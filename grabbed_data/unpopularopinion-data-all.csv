When in the presence of strangers we ought to act according to societal expectations, and our vulnerability should increase as we come close to home. If you start following dating advice as you meet someone, such as ""girls don't like clingy guys"", ""men don't want to hear about your problems"" or whatever, you're going to live a facade even with that one person you should be more intimate with. You're acting to please a average, who you won't really like and who won't really like you back. There's nothing wrong in seeking help in the context of relationships. But the main goal should be striving for healthy (instead of likable) behavior. If you're a clingy guy who likes weird stuff, somewhere out there is going to be a clingy girl who likes weird stuff too. If you start dating someone who don't like texting as often or who sees your tastes on a negative light, maybe that person just isn't for you. You should just look out for when your behavior isn't just unpopular, but also unhealthy (truly unhealthy, not ""r/datingadvice unhealthy""). When your clinginess goes too far, to the point of you freaking out and doing impulsive BS just cause your partner hasn't texted back for a few hours, maybe there is something else going on. Maybe there is something wrong in your life or your relationship dynamics with that person aren't sustainable. Then you have something to worry about. But, for the most part, you should not look out for tips and advice. ""What topics should I talk about?"", ""Should I text her now or tomorrow?"", ""Is it too early to say I love him?"". Just do whatever you want, or you will never have a fulfilling relationship. And fuck whether men or women prefer this or that."

3,vulnerability,unpopularopinion,(Most) mainstream video games arent art. They are more factory made products than art.,1,i9xdp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/i9xdp4/most_mainstream_video_games_arent_art_they_are/,2020-08-15 10:02:25,"Put your torches down and let me make my point. This comes from someone who likes and plays video games almost daily. Ill skip trying to define what art is since, due to its subjectivity, anything can be techically be *called* art. And also, I am talking about the big industry, where millions upon millions are spent. But Ill admit immediately, despite saying they are factory made products, video games do contain artful elements, stuff like character and world design, the music, the story, the art... but those things individually dont make a game. Weaving them together makes one. But the AAA game industry doesnt so much *weave* them as much as they simply **cram** them in one big package. Sure, you could argue that movies do the same, and thats a fair point. However, movies have never been so mass produced. Call of Duty, Battlefield, Assassins Creed, and other games I cant be bothered to search are released **YEARLY**. That doest sound like art being crafted but more like being churned out. Also, movies dont try to syphon as much money as it can from its audience. Movies **dont** sell 4 different limited editions that can cost to hundreds of bucks, sometimes not even including the game itself in the purchase, by capitalizing on FOMO (fear of missing out). Movies **dont** sell time savers so you can skip the boring parts (the grind). Movies **dont** sell surprise mechanics lootboxes that preys on vulnerable children and those with gambling problems. You can also see how committee designed a lot of those games are, how they are always chasing the money. When *modern warfare* was the trend because of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, every big company wanted a piece of the pie. The industry saw a huge influx of modern warfare shooters. Just not too long ago, it was Battleroyal. And companies jumped boat again. Call of Duty, Battlefield, even fucking Fallout jumped on the battleroyal bandwagon even though its not part of the franchises identity, they cram it in anyway because statistics says so. What kind of art constantly chases trends to the point of completely abandoning its identity? What kind of art preys on people with gambling vulnerability by using the same mechanism casinos? What kind of art is so heavily mass-produced that repeats the same motion year after year, changing itself only to chase trends?"

Im looking at the base of his cock. Im feeling his juices all over my face. Im tasting his cock with my tongue. Im feeling his shaft with my lips. Im feeling my throat being gagged.

Just by telling the truth, informing others of your dislikes and likings, crying, disagreeing, and expressing silly ideas to who we interact with, we can air out those negative emotions within. This will build positive habits that will ultimately lead to positive feelings and change in our lives.

It doesn't require very much training or education, and it pays them very well. If they want the job, then they need to accept that they will be in some amount of danger. Not as much as danger as, say, a construction worker or a truck driver, but accepting that job means they are accepting that they will be in SOME amount of danger. It's not even one of the top ten most dangerous jobs in the country, though. Now, it's just fine for people working in dangerous jobs to demand measures that make their jobs safer, but it crosses a line when they start putting OTHER people in danger to minimize their own vulnerability. If one out of a hundred people is going to pull a gun out of their pocket, that doesn't make it acceptable to put their knees on the neck of the other 99 people just to protect themselves from the one. A cop's job is to protect the public, not to potentially kill or injure members of the public just to keep themselves safe. The lives of the public are more important than the cop's life, because he chose to work a job that's specifically meant to put himself in danger to protect their lives. If he sees a man reach into his car, then no, he doesn't get to shoot him in the back because of the offchance the man comes out with a weapon. Those are the actions of a scared coward, a coward that puts his own wellbeing above the people he's supposed to be protecting. Better that he should put himself in a slight amount of potential danger than shoot someone who doesn't deserve it. (Note here that the Constitution provides the right to a trial and the right against cruel and unusual punishment, so no, someone who might have committed a crime like selling cigarettes or being drunk in a Wendy's parking lot do not ""deserve"" extrajudicial murder by police.) I would be 100% okay with more cops being killed or injured in the line of duty if it meant that innocent people (or even people who have committed nonviolent crimes) stop getting killed or injured by cowardly police officers. Our safety is more important than theirs."
11,vulnerability,unpopularopinion,Allowing our lives to be dictated by hysteria created by the media for the purpose of generating revenue is absurd.,1,ihtlqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ihtlqv/allowing_our_lives_to_be_dictated_by_hysteria/,2020-08-28 07:07:16,"Novel respiratory viruses infecting humans is not unprecedented. This interaction has been going on since before human beings were human beings. While a new respiratory virus that would indiscriminately kill off a double digit percentage of the population would certainly warrant the global measures that have been taken against covid-19, reports in early January from places like China and Italy had been sensationalized in the media claiming indiscriminate mortality rates as high as 10% which grossly mislead the public (some might even go so far as to say terrorized the public), allowing governments to enact policy decisions based on that public fear. The reality is that covid-19 is not the totally indiscriminate killer that was originally claimed by the media. It disproportionately leads to mortality based on a person's age, the more immunocompromised they are, and their underlying health conditions, or as a gross over-simplification how unhealthy they are. Now I am not saying that people who fall into those categories do not deserve health care or to be saved, but I am questioning - When did we throw healthcare budgets out the window, decide our economies were expendable, and that the lives of those unaffected by the virus and our rights and freedoms were not worth consideration? Hospitals, healthcare programs, and governments around the world have until covid-19 had budgets. As unappealing as it is to hear, those entities have had to make decisions since their inception as to what and who can be treated and what and who cannot, even when those who do not receive treatment or intervention pass away before they would have with treatment. Those decisions are often based on quality of life per dollar, years of quality of life per dollar spent, probability of surviving treatment etc, all evaluated by ethics committees of professionals from diverse backgrounds. It is just not possible to save every person from every ailment imaginable based on the total productivity of the human race and how much of that productivity it would take to save everyone. So based on that premise going back as far as we want in history, when did we decide to throw that system out of the window and change to a system where we would spend any amount of money, cripple economies, ruin people's lives, and infringe on their freedoms but ONLY for covid-19. The hypocrisy of this notion is mind boggling. Let's take a look at an example to get some perspective. So far there have been roughly 180,000 deaths reported from covid-19 in the United States. Regardless of the inaccuracies of reporting or criteria for being counted as a covid death let's just work with that figure. Between 2009 and 2017 the death rate in America rose from 2.4 to 2.8 million deaths per year. Now it has not quite been a full year yet with covid in the US but say the trend continues and that number hits 270,000 for the year. Even then, covid-19 deaths will have made up less than 10% of the total deaths in the United States while the expenditures and real cost to the economy will be astronomical compared to the amount of dollars put into treating or preventing other sources of mortality. How does that make sense? If we are willing to invest that much money and cripple the economy in such a way over covid-19, why not controlling the spread of influenza and common cold viruses in the past? Why not heart disease? cancer? stroke, kidney disease, suicide? Why is covid-19 so different when compared to other much larger causes of mortality? Also it must be mentioned, that in 2017 over 55,000 deaths were due to influenza and pneumonia alone. Many, if not nearly all of those who would have died from influenza or pneumonia deaths in 2020 are likely to instead have died from covid-19 or at least categorized as such. So the actual increase in total mortality annually from covid-19 will be significantly less than the big growing number that the media likes to scare the public with on a daily basis. Now let's put a little bit more context to the situation. This virus is new. It will likely never be as dangerous to our societies as it is in the first year or two as it makes its way through the population. After it claims an initial wave of deaths from unhealthy, old, or just unlucky people, the remaining population will likely go through rounds of catching covid-19, developing antibodies, fighting it off, perhaps losing those antibodies over time, and catching it again throughout their lives but with minimal symptoms. What is this prediction based on? All of the other respiratory viruses that make up the large group known as ""the common cold"". That's right. This just happens to be humanities first exposure to a new strain of what will soon be just another common cold virus. Skeptical? Awesome. You should be. But if you look into it there are actually 4 strains of corona virus that regularly circulate as part of the large group of common cold viruses that each would have had a start like covid-19 some time in humanity's past. So if we look at the mortality of covid-19 not just in the very short term but say over 5 or 10 years, the annual mortality rate is very likely to drop off significantly. Where in the next 10 years cancer may claim the lives of 6 million or more people (based on \~600,000 deaths in the US in 2017), covid-19 may only claim the lives of 500,000... and fewer and fewer per year each year thereafter. So if we are so concerned with mortality, why have we not thrown the same resources that have been invested to fight covid-19 into other causes of mortality that are actually far more deadly and have a much bigger ongoing impact to our societies? My assumption/observation/best educated guess: the media has a serious hold over what people think, how they interpret facts and events, and subsequently their actions and the actions of governments. Some time since the turn of the millennium, older forms of established, credible media outlets, that held themselves up to a standard of integrity have felt more and more pressure to compete for the attention of the public and as such have gone down a slippery slope of sacrificing their integrity for that attention. Between competing with the likes of the total fakeness of reality TV, and the completely not credible, no integrity, sensationalized media of social media platforms, traditional media has found themselves today adopting aspects of both. News personalities are no longer journalists, but actors playing a role. The story is no longer who, what, when, and where, but a narrative concocted to emotionally trigger the audience as much as possible in order to maximize engagement ultimately for profit. While social media platforms never really had credibility to begin with their influence is now too large to allow them to self-regulate and traditional media has leveraged the trust they once earned and deserved to now deceive and mislead the public in an attempt to stay relevant. So with all that said what should we have done or do about covid going forward? We should completely support the option to wear a mask. Either to protect oneself due to a suspected vulnerability to covid-19 or to deal with the anxiety and uncertainty surrounding covid-19. The option to wear a mask should be **encouraged**. In areas where contact with vulnerable populations is required (ex. nursing homes, retirement communities, hospitals, clinics, etc) masks should just be mandatory. The people there are at risk and proper precautions should be taken to reduce risk for them in those settings. But in all public spaces? Have we banned nuts in all public spaces so that people with nut allergies can be absolved of any responsibility for their own health and safety? No we haven't. Do we ban the ownership of cats and dogs so that people with allergies to them never end up with runny noses? No that would be silly. Have we mandated masks to prevent the spread of influenza even though it annually claims tens of thousands of lives in the US? no. We should continue to treat covid-19 patients with the same system that has been in place until now for evaluating if someone does or does not get treatment, and if there are not enough resources, we should triage. We should not ruin the lives of the public, lock them down in their homes, force businesses to close ruining the lives of business owners, causing untold financial hardship, marital hardship, drug abuse, suicide, etc. If anyone can direct me to a real legitimate accounting of the cost-benefit comparison of the measures that have been taken to stop covid-19 vs the hardship on the public from those measures I would really appreciate it, but I doubt it has actually be done at this time. &amp;#x200B; I guess the TLRD: To allow our lives to be dictated by false hysteria created by the media for the purpose of generating revenue is absurd."

Examples are misogyny, homophobia, bullying, aggression, [social dominance](URL a man not being emotionally open and a man feeling so much pressure to provide that it leads to negative outcomes for himself or society. As wikipedia states, *[other traditionally masculine traits such as devotion to work, pride in excelling at sports, and providing for one's family, are not considered to be ""toxic"".](URL So not all of masculinity is considered to be toxic. Toxic masculinity is a very broad concept. A man beating up another man for being gay is toxic masculinity. I think most people would agree that those few men in the West who still do this, should stop doing so. Toxic masculinity also covers things like men not being emotionally open, or men feeling so much pressure to provide that it leads to negative outcomes. And here's where it gets controversial. On one hand: yes, in an ideal world men don't feel a crushing pressure to become providers. Yes, in an ideal world men are emotionally open. I've been an emotionally closed and an emotionally open man in my life. Now that I'm emotionally open, I'm much happier, I no longer need a junkfood addiction to cope with repressed pain and my relationship is much more satisfying. Yeah my girlfriend dumped me after I opened up to her, but it's still worth it - I'm dating someone much nicer now, who I can be emotionally intimate with. Getting (mostly) over toxic masculinity has been great for me. On the other hand: the actual reality on the ground is that a lot of men are shamed or rejected or ghosted if they open up - not just by some men but by some women too. The actual reality on the ground is that a man who is a good provider will, all else being equal, have a much easier time dating than a man who isn't. No it's not the only factor in dating, yes some women don't care much, but all else being equal it certainly helps a lot. Where it gets ugly is that outside of academic circles, toxic masculinity is often framed as men's fault and something that's on men's plate to address. Of course, men contribute to toxic masculinity. However, women and society also contribute to toxic masculinity, which is acknowledged in academia but not in the broader culture. In the experience of myself and the men I've spoken to, emotionally opening up to a female friend is a coinflip: she may listen, or she may change the subject/tell you to man up/ghost you. Emotionally opening up to your girlfriend/wife is a coinflip: either she'll support you and love you more, or she'll grow cold and dump you soon afterwards. You won't know which it will be until you do open up - and so many men don't, despite wanting to. Women telling their boyfriends to open up and them dumping them is a much more wide-spread phenomenon that women think or want to acknowledge. Most men want or even need emotional intimacy too. Why do you think that men don't want to open up to their female partners? They don't fear being rejected by other men in that moment; they fear being rejected by their female partner. The men I've spoken to and myself have had more instances where we've been rejected/judged/shamed by a woman for opening up emotionally than we have instances where we've been rejected/judged/shamed by a man for opening up. Also, I've heard more stories of [mothers teaching their son to never show weakness/vulnerability](URL than I've heard stories of fathers teaching their son that.

21,vulnerability,unpopularopinion,The concept of men being either alpha males or beta males is the opposite-gender version of the Madonna-whore complex.,10,hnj0tn,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/hnj0tn/the_concept_of_men_being_either_alpha_males_or/,2020-07-09 01:25:11,"The Madonna/whore complex is when people either believe a woman to be a prude, chaste virgin, or else an immoral slut, with no room in-between for anything else. If a woman enjoys sex or displays any form of sexuality, she's a whore. If she doesn't like sex and dresses modestly, then she's a prude. It's easy why to see how this is a toxic mindset, as women are different things at different times and it's stupid to label people like that. (The ""I'm not like other girls"" phenomenon has its roots in this.) The whole concept of alpha males/beta males in humans is the exact same thing. A man is either a manly man, or not a man at all. A man should be dominant, confident, physically strong and stoic all of the time, and this makes him an alpha male. Alpha males always want sex and bend women to their will. If a man shows any emotional vulnerability, shyness, or femininity, he's a beta male and is a failure of a man. No room for inbetweens. Long story short, putting all-encompassing labels on people is bad."

Before I met my wife, I was so broken and alone, that I worked very hard to craft many layers and many masks that I'd rotate, jussst to manipulate situations and trick people into accepting me, on a very short-term, conditional basis. It was selfish, and vile. But that's all I knew. I didn't know how to be accountable for myself, so I blamed others for my misfortunes, and it ended up pushing everyone out of my life, eventually. I met my wife while I was on a date with a girl I met on Tinder. I took her to a local Korean restaurant, and my wife was our waitress. After the date, I went back and got her number. I proposed to her 9 months later and got married in January of 2018. While we were dating, almost immediately, she saw right through all my insecurities, my lies, my hurts, my chronic need to manipulate others to feel a false sense of security in my life. Instead of judging me, she tried very hard to understand why I was the way I was, and she told me she would partner with me to work towards a better life, together. She spent countless hours researching Borderline Personality Disorder, and she learned how isolating it could be. She used that knowledge to show me compassion, and she demonstrated patience and calmness when I would have an disproportional response to something I couldn't control. Over 2 years, she slowly designed for me a map to healing and discovery, and has accepted that this should be a lifelong journey, together. She has authored for us a new life that allows me to be my best for myself, for her, and now, [our son.](URL 1 year before I met my wife, I was living out of my car, couldn't hold a job for more than 9 months, and was so fucking lonely, unhealthy, and borderline suicidal.

She has literally saved my life, and I will spend every day of it trying to repay this unconditional, underserved gift of love that she's given me. We all have our stories of loneliness. If you're still in yours, hang in there. Your story isn't done yet. If you are lucky to have someone, love on them extra amount today. Because you both deserve each other :) For the loved ones of people with BPD, Please understand that you are SO strong for the course, patience, and understanding you demonstrate for your loved one with BPD. But, please understand that there is a difference between ""being supportive"" and being ""an enabler"". It's very hard, nearly impossible, to differentiate that fine line. In my opinion, ""stubbornness"" comes from pride, paired with the inability to allow oneself to become vulnerable to the other person. In essence, I think it's a natural defense mechanism, based on past trauma. It's your heart's way of protecting itself, but, it can also backfire and become a wall of resistance between you and another person trying to communicate with you, through these walls. My wife, almost supernaturally, saw through EVERYTHING I had from the get. She saw through my masks and facades and lies and my walls I built up. She even saw the hurtful manipulation tactics I had ready to fire at her, just in case I needed to *""hurt her before she hurt me""*. She saw all of that and chose to respond with compassion and gentleness. She completely disarmed me. So vulnerability was never really a choice for me. She's the only one that ever saw me as naked as God. That's how she penetrated my stubbornness and everything else and slowly changed my life. My advice would be to work on communication and showing yourself to become vulnerable to the people you love. It's easier said than done, and it won't happen overnight. But, it will be soooo worth it in the end :) Tl;dr: people with BPD make it almost impossible to love them. But with a lot of research, patience, empathy, and communication, you might see that they have so much love to offer. It's just not that obvious to see yet. BPD can't be fixed. But, it can be understood and managed with a strong dedication from both people in the relationship."

Most men in my life stress out about their body image and put their self worth in their body just as much as women do... And it seems like there's barely anything to teach boys what we're tying to teach women and a guy opening up about being insecure is almost never taken seriously. Not to mention the ignorance there's among women. Most women in my life understand that men's emotions are just as important as women's, however I've definitely seen women who don't and men just ""tough it out"" when women in their life invalidate their concerns/feelings. To end this on a positive note, if someone in your life is invalidating your feelings, they are toxic. Get them out of your life as soon as possible and know that your mental health is just as important as anyone else's. You're handsome and you deserve the same amount of appreciation that women get. [edit] it's been pointed out to me that I've failed to mention that most suicide attempts are from women, however male suicide attempts are more often than not -- successful. This does not take away from the fact that men's mental health is usually pushed to the side but I just wanted to correct myself and not spread any misinformation."

And the surprising part is that, this hurt comes from the same people who condemn toxic masculinity on the outside. Having depression? Be a man, deal with it. Having social anxiety? Please stay out of the dating pool. Having self-esteem and confidence issues? Sorry, we only want confident men. Why are men not allowed to have any mental health issues, and are supposed to have conquered every stumbling block in life?

It is this purported relationship which hooks so many vulnerable men, and the vulnerability of these men arises out of the intimate void left by extreme sexual liberty. This abusive transaction is akin to one nation raiding another nation for its goods and resources only to sell it back to them at an unfair price. Essentially, there is little freedom in the decision of the buyer in either case. The preferences of the buyer are acquired ones: onlyfans claims to offer a salve for a wound it did itself inflict. The sort of people buying onlyfans subscriptions are not the beneficiaries of love, emotional support, and intimacy in their daily lives, and *it's clear why*. Onlyfans isn't a porn substitute, it's a plug to fill the void left by the collapse of traditional relationships, and it is abusive: it identifies weakness and insecurity and it claims to offer redemption in exchange for a fee. But the relationships onlyfans suggests itself to be built upon are *false*. They are illusory. They are false advertising. The individuals who turn to onlyfans do so out of a necessary acquired preference. They need support, not the abuse and mistreatment which onlyfans truly offers them."

From an evolutionary perspective, the main value that men offered from a gender specific perspective was two things: 1. Gathering and processing resources 2. Fighting and hunting Not only do both of these things require no emotional vulnerability, its probably detrimental. So it makes sense that human beings evolved to react negatively in response to male emotional vulnerability."

I mean, is not like Riot will find our nudes folder and blackmail us with that....or that they will steal or bank accounts info for profit. That would be suicide for any big company. The thing I hear the most is that maybe Riot won't do that, but if someone finds a vulnerability in the anti cheat system, a more ill intentioned hacker could crack into our computers and do all kind of nasty stuffs....but how they could do that? I mean, for a hacker to have access to our computers they still need a program made by them to be placed into our computers...cracking into the anticheat software will only affect how the particular copy of the client will interact with Valoran's severs, so yeah, they could cheat....but they can't force other players to download a copy of their modified client so there is no way to access other people's computers, so again, there is no risk....right? I mean, if you download a hacked client so you can cheat in Valoran too of course the hacker can do whatever he wants with your PC, but if you do that, I guess you deserve it for trying to cheat in the first place...... Now there could be something Im not seeing maybe someone more savvy can give me another perspective...but right now I believe that Valoran's anti cheat system is pefectly safe for us"

It is less about changing yourself to meet the ideals of what you think someone else would like, instead try to be unapologetically yourself and you will attract people who genuinely value you for you. **2) Be proactive.** Comment on people's Facebook posts or reply to people's [Instagram](URL stories - both great way to reconnect with old friends in a direct way. **3) Use friendship apps.** There are many great apps out there which connect you with new people who are all on there for the same reason. They are open to making friends with you. I have used a lot and my personal favourite is [Serendip](URL \- it cuts through the superficiality and actually connects you with people who share your values. Others include [Bumble](URL but it is more used for dating. **4) Phone calls.** Calling your existing friends is a great way to strengthen your bond. When we can't meet in person due to lockdown, a voice or video call has much more depth than a text message. **5) Just ask.** This isn't dating, you don't need to worry about being rejected to find the 'one'. Ask people you have just met for a coffee or their number. ""I am new to the area and it would be great if you could show me around"". Put yourself at the receiving end of this - it's a very natural message. **6) Join local groups.** This is not advised during lockdown! Whilst we are under social isolation we can fall back on #3 for the meanwhile. Have fun guys! Please comment below if you have other suggestions :)"

Dont get me wrong, these works are absolutely legendary and I will forever rage when Oh My Dis Side gets on queue. On the other hand however, there is a reasonable argument that can be made that both Birds in the Trap and Astroworld are so much more complete as an album. Is Antidote more iconic than Goosebumps? Is there any song within his OG works that are artistically better than Wake Up? Are you truly a Travis Scott fan if you dont listen to anything else but Drugs Before You Try It? Another example is Kanye West. Even when Kanye single-handedly redefined music with MBDTF, Yeezus, TLOP, and etc., people will actually argue that he never topped The College Dropout. This man poured out his heart and soul into his works following his mothers death, was 2 years ahead of his time with Yeezus, released the incredible KSG, but people will still ride donuts on his d**k when he wore the pink polo. Now, let me get this absolutely straight. I am also not arguing the other side, I am merely just trying to give credit to these artists who continually reinvent themselves. There are many other artists I can talk about, especially Tyler, the Creator (this man literally exposed his vulnerability to the max with his newest albums with undoubtedly much better production than before, but people will vehemently argue Cherry Bomb was his best work... yeah dude), but I hope I got my point across with the examples Ive made so far.

They take into consideration the age of the young person, the age difference in the relationship, how the relationship formed (online, in secret) and whether or not the older person could have influenced the younger person. This law is designed to protect the **vulnerability** of young persons and in these situations, the law will not recognize that young person's consent to sexual activities with the older person.

I have heard, at least from my friends in the United States that the parents can choose to press charges against the older person. I'm not sure which States this law applies too. I just want to wrap this up by saying that just because dating minors was normal at a certain period of time, or in certain places, that doesn't mean that it is morally okay. Things are changing and with new empirical evidence that is coming out, we are adjusting laws to protect minors in the grey area of the age of consent. 16/17 year olds deserve to be teenagers, they are *not* adults, no matter what way you spin it or how ""mature"" they can be for their age. They have not had enough time to be in relationships to recognize when someone is exploiting them or coercing them into doing things. Adolescents don't know how to set boundaries yet, and older people who go after minors are very well aware of this. Young people can be easily influenced by an older person who seems to have it all, a house, a car, a job. It seems cool, they might feel proud that someone so old is taking an interest and them and seeing them as an ""equal"". Especially if this young person comes from a bad home life, is struggling in school or lacking social support. Since there is lots of information now about the developmental psychology of teenagers and young people, it should be our job to protect them against predators who hide behind the age of consent law."

Singing in front of others takes a lot of courage and it makes me happy when people sing around me because that means they trust me enough to show that vulnerability. And usually singing means someone else is in a good mood and that just creates positivity all around, at least from my experience. Plus, I think you can get a lot of insight into people just by knowing what kind of songs they listen to and stuff."

I understand that intimacy requires one to let down their guard, because it always has. I know it takes guts to admit when youre wrong and when youre afraid and that the first step to becoming a better person is to acknowledge your own deficiencies, but in the broader societal context dont we risk becoming weak if all we do is publicly express our shortcomings and seek sympathy for sucking at something? What about faking it until you make it? Remaining calm and carrying on? A stiff upper lip? At some point, between rewarding public displays of vulnerability and victimhoodwithout the requisite and subsequent self improvementwe have to admit that we are in a race to the emotional sub-basement. We are setting ourselves up to fail and feel good about it in a ruthless world with severe consequences."

I like that theyre not afraid to be themselves or show their true thoughts/emotions on something. I dont want some robot-type guy who doesnt feel anything or doesnt get sad at anything, and I certainly do not have the old school mentality that men should man up or not show their feelings. To me being emotional also shows confidence, which I like to see in my partner. It proves theyre comfortable enough with themselves to show some vulnerability, which you should especially be able to do with a romantic partner. I grew up with a male family members who dont emotionally react to anything, and it makes me angry because first, I can never tell what theyre thinking, and second, they think theyre so cool and manly and better than everyone because they dont show emotions. In reality they just seems cold, harsh, and insecure. In summary, if youre a guy, dont be afraid to show your emotions. Its more manly than you may have thought. Dont listen to the brainwashed and clearly wrong people who think youre lesser of a man for expressing your feelings."

They might be wrong but they also have some extremely good reasons why they buy it. For one, Apple values privacy. Im typing this on Android (contradicts my argument obviously) but have you ever thought about the tens of pages you saw after saying you signed in with Google about it wanting to access your contacts, your phone number, your personal information, all that crap? If you have not thought about it reconsider. Google and Facebook are tracking your every move and selling it to advertisers. ""Oh its selling your personal information to the advertisers how does that even affect you?"" Everything. When Google sells your information, it's going public. Every bit of your private information down to your most sensitive information is given to the advertiser, and it can do whatever it wants. Usually it's advertising, but be real here. They can do some insanely horrible things. Like reveal your house location to the world. Need I say more? stores your private info in a cloud that not even Apple themselves can access, meaning that your information is safe. That picture of your privates that you took on your Android could be sent to the world but advertisers and people who can get the info, but Apple keeps it safe so its not shared. Another great thing about Apple is their dedication to quality products. You might think Apple products are insanely expensive and they are. But they're also extremely high quality. Android phones are often cheaper and sometimes better quality than iPhone and stuff like that. But at the same time, Apple is a trusted company with a firm reputation, and even if the quality of the product is insanely awesome, it's kind of a hard sell if it's a company that seems shady. Not to mention Apples products are always balanced. Unlike many third party products which might excel in many ways but fall short on a big element. Finally is Apples tight control. People argue that it limits customization and diversity of products they can use. The issue is these problems are not issues for a lot of people, and it does have some downsides, such as vulnerability. Not to mention, this tight control also means that Apple has a high expectation treshold, meaning consumers can expect high quality products with tons of dedications. For instance take the iPhone 4S, and the Galaxy S2, released in 2011. The Galaxy got released with 2.3 Gingerbread but got supported until 4.2, which was literally the next year. In comparison, the 4S got released with iOS 5, but was supported until iOS 9, in 2015. The tight control of Apple means it can sustain older products for much longer, whereas Android is fragmented, meaning that Google doesn't have as much control of the phones as do the third party companies. To those of you who are doubting Apple, don't knock it until you try it."
63,vulnerability,unpopularopinion,We Need to Talk About Kevin: The Triumph of Seduction in the Movie Moonlight,1,gcudzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/gcudzs/we_need_to_talk_about_kevin_the_triumph_of/,2020-05-04 03:23:30,"I'm not sure where this essay belongs, but I've been obsessing over it for a very long time, and I'd like to share it... &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; We Need to Talk About Kevin: The Triumph of Seduction in the Movie *Moonlight* &amp;#x200B; The first time I saw Moonlight I was swept up by its beauty. I wasn't sure what to make of the movie intellectually, but I was moved by it. Then I watched it again, and I became much more critical of Kevin's character. I couldn't forgive him for betraying and hitting Chiron, and I started to see the film not as a romantic triumph but as a staggering work of tragedy. Consider the two primary influences on Chiron in this movie. One of these influences is Juan. He's an imperfect man occupying an imperfect existence. He preaches swimming and self-empowerment. The other influence is Kevin. He's an enigmatic creature of the night, and he preaches floating. One of these influences strengthens Chiron. The other one weakens him. What's mystifying (and a little disturbing) is that Kevin has been widely accepted as a positive influence and a worthy romantic interest, but Kevin is, at best, a coward, and, at worst, a sort of nihilistic succubus. And I think it's relevant that this went unnoticed by the moviegoing public. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Chiron's story begins and ends in a dark room. I'll get to the end later, but I want to start at the beginning when little Chiron is chased into an abandoned apartment by some boys with sticks. Juan is a pillar of strength and masculinity, and he first demonstrates this by literally ripping Chirons wall down and stepping into his dark, private place. Juan then opens the door for Chiron and offers to lead him out into daylight. He tells the boy it cant be worse out there than it is in here, alone in the dark. Juan immediately becomes a father-figure and a role-model for Chiron, but he also challenges Chiron and encourages him to define himself by himself. We first meet Kevin after a lovely game in which a cluster of fun-loving boys take turns grabbing a ball and getting pummeled by one another. Its innocent, harmless fun, and its portrayed as such with sunshine, a sweeping camera, smiling faces and a lovely, orchestral score. This is a group of boys who trust each other enough to dance on the edge between play and violence. Thats the fun of the game. Its absurdity bordering on chaos, and anyone who dares pick up the ball faces both the wrath and the mercy of the unbeatable masses. You have to trust the group not to hurt you. And even when the boys roll the ball pointedly towards young Chiron, the boys do so lovingly and supportively with giddy anticipation. Theyre not bullying him but merely pressuring him. They're inviting him into the game and into the group. They're inviting him to share this beautiful day with them. They're attempting to baptize Chiron with play. Its interesting that Kevin is the one who steals the ball and runs with it before the group has a chance to convince Chiron to play with them. I suppose we could interpret this as Kevin saving Chiron from the tyranny of peer pressure, but we could also interpret it as Kevin sabotaging the groups concerted effort to get Chiron to drop his guard and allow himself to have a little fun. Now it's possible that Chiron just isnt an athlete, or he simply doesnt want to be tackled, but then why is he out there on the field? Doesnt he want to play with the other boys? Doesnt he want to be included? When Chiron leaves the game, he's quickly joined by Kevin. Kevin has a knack for finding Chiron when he is alone and lacking a sense of connection, and here, in their very first private meeting, Kevin supports Chiron and takes his side. Whats interesting though is that the game never felt all that threatening. There was social tension and a divide between Chiron and his peers, but it was a harmless situation. Kevin, however, chooses to treat Chiron like a victim. Its also interesting that Kevin shoves Chiron to get his point across. He tells him he's acting soft, and that he needs to get stronger. Chirons response is interesting. He defiantly states, ""But I ain't soft."" And as far as we can tell, he's right. The kid takes care of himself. Hes observant. Hes got an inner strength about him. Yes, hes ducked a few physical challenges thus far in the story, but hes very young. Hes learning. Hes not weak. Hes just not ready to unleash himself into the world at large. And so Kevin offers a private bout, and the boys tussle in the grass. This is a bonding moment for Chiron. Hes seemingly found a sparring mate who will support his growth in private. Kevins friendship is special to Chiron. Kevins attention and sympathy are special. Its a new form of protection from the tyranny of the world. Or so it seems, because Kevins motives are less than clear, and they are increasingly less clear in subsequent sequences. What is clear is the contrast between violence and sexuality that this little roll in the grass is setting up. Is Kevin teaching Chiron how to fight and to play and how to exist in the world (out in public and in daylight) or is he pulling him away from others? Is Kevin seducing Chiron? Is he dragging him into the dark? The next time we bump into Kevin its accidental. This is interesting, because its always Kevin who seems to find Chiron. But in this instance, Chiron has caught Kevin sneaking around with some boys behind closed doors. And rather than push Chiron back out into public (and into daylight), Kevin sucks him in and locks the door. And how you view what comes next is likely going to define how you view the rest of the movie, because these boys are standing around and showing each other their penises. Ill note that there is nothing particularly engaging about how this sequence is portrayed. The boys are not laughing. The mood is stale and uncomfortable. It's a drastic contrast to the football field sequence--and a drastic contrast to the dance class Chiron was enjoying before this encounter. There is no music, so youre basically left to decide for yourself whether or not this is a good or a bad situation. So what do you see? Is this just boys being boys? And what about those boys with the sticks? Were they just being boys? Who's bullying who? I suppose this is all relative. But imagine for a moment that Chiron is a little girl being trapped in this room with these sneaky older boys. How obviously alarming would that be? Wed be calling for little Chiron to run and hide from these perverts the same way he runs and hides from the bullies at the beginning of the film. Wed want these perverts exposed and punished. Watch what happens in this movie. When Chiron becomes a teenager he finds that one of his peers wants to fight him. Thats the bully we recognize. The bully we fail to see again and again is the one who wants to fuck him--the one who wants to privatize and subdue him. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Terrel is the dreadlocked bully in the second act. He has it out for teenage Chiron for seemingly no apparent reason other than the fact that Chiron is an easy source of power for Terrel. Weve seen this sort of bully many, many times in many different movies, and he plays by the unwritten rules of bullying. He rides Chiron hard. He calls him names. He bumps him. He threatens to hit him. But the idea here is that Terrel can do whatever he wants to Chiron as long as Terrel himself doesnt start the fight. Hes baiting Chiron to throw the first punch, and Chiron doesn't take the bait. But Terrell isn't interested in proving his physical advantage. He's simply interested in exploiting it and seeing what he can get away with because of it. Ill come back to Terrel in a bit, because this is a good time to take a closer look at teenage Kevin. Firstly, theres the scene where Kevin brags incessantly about his sexual exploits. And then theres Chirons strange dream where Kevin sexually pummels a young woman in the moonlight and then turns to Chiron sinisterly and invitingly (much like Tyler Durden with his yellow kitchen gloves). This is the first of two dark, sexual dreams about Kevin. And then theres the hand job. And what a hand job scene it is. The moonlit lighting. The intimate close ups. The waves crashing on the beach. The tension and the vulnerability. The crushing, existential gravity. But what's going on here? Is this love? Is this connection? Is this sustainable? Or is this something more temporary? Is it fleeting? Interestingly, there's a close up of Chirons hand grasping the sand. It's as if hes grabbing something he cant hold onto. Its notable that Kevin just sort of appears in this sequence. He emerges from the shadows and steps out into the moonlight at the exact moment Chiron is at his most vulnerable and in desperate need of connection. This happens a lot with Kevin. He's sort of conjured up every now and then, but he doesn't seem to exist in Chiron's life full-time, and we never get the sense that there's much of a history between them. In fact, Kevin often feels more like a presence than a person. So here Kevin comes when Chiron needs a friend, but Kevin doesn't offer true connection. He merely offers temporary transcendence and an escape from the void. This is the sort of faulty exchange Chirons drug-addicted mother would make. So it's relevant that Kevin initiates this seduction with a joint. This is how Kevin gets Chiron to drop his guard and share experience with him. But it's not just the joint that comforts Chiron. Kevin's cozy ideas also play a part in this seduction. He talks poetically about the sea breeze and about the temporary relief it brings. But that's all Kevin ever is in Chiron's life. He's something temporary that carries no weight. We are introduced to the idea of weightlessness earlier in the film when Juan teaches little Chiron to swim. At first, Juan holds the boy in his arms and shows him how to float, but then Juan pushes Chiron away and challenges him to swim on his own. Thats the triumph of the scene. Not the floating. Not the suspension. But the swimming. The self-governed action. It's an absolutely magnificent moment in the film, and it's worth remembering going forward. But back to that hand job Kevin gives Chiron. Theres a similar scene in the opening episode of the HBO series *The Night Of.* The main character is swept up by a beautiful creature of the night, and he takes drugs with her and then enjoys a wondrously romantic moment on a glimmering shore. But that scene is purposefully manipulative. It butters us up for the horror to come (the girl is ambiguously murdered), and so theres a foreboding element intensified by their drug use. Theres a sense that something isnt right. Something feels too good to be true. And composer Nicholas Britell's haunting score at the end of the meeting with Kevin seems to suggest something darker as well. Teenage Chiron seems unable to distinguish the difference between sexual stimulation and interpersonal connection, and so he sort of falls for Kevin in this sequence, because Kevin makes him feel good, and he makes him feel cared for. And this is, ultimately, Chirons fatal flaw--which is why Kevin, as a sort of succubus, has so much power over Chiron. Far more power, even, than Terrel the bully, because Chiron trusts Kevin. But Kevin is a toxic influence on Chiron. I realize Kevin represents the unknown and the unexplored, and so, sure, he cant be presented as something straightforwardly safe, but what exactly about the guy is trustworthy? Is there anything not suspect about him? He is constantly tempting Chiron with cliche temptations such as drugs, lustful sex, and alcohol. Maybe these things have become so familiar that we struggle to identify them as symbolically bad behaviors, but the reason lustful sex, drugs, and alcohol are such tired clichs of bad behavior is because they so accurately portray empty behavior. These things offer convenient and temporary senses of relief and connection while suspending growth and the call to greater action. This, to me, is the most annoying thing about Kevin. He doesnt offer anything truly novel or truly creative. He doesnt offer growth or stability or community. He doesnt offer any sort of push towards passion or purpose or responsibility (the way Juan and Teresa do). He just offers the same old tired temptations. Of course, the worst and most telling moment in the film is when Kevin betrays and hits Chiron. This is when Kevin fully exposes himself as a fraud. Kevin cannot stand up for himself or for Chiron, because Kevin is a coward who lives by night and not in the daylight. And so here in the daylight and in public Kevin is weak and easily coopted to do to Chiron the very thing he pretended to offer him shelter from. Violence. Bullying. The physical dangers of the outside world. Maybe we could justify Kevins action as simply carrying out a beating that Chiron is going to get either way. We can dismiss all this as if Kevin is simply sparing himself, and as if Chiron is simply agreeing to spare Kevinbut thats nonsense. First of all, Terrell isn't holding a gun to anyone's head. Obviously the threat of getting hit and kicked is intimidating, but is it so intimidating that it's worth betraying a loved one? Consider if Juan or Teresa were put in this situation. No way they hit Chiron, because those characters have backbone. Kevin is a coward, and his cowardice only adds to the swirling chaos in Chiron's life. Chiron then makes a critical error himself in the aftermath of this violence. He fails to govern himself. He fails to even hear the voice of reason from the lady across the desk whos voice literally fades out as she implores Chiron to press charges and to save himself from exile. Instead, Chiron lets his emotions dictate his actions, and he attacks Terrel not to his face but from behind. Cowardice all around. Chaos rules the day. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Interestingly, Juan, the most powerful presence in Chirons life, disappears in the second and third act. We only get to see the loving side of Juan, and we never get to see the more judicious/dominant side of Juan who might lovingly challenge Chiron as he progresses towards manhood. But then were more or less expected to believe that Juans message was heard loud and clear, because Chiron grows up to be a man in Juans image. Maybe Juan would be disappointed that Chiron followed him into the drug trade, but at least Chiron appears well on his way to reflecting the only positive male role model hes ever met, and maybe hes even on his way to transcending Juans example. Its hard not to fall in love with this grown up version of Chiron. He's a handsome, physical specimen who commands attention and respect almost inherently. He has taste in cars and clothes and music. Hes superior, and hes mostly kind. He is the image of Juan (hell, hes Stringer Bell). And like Juan, this version of Chiron is living his life, very literally, in the sun. This is his kingdom. This is what he knows. This is where he rules. Yes, Chiron is living a dangerous and potentially destructive life that he's not entirely comfortable with, and it's possible he's headed towards a similar demise as his role model if he continues on this path, but at least he's demonstrating a comfort with responsibility, and at least he's capable of raising and fearlessly protecting his young employee. And, like Juan, he presses his younger employee. He intimidates the kid with his presence and power, and, like Juan, he also checks himself when he pushes too hard. This indicates that Chiron is capable of governing himself as he continues to grow. Adult Chiron is not occupying some dark, sinister existence. It is an imperfect existence populated by people Chiron cares about. These are people who make him laugh and people who make him cry. Chiron is even coming to terms with his mother who is now in rehab and no longer acting like a vampire (it's notable that this scene takes place outside during the day). Both Chiron and his mother are learning to put that nightmare behind them, and theyve both got time to do that. And his mother is now strong enough to assist Chiron in his furthered development as a man. She even challenges the life he's leading, and he reacts aggressively (not quite ready to be challenged by her), but she reminds him that she loves him, and Chiron believes her. Its the start of a renewed trust between them. There's a genuine connection there. But we never get to see where this relationship might be headed, and how it might shape Chiron going forward, because Chiron got a phone call from fucking Kevin the night before. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; It's as if Kevin is some evil spirit conjured up by Chiron's sleepless anxiety. Kevin even appears as a darkened silhouette on the other end of the line. And Chiron is immediately weakened by Kevin's presence. Hes suddenly nothing like the strong and responsible man we saw minutes before. Now Chiron is doe-eyed and pathetic. And some might confuse this as romantic, but its really just a guy submitting to the clutches of an old temptation that broke his heart and nearly ruined his life, and rather than resist the call and resist Kevin, Chiron attempts to go back in time. Back to adolescence. He wants to go back to that glorious, weightless hand job, because what Chirons really trying to return to is his innocence. He wants to return to the weightless drift of a time when he didnt have to be responsible. He wants to return to a time in his life when he felt cared for. The final act of *Moonlight* is absolutely gooey with warmth and charm, but isnt Kevin being overtly portrayed as a siren and a succubus? Think about it. Kevin called in the middle of the night as his shadowy silhouette beckoned on the other end of the line. Then theres Chirons dark, lustful dream of Kevin blowing smoke into the air. And the slimy stain of semen on Chirons underwear after he wakes from the wet dream. Kevin even offers to play Chiron a song when he gets into town, and he does play that song when the charm is being laid on so thick theres hardly room to breathe. It's also worth noting that sirens are known to live on the shore so that they might coax naive mariners into crashing their ships on the rocks. Kevin first seduced Chiron on a beach, and, at the end of the film, he takes Chiron back to his oceanside apartment. So adult Chiron drives down to Florida and steps into Kevin's diner as a total weakling, and Kevin sinks his hooks into him and treats him like a cancer patient. He cooks for Chiron with grace and compassion. He cares for Chiron as if he were some deeply wounded warrior. And Chiron is made into a boy again--as if hes revisiting the warmth of Juan and Teresas dinner table. This is where Kevin implores Chiron to drink the wine, and Chiron hesitates, because he doesn't drink, but he also doesnt want to break the spell. He wants to live inside the dream world, so he drinks the wine quickly and heavily and only then does he loosen up and laugh. This is an echo of that fateful meeting on the beach when Chiron had to share a joint with Kevin in order to feel more comfortable. Then they drive to Kevins apartment, and Chiron is drunk and his head aches as he attempts to cram himself into this unfamiliar life. And, yes, Kevin appears warm. He appears comforting. He even appears to have wised up in the last decade. And maybe the point here is to back off of Kevin and the life he has found for himself. He's had his own journey, and he has acquired his own responsibilities. He's made a home for himself on the shore where he can listen to the soothing sounds of the sea (a passion of his since he was a boy). And maybe that's just fine for Kevin. Maybe this is where he belongs--near to but at a distance from the ocean. But Chiron is a swimmer. He belongs out in the water. There's even a moment just before Chiron enters Kevin's apartment where Chiron stops and gazes out at the waves crashing on the beach. Is this romantic? Has Chiron finally found his Eden? Or is it more foreboding? Is Chiron turning away from Juan's teachings? Its not that Kevin is evil. Its that his pull on Chiron is toxic. The relationship itself is corrupted--or at least dated. Kevin might feel strengthened by Chiron, but Chiron is clearly weakened by Kevin, and Kevin is not letting him go or pushing him away. Chiron is suffering a crisis of identity. Hes pretending this dream is real and that Kevin and Kevin's life are more than just a temporary diversion. Chiron is also pretending that he can still be innocent. Hes pretending he doesnt have an example to live up to and that he doesn't have a rehabbing mother and a young apprentice to care for. Hes trying to throw in the towel and admit he's incapable of self-governance. Hes trying to float rather than swim. Adult Chiron is absolutely bewildered in the presence of Kevin. His sense of purpose is being compromised, and just like when he was a teenager confusing sex with connection, now, as a diverted adult, hes throwing meaning into the mix as well. He's putting everything into this reunion, and if were floating along with Chiron in this dream, then were being seduced right along with him. The point isnt whether or not Kevin is truly sorry about the past. Its not whether or not Kevin wants to redeem himself and take proper care of Chiron. Its that Kevin is incapable of helping Chiron in any meaningful way outside of teaching him another brutal lesson about the nature of gravity. But so much is swept under the rug. What about the last time Chiron trusted Kevin? What about Chirons dormant and uncontrollable aggression? What kind of chaos is this behavior paving the way for? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; In the final sequence of the film Kevin invites Chiron into his apartment, and Chiron is completely stripped of all his armor. Hes forcing himself towards the empty care of Kevin, and Kevin continues to pick Chiron apart. Whats with the gold teeth? Whats with the car? Whats with all this strength? He's basically telling Chiron to stop modeling himself after Juan. And he's not wrong. Chiron can't be *exactly* like Juan--and Juan would have agreed. Juan instructed Chiron to define himself by himself, and he was also openly ashamed about dealing drugs for a living. But this doesn't mean Juan's example is entirely faulty. It doesn't mean Juan wasn't a compassionate and reliable man. It doesn't mean masculine strength and ambition and dominance are inherently negative characteristics. It just means Juan wasn't perfect, and, hopefully, Chiron can do better. But Kevin basically exists as an antithesis to Juan's example, and, rather than encouraging Chiron to be something, Kevin is primarily interested in telling Chiron what he shouldn't be. Kevin liberally offers critique and disappointment, but he doesn't have solutions. Kevin also constantly bullies Chirons choices throughout the story: wrestle with me and not the other boys, look at my penis, show me yours, smoke the joint, drink the wine, drink more wine, let me touch you, let me hit you, let me call you Black"" (against Chiron's will). And here in the final act Kevin tells Chiron youre not what I expected. And the berating continues. He asks, Who is you, Chiron? And Chirons unapologetic answer is Im me. This hearkens back to the first time little Kevin challenges little Chiron as ""soft."" And little Chiron responds but I ain't soft. Yet Kevin demands something else of Chiron throughout the film, and he continues to demand something as an adult. Kevin seemingly wants Chiron to let go of something, and were okay with Kevin challenging Chiron in this way, but why? What exactly do we like about Kevin? What do we trust about him? He's already betrayed our hero once, and he hardly seems to respect Chiron. But, much more importantly, what do we like about Chiron when he's around Kevin? He's always so stiff and submissive. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Before I conclude, I want to address the earliest threat to little Chirons safety--not the boys with the sticks but Chirons vampire mother. Chirons mother is, at first, a woman lost in the darkness of addiction and isolation and irresponsibility. She is a woman deprived of meaning, and a woman who is literally unable to exist in daylight. Theres even a frantic scene where she nearly has a breakdown trying to snatch her son from the sunlight, and her disjointed speech in that moment is mirrored later in the film when adult Chiron first gazes into adult Kevins eyes at the diner. In both sequences it's as if somethings wrong or as if theres a disconnect or a distrust--as if a darker influence is present. Early on, were shown a frightful image of the vampire mother screaming at little Chiron. She stands at the end of the hallway, glowing in neon pink light (a notable contrast to the blue used to highlight Chiron throughout the film). Chirons mother is a literal monster in the hallway looming large and in slow motion. We cant hear her words the first time we see her, but we do the second time. Don't look at me! she screams. But the boy doesn't retreat. He keeps watching, and he becomes a sort of mirror for his mother to see her reflection in. Then, rendered powerless, the monster recedes back into her layer. It's interesting that this is also how teenage Chiron chooses to respond to Kevin's betrayal. He just stares at Kevin and lets him punch him over and over, and this is the only time in the film that Kevin is emotionally shaken. It's also the only time Kevin is confronted. But Chiron fails to keep his eyes open at the end of the film. He never asks, Who is *you*, Kevin? because Chiron is succumbing to the siren's call, and he so desperately wants to believe in magic, and the audience is right there with him--craving reprieve and romance and failing to see the seduction taking place. Kevin appears not as the enigmatic, empty coward he has proven to be but as something strong and confident and trustworthy and wise. And Chiron wants to feel cared for so badly that he submits to Kevin's authority and confesses his deepest vulnerability--that hes never been touched by anyone else. He's throwing open his borders and proclaiming his disconnection and his loneliness, and he's basically begging for pity and for help. Kevin contemplates for a moment. Perhaps hell do the honorable thing and push Chiron back out to sea where he belongs. But, instead, Kevin smiles. He finally got Chiron to admit that there is something wrong with Chiron. And Kevin doesnt even answer with words but with the sound of the sea breeze--the same fleeting, weightless sound they bonded over as teenagers. It's the sound of being high and living without gravity. Hakuna Matata. It's the sound of nihilism washing over Chiron once and for all. In the next image we see Chiron (a mountainous image of masculine strength) tucked like a child against Kevin in the darkness. There's a similar shot earlier in the film when little Chirons mother is forcing her love onto her son. But at least, as a boy, Chiron had the presence of mind to get up and remove himself from the corrupted caregiver. Here, though, under Kevins spell, Chiron is vanquished and lost in the dark--still seeking the warmth he never got from his mother as a boy (composer Nicholas Britell's score here is notable. It's the same eerie music that plays after Kevin seduced Chiron on the beach.). And so, tragically, Chiron is right back where he started (trapped inside a dark room), and we never get to see him apply himself and excel. We never get to see him swim. The popular response to Moonlight has me wondering about the stories people tell themselves when they watch this film. Do they see a capable and unique individual striving to carve out a proper place in the world? Or do they see a poor black boy in need of sanctuary? Do they want to see Chiron come of age? Or do they just want to see him weep? In the final shot of the film little Chiron is standing on the shore and gazing out at the water. Then the boy turns to us. But why? Is he making sure weve got his back as he moves out into the ocean? Or is he staring down a monster?"

We invariably and naturally equate genuine relationships with life-long relationships. And therefore it seems almost impossible for us to interpret the ending of a union after only a limited period  a few weeks, or five or ten years, or anything short of our or the partners death-date  as something other than a problem, a failure and an emotional catastrophe that is someones fault, probably our own. There are people desperate that they have failed because their relationships have lasted only thirty-two years. We appear fundamentally unable to trust that a relationship could be at once sincere, meaningful and important  and yet at the same time fairly and guiltlessly limited in its duration. There are, of course, a few very good reasons for our collective valorisation of the life-long love story. A great many of the pleasures and virtues of relationships do only reveal themselves over time, once trust has been established and loyalty fully demonstrated. When two people know it is forever, they will work harder than at anything else in their lives, there is no option to avoid some necessary but unpleasant issues, they will do their utmost to understand the mysteries of the others psyche, they will show reserves of tenderness and vulnerability they wouldnt ever otherwise have accessed. They will learn to apologise and reach a modesty about their own shortcomings. They will grow up. And in the meantime, day-to-day, they will sample the modest but genuine pleasures of cosy Sunday evenings together and shared walks in country parks. Not least, children always benefit."

No offense to women, but sometimes they just don't know the amount of emotional labor they generate. To put it bluntly, male emotional expression (especially in relationships), is largely not for the benefit of the man but for the woman. I know this sounds bad at first but bear with me here because I think it's an important point that people don't consider. As men we are told by society constantly that we have to act a certain way and meet all these standards to be lovable people. In relationships, all those expectations are turned up to 11. We have to be caring, but not smothering. Get angry at the right times and for the right reasons - anything else is toxic. Be someone's rock, but show that you're a person too. If you don't open up enough, you're emotionally stunted. Open up too much, and you're a basketcase. Show just the right level of affection - too much means you're insecure and too little means you're not invested. Expressing *unwanted* emotions to women gets you shamed. That's likely a lot of it. We're not only told but pressured by everyone to not let our anxiety until things have gone so wrong we can't take it anymore. For a lot of women it seems like a big shock when their husband or partner who they've been with for a while breaks down and has the same insecurities they do. They aren't assertive, they don't have all the answers or a plan, they aren't a rock, they're just as clueless as the rest of us. That confident, assertive, happy-go-lucky person you once fell in love with is gone. Many people say they want vulnerability with men but sometimes it happens so violently or so unexpectedly that it comes as a shock and *the woman ends up feeling unsupported*. That's more than enough to cause someone to back out of a relationship. It's only compounded when you take into account how males have been socialized for the provider role, so anything that threatens that ability to provide is often met with that feeling of lack of support. Another reason I think is important is that men and women tend to argue differently. This is anecdotal but in my life I've *never* seen a man try to emotionally hurt someone the way I've seen women. Whenever my ex gets angry, she's absolutely brutal. There's no limit, no sensible place to stop to keep the friendship. She'll go right on past ""fuck you"" to ""I hate you"" to ""I wish I'd never met you"". A lot of people when they get to that point let off really terrible stuff like saying someone never pleased them in bed, they can't believe their partner is such a loser to still live with their parents, or their partner is the worst-looking person they've ever met and couldn't possibly get anything better than them. I feel like a lot of the time women go for the jugular in an argument and try to cause as much emotional pain as possible, while men often substitute with anger and violence. Words hurt though, and once stuff like that has been said there's only so much you can do to backtrack it. Most men have been through this situation or have seen someone who has. And frankly, there's a lot of women out there that openly express their proclivities towards tall, rich, or handsome men. I was in a bar recently and there was a group of women giggling as guys came out of the bathroom. They were rating them (in very poor whispers) and you could just sense the air of entitlement they felt. It didn't matter if you were a person with feelings to them - you were their entertainment. It only takes a handful of these experiences to make someone feel like women are only after them for superficial reasons, and not because someone wants to love them in return."
72,vulnerability,unpopularopinion,"""Men aren't allowed to be vulnerable/emotional"" is a weak argument",1,fsw22j,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsw22j/men_arent_allowed_to_be_vulnerableemotional_is_a/,2020-04-01 19:50:39,"I'm not saying that the statement is completely false or that it doesn't have bearing and influence on our lives. Every Guy at some point has made the same mistake - he opened up to a Girl he liked or was dating about his vulnerability/emotions/subjective weakness, and found that she wasn't that supportive or that she lost her attraction and interest in him. I realize that this experience can be painful and that it's largely influential over the ""red pill"" dichotomy and that it's part of the fuel that drives misogynistic culture. However, I perceive that our reaction to that can often be very self-involved and ignorant. The reason I call it a weak argument is that it still basically omits and obfuscates a certain reality - Women are naturally a more vulnerable and (on average) a more emotional gender. Now by saying that I could be called either a white knight or a sexist, but I think that in the end, it's true, even if only on a biological level. Women I've known are generally more fearful in many situations. They're more attuned to feelings, more likely to attend a funeral of someone they only know vaguely, they are more often depressed and they take insults more severely than Men. It's like that one quote ""Men are afraid Women will laugh at them. Women are afraid Men will kill them"". Now I realize that the Male suicide rate is higher, and I think that Men's voices deserve to be heard and that it's a huge concern. I do have a (possibly hair-brained) hypothesis... In my opinion, it takes a certain level of lack of emotion and some degree of testosterone to put a bullet under your chin and blow your brains out. If you look at the reports, Women rate higher on depression rates and suicide attempts, but fail to go through with it more often - that doesn't objectively mean they have easier lives. It's been shown that testosterone makes people less emotional, and to me, killing yourself may be a masculine gesture. I could be completely wrong on this, and if I am, then I am sorry... I am not in any way diminishing the tragic and horrible nature of suicide and I am sorry to any Man who is suicidal or affected by it. To me. Women and Men are very similar on some fundamental levels - we have this innate tendency towards tit for tat vibes when it comes to gender shit. Guys who are bitter that their feminine/emotional side is not very valid or of high importance socially, are probably the Male equivalent of Women who feel suppressed for their ambition, confidence, prowess and strength. I do consider the possibility that I'm glossing over a myriad of much more complex issues. If you have an opinion, especially a contrarian one, I want to hear you out."

Further, people cannot be distinguished as 100% introvert/extrovert because these character traits are present in individuals with varying degrees, just like empathy, and can change according to circumstance and necessity. Now to adress my opinion: I have recently seen a video where someone did a prank call and after watching it I scrolled down to read the comments. The top comment was like ""every introverts nightmare when someone calls you instead of texting"" and people agreed and said things like ""ikr?"" or ""lol that's me"". But that is exactly what introversion is NOT! Introversion is a personality trait that expresses itself in an individual as a high affinity for introspection and a voluntary preference for activities that involve a low amount of stress or even lead to stress reduction because the stress-vulnerability in introverts seems to be higher than in the general population. If you are afraid of social interaction and shy away from other people, if you socially isolate yourself, have problems making the first step and introducing yourself to others and if you avoid situations that generally involve communicative exchange between people, then you suffer from social anxiety. Most of them however don't like to admit this and prefer to call themselves introverts. My friend's sister is like that. She is very withdrawn from the outside world, not because she needs alone time to dwell on existential philosophical questions, or reading a good book, but rather because she is afraid of being negatively judged by others (which is a sign of a possible underlying inferiority complex/self-confidence issues) and when I told her that she actually might have social anxiety, she flipped out and told me angrily that she is an introvert and that non-introverts will never understand this. I understand when people react negatively to this as we generally don't like being confronted with our own weaknesses and prefer to live in denial, but in this case it is simply the truth. When someone panics and is afraid to call somebody, hold a presentation, take initiative for action, then they are faux-introverts. Introverts don't need validation by reading books like ""the secret power of introverts"" to feel better about themselves and stroke their own ego. An introvert is neither shy nor in any way avoidant, they are simply quiet, introspective, observant and take firm action where action is needed. Faux-introverts need to stop purporting this image that introversion is marked by isolating yourself from the outside world and being afraid to talk to strangers because that is SOCIAL ANXIETY!"

I mean exes of hers from years ago were still stalking her and trying to get with her. She must be pretty incredible. And she was! At first...the sex was MINDBLOWING and during sex she would always say Ill do whatever you want always, just tell me, youre my man. But she emotionally abused me for the past year. Im on meds, I break down almost every night, i have trauma and ptsd. She was the fucking devil who looked like an angel. The relationship was intimate af, extremely sexy, crazy, toxic and out of control. But it broke me into a million pieces. She laughed at me and mocked me for showing vulnerability. She would ghost me, lie to me, gaslight me, but always came back and promised the world to me. Her push pull sucked my soul out and was killing me. And she never once said sorry. In fact, she denied all responsibility. Im sort of seeing this new girl right now. Shes not as attractive, but shes been emotionally abused in the past too. Were taking things slow, but it feels really great. I cant feel love at the moment so Im taking my time, but sometimes this girl genuinely makes me happy, which is something I never felt with my ex. Happiness with her always felt like an endorphin rush, my brain firing on all cylinders like I just took heroin...but it wasnt constant, it was unstable.

My spirit and soul has been sucked out. Im worried Ill never recover. Please. Its not worth it, no matter how hot she is. IF YOU SEE RED FLAGS YOU GET THE FUCK OUT!!! DONT WAVE THEM AWAY! PLEASE! I ignored all the red flags because I was so blind. And let me tell you, once crazy gets a taste of you, it doesnt let go. This is not a joke! Sorry if this is dramatic, but I wouldnt wish what I went through on my worst enemy. Take care of yourself, love yourself, and dont be blinded by someones looks. Its whats inside that counts! Dont let yourself get abused like me in order to figure that out (yes I understand that less attractive people can be abusive too, but my point is dont place value on someones looks, place it on whats inside, the person that they are)."

I think it used to mean to decide if someone has hope or no hope to change in their life while doing this, which I do not condone. You see, I believe that people say not to judge them not because they want everyone to be respected, but they dont personally want to be criticized, so they develop a social contract of sorts that if I dont criticize you, you have no right to criticize me. This is not tolerance, or the ability to live with people that have differences peacefully, as even in tolerance there should be criticism and people trying to be their best, but not violence or scheming against them. This is isolationism instead, as no one speaks to anyone about anything meaningful as someone might be criticized and have their feelings hurt. This is likely why loneliness is up, because people arent having meaningful relationships because they are afraid of vulnerability. Criticism and how people now define judging is important to a well ordered discourse, as ideas can be tested against the truth instead of everyone pretending like everything is fine no matter what."

Actually, the only difference between them is that it's actually harmful to act on your pedophilical urges, since you're not dealing with a consenting adult but a child. Pedophilia does not make you a bad person, acting on it does. Even though, whenever anyone even tries to discuss it, they're bombed with hatred (probably like this post will be), them being pedos or not. That's not how you stop children from being sexually abused, that's how you force people to build this guilty pleasure alone and by themselves until they can't handle it anymore and they hurt someone.

I'm not talking about going through your partner's phone, putting a GPS tracker on them or demanding to smell a guys dick after a night out. That would be ridiculous. But we have the technology to do paternity tests for example. They're relatively cheap, and it would reduce the chance of paternity fraud to zero. Why not pay a few hundred bucks to live with the same certainty women do? You should have a responsible discussion about it with your wife or girlfriend first of course. Another example is STD screenings. Wouldn't it be a good practice to get an STD screening in between every sexual partner? It is free (paid for by taxes) where I am and would help improve public health. It may be a bit hard for the more active people and not a very sexy pretext to a relationship, but sometimes people don't know that they have something. You could be HIV positive and not know for a long time and condoms aren't perfect at preventing transmission. One could argue that it's the ethical thing to do. If you're in a monogamous relationship, then you both know what the situation is for as long as the relationship lasts (and stays monogamous I guess). Isn't it kind of sexy though to know you're both in the clear? Lastly, It's important to talk to your partner and honestly discuss what the rules are for the relationship instead of letting them be implicit. We are individuals with different expectations. It's good to know where a line is so you dont cross it. Emotional intimacy requires vulnerability, and makes sex so much better. Why not make it easier to feel safe enough to let yourself feel vulnerable? i get that safe vulnerability is an oxymoron, but things aren't so black and white. Anyways, I'm sure there are other examples, but I can't think of any right now. Where do you think minimizing the need for trust crosses a line? Do you think 100% trust is necessary for a relationship?"

Kids are inherently unable to independently form and hold political opinions, as they simply lack the knowledge, experience, nuance, independence of thought and ability to reason an adult possesses. They will believe anything you tell them and they will do almost anything to win your approval. Exploiting this inherent vulnerability to prey on peoples empathy for children to push YOUR political agenda is simply disgusting, no matter how good you think your message is, because you dont know if your child will agree with that message or tactics as an adult. If you are a democrat, how would you feel if your parents forced you to scream how much you loved Trump? If you are pro-choice, how would you feel if your parents made you hold signs saying all abortion is murder? If you are a democratic socialist, how would you feel if your parents made you confront Bernie Sanders about his communism at his congressional office while recording it to post on social media? You would probably feel as if you had been exploited and violated, and you would be right. If you, as an adult, have a political opinion, say it for your god damn self. Dont use your little kid as a spokesperson for your opinions and as a human shield against criticism thereof.

First off, I am divorced. So maybe I have a stigma when it comes to this topic, but I feel it is valid. But now that the world is SO connected, youve got all these single dudes out there just looking for a chance to jump at any vulnerability. Or the ones that dont have any morals and will just go all out. And say one of those dudes worked with his charm, and opened up a Pandoras box of disillusion. And on the other hand, while said spouse is secretly living her life and the strain is huge, youve got this monkey on your back and lifes looking pretty down, turns out your ex and women around you like monkeys. And turns out your pretty lonely, married to someone who isnt there. (Turns our stigmas grow when you dont settle them right away) My second and probably more alarmed disgust, is morals in general.

Now, if a religious person tries to use a vulnerability of another to attract it into its faith, isnt that manipulative and hideous? Children are vulnerable and you using that to introduce ideas on its head is exactly what makes a parent negligent. If you are in a debate in which you dont have the tools to choose a stance, the reasonable thing to do is not choose one, stand in neutrality until you get what you need to take a side. This is what happens with children, they do not have the tools to choose a stance in regards of religion, therefore they should not be encouraged to choose it or disregard it completely until theyve done their research and can be reasonable enough to have their own opinion.

Sure, there was much made in the media about how ""Russian trolls and bots"" were posting political memes on Facebook, or this politician or the other was meeting with Russians or Ukrainians, but why is all of the focus on them? In 2020, Russia is hardly a major player on the global stage anymore, featuring only the 11th largest economy in the world (behind little Canada), and a far weakened military post USSR breakup. While they are regionally belligerent at times they aren't doing the kind of global, economic expansion that other major players are doing. Their society is a stagnant mess and they really have no prospects, making their limited involvement in American politics more of a desperation play to keep the United States off their backs than anything else. So let's look at someone else that has seen a *massive* rise in economic power in the past 25 years, is now flush with money, and has been pouring that investment and influence into America itself: China. China is the 2nd largest economy in the world now, right behind the US, and far ahead of Russia (12x their size). China, being a state-capitalist (basically ""communism lite"") country, and patently anti-liberty, is diametrically at odds with America and resentful of them on an ideological basis. China has made public their own communist party's goal of overtaking the United States as the foremost power of the planet, and while the details remain scarce, it isn't hard to surmise that involves taking advantage of one of America's inherent weakness in its democracy and freedom of information, or disinformation, for that matter. Given this, it isn't hard to see the vulnerability in how individuals or organizations in the media could be bought or coerced, or how tech companies could be influenced to send out regular messaging that furthers politics or initiatives that benefit the ambitions of the Chinese state in dividing/weakening America and eventually overtaking it. As it stands, California, where much of the media and Silicon Valley resides, is far and away the biggest beneficiary of Chinese investment and influence, and a lot of their curiously anti-American politics and love of authoritarianism seem to be a testament to this effect.

The only reason this is unpopular is because the idea of marriage has become so stigmatized and negative, and so people, especially young people (I say as a young person myself) decide to sit in this limbo/ purgatory state of dating which was never supposed to be a destination at all. Dating is a means to an end. Not the end. Without some kind of unbreakable agreement between two people, you never have to fully give yourself to them. You never have to fully open up, and of course there will be secrets, because there is always a back door. It isnt a commitment. Its a temporary agreement that we act out as if it was more, unless of course someone else comes along that I realize is better than me, in which case peace out. And the only reason any of us go along with this is because the other partner has the same unspoken backdoor. I do not consider myself conservative, nor religious, but recently I have just become aware of how heavy we place the weight of responsibility and commitment on people who are dating. I just read a sub reddit from someone begging for advice on how to get out of a relationship that he realized wasnt right for him, and he felt like he was leading her on cause he couldnt find a way to tell her. Im not saying go ahead and break as many hearts as you want and I am not promoting hookup culture (though I think that is something that has its own negative effects as well).. What I am saying is we have seemed to forgotten that dating is meant to be the time when we meet many different people, and figure out who we want to be with. We keep it light and appropriate and when we realize weve met the person we want to commit to, we come into a contractual agreement that says we are in it till the end no matter what... something that EVERYONE SAYS when they are dating but then give up on two months later when we realize that person isnt perfect of hot guy/ girl number two walks in the door. Marriage is meant to be a decision made for the present and the future. I was the person who laughed at marriage cause who wants to be tied down?? And then sure enough, when the rubber met the road, they were with someone else faster than I could say who the fuck-? Now, 5 years later and the roles have changed. I willingly shackled myself to someone and now I realize it isnt a burden. It is freeing. Because we have agreed to be partners in life no matter what comes. Good God it feels good to be tied down . Because theres security and vulnerability and growth and trust in that. Also no, you cant marry the wrong person there isnt the one. When you Marry them, they become the one for you. And holy shit stop looking for the one. What youre saying is I want a person who fits into my life like a puzzle piece so I dont have to compromise or change anything about myself. Stop. That person doesnt exist. But guess what, you have the opportunity to be the THE ONE for someone else. Every day you get to make those sacrifices to be the best possible parter you your significant other. And guess what, when both people are doing that... words cannot describe how incredibly right that is. That is how you find the one, by being it. Dont believe me? Still not buying it? Thats okay. You dont have to. But when things dont work out because he/she is starting to have doubts, it isnt my fault. Okay sorry for the rant. I definitely got more passionate than I expected to writing that, and also covered way more topical ground than I meant to. My passion isnt anger by the way... its sadness. Its brutal heartache for all my friends and family who I see willingly, blindly tossing themselves away to be crushed under a boulder of responsibility and commitment they dont need to shoulder while searching for the person they want to be with."

I am one of the people who arent very fond of very young children. They can be annoying, rude, selfish, disgusting, and overly coddled like they are Jesus Christ. Of course there are many reasons for all of that, developing brains and vulnerability. They are easy targets to many dangers in life and deserve all the love and safety from their loved ones. But I think the child-worship in society is getting a bit out of hand and I wouldnt blame anyone for disliking their forced in presence.

93,vulnerability,unpopularopinion,The killing of General Soleimani was a great move for the United States and Trumps handling of the situation was remarkable.,1,em5z4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/em5z4k/the_killing_of_general_soleimani_was_a_great_move/,2020-01-09 17:44:14,"A lot of people on Reddit are getting concerned of a Third World War after Trump ordered strikes which killed the Iranian general Soleimani in Iraq. However, Trump knew from the start that Iran had little ability to retaliate and used this as a massive win for America diplomatically. Firstly, in killing Soleimani, Trump essentially took out a large part of Irans strategic body and inflicted a massive loss of morale for Iranians and the Iranian military. By compounding off of existing unrest, Soleimanis killing demonstrated extensive national weakness for the Iranian government and conflated the governments issues in conveying strength domestically and within the region. Trump handicapped Irans military capabilities and internal order, weakening their ability to exercise control in the region. Secondly, since America has now become energy independent for the most part, Trump has the leverage and freedom to make sweeping movements to secure interests in the region without extensive economic repercussions for America. Without as large of a reliance on foreign oil as we used to have, we can better secure interests in the region without retaliatory measures which can impact oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. Killing Soleimani could have been done as a result of growing American leverage in the Middle East. Third, Iran couldnt have retaliated extensively, and was forced to retaliate marginally in order to save face with the populace. Iran is already in a state of great unrest, economic stagnation due to sanctions, and is losing power in the region as states such as Iraq begin to re-emerge and NATO members/partners like Turkey and Saudi Arabia make steps to ensure control in states like Yemen and Syria. The power vacuum left by ISIS in the region made it hard for Iran to exercise power against states there and make meaningful trade on favorable terms. Iran is growing rapidly without access to new resources to match it, and the Rial has been a very sensitive and weak currency. Iran doesnt have the capability to wage war, in terms of national morale, economic robustness, or diplomatic leverage. On the note of diplomatic leverage, Russia and China wouldnt help out Iran at all. This is pretty evident by the fact that their responses to the Soleimani attack were quite weak, if there at all. Russia is suffering from its own sanctions and economic downturn, the growing vulnerability of the ruble, progressively more outdated military equipment and tactics, a corrupt oligarchy hurting the military high command and officer ranks, failures to maintain large numbers in the military and reach targets, a Catch-22 situation in Ukraine, and Putins progressively weakening position at the head of Russian politics. A war with America would be the very dead last thing Russia would want or need. As for China, theyre in a similar boat. Their economy is flattening out as they lose export markets to other cheaper countries, wealth inequality is growing geographically and demographically, unrest amongst the cult of Jinping, poor infrastructure, and no practical combat experience. The trade war is hurting China very badly, and active conflict (especially against the US Navy) would put a stop to their export based economy. With no domestic economy to back it up, China would end in ruination. They have to tread VERY carefully, and a lack of interest in Iran would contribute to that. The BRI is starting to give way anyways, so vested efforts in Iran are against the Chinese prerogative. With all of that in mind, when Iran launched its small missile strike on vacant US bases to save face and boost morale, Trump responded perfectly. By making himself clear in protecting American interests in killing Soleimani and then asserting his own desire for peace, hes setting himself up for a strong position at the table. Hes showing that he is willing to make peace and also willing to take action when that peace isnt met. He was calm and collected in his statement today, and really was his best diplomatic performance yet (although thats not a high bar). In the end, Trump took an advantage of an opportunity, called Irans bluffs, and is showing a balance between a commitment to peace in the region and a promise in protecting American interests there. Hes setting the agenda on his terms, and in the state Iran is in, Iran will have to give in. In the end, the Iran crisis was a big win for Trump and America diplomatically and domestically. Hes not only gained political capital against Iran and with other countries, but also for his own agenda leading up to 2020. Its hard to discredit the suaveness of Trumps handling of the situation here. I wish more of that happened; we could maintain our interests while still leveraging for peace and cooperation."

I think there is now quite a **strong emotional bias** toward drugs in our generations, and it seems to have driven one of the strongest echo-chamber in the web, with strong opinions that are only reinforced by a complete disregard of any scientific research that hint at harmful effects of said drugs versus the positive effects (excessively publicized here) that they can have on specific pathology and disorders. This is partially explained by the previously popular, and equally extreme, opposite stance of complete (and literal) demonization of anything drug-related, people shifting from one extreme to the other as usual, but also there are strong components of coping, cognitive dissonance and delusion at key here. Finally, weed is becoming an industry with a lot of financial interests invested in. If the tobacco / climate denial is any indication for it, that can mean a big potential for smokescreen (no pun intended). Ignoring, or being completely blind to, the potential health crisis that widespread drug use represents **could have disastrous effects** on future generations, that we seem to grow completely oblivious to. I think there are only two points that really matter in this discussion : **Are drugs harmful** and **is their prohibition** an **efficient** way to reduce the number of users. I believe we have, at this point of our history, sufficient statistics to allow us to conclude positively to both of those statements, but I will go into details : **1 - Are drugs harmful ?** ^(\[None of you want to hear or read this, but if you use, I implore you to do a little bit of impartial research on your own. There is a lot of information out there that should at the very least question your certainty in your favorite drug's innocuousness.\]) **Even cannabis**, a drug that is **generally perceived as harmless**, hints at a **lots of potential harmful effects** on public health (**fetal growth** [1](URL [2](URL [3](URL [4](URL **decreased cognitive abilities** [5](URL [6](URL that are more serious the [younger you are](URL **brain development** in adolescents [7](URL reward system / **motivation** [8](URL [6](URL [9](URL **schizophrenia** [10](URL {causal} [11](URL {*through CIP*} [12](URL {causal} \[not linked with genetic vulnerability [13](URL \[longitudinal, old : [14](URL [15](URL \], [16](URL {review, 2014} [17](URL ...) [18](URL {general review} [19](URL {general review}, and its ability to **trigger psychotic symptoms** (a specific syndrome called *cannabis induced psychosis*) has been attested by numerous studies [20](URL [21](URL CUD has been shown to increase in prevalence with THC potency and cannabis use [22](URL **Cannabis induced psychosis** is, itself, **heavily associated** with future **schizophrenia** diagnoses. [11](URL There is substantial evidence that **most neurotoxic substances** can trigger psychotic disorders [23](URL {MDMA}, [24](URL {amphetamines, review}, most of them (cannabis included) are *associated with* schizophrenia [25](URL [26](URL and gradually decrease cognitive abilities [27](URL {MDMA}, [28](URL {MDMA}. **Even alcohol** can, during the specific state of *delirium tremens* and in the very serious cases of *Korsakoff syndromes* (though prevalence and repartitions is not comparable). These are specific health issues that arise outside the **specific problem of addiction** (well [documented for cannabis](URL despite constant denial : the psychological addiction only has been [debunked](URL yet remains popular) and all the related social issues that it provokes. For those reasons, I believe that the public health danger of high and uncontrolled use of various drugs do exist and is potentially (but not necessarily) even more serious than the numerous public health issues caused by high tobacco and alcohol use (with which they can share a co-morbidity, meaning that high cannabis use can increase and maintain tobacco use). There are a lot of questions left unanswered, but claiming that cannabis, MDMA, ketamin or any illegal drug for that matter is absolutely harmless (no matter how fun they are), is simply disingenuous, specious and irresponsible. As a rule, you shouldn't smoke weed when pregnant or before 21. After that, you should be wary of CUD and stop as soon as you feel that your cognition is started to be affected by it. **2 - Is their prohibition efficient ?** Even though proponents of marijuana legalization in the state used to claim that legalization would not impact the number of users, the most recent studies show that the **prevalence of marijuana use** has [**more than doubled** since its legalization](URL ([1](URL [2](URL [3](URL [4](URL Contrary to the expectations, MML have also **not slowed down the trend of increased potency** of available marijuana [5](URL It is difficult to obtain data on the strict impact of legalization on consumption, because social experiments cannot be easily provoked, but whilst there are obviously many different variables that determine drug use in a country, there is definitely a case to make for the efficiency of prohibition in reducing the prevalence of specific drug use. Even though drugs are accessible to the general public when prohibited, the social stigma that surround them and the adverse consequences that can incur when trying to access them may very well be enough, on their own, to significantly decrease the prevalence of drug use. Also, it seems **disingenuous to me to paint the opioids crisis as a problem caused by prohibition**, when opioids prescriptions are highly controlled in most western countries and none of them has known a similar crisis to the American one, which mainly results from a combination of partial insurance coverage that only covers pill, and specific policies to actively pushed the opioids to the American public since the 90s. The **wide range of symptoms that Purdue's OxyContin was prescribed for**, supported by a **campaign of active disinformation of the public**, are generally identified as the main cause of the epidemic that strikes the U.S. **3 - So, is it worth it ?** When considering whether it is worth it to maintain the prohibition of a specific drug, you mostly have to consider the cost in public health and social issues (drug induced crimes, poverty, education etc.), versus the benefits of potentially tremendous increased tax incomes, law enforcement priority relocations etc. **Criminal activities** and prevalence of risky behaviors **are not entirely determined by criminal opportunities**, but by a lot of different social factors (high wage imbalance, high rate of poverty, ethnic divide and marginalization, cultural and biological markers etc.). In other words, **criminals won't cease to be criminals because their main occupation suddenly cease to be profitable**. As long as the determining factors are still there, you'll still observe financially motivated criminal behaviors, you'll just observe different ones. People selling weed will just end up stealing cars, fencing stuff, robbing people or smuggling stuff or whatever. They won't suddenly stop having a reason to commit crime to provide for their livelihood, and **decriminalization has** [no decreasing effect](URL **on crime rates.** In fact, property crime on adjacent areas has shown increases in some studies [1](URL This is also why **You never win war on crime**. There will always be antisocial behaviors (rape, theft, murders etc.) no matter how hard we try to prevent or deter them, we can only try to minimize their occurrence, but we never definitively ""win"", per se. In light of all this, I believe, given the (now better documented) **therapeutic potential benefits** (depression for special K, PTSD for MDMA etc.) of some of those products, that their use should be (for most of them) allowed in **highly controlled and limited medical circumstances**. I also believe that their advertisement (like tobacco and alcohol) should be forbidden, and I honestly don't believe that it is generally a good idea to completely deregulate and allow the general selling of all neurotoxic substances to the public."

I think that many people have found themselves in a predicament where they have loved more than one person at the same time (ie still getting over a breakup but meeting someone knew that they connect with); the only difference between these people and polyamorous people is that the people in polyamorous relationships have the kind of personality that allows them to say ""fuck it, I want both of these people and they both want me and I really don't care what my culture thinks about that."" As far as asexual and aromantic people are concerned, I am sorry to say that I believe there is something either physically or psychologically wrong with them. An exception of this is if an aromantic person has just disregarded this society's expectations that it is normal and expected that everyone falls in love, in which is still the result of a personality trait or an experience that resulted in them straying from the norm. I believe that all humans are wired to feel sexual attraction - and if they don't there is either a chemical imbalance in their brain or they had some negative experience in their life that made them asexual, whether the individual is conscious of this experience or not. Gay, lesbian, bi, and trans people are constantly struggling with hatred and getting the same rights as others. They cannot control who they love and what kind of relationships they feel the need to form. As a result they struggle with adoption, being able to have a legal marriage, and having to deal with assault and verbal abuse constantly. The only people I mentioned above that have to deal with these issues are people in a polyamorous relationship, but as I said, I believe this is something they can control and also cannot be defined as a sexuality. I do believe it should be allowed, though! Follow your dreams if you want a relationship with multiple people and others should not verbally abuse or deny them the validity of their relationship. Tl/dr Putting all of these identities with gay, lesbian, bi, and trans people is fundamentally incorrect, because they are not sexual orientations."

When you drink, you dull those senses, lose awareness and figuratively kick the pleasure Out of the experience. Its numb, and regretful because you made a bad choice and if it was a good one, you cant tell because you either dont remember or never really felt connected. And half the time you gotta take a piss anyway. And I get it, when its your first time with someone, a drink or two helps us loosen up and help progress the relationship to intimacy. But once youre sloshed, where even is the fun? As Ive said before, Ive had sex drunk, it ranks at rock bottom. Sober is best.

As a result, it's easier to keep hiding at home. Fear of the scene, new acquaintances and unusual conditions - all this is avoidance of checking your arrogance in action and in reality. And the more compact life is, the easier it is to think of yourself as someone special. The root of uncertainty is an unsustainable opinion about yourself and your real qualities. Shaky self-esteem, made up to fall to low ratings, is the main cause of vulnerability and subsequent cramped life, where it is only possible to retain a sense of self-importance.

Either the OP is deemed 100% wrong, or the other party in question is deemed 100% wrong. Theres often no nuance. No trying to empathize with both parties. And once the subreddit decides who they like more...one false move, and OP will be bullied and invalidated into submission. Someone has one bad moment where they yelled at their partner in the heat of an argument? They are dubbed emotionally abusive, downvoted and shamed. Someone tries to respond to a comment giving additional context to clarify their actions, or those of their partners? Downvoted and shamed. A ridiculous number of posts just advocate for immediate break up. God forbid OP says they want to stay. If you look through many of the less popular posts, it is very common to see OP have comments with dozens of downvotes. They came there for sympathy &amp; advice, but instead they find themselves fighting to defend their integrity. This can be seriously damaging to people who are in already emotionally vulnerable states. It could even drive people to harm themselves or others. Sure, you have plenty of instances where good advice is given. And there is nothing wrong with seeking 3rd party advice for a relationship problem. But the big problem with having a platform like this on Reddit is its inherent anonymity, the generally broad-demographics of the userbase, and the upvoting/downvoting system. You have 14 year old kids pretending to be experienced, giving live advice to 30 year olds in a state of mental crisis. You have people with serious emotional baggage and damage of their own projecting it onto the posters. You have people who hate men looking for any megaphone for their agendas. And its all grounded in the ""context"" of saying what is likely popular instead of what is actually good advice. Subs like fatpeoplehate were taken down because they were toxic, and a hotpot for cyber bullying. I think /r/relationships is not a hate sub...but it is in many ways equally as toxic.

It's complicated as hell in terms of safety, what's required for cars to communicate with each other, and the updated infrastructure needed for roads. And for what? So people can sit the car for an hour and not drive but read? Wow, mindblowing. And there's a lot of downsides to Internet of Things too, like privacy issues.

Im not personally fond of christian rap, or christian music in general but its undeniable that there will be a new wave of artists and records in the near future where christian music or music about religion will be the norm for a lot of artists. Knowingly it not, Kanye has gave christian artists a platform and they will for sure be using it to their advantage for years to come. Kanye for the first time in his career has looked past his core fan base and actually *expanded* his audience and created a image around his music that portrays his vulnerability, his humility and his artistry. There are not many Hip-Hop artists who are down this same path (besides possibly Kendrick Lamar). Im not sure if those who dislike the album are nostalgic for the old Kanye, or if they legitimately think the album is bad but it shouldnt be ignored how revolutionary this will be to music and Hip-Hop specifically, in the grand scheme of things."

Truth is power, over ourselves, over our nature, over nature itself. Lies are weak, they are a vulnerability, they make us vulnerable, to nature itself. In a kingdom of lies, those who speak truth are criminals. Men who should be heroes are exiled or executed, while those who should be imprisoned instead rise to the greatest positions of power. This is backwards, and it needs to stop, before it leads to our complete destruction. That is not hyperbole. Deception distorts everything; intentions do not match outcomes, plans do not match objectives, declarations do not reflect intentions. This does not merely inhibit our ability to function, but it actually turns those efforts against us. No lie is acceptable, no one should ever accept one, and no one should stand by while another spreads them. This is not life advice, sadly, i have as many friends as i do lies.

Asking ourselves whether we want to allow bullies to continue existing by silencing the violence and abuse perpetrated against them, or, if we want to actually find the root cause of the epidemic and stave off bullying, or at least abuse against people that often leads to the conception of bullies.

I feel like that entitles it to be a popular opinion. So, from the other side, I feel that it is not. Rather than copy-pasting the same text onto every one of these posts and getting no replies, I will post here. ------------------------ Environmental scientist here. Please, for God's sake Reddit, stop regurgitating all the pro-nuclear nonsense. You do realize it's a package of talking points developed by the fossil fuel industry to undermine renewables+batteries, yes? Nuclear power cannot compete on cost. That is why it is dying, and majors like Exelon and Hitachi and Toshiba are all exiting the industry. It turns out that you can't just build cookie-cutter nuclear plants because of the demands of local geography, water supply, weather conditions, and disaster vulnerability. Every site design has to be unique, and vetting that for safety is enormously time consuming and costly, even in China and India where there is no bureaucratic red tape or public opposition to nuclear power. Nuclear power was only cheap in the 1970s because we built so recklessly. It is 5 times more expensive now because we know so much more about what is required to actually make nuclear plants safe. This is almost unprecedented. Nuclear power is one of only a handful of technologies in history with a negative experience curve, meaning it gets more rather than less expensive as we build more of it. The pro-nuclear fanbase is also extremely ethnocentric. Is it really realistic to think that Senegal and Berundi and Madagascar and Somalia and Uganda and 150 other less-developed countries where over half the world's population lives have the resources and institutions necessary to safely manage the entire nuclear power supply chain? Hell, drug lords in Brazil just attacked a uranium ore convoy in Brazil a few weeks ago. It's just hopelessly unrealistic. It's also extremely difficult to run nuclear plants in arid countries because of the water requirements. France's nuclear power plants consume over 50% of ALL of the country's fresh water! That means more than all other industrial, commercial, and residential water consumption combined. And nuclear power still only provides 75% of the country's electricity. Countries without France's abundant freshwater would end up using virtually all of their water trying to run 100% on nuclear. (Have you ever wondered why almost none of US nuclear power is in the arid states?). Here are some other key points from an analysis by Professor Derek Abbot about a 100% electricity from nuclear power scenario, which would require 15,000 active nuclear power plants at today's level of electricity consumption: -------------------- **Land and location**: One nuclear reactor plant requires about 20.5 km2 (7.9 mi2) of land to accommodate the nuclear power station itself, its exclusion zone, its enrichment plant, ore processing, and supporting infrastructure. Secondly, nuclear reactors need to be located near a massive body of coolant water, but away from dense population zones and natural disaster zones. Simply finding 15,000 locations on Earth that fulfill these requirements is extremely challenging. **Lifetime**: Every nuclear power station needs to be decommissioned after 40-60 years of operation due to neutron embrittlement - cracks that develop on the metal surfaces due to radiation. If nuclear stations need to be replaced every 50 years on average, then with 15,000 nuclear power stations, one station would need to be built and another decommissioned somewhere in the world every day. Currently, it takes 6-12 years to build a nuclear station, and up to 20 years to decommission one, making this rate of replacement unrealistic. **Nuclear waste**: Although nuclear technology has been around for 60 years, there is still no universally agreed mode of disposal. Its uncertain whether burying the spent fuel and the spent reactor vessels (which are also highly radioactive) may cause radioactive leakage into groundwater or the environment via geological movement. **Accident rate**: To date, there have been 11 nuclear accidents at the level of a full or partial core-melt. These accidents are not the minor accidents that can be avoided with improved safety technology; they are rare events that are not even possible to model in a system as complex as a nuclear station, and arise from unforeseen pathways and unpredictable circumstances (such as the Fukushima accident). Considering that these 11 accidents occurred during a cumulated total of 14,000 reactor-years of nuclear operations, scaling up to 15,000 reactors would mean we would have a major accident somewhere in the world every month. **Proliferation**: The more nuclear power stations, the greater the likelihood that materials and expertise for making nuclear weapons may proliferate. Although reactors have proliferation resistance measures, maintaining accountability for 15,000 reactor sites worldwide would be nearly impossible. **Uranium abundance**: At the current rate of uranium consumption with conventional reactors, the world supply of viable uranium, which is the most common nuclear fuel, will last for 80 years. Scaling consumption up to 15 TW, the viable uranium supply will last for less than 5 years. (Viable uranium is the uranium that exists in a high enough ore concentration so that extracting the ore is economically justified.) **Uranium extraction from seawater**: Uranium is most often mined from the Earths crust, but it can also be extracted from seawater, which contains large quantities of uranium (3.3 ppb, or 4.6 trillion kg). Theoretically, that amount would last for 5,700 years using conventional reactors to supply 15 TW of power. (In fast breeder reactors, which extend the use of uranium by a factor of 60, the uranium could last for 300,000 years. However, Abbott argues that these reactors complexity and cost makes them uncompetitive.) Moreover, as uranium is extracted, the uranium concentration of seawater decreases, so that greater and greater quantities of water are needed to be processed in order to extract the same amount of uranium. Abbott calculates that the volume of seawater that would need to be processed would become economically impractical in much less than 30 years. **Exotic metals**: The nuclear containment vessel is made of a variety of exotic rare metals that control and contain the nuclear reaction: hafnium as a neutron absorber, beryllium as a neutron reflector, zirconium for cladding, and niobium to alloy steel and make it last 40-60 years against neutron embrittlement. Extracting these metals raises issues involving cost, sustainability, and environmental impact. In addition, these metals have many competing industrial uses; for example, hafnium is used in microchips and beryllium by the semiconductor industry. If a nuclear reactor is built every day, the global supply of these exotic metals needed to build nuclear containment vessels would quickly run down and create a mineral resource crisis. This is a new argument that Abbott puts on the table, which places resource limits on all future-generation nuclear reactors, whether they are fuelled by thorium or uranium. -------------------- **I didn't write the above comment**, but it's what led me to start reading more about nuclear energy (being a huge fan of nuclear power before that myself, as I live close-ish to a well-known one). Credit to /u/bombula, who unfortunately has since deleted his account. There are a few things I have learned myself since reading the above. For example, the energy company Westinghouse (the guys who trusted Tesla over Edison, which is why the world uses AC for socket current today) [closed their doors in 2017 because they tried to build a nuclear reactor](URL Nuclear energy is [some of the most expensive](URL to generate, after you take into account the building of the reactor and the necessary regulations. United States as a whole [is closing more nuclear reactors without building any new ones](URL and it's not because of public pressure or anything. If you look at the link, they're still investing in peak gas plants, despite great public pressure towards making the grid more green. However, the overwhelming majority of new installed power generating capacity comes from commercial photovoltaics. At the end of the day, if nukes made sense economically, we would simply not be seeing the numbers we're seeing. I believe that the grid of tomorrow is a combined grid of wind, hydro, and solar, boosted by improved chemical batteries (like the [Tesla installation in South Australia](URL [WARNING!

Yes, they look shiny, but is the extra cost for the same hardware really worth it? Let's do a quick online search to compare... A PC from Staples with 8 GB RAM, Core i5, and 1 TB HDD is $400. A Mac from Bestbuy with the same RAM and CPU, but only 128 GB memory (admittedly SSD) costs $900. It's clear that the PC blows the Mac out of the water when it comes to performance over cost ratio. The two computers are running virtually identical hardware, but the Mac is over twice as expensive. I am a person that values efficiency and function over appearances. I am not the most attentive person, and often don't even notice aesthetics in a computer. I just want my sweet RAM and CPU clock speed. I also want to be able to run a broader array of productivity and scientific research software and play games at more than 5 FPS. Some may argue that the PC has several drawbacks as compared to the Mac, chief among them is the PC's vulnerability to malware. However, by exercising sound judgement when browsing the web and running an up to date antivirus software, one can avoid the vast majority of issues regarding viruses. Also, it's not like Macs can't get viruses either. Another potential argument is that Macs can run a more diverse array of creative/artistic software. However, it's probably not too hard to find similar software that will run on a PC. At the end of the day, both platforms will get the job done. One tangible advantage Macs have, I will admit, is battery life. A brand new Mac usually has a battery life of around 8-10 hours, compared to 4-5 hours for a PC. However, 4-5 hours usually will be enough for most daily tasks. I tend to keep my computer plugged in most of the time anyway, and rarely do I even spend 2 hours running on battery. I think that overall, the PC is simply the better option, especially if you're strapped for cash."

I'm one of those people who always has to win the other person over by taking the first steps to showing them I'm nice (and safe to chill with!). I also have a really deep voice, and it's been like that since probably 6th grade. Basically, I've been through the ringer and it really seems to show. Walking down the street, people have crossed the damn street just to avoid walking by me. If you're a minority in a predominantly white neiborhood, I imagine my complaint petty in comparison to the discrimination you face every day. One of the reasons life can suck for some is because, initially, most people judge you based off appearance alone. That isn't remotely an intellectually sound way to go about judging people, but it's the reality of modern society. I've even had psychiatrists before who, initially, didn't believe I had ocd (extreme germophobia) because I didn't look like the 'clean type' to them. If your head could explode from extreme frustration, I'd have died a long time ago. What does that have to do with my scrutiny of the idea of toxic masculinity? Simple; but let's pull some of it's main arguments apart one-by-one, shall we?: \~masculine toxicity suppresses compassion\~ You know what happens when cavemen like me make an effort to show compassion? People--of all genders, not just bullies/bros/tough guys calling you a pussy--\*suppress that opportunity\*. If you made a profile on SitterCity, would people hire you to be a nanny? They wouldn't me, because, (read: never mind those other fears attributed to men racing through the average parent's mind), at the very least, I don't \*look\* like someone that can take care of kids. Even though I'm really good with kids, and my nieces/nephews prefer me over their aunts. Why the hell would that guy want to babysit? Is he some kind of child molester? Of course, because most people \*believe\* that men are lousy babysitters anyway; and what real man would even \*want\* to be a nanny? Almost everyone scrutinizes that - and almost everyone is guilty of that double standard. The most femininity-advocating human in the world will question the motives of a male nanny. I want to clarify that while some women are intimidating to people and children, it doesn't usually fall within that same context of physical harm. You get my point, in the immediate eyes of most, a male babysitter is one of two things, dangerous or queer. And all types will bully you on that: your brother, your sister, your gay friend, etc. I'm aware of the counter-arguments here and I'll address that at the conclusion of my rant. \~masculine toxicity translates to violent behavior\~ Because as observed in any high school, college, workplace, social media or prison, females just don't fight nearly as much as men (r/whoosh). Now, admittedly - women typically aren't violent in an equally \*physical\* way - but there's \*other types of violence\*, that are \*every bit as harmful\*. I'd probably rather lose a fist fight than be undermined in any way that could affect me long term. In short, feminine traits are equally hostile, but it isn't the same kind of violence so it gets a pass!? Doh! \~masculine toxicity discourages open communication/suppresses emotional health\~ I could make a lot more points if I had the time and thought it to be worth said time, but this one is probably my \*biggest complaint\*; Firstly, a lot of \[people of any genders\] are hardwired to bottle things up, that's just their nature which is \*very\* hard to change. Try changing your goddamn personality; that's about how easy it is if you're not much of an external communicator. Women are \*definitely hardwired to openly communicate their issues way more more than men\*. But that lacks context just like anything else in life; Just because it's healthy, therapeutic and sometimes cathartic - doesn't mean it's the \*right thing to do, or that it isn't toxic\*. Being naturally \*vocal\*, inherently entails venting, complaining (teachers complaining about students, nurses complaining about patients, etc.) and (how about?) \*gossip\*; \*it's only therapeutic to those engaged in, or otherwise interested in overhearing it\*. To everyone else, it's toxic or something semantically related. It's certainly aggravating. Now when it isn't 'nasty', it isn't usually 'gossip', but women just talk a hell of a lot more in general - and not everyone wants to hear complaining, which brings me to another point; Some talkers, are more interesting (read: to the general \[normie\] population) than others. Gossip is juicy, fun, stimulation. Free entertainment and if you're the one talking, you're also entertaining yourself. For some reason, it's like a therapeutic kind of drama. I don't really like drama, and that's why I don't do it... ...But \*even if I did\* want to address people aloud with my troubles, be it personal one-on-ones or group settings, we are now presented with yet another issue. Yeah, remember that tough guy from my first paragraph, out on the margin of society, who doesn't exactly come off as inviting as Drew Barrymore? Yeah... no one really cares about what he has to say. Why? \*Because it isn't fun\*; it isn't gossip, it isn't engaging, it isn't entertaining and it isn't interesting for those reasons. And the guy complaining? The powerlifter-looking neanderthal? He's tough - he can take care of himself (said the people of \*either\* gender). When men bottle their struggles, \*there can be a good reason for it\*. \*If there wasn't - we wouldn't suppress our feelings in the first place\*. Maybe we're psychologically less inclined to hold grudges and wait it off. Maybe our anger lies in taboo or controversial subjects - that aren't safe to vent on - \*anywhere\*. Where do I open up to complain about religion?(I know that's a bad example given the possible solutions like athiest meetups, but still throwing it out there.) Where do I complain about how I think therapists are \*way overpaid\* and borderline useless for certain cynics like me? Therapy? (See what I did there...) \~toxic masculinity engenders emotional repression\~ \~...part ii\~ I live in a big city and have had hundreds of friends throughout my life. When a male shows his modern female companion vulnerability, you know what often happens? She hates it. She wants him to \*stop acting like such a pussy\*. She's knows he isn't like that around his homies. She knows he must be up to something, for him be crying like a little girl. It's a turn-off. I remember a few years ago my mom was watching dr phil. He had a psychologist on his show conducting a social experiment of sorts, by asking a large volume of random women (aged in their 20's on average) the most common reason they dumped their ex's. You know what the most common answer was? Because their ex-boyfriends were ""too sensitive, for a guy!"" These guys, were \*too sensitive for the standard that women hold them to\* (which can often mean expressing vulnerability, which I've witnessed countless friends dumped for), which--in an ideal world that we do not live in because reality hurts--should be considered a good trait for any human to have. But that trait isn't always accepted from men, and who often rejects it again? Women. But I hear your argument. If OP is so thoughtful, why would he only associate toxic masculinity to men? Who said it couldn't be attributed to women? And that's when I link you to this accepted description of toxic masculinity, where I invite you to read it in its entirety and tell me it doesn't smell funny.

How often have women belittled you to ""be a man""? Even your mother/grandmother has hit you with that one. The proposed solutions for this toxic masculinity issue, would seemingly \*condition\* away certain traits that are parts of male evolutionary makeup for a reason, and aren't even feasible to remove without negative consequences. 3. We face things many women don't have to deal with, and that's why our emotions are repressed; and our compassion restricted. If someone's crying, guess who can't run up to them and give them a hug!? Me! I'd love to help, but I don't want to scare the shit out of you. I don't cry but if I did, I don't know of any women who'd hug me. I know a bunch who wouldn't, though... Some of them even seem the edgy/coolwithit types, died hair, tattoos, piercings... used to work at Hot Topic. We are men. We have deep voices, beards and aggressive body odor (I certainly do). We don't talk as much because we like taking breaks from talking. \*Society doesn't even allow us to tap into our feminine side\*, so some of us ditched it completely. The ones who embraced it (and got away with it) are surrounded by some kickass people. People are a lot more intimidated by us than they are women (physically). If I was at a party and offered to change some baby's diaper, and I was the only guy there they'd judge me. Everyone holds people like me to certain expectations; even the people who came up with toxic masculinity in the first place, would hold me to said expectations."

Then 1960-1970 gun control and theres all of a sudden lots of shootings. Why? Because gun control enables people to get more dangerous guns by building them or buying them illegally and then in their crazy mind they ONLY chose gun free zones.. What shooting hasnt been in one? This is why gun control creates shootings it brings vulnerability to people in gun free zones where some crazy person can bring a gun and shoot lots of people, having a much less chance of a civilian ending the shooting before it starts.

If it does, why? If anything it should enhance it. Why should you be afraid to confront your feelings and give in to your vulnerability? I think people are just scared of attachments or scared of being hurt.  Besides sexual flirtation and compliments about looks, and physical touching in a loving way, what Is the difference between a lover and a friend? All it is, is the simple fact that you are attracted to the person, that's it.  Why should I be afraid to talk to a girl like I do my homeys, just because I'm attracted to her? Why should it be different than any conversation I have with my sister or female cousin?  Personally the more I can do regular shit with the girl, the more I get attracted to her.  Let's say for example, I hit a girl up to go play basketball with her, then afterwards we browse through YouTube videos and watch them together. Later, we just end up talking and discussing whatever new shit we found out, whether informational, funny, stupid, whatever. Does it change the fact that at the end of the day/night that I want to smash?  I shouldn't feel like I have to separate the two feelings from each other. If I wanted an opinion from the female perspective about an everyday life experience, should I be afraid to ask just because I still want to do naughty things to her if I'm feeling horny?  Just the regular shit that you do with your friends or homeys of the same gender; why can't I do it with a female that I am attracted to? In this case I should be able to have my cake and eat it too.  If there is really going to be all this gender equality bullshit going on, then I should be able to guy things with a girl I'm attracted to, but still be able to touch, grope, and have sexual relations with her. They should still be mutually exclusive.  Basically it all comes down to if you really find the person attractive or not, which is why looks matter.  If indeed doing more stuff with someone you like does change your sexual attraction towards them, then just end the relationship and move on. It can't be any different than an friend or acquaintance that you just fall out of touch with.  If I am wrong, then two people can't really be in love with each other.

Women select men, not the other way around. And men really want women. Most if not all decisions men make revolve around them, consciously or not. But women are selective. The fact is, women don't want men who are emotionally expressive, soft, and bookish. Women don't want men who are socially meek and harmless. On the contrary, women love socially dominant, boisterous, hard-bodied, arrogant and violent on occasion, even, men. They love men who drive big ass lifted trucks (or Beemers, insert social class here) and repress their emotions to be always stoic or angry. Women: If you want men to express themselves, don't ditch them at the first sign of vulnerability or insecurity. Men: The quickest way to watch a woman's attraction to you disappear is to be open and honest with them about your feelings. Men know this. Its been my experience that if women say they like one thing about men, the opposite is true. That goes double for women on Reddit. If you want to fix toxic masculinity, start with women.

There is no way the idea pans out. If his origins were mythical (Thor) it would make more sense. However The amount of force he uses is not possible. The official wiki says the shield weighs 12 pounds. But this would not do. The amount of carnage he creates, especially while throwing it, isnt possible with such a light shield. Someone could catch it without too much trouble, and it would have a negligible offensive effect compared to a run of the mill shield. It has to be at least as heavy as steel to create the carnage he creates. His shield weighs 12 pounds supposedly (Fandom) And travels 43.6 miles an hour (wired). This means the shield puts out 523 pound of force. Sounds like a lot, but its actually not. The best Flyweight boxers produce that much force in a punch, which boxers take dozens of in one fight. Movie clips show him knocking back full grown men several feet by throwing his shield. One scene shows his shield breaking through glass, then embedding itself in a steel wall. To punch a hole in 22 gauge steel, (I figure a weak gauge is fair considering the shield is curved and how long the cut is) you need a little more than 2 tons per square inch, CA produces one quarter that. The shield would need to be much heavier, if he has super human strength, he can only get an object moving so fast, but heavier objects at comparable speeds because of his strength. His shield would have to be much heavier. Im talking manhole cover heavy. (250 pounds) The force required To throw a 200 pound person 10 feet (which he does) is enormous. Even assuming hes strong enough to throw it as hard as he does, he wouldnt be able to sustain his balance in any capacity, remember he is subject to the same amount of force as the person on the other end. The problems with the shield only scratch the surface. What about his astonishing vulnerability? A shield with only a 2.5 foot diameter isnt really that protective, medieval shields were often well over double that size. We see him taking down 15 soldiers all at once. In reality, he would just be shot by someone where his shield didnt protect. His legs, arm, head, and entire back are exposed. And dont give me that super reflexes stuff. It takes 150 milliseconds for an image to travel from the retina to the brain. Not fast enough for him to dodge bullets. He is too vulnerable to be considered a super hero. This, along with his weak sauce shield, is just too much for captain America to be an effective fighting force much at all. Sure, he has the advantage of an indestructible shield, albeit a puny one, and super strength, but hes not bulletproof. If hes not bulletproof hes just as vulnerable as some rando with a riot shield. (PS you can still have a good captain America story, but his abilities need to be lowered significantly (no shield throwing) and he cant be considered on the same level as the hulk or iron man, and especially Thor.)"

Most common people are probably not even effected by common vulnerabilities I think. Add to that, developers don't bother putting decent changelogs. Telling ""Improved stability and security"" does not help. OS updates are hard to undo. With updates, there are always risks of something breaking. For phones, maybe slower performance, battery drain or something else. For Windows, with so many devices, there is history of things breaking but they still force the updates unless you have professional version and do tweaks to disable it. For iOS, what if I don't care about Apple pay or podcast or what not? On Android, do I even need monthly security updates?

Still, i dont think this should be systematic (see list below). Sorry for my english, i will use the term  child  as  offspring , and not to refer to little kid. Parents of minors or young adults who have committed serious offences or crime, are partially responsible for the harms done by their children. For example, if a 17-year-old kill, participates in a robbery, or rape someone, they reflect the way they were educated and must be punished by the legal system And they parents too, for neglect by lack of parental duty. A normal/healthy educated person should not rape or kill (I dont include, legitimate defense in this). These behaviours are harmful to society. And parents need to understand that, if they fail on their basic role as educators, they will have to face consequences, since they too will be responsible for the wrongdoings committed. Choosing to have children should be accompanied by a duty to bear the consequences of their worst actions If you have engender and educated a criminal, you have failed as parents and must pay (along with your child) for the damage that your education causes to others/society. possible exception: \-Mental disorder or sociopathy of the child \-if the parent denies and disinherits the child, thereby expressing their desire to dissociate themselves, from the child's actions. (since they consider then, that they dont have one anymore). \-parents who are too old or ill to be taken over by the prison system. \-proven mental illness or vulnerability of the parents that would prevent them from having done their educators duty."

I found it to be indulgent, meandering, and suffering from characters who were massively underdeveloped (Sharon Tate) or one character in specific to be lacking in any type of flaw and that would be Brad Pitt's character, whatever the fuck his name was. Everything goes right for this character. He gets away with murdering his wife, he can hold his own in a fight against Bruce Lee, he shows no fucks given at losing his job at the movie studio, he's persuasive enough to get what he wants when talking to a creepy redhead hippie, he beats up another hippie just moments later without breaking a sweat, he's doing a whole bunch of perfect flips and acrobatics to get on a roof, and the entire climax is him effortlessly beating the shit out of the Sharon Tate killers. He's the male version of a Mary Sue, a Gary Sue. He's perfect, everything goes his way, he never has that moment of weakness or vulnerability, and it simply makes him a boring character whom you can't relate to. And guess how many people I've seen speak out against it? Zero. I've yet to see one other person point out the weak writing in this character and it's just proof that the flaw of writing a perfect character is reserved for women. Rey in Star Wars has gotten nothing but shit for being a Mary Sue (I personally disagree with those arguments) but there's nothing for pretty boy in ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood."" Apparently if a female character shows any signs of being perfect, she's a Mary Sue, but if it happens to a male character, he's well-received as an ""escapist character"" as I've seen some people call him, for reasons relating to this sick gender bias in society that has gone virtually unnoticed."

If I wasn't in relationships where women took advantage of vulnerability, I'd keep my mouth shut. Never have I wanted to punch certain people in the face so much. Let's take someone, make or female and let's say they have a normal life. Family, friends, don't know what abandonment is because they are well liked, ect. Well, they find a mate, someone attractive or attracted to. They get into a relationship but constantly are fighting with each other. The fighting becomes physical. Someone or both are the victim. No. None of you are the vics. You purposely thought with your genitals, misinterpreted for an emotional feeling, let the grow into what ever, and realized you and this person don't get along at all due to having shit in common. That never goes over so well. Now let's take someone that falls into a very abusive relationship. Not just fighting but someone who puts the fear in you. Fucking leave. If you're scared they are going to kill you if you leave guess what? They're going to kill you if you stay. Why give them the satisfaction? Know what I hear? ""But I love them."" Then shut the hell up and stop trying to say your a victim. You're justifying shit actions with shit thinking. You're not a vic.

Gloating about views, always seemed like he was rubbing it into his viewers face. Disgusting behavior. People are it up too. Not too long after some drama pops off and he makes an advertised video of how he was abused by this person. He cried. I was sick, and offended. As someone who suffers from PTSD from years of abuse who the fuck was this guy to say how bad his life was? Or say he was victimized because he was thinking of views and his dick? I called him out publicly and got the response ""You lack any compassion."" When it comes to people like him. Yup. Don't throw your wealth, success, personal life in other people's faces.

I feel like it is still common practice in many of today's societies to give men status, power, responsibility and importance, but not view them as human beings capable of love, friendship and closeness as well as mistakes, learning and growth. There are still a lot of harmful stereotypes and ideas in circulation leading even younger generations to close themselves off and develop a tough shell at an early point in life because there seems to be an outspoken or unspoken rule that unless you appear invincible, strong and straight as fuck, you are not likable as a man and you've lost your right to be taken seriously by other men, even up to the point of punishment by harassment or violence. Or you try to turn to people who claim not to support such stereotypes, but some, although less, of them, too, hold this idea that all you are is a monster that's after power over other people and is incapable of empathy. We all influence one another, and sometimes it can be harmful behaviours that we uphold despite them not really feeling right to any of us. Some of us are trying to live our lives differently, more open to connection and compassion, but it can be painful when these harmful ideas about men being some kinds of brutish monsters that are somehow essentially dumb, ugly and exploitative are super pervasive and accepted. I feel like it is necessary to reiterate that men are as much in need of love, care and affection as anyone else, and that they're allowed to show affection, vulnerability and openness to others, also to one another, without shame or punishment and without being predators. Men are not some kinds of inhuman monsters that can exist without love and creativity or expression in their lives, but we are often treated like we're supposed to, and that can become our self-image unless we work to counter it. It can feel like we are forced to play this role of being expendable and necessary only for work, sex and productivity, and nothing else. But it's not true. It's just not. We have hearts and desires and feelings, fears and weaknesses, we can be hurt and it is okay. It's more than okay, it is good that we are vulnerable and open and human and that we have all these wonderful aspects of who we are. Just because we may have been perhaps cruelly rejected in the past doesn't mean we should shut down our feelings and how we are when we're really honest. There is no money, no status and no power over other people that can buy me back the feeling of real self-acceptance and authentic human connection, and forfeiting myself in return for a false sense of ""belonging"" with others by way of adapting to a role is only harmful to me. For this purpose I need to know a few things. First of all: It's fine to have a body that is not the instagram-ideal, not the kind seen on the covers of magazines, not the type that you see in some movies. It's still a good, beautiful body. And yes, it can be flawed, you can struggle with it. It's still worthy of acceptance. Second, I don't need to push myself to do or want anything you don't feel you want. If it doesn't feel good, don't do it. This also, or especially, goes for sex. How often do I hear from guys that they feel pressured to act sexual but are really uncomfortable with it? A lot. Respect yourself and it will greatly improve your life and relationships. Men, too, deserve this."

This is immoral because it means these people are just looking for self-validation in many cases. They want to know their value and how they help people and clearly see this in a broken person. 2. Women particularly find vulnerability attractive and like men with a chip on their shoulders. When every guy is trying to be bravado, to see a man who struggles with his past is attractive to women.

An emotional affair is sometimes referred to as an affair of the heart. An emotional affair may emerge from a friendship, and progress toward greater levels of personal intimacy and attachment. What distinguishes an emotional affair from a friendship is the assumption of emotional roles between the two participants that mimic of those of an actual relationship - with regards to confiding personal information and turning to the other person during moments of vulnerability or need. Given the above excerpt it seems to me that while people can get as close to each other as they would in a relationship, without the physical side it's simply two people that get along very well being able to be so open with each other that they can share their pains and problems. When did having someone else to confide in become cheating? Yes the argument can of course be made that ""if you can't confide in your partner then what's the point of being with them?"" but sometimes it's not so black and white and sometimes you need another voice and another opinion to help you through your dark times.

I know its an unpopular opinion. I should note that I am not talking about therapy. Finding a good therapist can be hard, but it has been life changing in my case. But suicide crisis lines and 3 day psych holds are garbage. There is absolutely no evidence base for them, no peer reviewed studies, nothing at all proving such lines do any good whatsoever. I would like to have some proof one way or the other, but there is literally no study done on the efficacy or effectiveness of such lines for their stated purpose of reducing suicide. Anecdotally I have been screamed at, told I was playing the victim, told to call a friend and hung up on when I told them I did not have one, laughed at openly, told I was not suicidal and it was all manipulation, and had the cops called on me. This was the one side, a few were super kind, but far more were not. And the vast bulk sounded like unhappy, tired people reading from a script, about as much empathy as a toaster, except most toasters have a dial to make it warmer. Suicidal thoughts are one of the most difficult, complex, emotionally draining things actual therapists deal with. It is recommended that they don't deal with it unless they have extra training and good supervision. But apparently essentially untrained volunteers is fine in this case. And inpatient psychiatric care is if anything worse. The suicide rate for people who have been discharged from a hospital is 3 times as high as the general population immediately after leaving. URL And the number of people who commit suicide well actually inside a psych ward is much, much higher than the general population. 6 percent of all of the suicides in the united states, 1600 out of 35,000 in the United States in 2012, were committed well the person was a patient in a psych ward. URL Now I know correlation is not causation. But unless we have evidence otherwise, which we do not here, correlation can be causation, lots of things that are correlated turn out to be causal relationships in the end. And it sounds a lot like psych wards are wildly more dangerous than regular society, at least in terms of suicide. How much we are actually spending on this seems relevant. The National Institute of health, the chief agency in the United States tasked with dealing with suicide, under the guidance of the US Department of Health, spent 35 million in 2017 on suicide prevention, almost precisely the same amount they spent on eczema research. And it sounds like we have as a society been clinging desperately to this policy of crisis lines. URL Again the issue of correlation versus causation comes up. But it should be noted that the number of crisis lines has only gone up since such programs were started 50 years ago, and the suicide rate has only climbed. As I say in 2012 it was 35,000 Americans. In 2017 it was 45,000. Last year it was 47,000 Americans. This seems obvious to me that the public and through them the government do not care even a little about suicide. Spend nothing to fix the system. Don't even study to see if the solution works. Because it doesn't matter if it works. The point is not to help people, the point is for society to be able to pay lip service to the idea of helping people. You see the direct form of that on social media all the time. A person tells their story, their sadness and anger and real life struggles, pours their heart out. And their met with copypasta about the fact crisis lines exist, simply that their a thing. Any anecdotal stories about someone being saved are about as valuable as my personal anecdotes, for every kind worker who may have talked someone down there is another one who may well have made someone feel so bad they went through with it. Therapy, good therapy with a good alliance, can actually help. Trying to eat better, exercise, getting into nature, getting a pet, these can help. Spirituality, church, volunteering, these can all help. People should be more empathetic and kind, and if they get to a point where they can't they should be a hell of a lot more gentle in telling them to get professional help often. But what I see is people who normally may have felt a moral drive to speak to someone who is suicidal can now throw a crisis line number at them. The best comparison I have seen is a local youth shelter for younger people 25 and under was built in my town. The number of homeless tripled overnight. Parents who would not see their kids in the street now felt little compunction throwing them onto the tender mercies of the municipality. I honestly don't get it. Actual suicidal people at best give mixed reviews, and are often antagonistic towards such lines and psych wards. There is not a lick of evidence they decrease suicide, and there is evidence that the suicide rate has only climbed well they have been in use. If there is another explanation besides people want others to fuck off with their personal problems I cannot figure out what it may be. It seems that the system was designed to help acute suicide risk. The evidence is in on that subject, lots of study, the acute risk patient who becomes suicidal out of the blue, and then ceases to be suicidal with a bit of treatment, is more of a myth than a real thing. Chronic suicidality, something that has been an ongoing issue internally or in actions since childhood or adolescence, that is what the vast, vast bulk of suicidal people are dealing with. The system was never designed for this, and what little they learned about how to help is impossible with resources designed for rare acute cases. I guess my point is this. People say its better than nothing, but is it?. If we had no system rather than a broken system we as a society may be forced to find solutions for the real suicidal people that actually exist, rather than theoretical suicidal people who pull it all together in days or weeks, which largely does not exist. A ""solution"" that does nothing to help and may actually make things worse is not the societal equivalent of medication for the problem, it is the societal equivalent of doing drugs, just masking the issue. I feel incredible sympathy, empathy, and care for people who are suicidal, I really do get it, and I want nothing more than for them to get help. But I just can't see how this is helping, even a little."

When sociophob is alone, he can think really highly about himself. A clash with people threatens his self esteem with unflattering doubts about himself. As a result, it's easier to keep hiding at home. Fear of the scene, new acquaintances and unusual conditions - all this is avoidance of checking your arrogance in action and in reality. And the more compact life is, the easier it is to think of yourself as someone special. The root of uncertainty is an unsustainable opinion about yourself and your real qualities. Shaky self-esteem, made up to fall to low ratings, is the main cause of vulnerability and subsequent cramped life, where it is only possible to retain a sense of self-importance. Sociophobia is cured by self-knowledge with the help of sensitive introspection and live communication, when one encounters fear face to face."

I am a legal immigrant now citizen originally entered on a humanitarian visa because my parents were in military/politics. I have family from different nations, and a strong multicultural background. Im not against legal immigration, and I dont hold hatred for anyone, however I think this is becoming a major problem worldwide. There are specific cases of course but generally this is a legit problem. I understand no one wants to be in tough or traumatic situations and seeking asylum makes complete sense when your own country has failed you, but many are abusing refugee rights when they enter into a new country, and crime rate goes up drastically. In my nations refugees are protected more than local citizens, and their culture is usually held to a higher standard, and they get excused for numerous incidents that a local can be criminalized for. Everyone is too afraid to offend them, and many people in the USA for example, blindly accept refugees or the general idea/concept without understanding the true impact. Many havent traveled outside of their county before, or have and went to very touristy places, do not know about linguistic or cultural factors from other nations outside out outdated and bias historical classes from public education, and dont have a true understanding of what the real world is like. This leads to vulnerability of locals being taken advantage of by an influx of refugees. Look at Gypsies, terrorists, criminals, and illegals. These impacts are not okay, this ruins a country. A culture can be lost and most citizens are expected to conform and cater to the refugees that enter the country. Many refugees dont come with valuable skills to their new nation, and carry on their racist mindsets, dont attempt to learn a new language, and milk the system for support. Many of them have multiple children to gain more financial support that they wouldnt have in their home nation. The refugee crisis is a very real thing, there are of course specific situations where seeking asylum has led to a positive impact, however generally there is a negative heavy impact on the society that they integrate into. Many refugees are being taken in as an obligation, and mandatory acceptance because I think people are afraid of being offensive. But there are instances where its completely okay to say no, no more, or not at all. You can say these things without being racist, xenophobic, or heartless. A significant amount of refugees dont have adequate education, do not continue or attempt to gain more education when relocating, are illiterate, are not qualified for societal contribution. They only know their limited way of life and traditions, and usually cause extreme societal, cultural, economical, and environmental impacts that can reach a long lasting magnitude of devastation. I have seen my own home country become ruined from a political power play gain of refugees, and is now known for being the import/export of illegal activity. The local women are losing their rights, respect, and independence because of radical ideals and extremist attitudes brought in from surrounding countries refugees, and political almost dictatorship in support of these refugees as they cater to the extremist views and policies being brought on by the political power as it better reflects their home nations, and not the county that I once called my home. My country of origin is not the only country suffering from this impact, Canada, USA, and many European Nations are also being drastically impacted by the refugee crisis. The whole world does not have to be a melting pot, and citizens have the right to be angry about this and have personal opinions/views regarding the matter even if they conflict what is deemed right. in a humanitarian aspect. Many public services are underfunded in numerous nations, local sick or disabled are not able to be supported financially or economically, job positions can be limited to locals already, and local citizens needs are neglected at the expense of completely supporting refugees who enter the country. Many refugees DEMAND true entitlement, compassion, sympathy, financial support, free passes, and freedom to be exempt from legal criminalization for cultural reasons. There are numerous cases of child rape, women rape, verbal and physical abuse from refugees to local women/children, and parasitic behavior from many refugees. Not all refugees are angelic victims of political or economic factors, and even if they are they do not deserve this form of entitlement and justification for their poor actions and views. Even the non aggressive refugee populations still hold many entitled views, demands, and still want to glorify their cultural origin that abandoned them or that they abandoned, while simultaneously denouncing and demeaning the new nation/culture that so nicely accepted them as non contributing members of society. Its odd that they have such praise for their home nation that they ESCAPED from. Many even claim that only women from their country are clean and worthy, and that all other women are dirty and corrupt: yet they attempt to rape or harass women from different backgrounds not like their own. Locals are being criminalized, ridiculed, arrested, ostracized, punished, and penalized for being against refugees or standing up for themselves when a refugee acts in criminal or immoral behavior. Local women, children, veterans, disabled, sick, youth, and elderly are neglected in order for complete support to be provided for refugees and it is disgusting. Refugee camps are not paradise but should be a continued option for those who seek asylum because if their home nation is THAT bad then the camps should be a safe haven for them. The camps should be able to equip them with valuable skills BEFORE they are allowed to integrate into a new society. There should be briefing and training about the cultural, economical, moral, and society responsibilities they have in their new society beforehand. Open borders is not an economical stable option. Look at what is happening to Germany, France, America, UK, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, etc) The UN is failing us. This is terrifying. This is not okay. *Refugees or war are usually decent moral human beings who generally seek a safe haven and attempt to contribute and integrate into their new society. But OTHER refugees do not have this mindset or morality. I am exempting refugees of war from my personal opinion."

It was discovered there was a much higher association between marijuana and alcohol use than between marijuana and other substances, one that was still relatively insignificant by measure. Researchers concluded there was no scientific link between hard drugs and marijuana other than *patterns* determined by social factors. It also does not directly lead to addiction or dependency on harder drugs. Addiction is typically born out of an individuals attempt to fill a void in their life. Ex. poor mental health, vulnerability and dependency factors will often stem from a persons suffering emotional health/life circumstances, which then snowballs into a physical dependency."

If a motorcyclist is injured in an accident that would not have injured a car driver, there should be no extra stigma or shame applied to the driver of the car. Anyone buying and riding a motorcycle is subjecting themselves to increased vulnerability. I dont want to give them extra room in a lane or when passing, nor do I want to be shamed for treating them according to the same rules I follow with fellow car drivers.

Alien was a gothic horror masterpiece. Ridley Scott and Giger created a truly horrific mythos and didnt explain anything. It kept us on our toes and delivered a dark interesting fresh take on scifi horror. Its themes and undertones are truly terrifying. It alludes to things like sexual assault (when Ash tries to shove a rolled up magazine down Ripleys throat) or rape (when the Alien kills Lambert, it slides its sharp tail up behind her leg, then we hear a rhythmic groan as shes being killed) the alien itself is very phallic and so is the fact that it erupts from Kanes chest. The poetry of how Ripley kills it by blasting it through its chest with a harpoon, as if in vengeance for the way it killed her crew. They were completely vulnerable, no guns or weapons, just improvised tools. Amazing movie. Then we get to Aliens. It was an attempt to turn Alien into an action movie. It effectively turned to terrifying Xenomorph into a bug, an ant hill. They made them dangerous but killable. One xenomorph in alien hid and took out nearly everyone. In Aliens, there are hundreds and they kill all the stupid people who are shooting them. The queen is another bastardization, Ridley Scott intended for the Alien to be able to convert its victims into eggs as we see in the directors cut of Alien. We also get this whole love interest bullshit and Ripleys mother leopard bullshit. It was entertaining but it destroys what Alien built. Lame. Then theres Alien 3. Here we return to the roots. Gothic horror? Check! No weapons and lots of vulnerability? Check! One single Xenomorph? Check! Gnarliest chestburster scene ever made? Check! Lonely, grimy, scary as fuck? Check! People are mad because newt and hicks get killed off instantly, Im like yeah, good. Those characters fucking suck. The girl is annoying and the guy is a dumbass. All they bring is a reason for Ripley to go into danger and guns, both of which weve seen. Now lets see her *escape* a *prison* full of *rapists* and *murderers* and all men. Thats fucking horrifying. It doesnt have much eye candy, but if thats why you like the franchise then youre watching for the wrong reasons. It was a movie that would make Giger proud. And David Fincher goes on to make Se7en and Fight Club. James Cameron does Avatar Alita. I like Terminator and T2, so i admit hes a good film maker. But he knows fuck all about horror, and his fans are exactly the same."

Big purses, and multiple purses. Jewelry. Skirts of any sort. Clothes that are not practical for any weather. Shoes that don't protect their feet such as sandals or very thin flats. Women wear clothes that cripple them so that they cannot walk significant distances or lift any sort of weight. And then women have this bizarre tendency to be proud of this, like saying that Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did backwards in high heels. That's not something to be proud of! And I'm not saying that women shouldn't try to be pretty or shouldn't wear proper support of some kind for their breasts, just that women should refuse to wear clothing that cripples them every single day of their lives. &amp;#x200B; Feminist women tend to treat the wearing of crippling attire as a right that females have because to not wear crippling clothing would be to admit defeat against rapists somehow. And then beyond clothing there are the stick-on eyelashes, the stick on fingernails, additional hair (weaves, wigs, and whatever else), that make women have difficulties even in sedentary office environments. (Okay, the eyelashes and hair may not cause real physical problems, but they are financially crippling. They might prevent women from being able to go about freely in the rain or humidity but I'm just suggesting that since I don't know enough about wigs, weaves, or false eyelashes to say so for certain.) These forms of crippling attire are things that men (who are not cross-dressers, or in costume) just plain don't have to deal with. And why? It's not like we usually can't tell a man from a woman without these things. Because vulnerability is appealing even when it's something that somebody has done to themselves? I suppose there's more than one answer but it really hurts any statements out there about how a healthy woman is an attractive woman. Or maybe it's like if you can't be healthy be a self-imposed cripple because that shows that a girl is willing to put forth a lot of effort into getting a man? Unless women really, really do this to intimidate other women, which I think is a distinct possibility."

This is particularly evident with women as I feel they enjoy shaming and undermining anyone who ever disagrees with them on anything, but men are guilty of taking advantage of people apologising to them as well. Apologies hold no value if the person doesnt execute some degree of revenge to you, and thats why I feel in this modern overpopulated day, its better to simply brush off someone and avoid them than to allow them to traumatise you or anger you in some way or the other, there are billions of people on earth, no ones special enough to be worth an apology."

This scenario is not nearly as traumatic, as the one described in the title. A friend from a bad neighborhood told me, that a girl had kicked a boy in his class because she was pissed (I don't know why), and that because of his extremely agonized reaction, with an hour of convulsions, gagging, coughing, crying, etc, and because he behaved ""like his spirit was broken"" ever since that incident, he believes that this boy lost a testicle from this attack. He said even watching it happen traumatized him. Hell, even hearing the story gave me an anxiety attack. This is the most vulnerable, precious, private, holy part of a guy's body, and literally what makes him a man. Something that he looks at and touches every day and that, for him, is the incorporation of his vulnerability and manhood. The pain alone must have been traumatizing, let alone having that part exploited and destroyed by a member of the opposite sex. Seeing it turn black and blue and swell up the size of a grapefruit, having it removed - all of this sounds far more horrifying to me, than the thought of being anally raped by a huge, disgusting man with a huge cock, pardon my french. At the same time, I do not believe that the girl who did it, is ""as bad"" as a rapist. All I'm saying is, it must be at least as horrible as rape to that boy, if it can ""break his spirit"". It seems that the girl faces no repercussions at all, not from the school, and not legally, because the boy won't sue her. Probably to protect his ""secret"".

So many women are left defenseless in violent altercations due to biology and end up being brutally victimized. The only way to equalize the biological unfairness would be to arm every woman with a gun. NO man is ever allowed to get near a gun. A man with a gun will commit school shootings or other atrocities with it due to their vulnerability to severe mental illnesses and tendency to externalize their problems. A woman going hiking alone then gets confronted by a violent man? He gets shot and killed on the spot. The woman suffers no legal consequences whatsoever because it was in self defense.

Maybe my definition of ""toxic Masculinity"" is flawed, but blame that on all of the radical feminists who told me everything from Iron Man to wrestling is ""toxic"". I am sick of the forced standards that are supposed to tell me how I should live, what I should do, and how I should respond to everything. Also, I hate how homophobia and misogyny are automatically listed as ""toxic masculinity"", like women are super tolerant of gay people. Also, misogyny has never been considered inherently masculine; how many of us were taught that being a man involves kicking a woman's ass? &amp;#x200B; Stopping misogyny is one thing, but trying to tell me how I should live my life and respond to people is entirely different. Firstly, I do not cry, I won't cry in front of people, I will not express my deep emotional states in front of people, and I will not show excessive vulnerability. It makes me extremely uncomfortable, I see it as a sign of weakness within myself, and I was not raised to emotionally expose myself to the world at large. Why does the world need to see me cry or express excessive emotion? Sucking it up helps me get through shit because breaking down over it won't fix a damned thing. I don't think most of these feminists have actually thought about the fact that maybe not crying is how some people deal with crap that is entering their lives. Plus, I have had weak moments, and every single time I have ever had one, what came of it was far worse than if I had simply sucked it up in the first place. My emotions are not for the world at large, and leave me alone about it. &amp;#x200B; Second, if I get angry over some bullshit, I have the right to be that way, and stay that way. People get offended at the idea that men are aggressive, and some of us get fighting mad over stuff? Listen, I don't think violence or anger is always the answer... but when I get violent or angry, it is for a good reason in my head. No one is going to tell me that I shouldn't respond with anger because it is ""toxic"". That anger is what I feel most comfortable. I fight, argue, get mad, yell, talk intensely, and do shit. The minute a guy gets angry, the whole world is supposed to be messed up, but I don't see anyone addressing females with equally messed up attitudes (because it is ok of course if women engage in toxic masculinity behaviors). Everyone wants guys to be softer and more emotive while being less aggressive, but for a lot of us, it is not in our nature, and we wouldn't change it. I won't stop fighting back in the face on injustices simply because someone else wants a softer, easier to control human punching bag. &amp;#x200B; Next, regarding teaching boys how to be men: STOP with the chastising about what men teach boys. Women have no idea what it is like to stand in our shoes, yet too many of them want to talk down to us about what we choose to teach our boys. First off, we teach boys to whine excessively because whining gets you nowhere in life. Hell, even girl children shouldn't whine excessively about life because of how unfair life naturally is. Second, we will teach boys the gender roles that we have, and we will not slow down with it. Teaching boys to stand up, take charge, be leaders, and to try their best to be their best is nothing short of amazing. Encouraging boys to be great things is also not going to change; I want my hypothetical daughter and son to be great people with great careers. Also, if I pass down my martial arts, weight lifting, and other ""manly"" activities (they are not even uniquely manly. They are good life skills often associated with manhood that are still great to have), I will do so. If I don't want my son putting lipstick on, wearing dresses, and acting prissy, I will teach him not to because that is not what men do. Women do that to increase their feminine beauty, and my son has feminine beauty to worry about as a kid. &amp;#x200B; In regards to emasculation, that is what teaching boys to stand up is for. If someone tries to emasculate you, you emasculate him or her (kind of like men have to in face of radical feminism). The world will be harsh on you, kids are mean, people do mean things, and no one wants to be picked on... but there are two sides to this. On one end, boys should not be made fun of if they aren't ultra macho tough guys, but on the other end, why shouldn't we encourage each other to man up sometimes? People see what we say to each other as bullying, but sometimes, what we say to each other needs to be heard. Telling someone to man up doesn't necessarily always mean ""stop being girly"", sometimes it means to put your foot down and stop being a victim. Sometimes it means pull yourself together. Sometimes, it means stop allowing the world to run over you. We don't constantly bully each other... Plus, being a victim feels worse than standing up does. I also see that men ""never let themselves be victims"", but who the FUCK wants to be a victim? Why should I, or anyone else, mentally submit to this planet, society, or people? What do I get out of embracing a victim mentality? Hell, I am black. A victim mentality means that I will leave in a perpetual state of defeat and misery if I give in to a victim mentality. Refusing to be a victim is how you get shit to change. &amp;#x200B; Lastly, I hear all about how our body image issues, what we like to do, and our fiction is toxic masculinity. First of all, everyone has body image issues, and you either have two choices: get over it or change it. As a person who was formerly skinny, I hated to look in mirrors, so I decided to work out and diet right until I looked up one day to find myself diesel. You can accept who you are, but that is not supposed to stop you from changing what you don't like. I'll be damned if we can live in a world where people can switch genders and are encouraged, but anyone who wishes to be built like Thor has to be shamed for that... when in fact, it is far easier and more likely that someone out of shape could easily get in shape. Next, my wrestling, martial arts, comics, and violent video games have defined a large part of my life (I want to be as strong as Batman), and they keep me entertained. All of these things are cultural, and the masculine images they produce are entertaining. who cars if they are all rooted in some kind of violence? The stuff is fun, it doesn't make a bad person, the masculine imagery has inspired tons of people to do all sorts of things, and I THOUGHT these kind of things transcended masculine-feminine borders due to all the women who like these thing and get inspired by them too. Also, little boys being rough and play fighting is fun for them, and it was fun for me when I was little. I don't know why some people want to scrutinize little boys for normal activities (activities girls also engage in if given the opportunity), but little kids like to run around, have fun, wrestle, and do other things. Fucking with kids over a bunch of identity politics they don't understand is wrong. &amp;#x200B; Lastly, our fiction is not realistic because not everyone in real life looks like supermodels, and the guy doesn't get the girl most times... but hey, that is why it's fantasy, right? You can self insert and enjoy the fantasy, that is large goal of story telling, and if some women want women to be the main character in this, it is possible to do so in the exact same way for men. I don't see why our enjoyment and storytelling has to change so much when all you have to do is appeal to the female ego like the male one to create stories that are just as fun. Boys want to be the manly man that beats up the bad guy and pulls the girl. Why not just make something about an awesome woman who beats up the bad guy and pulls the boy if it such a big deal? Instead, we are starting to get more of the atypical Steven Universe-esque bullshit that is aimed at girls. Not only that, but everything is being tamed down from appearances to storytelling in order to step away from the ""male fantasy"", because of course ""She-Ra"" looking like a woman and not being gay was simply for little boys to get off to and not something good for little girls to idolize. It is almost as if these radical feminists want everyone to be out of shape, soft, ultra compliant, and unable to speak up for themselves. Scaling down fantasy elements to insert identity politics in kids who just want to see an adventure is borderline evil. &amp;#x200B; The truth is, I believe that is okay for men to show emotions. I believe it is okay for an adult man to paint nails, wear dresses, and do whatever. I believe it is okay to be soft... I believe it is okay to be who you WANT to be, something anti-""toxic masculinity"" people don't care about. They want to force a large amount of men to be away from what they are comfortable with to satisfy their personal agendas/vendettas. I also believe it is okay to raise children to stand up for themselves, and to engage in gender specific behaviors. If my son grows up to want to put on skinny jeans, paint nails, and talk about men, I can't stop him. However, I am not going to raise him with those things. I am going to raise him as a regular man, and if one day he chooses to be a different kind of man, that is on him, but I will not purposefully indoctrinate him on something most men aren't naturally inclined towards. I am not going to beat down anyone's door to tell them how to raise their kid, so don't come near mine. Also, for anyone who thinks that I don't know what toxic masculinity is, blame the people who taught me with their words and actions. If you want to narrow the scope of the definition of toxic masculinity, some of you need to take steps to make sure it gets narrowed. Boys will be boys, and there is nothing wrong with that."

Your vulnerability, your manhood, and exploiting it is a joke, especially if a female does it, because she's so innocent and precious, and you're a joke and deserve it, because males are so fucking terrible and oppress females. &amp;#x200B; GOOD fucking messages to send to a little boy. &amp;#x200B; Someone explain to me, how kicking guys in the balls, which regularly makes boys and mens testicles fucking explode and be removed, (boys in kindergarten, elementary, middle school, etc, all the way up to grown men) is any more appropriate than showing comedic, non-mutual, male-on-female violence, that is directed at their genitals, in movies and shows for CHILDREN, who don't know any better? &amp;#x200B; Grown men fall into depression and can't feel manly, after losing a testicle to cancer. Imagine a BOY loses one, but from a KICK, in an environment that should be safe, from a member of the OPPOSITE SEX (yes, I DO believe that makes a difference), and people think it's hilarious that he collapses, groin kicks are joked about everywhere, and if HE so much as SLAPPED the girl for it, he'd be a worthless piece of shit, while constantly having to listen to how men and boys are terrible violent monsters, who oppress wonderful, lovely precious girls and women. The girl of course would not NEARLY be blamed as much as a boy, who so much as groped a girl, let alone mutilated her genitals for ""fun"" or because she ""deserved it"". Think how fucking traumatic that must be for a little boy."

In fact, Obi doesn't even Luke about the holy war between the Jedi and the Sith. Obi becomes Luke mentor and lets Vader kill himself in single combat. So he can hunt Luke and give luke more reason to kill Vader, oh, and he also told luke Vader murdered his father. Heres the real kicker Yoda and Obi only value Luke for his strength with force. When Luke rushed off to save his friends despite being warned not to probably because the Jedi don't value the lives of his friends Obi says he's our last hope. Yoda replies no there is another had Luke died they would have just turned his sister into a killer. When Luke finds out Vader is his father he confronts Obi, and you could tell Obi was disappointed because patricide is a tough sell.

I go to a pretty popular party college and I work in a part of the university where I've seen a handful of these situations and heard about a lot more. What I mean when I say victim blaming is when talking about sexual assault type situations and how to avoid them, mostly with new students and other university staff member. Almost all of the situations I have seen firsthand or heard about, the victims could have avoided it by following common sense party advice. Things like, don't go to the 'rape-y' frat's parties, always have a buddy or friends with you, know your limits with alcohol, or don't mix drugs and alcohol. When this stuff gets brought up, I hear lots of people say ""let's be careful not to blame victims."" But if analyzing an assault and finding the things the victim failed to do to prevent the event is 'victim blaming,' then we need to be victim blaming. I'm not saying we should go around telling rape victims what they did wrong, but telling other people what to do and not to do is certainly not a bad thing. Going out without friends or leaving your friends at parties doesn't usually end well. Going to a party of a frat that's well known to be 'rape-y' is like going to the south side of Chicago and expecting only positive interactions. Mixing drugs and alcohol outside of a safe setting (especially with the addition of some of these other variables) rarely has good outcomes. Of course doing these things didn't *cause* an assault, but they certainly increased the victim's vulnerability. In short, it is possible to both say it is not the victim's fault while also saying there were things the victim could have done to prevent it."

(not that the extreme pain of it wouldn't be reason enought to hit back) It's an exploitation of your greatest vulnerability, an attack on your manhood, your identity, and it reveals your struggle to live up to the expectations of society to be a man, to be invulnerable and strong (which is a lot of pressure and causes a lot of hurt for boys) as futile, by attacking the physical manifestation of what you were sacrificing your vulnerability for, your manhood. And even though you have been revealed to be vulnerable, and that vulnerability has been exploited, you don't get sympathy, your attacker no disdain, but you get laughed at. &amp;#x200B; And yes I believe it makes a difference whether another boy does it, or a girl. When a boy does it, it can be reciprocal, the pain is inherently shared. He isn't ignorant of what you're going through. There's no emphasis on gender, it doesn't shake the trust in the assailant's gender, it doesn't push you away from that gender, it doesn't attack you as a boy, because your gender is the same. You're not looking for love, gentleness, understanding, caring from another boy, but girls, which is why such a personal, gender-related, extremely painful attack aimed at your genitals, your manhood, your most vulnerable part, is especially painful, and potentially traumatic, when a girl does it. &amp;#x200B; There's also the thing that boys always get told that it's never ever ok to hit a girl, no matter if she hit you first, no matter what she did. That alone makes a boy feel like his life is worth less than girls'. The explanation as to why, is usually that it hurts a girl more, and a girl is more gentle. Obviously both not true, if she kicks you in the balls. Yet when she does it, she's still not as bad as you, if you hit her back for it. Again, makes you feel worthless. Why can she do that to him? &amp;#x200B; Whatever. Boys should be allowed to hit back girls who kick them in the balls, because the physical differences have been compensated for, given the nature of the attack. Plus, she really deserves it, if she does something terrible like that, just like boys deserve to be hit back, when they hurt someone this fucking much and in a way as such."

It's actually important to the scene. In contrast, it's heads exploding and spines being ripped off essential to mortal kombat? Sort of? It doesn't really show anything that is vital, so not really as well. Yet somehow this is kept because it's not hindering child growth. Give me a break. Persona 5 had the sexual abuse at the beginning of the game. But ultimately the game is just trying to show why it's bad, and it needs to build it up for you to hate that character. Yet this gets a bunch of news articles on why it's bad. Just stop leaking your stupid American SJW shit into Japanese games I love that used to have substance.

And don't get me wrong - I'm not one to get bored very easily in movies. I almost never have a problem with slow pacing because I am easily entertained. No - I lost interest because I couldn't invest myself in anything that was happening anymore. People try to claim that the high-number of deaths in the series is good - that it adds a real sense of stakes and danger. True - if I knew my favorite characters might actually die, it would make pivotal moments more intense for me. ...Normally. As my old pal, Syndrome, once said: ""When everyone's super, no one is."" Or in this case: ""When everything is high-stakes, nothing is."" I liked Ned stark and was surprised when he died. But that was okay because it produced the desired effect. Now I knew that anyone could die. I mean - at that point we already had 25 other notable characters die, but Ned was the biggest. ...And then, in-between dozens of other deaths, Khal Drogo died ...And then Robb Stark died At that point I began to get the feeling that *anyone* I invest myself in is going to die. Not that they *might* die, but that they *will.* What was even the point of Robb Stark's whole arc? Why show us his whole campaign if he was just going to die in some wedding? What did that add? I've tried hard to extract some kind of a message or theme from this show, but I can't find one. Maybe something attune to Nihilism - but no one every seems to hold to that viewpoint. Maybe they try to have themes of redemption... but then those characters just die anyway. Or they show themselves to still be terrible people. What's the point?? Movies and shows always try to give some kind of message, right? Or at least they have a *purpose.* Even comedy films have a purpose: to make you laugh. What is the purpose of GOT? To make you *depressed*? To show off how *bad* humanity can be? Honestly - if that's the purpose, then it doesn't matter how good it is. I doubt I could ever like it. Another example: Jon Snow dies. He gets revived. ""What did you see?"" ""Nothing. Nothing at all."" You would think this would be a good place to make a point about one's *own* sense of purpose. If there's no after life, what's the point? Is there *necessarily* not an afterlife just because *Jon* didn't see one? Does it matter? What does this mean for everyone? **apparently nothing.** No one seems to mention it ever again. Who cares. In trying to catch up with what's happening, I'm finding myself with similar feelings from before. Only now - I also hate half the characters for being perpetually full of themselves. These characters only seem to become more shallow and impersonable the more I see them - when the key to development is breaking a character down to a point of *vulnerability.* &amp;#x200B; Not to mention that this show goes to **stupid** lengths to find every excuse in the book to show nudity. Some people don't want that in the first place (especially since after learning the story, I can definitively say it's almost always unnecessary) but it's gotten to a point where it is honestly just disgusting. If I want to watch something for entertainment, I'd rather not be repulsed by it. Do we really gotta show the hound while he takes a whiz and talks with some people camping out? What is the point?

He would look hyper masculine and wear skin tight clothes that show off his HUGE bulge. Instead of blowing bubble gum and popping it, like Cassie Cage, he'd be carrying around a small bucket of pink flarp noise putty, which he would be constantly and furiously fingering, while lustingly licking his lips and eyeing the opponent like a piece of meat. His other attacks would contain several violent groping techniques directed at the opponents chest, (male and female alike, so it's totally equal) to which he would comically utter: ""Honk honk!"" over the opponents screams, anytime he performs them. All in all, his attacks should look like he is going out of his way to specifically target female genitalia, and to humiliate female opponents.

Yet women are saying that men can be emotional, that they should be emotional and be more emotionally open. Yet it is well known that what women say is not what they want in their subconscious mind. Basic women thinking and biology tells us that women want the best that's available, that they want a man who will not make more problems for her but to solve them, to be her support. To be strong, to be a MAN. Yet they are telling us that we can open up, and that we SHOULD, yet the things that happen after that show otherwise because as I said, what women say =/ what they actually want. With personal observation, personal experiences and talking with a lot of men both on the internet and in real life, I came to the conclusion that my situation is rather not unique at all. In fact, it happens to 90% of men. Not all women of course, but the amount of women contradicting that statement overshadows the very little amount of women who do like emotional men. Most girls say they love men opening up but don't actually mean it, if not unconscious then unconsciously because lots of relationships start to die once a guy shows his soft spot. Not saying that opening up was the sole trigger or anything, but you could always feel that instant shift in the relationship. Call it image, respect, sense of security, or whatever because it's hard to pin down. The effect was immediate and permanent even when it was really subtle. Part of the problem is also that men are told to open up more and more but they put themselves at risk when they do. And when they express that sense of risk, basically people tell them in detail exactly how they should open up differently to effectively balance the woman's experience. You have to moderate it carefully otherwise they get spooked and leave, which makes no point in opening up then. Subconsciously most women perceive weakness as an attraction killer even if they think they would be ok with it. Showing emotional vulnerability can increase connection and intimacy but displaying self-doubt, fear or weakness will make most women recoil instinctively from any romantic possibility. I know there will be people in this thread that will tell me their personal experiences tell me otherwise, but you are those 10%. For every guy telling me I'm wrong, there's 20 guys who will tell me I am right. There's a very good reason stoicism is praised, because it works 90% of the time. Such things would never be said and seen if there wasn't something going on that often. This might be a bit petty, but every time a woman was talking about how she loved when men opened up, there's that little part that seems repeating every time. ''My ex's, my ex-boyfriends''. They became ex's for a reason, maybe not exclusively because of the emotional opening because there are other reasons of course, but as I said in 90% of the cases it's because they opened up. Women are subconsciously wired to go for strong men and they want someone to lean on, not to get leaned on."

While on the other hand a lot of people totally ignore this fact. They tend to be mean and aggressive in their conversations. By aggressive I mean they leave us no chance, they give us the hardest looks and exclaim a lot which hurts us very much. We think about the smallest of the details, that makes us sick. I am not trying to pity us but we need to feel safe. I miss a lot of chances because of this shit. I was applying for a job and skipped the interview because I was literally terrified. I thought that I couldn't handle the situation I stayed in bed all day sorrowing over my vulnerability and the chance I missed. I only ask people to understand. I don't want to be judged upon my anxiety. I have potential and skills that qualify me for a lot things but I get rejected because the lack of social abilities. Btw none of the jobs I applied for were related to direct communication with society, they rejected me because I messed up the interview ignoring all the qualifications I have... It hurts when you are rejected from every job and every single social gathering because of something you don't have a control over. "

So are a guys balls. If they attack those, and especially if they think it's FUNNY, they don't deserve that special protection anymore. Because you can't lay moral claim to what you take from others, in this case, having your (gender-specific) vulnerability respected. The difference in strength and size is meaningless, when a girl kicks a boy in the balls, because a guy's size and strength doesn't protect him from that, and the girl doesn't NEED strength and size, in order to seriously hurt a guy there. It's fair game from then on out. It's the outcome that matters. And if the outcome is THE SAME, namely a person collapsing in pain, then HOW is it better, if that person is male, instead of female? How is the girl any more inccocent, than a boy who makes girls collapse in pain? How does she deserve any less punishment? How is she less despicable? Why does she deserve more protection? She proved not to be harmless, or gentle, or caring, nurturing, loving, compassionate, or non-violent. THOSE are the things that are supposed to make a girl deserving of special protection, not the mere fact that she has a vagina. And for the ones who like to twist shit: I hit back guys for FAR less. I'm still treating girls better than guys, even though they don't deserve it. But this is the line. And this is not me ""searching a reason to hit girls"", this is me not baselessly and arbitrarily granting girls special protection over guys BEYOND A CERTAIN POINT. Yes, I DO want to hit BACK girls who REALLY FUCKING HURT ME. Because they're violent and ASSAULT ME, not because they are female."

A positive emotional bond between captor and captive is a ""defense mechanism of the ego under stress"", Since captives often fear that their affection will be perceived as fake, they eventually begin to believe that their positive sentiments are genuine. 3) Women are especially prone to developing the condition. 4) When captors make captives doubt the likelihood of their survival by terrorizing them into ""helpless, powerless, and submissive"" states. This enables captors to appear merciful when they perform acts of kindness. 5) In both the psychological and societal senses, women are defined by their sense of fear surrounding the threat of male violence. This constant fear is what drives women to perform actions that they know will be pleasing to men in order to avoid emotional, physical, or sexual assault as a result of male anger. 6) A hostage's development of positive feelings towards the captor, they is no need for a previous relationship between hostage and captor 7) hostage's belief in the humanity of the captor because they cease to perceive the captor as a threat when the victim holds the same values as the aggressor. 8) Abuse and subsequent submission and appeasement by the victim have been observed among chimpanzees, leading to the theory that the Stockholm syndrome may have its roots in evolutionary needs."

Toxic Masculinity refers to the societal roles and expectations placed on men that are problematic and unhelpful. Many of these are vestiges from our ancestry and evolution, but that does not make the behaviors virtuous. Specifically, when we discuss Toxic Masculintiy there are 3 things that are meant: -The need to be ""Macho"" 100% of the time, to never express any emotional vulnerability or weakness -The ""Boy's Club"" attitudes that lead to sexual abuse in large organizations, and the covering of sexual abusers as just being part of how things are done. -Garden Variety sexism. These are the problems. And when we talk about ""Toxic Masculinity"", we aren't saying it's solely the burden of men to change things. In response to the first bullet, many men *and* women need to change their attitudes to evolve past it. All of that said, the phrase itself. ""Toxic Masculinity"". Immediately implies to some people that all men, males, and masculinity is toxic. This is not at all what is meant, and is in fact a total waste of time that gums up the works as people explain this, misunderstand, or willfully misunderstand.

I can almost guarantee in any sort of superhero/action movie with a female protagonist theres going to be a scene where a sexist white male (either middle aged or a young dumb jock) will insult/catcall said female protag and said female protag will either destroy his car, knock him out, or embarass him. Its a trope at this point. Theres very little arc to female heroes. They dont start at the bottom and rise to the top before collapsing and then finishing strong. They may start in a poor place, but internally they're strong badasses whose badassness will get them through the story. Theres no vulnerability or growth. Take Luke Skywalker. This kid was lost in life, spending his days blasting womprats and arguing with his uncle. Hes clueless, weak, and vulnerable. He cant negotiate prices for transport, he gets himself into situations where his wise teacher must save him repeatedly, and he is awkward and clumsy. Then over time he ends up as a confident trained jedi secure in himself with a clear driven purpose. The character of Luke is completely different from where he started, even at the end of the second movie. Rey is awesome right from the get go. She'll charge those who she thinks are threatening her, she is confident in her abilities and fears almost nothing, and she can fix the Falcon to a level that surprises Han Solo. She is basically the same character throughout everything. She just knows how to use a lightsaber. Its not that female characters are naturally badly written, its just that writers insist that they be ""women protaganists"" instead of just protaganists. They must be strong, confident, and badass so that women could feel as such. Its sort of patronizing in a way. A good female character would be Ripley from Alien. She is vulnerable and scared throughout the movie. Terrified like most humans would be in her situation. Then she has to rise to badassness through conflict, survival, and love of protecting others. I dont like him as a person but Jordan Peele recently made a good point about making his new film ""Us"". He said its important that black people can be at the center of movies without their race being a factor. The same is true for women. Also, the fans protect badly written female protags because they want to be woke and they think they look cool. They dont actually care about the story, they just want a woman to look badass.

Let me start by saying Detroit is dying. Homeless people are **everywhere**. Most people who go to Tigers games arent from Detroit. Its a Michigan thing to Head to the tigers game! As if its a huge deal and worth driving 5 hours one way. So a lot of these people end up avoiding or ignoring the homeless people. I even did it for a time in my life. I felt this weird sense of guilt whenever I saw a homeless person. Was it because I grew up middle class? Or that I knew I wasnt able/Generous at the time in order to help them? I dont know. But that all changed when I met Marcus. Walking out of the Tigers game, there was a homeless person or group of homeless people around every 50 feet. We had to walk around a half mile to our car to get home. (I was with a group of friends) Every time I passed a homeless person, I felt an enormous source of guilt. And then I had an epiphany. When we dont help the people who need us most, we dont hold up our own belief in our goodness as a person. Most people would say they are a good person. But would a good person really ignore these desperate people? So the next homeless person I saw, I approached and talked to him. He was a skinny black man with tattered clothes. Hanging his head between his legs next to a lamp post. My friend instantly switched her purse to the other side. She said to keep going, but I decided to talk to the man. Marcus was his name. Ill never forget it. I could tell from the moment I met his eyes that this man was broken. The look on his face reminded me of the same look that I once saw when I struggled with depression and suicide years back. The eyes barely holding on to life. Just pleading for someone to love him. His own mortality hanging on a thin string, fragile enough to be cut by the slightest hint of scorn or hatred. I asked him what his story was. He told me. It was wild. His house burned to the ground because he left his stove on by accident. He lost everything. His car. His job. His home. He had nowhere else to go, and was on the street for around a month. He had been abused as a child, and had just started to see his life look up when it literally burnt to the ground. I asked him how he was doing, and he said that he didnt have the will to live anymore. He told me he was contemplating suicide that night. I asked him if I could share my story. He said yes and I gave him the entire journey I went though to climb out of depression and suicide. I told him that while we went through different experiences to get that low, we are both human and that I understand him. He mentioned how he found God a few months back. I am a Christian and I asked him If I could pray with him. The look in his eyes when I said this brings me to tears every time I think of it. It was as if I had cracked open the dark shell of a man he was and peered into his very soul. A person wanting love and affection, but without any at all. We prayed that night and I bought him dinner. I ended up talking with him for around an hour and a half. I told him that even if his parents didnt love him, he is still deserving of love and value. I told him that whether its the universe, God, or a person. Somewhere, on this big earth, there is something or someone that cares for Marcus. And that it was his job to go and find it. I gave him the address and numbers of resources for the homeless. He told me that if I had not come by and spoken with him that day, he would have left this earth only hours later. My point is this. **the homeless are the most human of all of us** they have nothing to distract them from their own fragility and vulnerability. They live in the very place we are all desperately afraid of. Its not a physical place, but a emotional state of complete openness without anything to hide. They are suffering for all the world to see. They wear no masks, they dont put up a facade. They know more of what life is capable of than all of us. We have a lot to learn from them. And we have a lot to give. Why not give a hello? "
221,vulnerability,unpopularopinion,Rape. No Means No but...,1,aj32yc,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/aj32yc/rape_no_means_no_but/,2019-01-24 05:58:02,"I want to start off by saying, this post should probably NOT be read by victims of sexual assault. It may come off as insensitive to you, which is not what I am trying to do. I am simply trying to open up a discussion on a frowned-upon opinion of sexual assault in relation to victims and perpetrators. With that being said...there is currently a headline surfacing around the inter-web about a woman who was raped in the club. New sources have found that prior to the sexual assault, she was on stage wearing revealing clothing twerking for several minutes in front of the club. No opinion here. Only the facts. No means no. I think EVERYONE can agree with this statement. But lets really think about this and get away from surface-level conclusions and opinions. No one EVER deserves to get raped. Ever. No one deserves to have their bodily rights stolen from them under any circumstance whatsoever. HOWEVER, lets break this situation down into its components and actually think biologically, sociologically, and psychologically about this. In the animal kingdom, there are many species that perform dances or rituals in order to sexually attract their opposite-gendered counterparts. They do this to mate, obviously. Subsequently, these animals who see this dance or ritual, if they are interested, approaches the animal. And off they mate. So its safe to say that these rituals WORK. Us being complex human beings not only also have mating rituals, but we have the cognitive ability to act out these mating rituals even when we arent on a quest to find a mate. I believe this is what this woman was doing. Its without a shadow of a doubt that straight men are sexually attracted to this form of dancing, and thus, seeing it releases chemicals and hormones that puts them, psychologically, in a mate-ready position. Its very possible, and might be accurately so, that this woman had no intentions on partaking in ANY sexual encounters. She was just having fun. The problem, however, comes in when there are men who believe that they have the RIGHT to a womans body. And believe with that right, they can take advantage of a drunken situation, or even a sober situation and forcibly make her perform acts in which she does not consent. We KNOW with our 20+ years, or even 10+ years of life experience, that there are bad people in this world. We know that we cannot trust everyone to help us when were in need, or have our best interest at heart. We know that there are evil people who rape, kill, and steal. Etc. Therefore, we so seriously need to use this knowledge to form our decisions on how we live, who we interact with, who we let our children around. I am not saying that the victim is at fault by any means. But I am saying that you as a human being CANNOT fix brokenness. People who rape, steal, and kill are BROKEN. If not mentally, then spiritually, and emotionally. There has to be something wrong within them because we know that normal people (people who are sane and live within the means of reality) do not rape. It has very little to do with the way they were raised. We can teach our boys all day long that no means no, which we should, but we SHOULD NOT encourage our daughters to live however you want because, unfortunately, our girls are NOT untouchable. Of course there are cases where the girl can be the absolutely most innocent thing on earth and still meet face-to-face with sexual assault. And whether this is the case or not, the perpetrator should definitely be submitted to the SAME punishment. I know that most rapes are committed by someone the victim knows, and this opinion isn't directed towards those cases. I am a STRONG believer in not giving rapists the opportunity. Im a criminology major who has/is taking upper level CRM courses. MOST crimes are crimes of opportunity where the victim is vulnerable and no chaperone is present to prevent the crime. So I say all that to say this: STOP ALLOWING VULNERABILITY. I would rather not have anyone reply who is going to respond solely off of how they ""feel"" about the situation. Rape makes everyone sad.

But the line, ""Mr Stark, I dont feel so good"", thats become so iconic, was pretty forced and generic and it immediately took me out of the immersion when i saw the film in cinemas. I mean, is ""I dont feel so good"" really the first words that come to mind as you literally crumble out of existance itself? Its such an uninspired line and although i couldnt name them, im pretty sure ive heard it in about a dozen other movies and shows. Only seconds later, Tom Holland brilliantly channels the vulnerability of a little kid who has suddenly been struck by the realisation that his life is about to end and there is absolutely nothing he can do to stop it. His performance is truly heartbreaking, and yet its a throwaway line from the beginning of the scene that people have come to remember it for. I realise this is petty of me but it really annoys me. Ive expressed this opinion a few times and pretty much nobody agrees with me... so im posting it here"

This is the story of a girl crying a river to drown all the mods, that position should die, #unpopular, #controversy, #clickbait, #literarybitch, #philosophymajor, #fightmeiwillcutyoujk, #nofriends, #tooedgytointernet. &amp;#x200B; So I was posting about my life which is medically and legally sad and makes all the misery workerr sob and mentioned that I had been raped multiple times, like by so many people I actually don't know how many people have raped me. Someone responded by saying, ""you deserve to be raped because you flirt with people and fuck strangers"", and he also commented in many other forums just sadistically enjoying violence, especially against women, and not ironically, like being satanic. I make fucked up jokes (9 out of 10 people enjoys gang-rape, I would know because I was there), I get irony, it was not irony. I'm not sensitive at all, I dare you to try to hurt me, I only get offended at stupid and injustice. So one, no one deserves to be raped ever because you have a human right to bodily autonomy and safety from others' infringement on your liberty (#unpopular), and two, I was raped by three people from 8-10 years old, I was raped by a boyfriend who I lost my virginity to who I dated for over a year, a boyfriend I dated for three years tried to rape me in my sleep, I escaped an attempted rape at a business dinner my wife brought me to, I escaped an attempted rape in a dark interactive art exhibit at like an SJW party perpetuated by a stranger I literally said nothing to, and I was drugged and gang-raped by at least six men my first night of college according to the LAPD, no dating apps, and witnesses said I was unconscious, (and nothing legally happened to them, fuck the POlice). I do not drink, I do not do any drugs, I became severely obese on purpose after anorexia to make it stop since people told me I was so hot it was my fault and now I'm a manatee, I have agoraphobia and do not leave my house except rarely and only with other people (I live on Soylent and Postmates), I have absolutely no social media to avoid stalkers, I don't talk to strangers and I have no friends or family now so I internet, I've been monogamous in a marriage for four years and it hasn't made anyone stop raping me, and I moved to the suburbs so no one is near me like in an apartment. Like everything, not asking for it all. And the icing on the cake is that I'm a lesbian. Like, married to a transgender woman (don't be a TERF), first kiss and first love different girls, told everyone I'm a lesbian. I ain't in the market for big dick energy or any dicks or any energy besides Red Bull, I'm actually a lesbian. If you wonder why this would keep happening to me, fucking satanic family like literally satan, repetition compulsion, predators can smell vulnerability, and I'm a bunch of minorities that people think are thicc. &amp;#x200B; So I told this incel, you are evil and your life is meaningless and I pity you. And then another guy is like ""Two wrongs don't make a right unless you speak a Slavic language"", and I said, ""I speak fluent Russian, fuck off"". Turns out he was a mod and he permanently banned me and wouldn't let me reason with him even when I told him I was suicidal and would send him my medical records to his email, just ghosted me and now I'm banned. Then I went to RaisedByNarcissists and wanted emotional support and was like, I spoke to this person for hours and my family is mostly narcissists and I know what that is. They deleted the post and said ""you can't drive-by diagnose someone you don't personally know"", and it is like, define the definition of ""personally know"" in the internet age, if a person messages and says the same things to you for hours on the internet versus meat world, like how is that different? I started arguing with her about the nature of ""knowing someone"" and how the internet is literally part of real life, and I apologized multiple times and asked if they could recommend another place to post this issue and explained the suicide thing, and I got banned there too. I didn't insult anyone other than ""fuck off"", but now I'm banned in two subreddits on the same day, and I genuinely was being rational and was not trying to troll. Like what? These are forums meant for supporting traumatized people, but if you question a mod and even apologize the whole time, they'll just ban you. &amp;#x200B; Moderation is prone to human bias, and I think the types of people who get internet power and their real lives are probably really sad are even more likely to abuse it. It is censorship if you say something that literally doesn't break any of the rules, apologize your ass off, and ask honest questions and for help, but then the mod doesn't like you, and they block you for trying to reason with them. Like where are the subreddits without mods, where do I go? I have very nuanced opinions, like I'm a leftist radical who doesn't believe in activism, I'm disabled but I think there's good arguments for saying ""retarded"" and even for eugenics, and maybe humans should go voluntarily extinct, and I have the science and philosophy to back that up. Madness is genius, and it pisses normie snowflakes off. Help, what now."

We have to be cool with just about anything our partner chooses to do otherwise were a prude/asshole/bitch. I feel like this is the reason for a lot of cheating and dissatisfaction in a relationship. Im not saying trust is not important but when alcohol, friends, emotional vulnerability, etc, are in the mix even good people can make dumb decisions/mistakes. Not saying I think things should be as extreme as in Korea, but there should be some kind of acceptable medium. "

But even among my friends who would never judge someone for going to therapy, I still find that they're super hesitant about going themselves. Which I do somewhat get, the ones I recommend therapy to usually have mental issues that make that kind of vulnerability hard for them. But quite often their hesitation stems from general ignorance of what therapy is like. Some of them go in expecting that any therapist they meet will hypnotize them, or give them ""happy pills"" at the first meeting. Therapy is an incredibly useful thing that should be far, far less stigmatized than it is. It should be normal to go to therapy even for tiny issues, or just for a monthly mental checkup, like a doctor's visit. We treat our physical health like this, so why not our mental health?"

Nor am I proposing the constitution be amended in any practical sense. This is an opinion on the theoretical, philosophical nature of religious freedom (lower case, not bound to any existing laws, simply the basic premise). Ever notice how most religious people are the same religion as their parents? If you press them, they will insist that they chose it for themselves. So where are all the kids who chose Islam while going to Protestant Church? There was no choice other than the vague and often-difficult choice of leaving their parents religion for another or none. Freedom of religion in the American sense isnt strictly a personal freedom. In fact Id say its less of a personal freedom than it is a freedom for various church or informal congregations of people to bring young minds under their sway. A truly free society would recognize the vulnerability and lack of true decision-making power in children and protect them until they are of a certain age (10? 12? 18? Thats a whole other debate)."

A massively well-funded study of over 100,000 schoolchildren found that Adolescents who identify themselves as mixed race are at higher health and behavior risk than those of 1 race. Indeed, even when controlling for education, socioeconomic status, and other factors, there is an across-the board higher rate of health risks amongst mixed race adolescents than mono-racial adolescents. URL One study found that White-Asian mixes had a 2x higher rate of being diagnosed with a psychological disorder, such as anxiety, depression or substance abuse. URL A study on Black-White mixes in agreement found that When it comes to engaging in risky/anti-social adolescent behavior, however, mixed race adolescents are stark outliers compared to both blacks and whites. This holds true despite being raised in similar environments to mono-racial children. URL Often race-deniers and cultural Marxists will bring up Haldanes rule, arguing that since races can mix and create fertile offspring, the genetic distance is not too great. Haldanes rule is when in the offspring of two different animal races one sex is absent, rare, or sterile, that sex is the heterogametic [XY] sex. URL Indeed, although Black-White mixes are not sterile and males are not absent, males (the heterogametic sex) are more rare than females. URL the argument regarding Haldanes rule is also meaningless because different species in the animal kingdom can breed and still produce fertile offspring. The wolf (Canis lupus) and the dog (Canis lupus familiaris), the coyote (Canis latrans), and the common jackal (Canis aureus) are separate species yet can all interbreed and produce fertile offspring.

URL The common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and the bonobo (Pan paniscus) and many species of birds, such as the pintail (Anas acuta) and the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), can interbreed as well. URL URL The gibbon and the siamang can also interbreed to produce a hybrid URL URL Some species that arent even in the same genus can interbreed. URL Black Americans are a hybrid race of around 22% White ancestry URL This 22% ancestry is the cause of multiple negative health effects due to genetic incompatibility. Indeed, consistent with Haldanes rule, unmixed Blacks from Africa and White Americans do not have the same rate of birth problems that hybrid American Blacks have: In 2005, the mortality rate for black infants was 4.4 times higher than that of white infants African women who come to the United States and have babies experience the same low rate of infant deaths as white American mothers. URL (docs.google) Indiscriminate interbreeding between distinct forms, whether species or markedly different races, is not generally beneficial. The defect may show in a change in the sex-ratio of the offspring, probably caused by the early abortion of members of one sex, generally the male in the case of mammals. URL LTA4H, or leukotriene A4 hydrolase is found on chromosome 17. An allele of this gene increases the risk of heart attack (the #1 cause of death in America) in Blacks by more than 250%, but only 16% in Whites. The 30% of Whites with this allele have counteracting genes, while the 6% of Black Americans who obtained it through race mixing do not. URL The average rate of success for mixed race couples is around half that of same race couples, 0.127 compared to 0.213.

URL One study showed that people tend to find their own face when morphed into the opposite sex most attractive, even when he/she doesn't know it's his own face, strongly suggesting that people typically prefer those who look like themselves, in other words their own racial/ethnic group. URL Hybrid vigor (heterosis) does not seem to apply to humans as we are already very heterozygous, at 0.776 [URL Compared to dogs for example at 0.401. [URL Although some argue that race mixing ""averages out"" traits and since average faces are considered more attractive [URL then mixed race offspring are more attractive. However this is fallacious as it assumes we are designed for perfect symmetry, when in fact the magnitude of asymmetry is the correct measurement and this random component fulctuates, also called ""fluctuating asymmetry"" - so more honestly a lower level of asymmetry correlates with increased attractiveness, not symmetry. URL But does increased heterozygosity cause lower asymmetry? A meta analysis of 118 datasets in 14 studies showed a very weak inverse correlation between the two, showing that increased heterozygosity has no beneficial effect on symmetry or asymmetry URL One study on the craniofacial morphology in White-Amerindian mixed race individuals found that over half of the 52 shape variables deviated from the mathematical average completely shattering the above argument.

That slur, of course, is ""toxic"". To be toxic is to be hazardous--and that which is hazardous must be *contained*. People who use the word ""toxic"" should be honest about what they mean by it. It's not a complicated metaphor, and those subjected to it frequently have no trouble interpreting the message. No one ever calls for the reform of toxic chemicals, after all. There is no injunction to work out your issues with toxic waste, nor would anyone ever be advised to expose themselves to, say, nuclear fallout in order to achieve mutual understanding and balance. A toxic item can only be relocated--around or away, inside and below. It's stored, hidden, *exiled.* We dispose of the toxic, or we avoid it. To call someone toxic is to tell everyone around them--friends, family, coworkers, partners--to stay away, and to petition those in positions of authority--police, politicians, bosses--to enforce this injunction. It is unambiguously a call to ostracize. It's worthwhile to ask, here: who could possibly realize this call to action? One clue to this question is the great hallmark of sneering privilege that can only ever be held by the truly powerful: the expectation that you will never have to interact with people who you do not choose to interact with. To call someone toxic is to announce that you have access to a button which, when pressed, effectuates their fall from the social ladder. It is to *admire* the ladder itself, to cling to it, to revel in the power of hierarchy and authority over others. In fact, it is nothing less than a call for the continued fragmentation and atomization of the consumer paradise enjoyed by various species of first-world parasite. We should therefore also ask: *who would want this?* I can think of only one sort of person. ""Toxic"", then, is the weapon of the snob, and it can never wielded by someone who doesn't already command an oversized portion of influence and resources in society. There's little mystery as to its popularity among the preening techno-nobility of the internet age. Every trust fund-backed twitter account is today occupied with the task of filtering contaminants from their shrinking worlds. Whether its the foreigners--Russians and now Iranians--with their exotic germs, or the contrarians and trolls with their ""dangerous"" opinions, the critics and back-talkers with no regard for their social betters, they are all dealt with in the fashion that any powerless person throughout history would recognize: silence. They are blocked, ignored, suspended, de-platformed and blacklisted. In a word, they are *removed*. Toxicity is the obsession of a digital hermit kingdom, no different from any elite enclave carved out and walled off from open society. It's the signature concern of anyone who's daily fears and obstacles are so trivial as to make mere dissent appear as a grave threat. It is, after all, *isolation* which renders us most vulnerable to the pathogens of others. Anyone who is today troubled by the toxicity of the world in which they live can only have been rendered frail and feeble by their own privilege. It never occurs to those who have been strengthened by unavoidable conflict to wonder about the state of their immune system. They don't feel the vulnerability to the toxic element because they have never known the permanent shelter of wealth and power. The ones who couldn't adapt are simply dead. Those who use the word toxic as an insult should be made to run the same gauntlet. It's only fair."

Being forced to listen to multiple graphic recounts by true rape victims. Being forced to view the process of a real rape investigation to see how invasive and indignate these can be for the victims. Being forced to face a room full of real rape victims, and telling them that you lied about having gone through what they have and that you did it it for attention or other personal gains. And finally, being put into a cell next to another cell full of sex offenders and being made to strip down for a certain length of time to give them a small taste of the deeper feelings and emotions (ie shame, vulnerability) a real victim feels as well as being able to hear the things a real victim may hear from their offenders during their ordeal.

250,vulnerability,unpopularopinion,Why people refuse to talk about veganism when discussing climate change,1,9n314r,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/9n314r/why_people_refuse_to_talk_about_veganism_when/,2018-10-11 07:10:19,"The reason why so many people refuse to talk about veganism when discussing climate change is because that would require them to consider the daily choices they make, as individuals, instead of just pointing the finger at politicians and corporations. The U.N. says that raising animals for food is one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. The most powerful step that we can take as individuals to halt climate change is to stop eating meat, eggs, and dairy products. Fight Climate Change by Going Vegan Climate change has been called humankinds greatest challenge and the worlds gravest environmental threat. According to the United Nations (U.N.) report Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability, climate change is having an impact on every continent, affecting agriculture, human health, ecosystems, water supplies, and even peoples livelihoods. Many conscientious people are trying to help combat climate change by driving more fuel-efficient cars and using energy-saving light bulbs, but these measures simply arent enough. If youre serious about protecting the environment, the most important thing that you can do is stop eating meat, eggs, and dairy products. How Animal Agriculture Contributes to Climate Change Feeding massive amounts of grain and water to farmed animals and then killing them and processing, transporting, and storing their flesh is extremely energy-intensive. And forestswhich absorb greenhouse gasesare cut down in order to supply pastureland and grow crops for farmed animals. Finally, the animals themselves and all the manure that they produce release even more greenhouse gases into our atmosphere. Greenhouse-Gas Emissions Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide are all powerful greenhouse gases, and together, they cause the vast majority of climate change. Carbon Dioxide Burning fossil fuels (such as oil and gasoline) releases carbon dioxide. Since it takes, on average, about 11 times as much fossil fuel to produce a calorie of animal protein as it does to produce a calorie of grain protein, considerably more carbon dioxide is released. Researchers acknowledge that it is more climate efficient to produce protein from vegetable sources than from animal sources. Chatham House, an international affairs think tank, has called for a carbon tax on meat to help combat climate change. Of course, eating vegan foods rather than animal-based ones is the best way to reduce your carbon footprint. A University of Chicago study even showed that you can reduce your carbon footprint more effectively by going vegan than by switching from a conventional car to a hybrid. Methane The billions of animals who are crammed onto U.S. factory farms each year produce enormous amounts of methane. Ruminantssuch as cows, sheep, and goatsproduce the gas while they digest their food, and its also emitted from the acres of cesspools filled with the feces that pigs, cows, and other animals on these farms excrete. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has shown that animal agriculture is globally the single largest source of methane emissions and that, pound for pound, methane is more than 25 times as effective as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in our atmosphere. According to Vasile Stanescu, a scholar at Mercer University, animals raised by organic methods emit even more methane than animals on factory farms do. He believes that so-called free-range or pasture-raised animals are significantly worse in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions. Nitrous Oxide Nitrous oxide is about 300 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. According to the U.N., the meat, egg, and dairy industries account for an astonishing 65 percent of worldwide nitrous-oxide emissions. (Use the N-Calculator to calculate your nitrogen footprint and to see how you can lower your nitrogen usage.) What Other Experts Say The U.N. believes that a global shift toward plant-based food is vital if we are to combat the worst effects of climate change. Globally, animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gases than all the worlds transportation systems combined. An Oxford University study, published in the journal Climatic Change, shows that meat-eaters are responsible for almost twice as many dietary greenhouse-gas emissions per day as vegetarians and about two and a half times as many as vegans. The researchers found that the diets of people who eat more than 3.5 ounces of meat per dayabout the size of a deck of playing cardsgenerate 15.8 pounds of carbon-dioxide equivalent (CO2e) each day, whereas vegetarians and vegans are responsible for 8.4 pounds and 6.4 pounds of CO2e, respectively. The study indicated that the dietary greenhouse-gas emissions among meat-eaters were between 50 and 54 percent higher than those of vegetarians and between 99 and 102 percent higher than those of vegans. Overall, the studys authors concluded that the production of animal-based foods causes significantly greater greenhouse-gas emissions than the production of vegan foods. Many other scientists around the world have reached the same conclusion. Researchers with Loma Linda University in California found that vegans have the smallest carbon footprint, generating a 41.7 percent smaller volume of greenhouse gases than meat-eaters do. When scientists at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden calculated ways to combat climate change, they found that cutting greenhouse-gas emissions from transportation and energy use alone isnt enough to curb climate change. Dr. Fredrik Hedenus, the lead scientist of the study, said that reducing meat and dairy consumption is key to bringing agricultural climate pollution down to safe levels. Similarly, Ilmi Granoff from the Overseas Development Institute in the U.K. has urged officials to forget about coal and cars, because the fastest way to address climate change would be to dramatically reduce the amount of meat people eat.

Anyway the title of the post; Altruism doesnt exist. No one does anything without they themselves gaining something. Especially women should be noted as they are seen as such giving empaths. So men, as the people having to extend themselves first in sexual interactions really are giving to receive and thats normal. They should do that. They shouldnt attack women but the attempt to connect with them is fine. When a girl refuses them and they get some indication that she wouldnt refuse other men who approached her in whatever same environment, it hurts their feelings. It would hurt anyones feelings. Because these people are men, society feels its okay to abuse them as they share their vulnerability and weakness. That isnt what they need and the problem isnt that theyre trying to do something a woman might enjoy. All this women dont want to be treated nicely shit is either very toxic or very sad and true.

It's not just a physical act- if the physical pleasure of sex was all that it had going for it, people would rarely go beyond masturbation. It's an activity that by its very nature necessitates the investment of one's ego- its a source of validation, self esteem, contextualization, and self expression. White knights on reddit like to ignore all of this so they can spin this narrative: ""If a girl likes sex and wants to get paid money for it, why is that wrong? It's just sex."" Most of the people that counter this avoid addressing it directly- instead they make inductive arguments about sex trafficking and the regrets of former porn stars. I don't believe it's necessary to sidestep the central claim here. The problem with women (people, but the market is massively skewed toward women) having sex on camera for money, is that doing so requires them to completely ignore all of the auxiliary effects of sex. To be a porn star, a person has to be willing to ignore the vulnerability of exposing oneself to large numbers of people, the pain of being reduced to a set of physical characteristics- ie objectified- the danger of being coerced into doing painful or degrading things, the life long social consequences of being exposed sexually on camera, the emotional consequences of associating sex with money- depriving it of it's significance as an expression of affection and trust- the lack of respect they will be faced with in professional environments going forward, extreme difficulty to form a trusting relationship with a romantic partner, the threats posed by stalkers and creeps, and, last but perhaps most significant, the sheer psychic weight of knowing that millions of men at any given time are using images of you to pleasure themselves. What kind of women are willing to overlook all of these things? Well, in order to do so, a woman must either A: not care about any of these things Or B: be desperate for whatever it is they get in return I've yet to meet a person that doesn't care about the things I've listed, so I think it's a fair bet that the vast majority of porn stars belong to category B. So, then, women are driven to become porn stars by the money, validation, and fame, (and sexual satisfaction, for the exhibitionists) that they receive in return for sacrificing all this other stuff. And this is why people look down on porn stars and other sex workers. A rational, stable person, the kind of person you want to hang out with and rely on, values all of the emotional, social, and psychological goods I listed above more than fame, money, and validation. Women that are willing to make that trade off, then, are fame hungry, chronically insecure, or (sadly) just not good enough at anything else to make a living at it. So, people look down on sex workers because, as a society, we have all subconsciously decided that it's more important that people have all those emotional and social goods instead of fame, money, validation, and sexual thrills, so we want to discourage the women we care about from making the trade. Is this social more often abused by men looking for an outlet for their resentment and hate? Absolutely. Is it therefore invalid in its purpose? Not at all. I have seen several young women my age batter themselves to pieces with promiscuous, exploitative sex, because they were fed a narrative that reduces sex to a purely physical act. A great deal of mental and emotional harm had been done to these women as a result, and if they had not been convinced that sex was a meaningless thing, they would not have used it as an outlet for their social and emotional insecurity. This goes double for the camgirls and prostitutes I'm friends with. Anyway, most of reddit isn't going to respond positively to this post, because most of reddit is made up of men that feel incredibly guilty that the porn stars they watch have such a hard time, and therefore refuse to face the facts. They pervert feminism, sexuality, and basic empathy, because they're too afraid to admit that they're at fault. They tell themselves that social mores are the problem, because the alternative is that they are the problem- and to fix the problem, they'd have to give up their porn. "

They want to put on a front of superiority and strength, so they lie. Altruism does not exist and no one is nice simply to be nice. They gain approval or attention or group recognition from every good favor because of the massive risk behind doing anything nice for anyone ever. In the case of men being nice to women to make those women date them, that is what anyone does when they are trying to attract someone. The methods vary but the end goal is to have the person like you in exchange for whatever treatment they desire which is nice. Wanting to tell someone you have these traits is not deplorable behavior and is the same thing as telling someone you have a master's degree. It may or may not be accurate and the stigma on talking about how nice you are is constructed. There are few people with the emotional intelligence and ego security to simply take a rejection and move on after sacrificing resources and plenty of incredibly insecure angry people have sex. The idea that anyone has the time, resources, or psychological strength to not be conditioned by constant failure is bullshit that is sold by authors and superficially practiced by consumers vying for the look of success (more on this later.) If you like a girl as a friend and are sexually attracted to her and you attempt to become closer to her with sex in mind using a gift and attention, this is completely normal and reasonable to the extent of her not making her disinterest obvious and has been being done the same way since the dawn of man. Women discouraging this when it is obvious is more so about sex negativity that they have internalized and this taboo is less prevalent in other cultures. Men who are, due to arbitrary circumstances, constantly failing and not becoming successful are simply people who are failing at something and there is nothing inherently manipulative or cringe-worthy about it other than when it is put on display, simply shining light on the awkwardness of any vulnerable person not being good at something. The taboo however manifests itself in people seeing these interactions, becoming anxious because of the perceived vulnerability, and being triggered into a learned group management behavior of shaming a victim. Charisma has many forms as well as strength. Many women and men have been conditioned into believing someone being kind to them is a sign of manipulation and weakness and that those who do not have time for them are valuable but that is not the nature of any one woman or women as a whole. In reality, people simply try to become involved with those they like and either get rejected or not. The shame is toxic and a construct. No man is alpha or beta and unfortunately those who feed into these ideas are as close to beta as one could potentially get because they're basing their interaction off of the findings of another man, making them place themselves at a lower place in their social circle by default. The closest things to alphas are those who sell the books to men making tons of money, which brings me to my last point. Pick up is not very useful when it comes to manipulating pussy out of women (keyword: seduction) and those ideas and methods to seduce women are immediately discovered and marked as gross. Women recognize a man who needs shell games as being inauthentic and dishonest. Other forms of manipulation go unnoticed and likely would never be taught as no one would give out truly valuable information for free. The real people being gamed are the men who buy these programs because they believe there is some guy out there who is always successful with women. This creates an endless money machine where new methods are produced and rejected. This also destroys dating due to the increased vigilance to things labeled as manipulation and an increased focus on concrete things such as wealth and security which are the true source of what is called toxic masculinity. In reality, the only patterns are ones people have been convinced exist (myers briggs included) and everyone has thoughts and options that branch off wildly based purely on the negative and positive stimulus provided by their unique experience and social group. People represent stereotypes only on the surface but internally are generally quite nuanced and intelligent, be that intellect often unappreciated or realized. "

But it became clear that the evidence showed that he was telling the truth. His story was, Reeva went to the toilet. It was dark and and he heard a sound in the toilet, and thought it was a burglar. There is very high crime in South Africa, one of the highest in the world. As an amputee without his legs on he can barely walk, let alone run properly. He was vulnerable, He took his gun and shouted to the ""burglar"" to get out of the house. Reeva didn't respond, because she thought there was a burglar in the house. So he fired 4 shots into the closed toilet door, which killed Reeva. He then went and put on his legs, and realizing that Reeva wasn't in the bed, put on his legs and knocked the door down with a cricket bat. The loud bangs of the cricket bat smashing the door, sound similar to gun shots. (As proven in court). After that he shrieked in grief which some neighbors said it sounded like a woman while other neighbors said it sounded like a man crying. The media never believed his story, even when the judge clearly explained why the timeline makes only his version and not the prosecutions version possible. He was still given 5 years at first because firing into a closed toilet was considered a manslaughter, but given his vulnerability as an amputee etc, he wasn't given a high sentence. The prosecution appealed and because of public outrage the appealing judge gave him a much higher sentence of 12 years.

Well, yeah, people have been talking about how smoking is stupid for decades, but not many people throw drinking in there too. I believe you can't just address one and not address the other. They go hand in hand. Have you ever heard someone saying they're going to go to a party in college to get ""high, but I'm not going to drink at all?"" Exactly. Growing up as a kid, my father used to tell me that he never smoked and that he also never really drank. Throughout my childhood, he would tell me various stories of the shortcomings of people who were too intoxicated to make proper judgement, usually resulting in things such as motor-vehicle accidents, losses in friendships, and other destructive mishaps. As for smoking, every time I turned on the TV, there's an anti-smoking commercial, so I really didn't have a want or desire to light a cig. And in terms of weed, the area I grew up in (NYC) was already a clear indicator of the effects that weed could have on people and what kind of damage that it could cause. My father would also tell me stories of people that were drug dealers that inevitably got shut down by the system, which helped to create a negative image of smoking in my mind. Now that I'm older and can reflect on it, I believe there's obviously some bias that was thrown around during my childhood. They did as most parents would do and tried to urge me to stay off the path of drugs and alcohol, which I'd say was mostly a success, because even while reflecting on it, I still find the acts of smoking and drinking to be largely stupid. How do you honestly enjoy continuously impairing your senses? It doesn't quite make sense to me. This is not to mention that if you go into excess that you'll reach a point where you'll lose control of the majority of your actions (very drunk or very high) and you're left in a heightened state of vulnerability. I don't think the after-effects of getting drunk are very pleasant either. Hangovers are a bitch, or so I've been told. Not only do I think the act of drinking and smoking themselves are stupid. I also think the way society gives attention to drinking (not really to smoking) is also stupid. It's a very popular social convention for ""adults"" to drink while doing a lot of things. You wanna hang out with your buds? Crack open a cold one with the boys. You wanna take a girl out on a date? You can simply bring her out for a round of drinks. You get a promotion at the office? Lets get some celebratory drinks. You at college and bored on the weekends? Hit that party up and get drunk. Hell, I've even heard that there are people that will look at you weird if you show up to a social setting where most people are drinking and you decide not to drink. What you mean to tell me is that if I want to drink Peach Tea over whatever fiendish concoction the group I'm hanging with has decided to gulp down, *I'm* the one that gets looked at weird? Huh? Look. To wrap this all up, I hate drinking and smoking. I hate how the prior has become so saturated in our day-to-day society. I hate how some people worship the latter. I have not, and never will, consume alcohol or ""smoke a blunt."" While it doesn't sicken me to the point where I'll actively avoid socializing with people or something like that, I do hate it to the point where I can rant about it."

This is not the first incident of its kind but in 2018 I think having physical windows in planes is archaic. If you consider Elon Musk's hyperloop design, the car will have no windows, instead it will have a kind of LCD display that acts as a giant window. Cameras can be ridiculously small nowadays as well as inexpensive, so instead of cutting holes for windows on airplanes, they could put tiny cameras outside the plane which would send a feed to a window-shaped LCD screen. No need for easily shatter-able glass windows. I don't really get why people love the 787 for its gigantic windows when it represents a major vulnerability that I don't think should exist in the year 2018. Remember the De Havilland Comet of the 1950's used to have large, square windows and people at the time thought it was a great idea until the squared edges caused the aircraft to undergo more fatigue stressing than was predicted which caused several fatal explosive decompression accidents. I feel the incident above will change aircraft design like the De Havilland Comet crashes changed aircraft design. If I designed a plane, it would have no windows at all, just camera-LCD interfaces or 180 degree rotating cameras that can be rotated using an in-flight entertainment style interface below the LCD panels. These cameras could also be linked up to the autopilot system, similar to how cameras are being used for driverless cars."

267,vulnerability,unpopularopinion,Gun Control in response to Mass Shootings currently is to emotionally based.,6,7y3nm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/7y3nm6/gun_control_in_response_to_mass_shootings/,2018-02-17 12:37:34,"This is most definitely a unpopular opinion with the majority of reddit especially in light of recent events. I would like to create a simple base argument based off two main concepts that are the cause of these shootings the primary one is mental illness or the intent to do harm. Sometimes people just want to harm others and this is not always because of a mental illness it is a decision they decided we must come to terms with that. The second is the way in which access to guns is granted. The primary one I base my opinion on is the implications and ideas on gun control currently and that the primary cause of these situations is mental illness or intent to harm first and foremost. Gun control is a complex issue and is being forced based off emotional responses rather than informed logic and understanding. 1. Mental illness is more to blame than gun control. If someone wants to hurt people they will find a way to. Other countries may not have mass shootings as often but they have stabbings, serial killers, theft, and other criminal actions. You want to cause mass damage to life there are a multitude of ways such as bombs, vehicles, knives, any object can be used to kill and if someone is intent of harming others they will do so. Having a gun allows for a faster way in which to harm others but if it is not around the person will find another way to harm others. Serial Killers are still a thing in every society, so are rapists. These people intend to do harm and they will find a way. 2.Taking away semi automatic rifles is not a good idea The idea of gun control is to put a limit on weapons that can take life on a mass scale and I will get to the gun control I believe we can agree on later. The problem with this idea of a limit comes down to the idea of what if X happens. The popular argument of those who support the right to bear arms is for civilians to be able to protect themselves from tyranny. If civilians are limited in their form to protect themselves how would they fight back? Imagine you only have a handgun and all your neighbors have a hand gun and the government turns on the people and the military starts bombing us, how would you fight back with just a pistol against automatic rifles? It would be nothing but suicide. I have heard several people say this is an outdated thought but the reality is it can happen and will happen again just look at history and other countries. Look at what ISIS has done. A group with weapons against civilians without. This is a base idea of just in case we need to be able to protect ourselves. Shit happens that's not always good, the right to bear arms was for those situations. Now we can all agree though no sane person needs a rocket launcher in there back yard but we should not surrender the means to protect ourselves and our rights to freedom. 3. Making a list of people with guns is not a good idea I have read this several times and discussed this with people its related to the point above. If the worst happens and there is a list of people with guns those people will be the first to suffer. The government does not need to know what you have to protect yourself as it can be used against them in a tyrannical situation. The Nazis kept known Jewish people in camps by knowing who they were, worst case scenario having a list of people with weapons is a dumb idea. If you want a scenario in which it is a bad idea just remember debt collectors know where you live and harrass you if it was a military looking to disarm, harm, or other bad intentions they would not have a problem targeting those that could stand up against them with the same information and a list of gun owners. 4. Guns are not a bad thing. Guns themselves are not bad they are objects. The primary use for most people should be self protection. Police and emergency services are first responders not protectors. Your life is only your responsibility to protect no one else. The military is not going to stop someone who wants to harm you it is up to you alone. Guns are on a small scale a way to protect ones self in a scenario of someone intending to harm your life, and on a broad scale a way to prevent tyranny by providing a more level playing field between civilians and military powers. Saying they are bad because they are a weapon is the same thing as saying a baseball is bat is bad or mace because they can be used to protect ones self. We can argue the idea of using non lethal force but when someone is using lethal force against the average person they should do everything they can to stay alive. 5. What Needs to change. We do need new controls and laws but these laws should be in training and mental illness checks. Possibly some other restraints on who can own a gun. Training helps prevent accidents from happening and provides a foundation from which every owner has a base level of competency in operating a gun safely. Mental illness checks at set intervals would need a proper way to be done without a list because of the aforementioned issues but would allow a level of control on stopping someone in a bad mindset from harming others. Gun free zones should not be a thing. This seems like a good idea at first no one can have a gun here, but no one can have a gun has two sides. No one should bring a gun here to stop people from harming others also means no one should bring a gun here to protect themselves and others. As said before if someone intends harm what do they care that they are not supposed to have something in a place? They are not going to decide, oh its a gun free zone let me not go here, the mass shootings occur in places people can not protect themselves as it is an area of vulnerability. The base idea is, if some person wants to hurt you with a stick and everyone in this area is not supposed to have a stick, they can bring it to that area then they can hit everyone their stick and no one can hit them with one back because they don't have one to protect themselves. This is not an avocation for guns this is an avocation for not making an emotional judgement on something that has broad implications. Things do need to change we can all see that but we must also understand the consequences of our actions and make an informed decision. Not everyone on this planet is good, some will harm others, but we must also realize mental illness of people who intend to do harm is the primary cause and issue. "

But it's getting on my nerves to see ignorant people who don't actually understand bitcoin gloat about it crashing and dismissing it as a scam, the truth is a lot more nuanced. Anything that can be said of bitcoin's lack of intrinsic value, or the value based on nothing more than consumer confidence, can be said of any currency. This goes for bitcoin, dollars, and even gold. ""Real"" currencies collapse all the time, see the Weimar Republic era of Germany or more recently, hyperinflation in Zimbabwe. It can happen with the dollar or euro one day. Even gold is not a sure thing. People think gold will protect them if their country's currency collapses, but the truth is that gold too relies on a demand for gold. It doesn't matter if its a metal, paper, or digital currency - it relies on people believing in its value and using it. So to condemn bitcoin as if the same fatal flaw doesn't apply to any currency is ignorant. Nor is it a scam anymore than paper money is a scam. New bitcoins are generated by people making bitcoin transactions, true, but the same can be said of currency - if everyone stopped using dollars to conduct transactions, we wouldn't make any more dollars and the dollar too would lose its value. You might say that because bitcoins are data and data can be erased, that makes bitcoin more vulnerable than other currencies, but guess what - if every computer in the world crashed right now, it would destroy ""real"" currencies and the paper money in your wallet would become worthless. Virtually all currencies are dependent on computer data at this point, and the same vulnerability applies. All currency is fragile, but bitcoin does offer us something worthwhile - protecting privacy. Why do you think governments are cracking down on it? Because they see it as a threat. If they thought it was inconsequential and could never be a widespread currency, they would have ignored it. A huge reason for bitcoin crashing now is because governments are trying to sabotage it, and maybe it's not unreasonable to be concerned about that. Is it not a sign of tyranny that governments are now trying to tell us that we cannot conduct transactions in ways we see fit? I may not use bitcoin myself but I find it incredibly disturbing that if Person A wants to sell something to Person B and they both consent to using bitcoin as currency, that there is a government telling them they are not allowed to do. Is that any less an example of tyranny than a government agent coming to shut down a garage sale? I for one hope that some form of cryptocurrency takes off, before everything we buy and sell becomes tracked by the state. "

If someone calls another a mean name and they cry, it's a sign that they can't handle hostility. If a person is stressed to the point where they cry in public, it shows emotional instability. If a person cries for any reason whatsoever, it is a sign of an emotional weakness or vulnerability. It's unprofessional to cry on the job. It's socially unacceptable to cry during a comedy show or other venue. There are many places where crying shouldn't happen.

It humanizes Tony in a way that makes him very realistic and understandable from an audience point of view. Heroes aren't bullet proof, and seeing this mental vulnerability is what makes Iron Man 3's Tony Stark so interesting. Just like the best Batman movies focus on Bruce Wayne, Iron Man 3 is the best of the Iron Man movies -- the plot isn't forced like it was in Iron Man 2, and the Mandarin twist turned out to be great (seriously, can you imagine how silly it would be to see Iron Man fight a wizard with magical rings?)"

So if you're a man, think before you respond. (Probably women too bc this is a VERY ingrained idea in this culture, and women have internalized it). There is nothing wrong with being a gold digger. Every person brings a set of personal attributes that amount to a desirability level- that is why beautiful women are ""10's."" Moreover, mammals have a specific vulnerability for females, the need to have the young cared for, driving women to value the ability to acquire resources. Now, when a man is rich, he doesn't date 2's and 3's, right? He dates 10's! And EVERYONE agrees if he can get them, he should. But when the woman, who has the exact same ability to bring attractiveness (her assets, just like his money), somehow that is the worst thing a woman can be. It's just hypocritical bc some men hate that women have that ability when they never will. In fact, I just got banned from another sub for saying this to a young woman. So- if you look at this from a pure value perspective, why shouldn't a woman use her value to acquire the most resources she can? When *men do the exact same thing-* use their resources to acquire the most value he can?"

It oppresses women at a socio economic level, and it oppresses men on an emotional and mental level. The media feeds women the idea that they should fill certain roles (Nurses, Teachers, Mothers) while feeding men the idea that they are emasculate if they show emotion or vulnerability. Talking about gender as if it only oppresses women or men, but not both, is exactly the sort of thing that acts to further the divide and separation.

I got so excited yesterday morning, that while I was cooking and eating I put on Iron Man and Avengers in the background. And right now, Im watching Sam Raimis Spider-Man 3. I am one of the few that *really liked this movie*. It was successful financially, but over the years it gets a lot of hate because of the convoluted cast of villains, Peter Parker dancing, and overall hard-to-take-seriously. I can partially agree that with the little time the movie had was not enough to flesh out the villains more fully. If they had done Spider-Man 3 as a sort of mini saga spread out a cross two movies, it might have worked better for the general public. But in keeping with the comic book tone, what they did works perfectly. It had three classic comic book style villains. &gt;-Harry Osborne, the overarching villain plot-line that carries over across multiple episodes/movies/comic books. Couple this with the classic comic book saga of We used to be friends, a long time ago. &gt;-Sandman, the misunderstood villain that wasnt *really* a villain, that stumbles upon a superpower. &gt;-Venom, the anomaly, the thing from outer space that no one could have seen coming. Its true that I would have liked MORE of each of the villains, but its still only a two-hour movie. It made the treat more urgent for the audience, because there were actually threats coming at Spider-Man from all sides. And then, theres the unnamed fourth villain that is Peters personal life, the other thing that everyone hates, but I found hilarious. It was Peter Park turning emo and careless and dancing all over the place. What people fail to accept when they hate on this movie is that this is Peters red kryptonite story. It works perfectly in stark contrast with his no longer a superhero story in Spider-Man 2. In that previous movie, he sheds the uniform after losing his powers, and enjoys life as normally as possible, accepting vulnerability, and assuming all the normal responsibilities that come with being normal and vulnerable. But with his red kyrptonite story, which is also a classic comic book/superhero tale, its about the lack of responsibility and being careless, selfish, and ironically not really being himself. Which is also a very human thing to do (who doesnt act up one or twice or a zillion times in their life when things get shitty?). He had just been manipulated into thinking his best friend and girlfriend had betrayed him and practically lost his job. And you know what? Its a pg-13 movie, so theyre likely just simply not telling the audience that Peter Parker was drunk and high on meth during that whole period. Im serious. The overarching storyline across the three movies regarding Harry and the death of his father, the goon who had become a powerful being that could control sand, the strange anonaly from outer space, and Peter Parkers personal problems all these together add up to put together a classic style comic book story. And with touches of Sam Raimis personal style that combines horror and camp, I still think its one of the best movies ever. *Edit: some formatting and grammar*"

This discussion was brought about after some confusion as to why their analysts werent able to detect a breach. After the standard security consulting services were delivered, we discussed the subject of talent in the industry. The customer began describing some of the entries in their employee's resumes. Many of these candidates look great on paper, but conversing with them and reviewing their work reveals how misleading those resumes are. There was even a guy who fabricated 6 years of experience. He actually had 0 years of relevant experience, but had a verified Master's degree in IT security, recently obtained. Granted, that's falsifying information, but I would at least expect someone with a Master's degree in IT security have a basic understanding of fundamentals; he did not. This problem seems to be a trend in my line of work; information technology is a booming industry and is becoming saturated with people who portray themselves as talented and qualified, but fail to perform in the field. Im learning the same problem is also present in other fields as well. Feel free to weigh in, I'm very curious. I gained most of my experience through active duty Army service, but took online schooling while enlisted. I was not impressed by the curriculum my college had to offer, but followed through to get the piece of paper for the check-mark vastly overrated by our society. I didn't expect much from my college experience though, so I didn't feel it was relevant to compare against. The company I work for has a program for mentoring college folks with internships. One of the students I'm mentoring is taking a cybersecurity program through a well-known, well-respected university. After looking at some of her books, I noticed several of them were published over a decade ago and conveyed incorrect or outdated information. Her professor was also not privy to much outside of these books, so when she asked questions, he recited quotes from the books and left her confused and frustrated. I looked over the entire curriculum and noticed an obvious lack of quality content which appeared to be hobbled together objectives from generic Google searches and buzz words. When I asked her how the delivery occurs, it appears much of the learning is conducted through constructivism - that is, regurgitating information from the outdated materials in small groups of students. I also notice a huge knowledge gap when conversing with coworkers fresh out of college which reinforces the frustrations my current customer has. I understand there will be field experience gaps however, not understanding fundamentals straight out of college is a bit concerning, but also completely understandable given the curriculum my mentee is paying $80k for. The more time I spend observing the product of our academic system, the more I feel the American society devalues academics in general and instead caters to feeding the corporate abyss. If you look at the primary functions of grade school through college, our society tends to focus heavily on socialization in non-academic capacities, internalizing ultra-nationalism, and competing in athletics. I dont think this is by accident."

Although I'm not majoring in CS (for reasons I'm about to mention), I'd like to share some of my observations about our program and CS in general: Most people would tell you that CS is, by far, the best major you could pick for a BS. CS offers an excellent starting salary, very easy work, and most importantly, an exploding job market. Sites like Code.org throw around statistics like ""58% of all new jobs created are in computing, yet only 8% of graduates are majoring in a computing-related field!"" However, statistics like only bring up an important question: if there's such a huge demand for CS majors and such little supply, how do companies get the software developers they need? The answer to this question is the crux of my argument. Because there aren't enough CS majors to fill demand, companies resort to hiring *anyone* with programming experience to develop for them. If you have a working knowledge of basic programming and data structures and a decent portfolio, then there are software companies lined up waiting to hire you. No degree required. There's also another factor: software development is generally very easy to learn. No complex math or physics is required, one just needs to understand the latest framework to get into the field. As a result, there's almost no barrier that's stopping people from entering entry-level software. To exploit this phenomena, a new trend of ""online coding bootcamps"" have become popular. They promise that in just 6 months, *anyone* can develop a working knowledge of programming. How much do these bootcamps cost? Around ~$500, which is about 1% the cost of the average 4-year tuition. The question now becomes, ""why should I spend 4 years and tens of thousands of dollars when I can just take a coding bootcamp?"" Compared to a coding boot camp, which teaches you exactly what you need to know and nothing more, a 4-year CS curriculum is bloated full of university requirements and esoteric, useless classes. In industry, nobody cares that you took a class such as ""underwater basket weaving,"" they only care whether you know what you need to know to perform your job well. People argue that ""bootcamps don't properly prepare you for a job in software,"" but that simply isn't true. Look at the number of liberal arts/pure science/no degree holders (who started out in coding boot camps) now working alongside CS degree holders in entry level software. It's astounding. I think that when most people think of computer science as a college major, buzzwords such as ""machine learning"" ""AI"" and ""cybersecurity"" pop into mind, but the reality is that you simply don't learn enough of this material in a BS degree to get a relevant job in one of those fields. It takes a Master's, usually even a PhD, to end up with a job that does groundbreaking work in any of these ""cool"" fields. Otherwise, most BS grads are relegated to taking web/app development ""code monkey"" jobs - the same jobs that most boot camp devs could get. I will concede that, for anyone who wants to pursue a Master's or PhD in CS, obtaining a BS degree first is the only viable option - but let's be real, few people do this because most people prefer to go into industry for the better pay. The truth about computer science is that the only reason why developers are so sought after is because there's a *widespread public ignorance* about how computers work. People who haven't worked in software seem to greatly overvalue the difficulty of developing software, only because they see that demand exceeds supply. However, this simply isn't true, and as more and more people become comfortable with technology, they'll realize how easy it is to develop code. People will realize that it doesn't take a 4 year degree to become a good software developer. tldr: coding boot camps are significantly cheaper and less-time consuming than a 4-year computer science degree, but given the state of the job market, most entry level jobs in software will hire people who graduated from either a boot camp or university."

In college I would constantly get rejected by women, despite being muscular and not a boring ass person. This caused my self-esteem to plummet and I was willing to date any woman regardless of how ugly she was or how terrible she was as a person. After college I landed an 80k a year cybersecurity job, this for some unknown reason made women more attracted to me, but only women who were in the same league of looks as I was. These same women rejected me in college and now wanted to mooch off of me. I worked hard to get UGLY (inside and out) gold diggers. If I were two inches taller or got a rhinoplasty I wouldn't have to deal with these types of women that often, hell I might find my soulmate because two inches of added height and a rhinoplasty makes THAT much of an impact on dating. I'm not saying I wouldn't run into horrible women after increasing the size of my dating pool, but I would run into higher quality women more often. Instead I'm stuck within a small dating pool of mediocre women who aren't even legitimately attracted to me. "
