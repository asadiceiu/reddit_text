0,vulnerability,depression,My desire to succeed is dwindling(long),1,i3vb8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/i3vb8n/my_desire_to_succeed_is_dwindlinglong/,2020-08-05 10:30:55,"I am a 16 year old girl and an 11th year student(junior). Over the past years of Highschool I have become less motivated. I do maintain okay to good grades. My freshman year I had a 4.00, and my sophomore year I had a 3.8 gpa. But, with junior year about to begin my motivation isnt there. At the start of Highschool I was already not motivated, and I kind of just went through the motions. Luckily, I am a people pleaser. So, even if I am not motivated in the slightest I think about how my teachers would perceive me. I want them to see me as a good student. The last time I genuinely did work just for myself was elementary school. I feel like I am incredibly inadequate. English is my only strong area, and I take college level courses for it. I also take journalism, and creative writing. I love writing. The thing is I absolutely dislike math. I am taking a normal level math class(algebra 2). It is a chore for me to study and pay attention in class when it comes to math. I have to exert so much self restraint to concentrate. Sometimes I get into such a negative state of mind that I cant even hear the teacher explaining the math. I drown everything out, and then I quickly get lost. I really cannot understand how someone would enjoy math. But, the problem that I am starting to become aware of is that the stem field Majors earn the most. I cant just become a journalist. It is not a viable career option. Journalism is a dying field. It is all so disheartening. I am sub par at anything stem field related, and so I am destined to just have a terrible low paying job. I want more for myself, but I cannot do a stem field job. I am always wondering what I envision for my future career. I am not that passionate about anything else. The only other thing that I might want to do is psychology. I have thought about becoming a clinical psychologist. But really, I dont even have a vague sense of what my future could look like. In school we had to take a career analysis assessment. When my results came back it stated that based off of my interests no career areas were found. I dont even know how that is possible. I was the only one in my class that that happened to. And to add on I have not had any friends since I was 12 or 13 and in the 7th grade. And even when I did have ""friends"" they werent really friends. It was more so just people that I occasionally talked to, or hung out with during breaks. I have severe to moderate social anxiety. Online schooling and social distancing has not improved my anxiety in social situations. I cant fathom school opening, and having to interact with others in person. And I want to make it clear that I am not a misanthrope. I do enjoy people, and the interesting qualities and experiences they hold. I like talking to others, but fear is what hinders me from doing so. My irrational fears have trapped me within a cycle of self isolation. And I know my fears are irrational, but It seems as if there is a roadblock that stops me from overcoming the power of my thoughts. I have no grip on how I want to feel, and even the tiniest intrusive thought can make me plummet into a full blown session of self deprecation. For the past 4 years I have been stuck. Every time that I have tried to befriend someone it usually ends within a short period. We will hang out for a couple of weeks, and then they will become bored of me. I dont know exactly why. I am quiet, so maybe they take this as a sign of being aloof. I cant pinpoint why. And I do like being alone. I can enjoy being alone for longer periods of time than the average person. But, there comes a point in which being alone turns into loneliness. I start to think about cool things that I could be doing if I had friends. I start to think about all the friendships that I am missing out on. I have this irrational fear that when I talk to someone they will think I am an idiot. They will come to the same conclusions as I have; that I am in fact ugly, stupid, weird, and a slew of other negative qualities. And I have this worrying suspicion that maybe all of my irrational thoughts and feelings are true. What if all my life ever equates to is failed attempts at social interactions? What if I never experience deep and meaningful friendships that I carry with me for a lifetime? I havent had a friend since I was 12. Its not that I get bullied. My peers treat me normally, but I dont enjoy being vulnerable. I know that friendship, when basically analyzed is a swapping of information. You share intimate details with someone else, and in that way your platonic relationship feels, and is different than the ones you share with random people or acquaintances. But, I cant seem to commit myself to that. My lack of vulnerability with others leads them to get bored of me, and I completely understand. It is my fault, not theirs. I used to attend therapy a year ago, but stopped. After 3 sessions I quit. Its not because I didnt like my therapist. They were very kind and affable. But, the truth is I lied. I lied to save myself perceived embarrassment. I lied about how I want to kill myself. I downplayed my morbid thoughts about death. I downplayed my social anxiety, and how much it does interfere with my relationships, and day to day life. Therapy became a game of, ""lets show the therapist I am normal and dont need therapy."" I have never had those hallmark teenage rites of passage. And I know it is stupid to get caught up in these, but I want it so badly. I want to feel normal. I would rather peak in Highschool knowing that I collected all the teenage rites of passage. If I have peaked(which I believe is true) I am absolutely pathetic. I dont know how to help myself at this point. This feeling of destiny is overwhelming. I feel doomed(which I know it is so pessimistic), but I cant seem to help it. I know, that from a objective perspective these thoughts are irrational, but I still let it control me. I have so many intrusive thoughts. I am tired of getting the same worn out responses telling me that it will get better. I am so worn out by the everyday tasks of life. The normal things seem so daunting to me, and exhaust me. What truly scares me and keeps me up at night, is that my life hasnt even really started. I am just at the precipice. How can I except to flourish in adulthood when I am already so tired, and on the verge of giving up? I dont want to do this anymore, and I am trying so hard not to give up. I am trying not to hate myself, but I just cant commit. Everything is out of reach."

And I mean really vent like complete vulnerability or is it just me? I always feel like unintentionally pushed the person away by allowing them to see how broken or damaged I may be.
2,vulnerability,depression,I thought I fixed my depression but I'm still troubled. Could it be something else?,1,i7awjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/i7awjg/i_thought_i_fixed_my_depression_but_im_still/,2020-08-11 04:49:44,"I'm a 25 year old male who has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression after a series of panic attacks and one breakdown that lead to a suicide attempt. I've been prescribed medication, went through some therapy, and got away from some the things that were causing me additional stress like where I lived and the job I had. For the most part when I look back on all the things I've been through its clear that I've made a lot of progress and I'm doing much better than before. That being said I've been struggling with another issue that's been slowly getting worse. I hadn't brought it up to any of my doctors before since the other issues were way more severe and immediately life threatening. My ability to manage my social relationships (both with significant others or with friends) have been deteriorating. I feel as if all of my mental problems are showing through my attempts to fix them and the people around me are actually bothered by them. Lately even when I hang out with people I've known for a long time, I get overwhelmed with this idea that it is only a matter of time until they realize that being my friend is too much trouble than what I am worth. When I am meeting new people (particularly girls I'm seeing) I tend to take a defense stance and anticipate rejection even though I really don't want to. In fact with girls in particular, I find it more and more difficult to be emotionally intimate since I worry that they might see my vulnerability as being weak. I get a lot of stress when I think about doing things in social circles with a lot of unfamiliar people and I've found myself leaving parties early or finding excuses not to go even though I really miss being around my community. When I see my friends effortlessly meet new people and make new relationships I can't help but feel extremely jealous and left behind, especially when they mention social events that happened without me/are planning to do without me. My rational brain knows that this makes no sense but lately my rational brain has been losing this battle. With COVID-19, its been really difficult to see a professional so I wanted to ask this community... Has anyone experienced something similar? Is this a recognized thing? Does anyone know what I can do to get this under control? Or is this just a personal problem?"
3,vulnerability,depression,I think I'm unable to be honest with myself.,1,ia28d5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ia28d5/i_think_im_unable_to_be_honest_with_myself/,2020-08-15 15:57:24,"A few days ago, a friend of mine was talking about a coworker of mine and said how she was a lot like me, one of the reasons being because we're both ""empaths."" Another friend of mine tagged me in a zodiac meme about how my sun sign (Pisces Sun, but I'm a Virgo Moon and Aquarius Rising/ dominant) is naturally empathetic, and more in-touch with their feelings than other signs. And I just haven't felt right about myself since then, as trivial as it may sound. That was never the image I wanted to create for myself. If I had to use a quote to describe the way I navigate through my emotions, it would be ""conceal, don't feel."" I think I'm pretty good at hiding them, and many people have expressed that I'm ""hard to read."" However, I think I just try too hard to be outwardly cold, just to avoid emotional confrontation, to improve my self-esteem so I can actually feel like I have more worth that goes outside what I'm feeling, and because I don't want to fit in the stereotypical emotional female image. There's probably some other reasons too, but these are the only reasons I have a conscious awareness of. I actually feel proud when people call me cold, robotic, emotionless, and other similar words. I mean, I have always thought that negative emotions were irrational and just got in the way, but that doesn't mean I haven't felt them. I know that denying my feelings, straight-up ignoring them, and denying my whole identity has been the root cause of my pain for several years now, but I can't bring myself to be that vulnerable. Especially when I have a group of very unaccepting friends who scoff at people's displays of emotional vulnerability, and even make fun of it behind people's backs. I've built walls around myself. I can't even open up around some of my closest friends because I don't want to shatter that barrier. I just wanted to be the tough one, the role model that seems to have everything together, the one who is actually taken seriously. But at what cost? Am I just being too mean to myself? I desperately want to open up, but not at the cost where my value as a person is being placed on my feelings, where I'm not taken seriously anymore. I feel like people are often completely judged by their feelings and I just don't want that to be the way I'm perceived. I just want to open up when I have to and forget about it once the opening up is done. I'd rather be judged for my accomplishments, the work I do, things that don't feel superficial."

I havent had a job since March and my depression got worse. I think Im actually at my rock bottom. Honestly everyone, I dont want a job, because when Ive had a Job things just get progressively worst, I get more depressed and start to have suicidal ideation. I can fake the shit out of people, people will think Im this upbeat, happy, jolly person, but Im writhing in misery. The people that I tend to meet as coworkers are either very understanding of my major depression disorder or are narcissistic pricks who slurp up the self loathing and vulnerability that Im energetically putting off. Im wasting my time working a 9-5 and why do I feel this way is because Im in no place to be putting myself in a cyclical cycle of insanity. Im a very approachable person and I really am kind so unfortunately I put out a vibe that people are gravitated towards. And I hate it  I cant even keep a friendship because my depression has become my priority. Its real shitty but its what is necessary right now. Also I cant have a job that pays me over 1,200 or I lose my state health insurance. So Im in this limbo state of what do I do?? Im working at creating a support network which is my therapist, my Peer Counselor, and a Crisis Line. My support network is whats keeping me alive. Im 26F and I still live with my mom and she has Narcissistic tendencies so its not at all a good living situation. Its making my depression worst. But what is a saving grace in all of this is that I love art. Art is what is saving my life as well as my support group. And Im working at selling things on my Etsy Shop so that I can have some income coming in that way. I just need to make enough to pay my bills, but it will take some time before that happens :/ Its a really hard process to push myself when Im depressed and to create art because I start thinking about my living situation but I have no other option. I didnt know if I should have posted anything on this forum because I dont know what type of response Im going to get.....the obvious answer is to just change my mindset and get a job and just focus on saving money to move out but thats not how my story is going. I wish that I could be that strong but Im on the brink of wanting to take my life so that answer is invalid. Is there anyone else who is going through something similar?"

So I tended to neglect my family and sibling and never showed any form of support , I was selfish and felt like its not fair they get help when I never got one. My parents always gave me that kind of tough love so I never show my vulnerability and they always question why Iam always cold around them but not with my friends. And when my mum found out through a paper that my sister wished to die and she told me that we should be more nicer, the first thought was like I almost killed myself but no one cared but now yall are supportive. I know thats bad and i wanna eat myself for such a thought and for jealousy to over take me. And I wanna fix this but each time I try , I can never do it . Iam mad at myself I can never show any form of emotion , I cant help my siblings, I dont them to go thru what I went thru. And I feel like I left them behind when I left for university."

I love the sensitivity part because it gives me a sort of vulnerability to humble myself and also is great to use when creating and writing songs. But when the wave of self doubt and procrastination come it completely ruins my groove. As an upcoming artist it can become really difficult to continue being ambitious and outgoing when Im dying inside. Its hard to voice this to my music friends cause guys dont really share that type of stuff, so that just reinforces the feeling of being alone. If anyone can relate to their depression killing ambition Id love to hear your experience!"

Idk wtf was inside me that pushed me talk to him. I desperately needed someone to talk to and I couldn't find anyone so I ended up texting him. He has always been a creep and he's still the same. 0 changes. Indeed he has worked on his animal instincts and has become even more pathetic. A week later, my dad expired and every one was busy faking concerns. But he did something different, he took that time to take advantage of my vulnerability and started asking me shit like what do I feel about him, what kind of a person I think he is and do I still feel for him or not. He asked me these questions because he thought that I am vulnerable and I will speak the truth. Rather than supporting me and just being there, he took his time to be the Shittiest ass one can ever come across. None of my friends have been by my side in this time. I feel ashamed for trusting such losers. For confiding in them and thinking that they would be there for me. Guess what? At the end of this, I hate myself and I miss my dad. I have realized that no one is there for anybody ever."

My mind feels like its built on a foundation of shattered glass. I try to not think about it, and I don't want to share because I hate the feeling of vulnerability. I hate that all I have to look forward to is these brief moments of acceptable happiness and then my brain punishes me for anything that goes wrong. It feels like all I have to look forward to when I'm happy is this emptiness. And I dont know what to do anymore. I don't know how to go forward anymore. It just feels like I keep getting pushed back into a hole. Again I'm sorry. I dont know that I want some magical solution, or a promise that there's a way to get better.

Looking for ways to make some writing friends? I'm looking to start online writing workshops, probably through Zoom or Google, with structured prompts and sharing/ discussion, and I'm trying to get a feel for the interest in it. During the last school year I interned for a program where we facilitated creative writing workshops in Jails and Community Corrections, and it was definitely one of the most fun and impactful things I've ever done in my life. While we always centered everything around the writing, some of the vulnerable convos I've ever had about mental health came from those times. The writing and the conversations were so full of vulnerability and passion, it really helped me to be the person I am today. I really think it could help out other folks as well Then MRS. Rona shut those down. I'm looking to start up a online writing workshop in the same vein as those workshops, open to anyone, while still keeping numbers somewhat manageable. Any one interested in participating/ helping me get something started ? Or does anyone know of a similar online group/meetup?"
14,vulnerability,depression,*A LOT OF TRIGGERS*Ive caused all hurt thats ever happened to me and Im so tired of it all,1,hxykmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hxykmt/a_lot_of_triggersive_caused_all_hurt_thats_ever/,2020-07-26 11:54:02,"Ive never been scared to want to kill myself, or people who have hurt someone Ive loved so much . Im actually very comfortable with leaving I just wish my family would understand.i know thats so stupid to say, but in a way to not hurt them, I wish it was understandable to just let me relieve myself from this all. Every single day I guess is another day I try to stay because I know thats not possible right now for them to understand and let me go . Its so frustrating that I have to just tolerate my mind and stay here but I guess in a way thats selfish of me too towards them but I dont mean to be. This is not just a phase or a sad moment I get in, I always have this if I dont distract myself eith something in life, if I dont distract myself and stay busy I start to feel stuck again and I get comfortable staying there and then I remember my family. I used to always want my own family because my family has always been the reason I stay everyday and I feel like if I had my own, even if I were by myself with my own kid I would have that love and need to stay and want to because Ill actually feel whole. I have done so much wrong in my life and sometimes growing up it was intentional so that I would have something turn out to hurt me emotionally. Im already hurt and bringing more will just give me more reason to outweigh the family part to leave. Its my sisters birthday so I cant do anything. Ive fucked up almost every stupid holiday. Or had some fucked up shit happen on those days . Thanksgiving was when molestation and sexual abuse started in childhood first with my sister (stopped in teens)which the uncle is who Im speaking of that I have hateful crime thoughts about. I know I was hurt but I blocked it out and as long as I tell myself it was my fault I wont feel hurt from it but really the only reason why it kills me is because I saw my sister grow up so broken and see what it did to her and she held it in to keep the family from having conflict knowing how my dad would react and probably get him in prison. Ive seen her cut and attempt so many times and scream and seeing what he did to her. To turn her into that. From what he did, is what makes me have so much anger . Anger doesnt even come close to what I feel. I hate myself for planning on what to do to make him feel even a slight bit of violated and broken. I want to kidnap him and his bitch mother that knew about it all the years and allowed him to and kept me and my other sister away at night from him but would let her go. And would shut and lock our door . She hated her and my mom. My sister had another dad and lets call her Rose, Rose had that my dad left his first kid and girlfriend to be with my mom and took in and loved and cared after my sister as his own. Rose even admitted years later when this all came up that she knew and told her sick son that he better never let his brother know what he did because he would kill him. She never felt bad or cried or scolded him because she knew the whole time. In retaliation, she tried to take home from us that we bought. To sell and pay for his bail and help him get lawyer to go against it and after losing job for charge. The day she found out they arrested him she was driving me around day before prom , she was shaking and couldnt even look at me she was so angry and said she could even talk or look at me and said my dad needed to come get me and she couldnt wait 1 minute before just picking my shit up and throwing it in the car and driving crazily to my house. She couldnt even drop me off she told me she was so angry to get off car and I started to get off and drove off driving reckless on her way to get him out. Next day at school I was confused because I started to think of how wrong she was and even though I knew thinking about it would fuck me up I just kept placing myself there again and started to remember stuff that I wish I never ever saw again I wanted to bash his penis with a fuckjng hammer and scream . My cousin Jenessa knew something wrong were all weird and off about feelings and she asked if okay real quick and I angrily started to cry because how frustrated i was and told her I found out he had done to her and I saw and she was ready and said I think you need to go home leah and the nurse called my mom telling them I was crying hysterically but wasnt talking to her and was probably annoyed by me and i was so scared to tell my parents I hate crying or feeling any type of vulnerability to anyone especially my family because its stupid to me and makes me feel pathetic and feel under and I didnt want them feeling weird and reject me for crying. Both picked me up and asked what wrong and my mom started crying and held my hand. I hadnt felt her touch like that in so long. I always felt she was so disgusted of me and hated me. I always felt that she was creeped out by me and didnt want to touch me for any longer than a second before she felt uncomfortable by me. When I was maybe 5 when I started doing sexual stuff and masturbating and trying to feel the feeling again that I would feel. So gross even saying that. She had caught me one day maybe 6 and she angrily said what I was doing and I tried to play off and asked where I learned that but I just lied to cover up and not get spanked and she told her mom and my aunts and growing up since then everytime I tried to hug her or lay with her she would move away and annoyingly let me hug for half a second and I could feel her uncomfortable and she would push me away. Ever since then I stopped wanting that and scared of hugging her or having any physical touch to avoid making her feel grossed by me. I was 17 when she had held my hand actually wanting to where I never felt disgust from her. At the house she grabbed my by the shoulders and wrapped me in her arms . Eventually after catching breath I told them what I remembered but didnt understand as a kid. I knew it was weird or off or something wasnt right but didnt get it and realized why she would beg me to go with her restroom in middle of night at grandmas house and sometimes I would be so tired and fall back asleep or she always HAD to sleep in the middle of us and I remembered a lot of nights I would wake up and she would be coming back late or I would wonder where she went because I was scared and would go see the blue light from TV games from his room and perk and he would tell me to go back to sleep . I would always want to stay with her and as we got a little older she would called me stupid and make me cry and be mean to me and push me out of room . He would watch us bathe but I think I might have been so young because I remember how she looked so young and little so we must have been when first started . He would go into restroom with us and I would remember him saying he was just brushing teeth and my sister would cover me so I could go to restroom and he would say hes my uncle its okay for him to see. A lot of shit like that. My dads face was the most sober and ready to make a horrible decision. My mom tried to calm him down and he always wear dark ray bans and he never emotional and turned to wipe eyes under shades and I looked down whole time because I was scared I was going to get hurt idk why me but I did. He called his mom and told her to get her shit and get the fuck out of the house and cussed her out and said he never wanted to see her again. He left slammed front door and drove off and didnt come back til late late and later admitted he was going to kill him. But his close childhood friend called and so I guess dad talked with him and my other uncle and they went to calm him down and told him to give them the go and they would all go and take him out to the fields and brat the shit out of him and kill him. A lot shit happened during that time and that affected me having to bring that back up in my mind and opened a lot of problems again with me after I had forgot about it after the years. I was always going through hate and disgust with myself and a lot of self issues I hadnt known fully why to yet until that stuff got brought up again. Then seeing my sister go into a self destructive time again fucked me up even more . Affected my relationship and after opening up my mind for the case and having to think and see it all again really reallly fucked me up bad. I because a whole different person, left school to IS and was doing okay just forgot about it again and started working to constantly distract myself and got cheated on in long relationship and so I tried to see it as it was my fault because I wasnt there for him because I was distracted with all was happening . And maybe better for him to find better. Let him go and down the road felt bad for a guy people made fun of at work and they bugged me to date him jokingly and I got angry towards them and felt bad and ended up learning about him to liked him and make him feel happy and seeing him grow and feel happy and confident made me feel good . Eventually he got super comfortable eith me and started being a jerk and very cocky and talk me down and like to feel in control because I would boost him and lower mysef to make him feel better and I guess he caught into that and loved it and loved making fun of me and being so cocky and make me feel like I had no say and I would never be mean back or speak up for myself even though I would have if it were a random girl treating me that way I would have gone off. But I didnt want to hurt him. I didnt want to hurt him or his feelings but it was so frustrating seeing someone turn like that when i was supposed to be his partner? He put a password on his phone and would stop seeing me and never text me at all except for a random day he would say  here and be like a dead zombie with me and never wanted to have me around any more. Always talk about a girl at new work then I never heard about again. then stopped wanting any sexual activity completely for months and finally I talked to a girl at work about it and she was a cheater and told me to leave him. I felt bad and couldnt because I loved him . I started to like him and wanted to be eith him . I tried to brainwash myself that I was doing nothing wrong and think that I wasnt in a relationship and slept with him and continued to because I wanted to be with him. When I started showing that I didnt want to be with my bf anymore, he wanted me and I asked about the girl and he then had shit to say about her and how much of a dumb bitch she was and how much he hated her and when I would ask why though and he would get stuck and say he just hated her and I could see him lock up and get nervous and try to play it cool. All of a sudden he wanted to try for me and I said WHY NOW. WHY NOW WHAT HAPPENED DURING THESE MONTHS YOU DIDNT WANT ME and he couldnt answer and so I broke up with him . I stayed with the other guy and I was happy and then we started having problems because I got jealous when I would see him with girls at work and I never got jealous before getting cheated on. I never ever had any type of problems until then. I was scared for it to happen again so I would get angry and act out. After some time I left job and went to another place and while there I lost a close friend, he killed himself and I stull feel like it was my fault because I wasnt there for him. Another story for another time. After knowing that had I never stopped convo with him and left him with his problems to deal with , I was so scared to lose anyone else and felt in a way to make it the same scenario and feel like I can stop him I would actually care to talk to anyone if they needed to open up. One guy there told me his dad died and a friend of his had killed himself and that he has been so depressed and suicidal that really hurt me feeling like I was in time again. I tried talking him out of it and doing what someone would to to avoid that. We connected on that and I liked talking to him in a way feeling like speaking to someone like how my friend was in that state of mind and this guy was, I could talk to him again and not repeat the same mistake I first did. My bf started asking questions about who he was on my sc and he never was anything to me at all besides me trying to fix my mind and my mistake and help him. And stupid as I am one day he invited me to eat early before work because as always he had to just vent about his dad and it got annoying after time because I felt he was fine until I would ignore him and he would pull that card and I would get mad b scared that he was being serious. I went and as soon as I sat to talk in his car, he was happy?? And I was scared to call him out on it or ask what and offend him, and he told me he liked me and put his hand on my thigh and I just froze I was in my head like no no no its not going to happen its not going to happen and I kind of forced a nervous laugh and he started to talk about how I make him feel better and Im there for him and stupid sentimental shit that he couldnt ever imagine not having me in his life because I help him as hes caressing my thigh and inside I wanted to fucking scream I wanted to say GET THE FUCK OFF WHAT THE FUCK but I couldnt I was just stuck and tried to act like I was okay and he asked what I thought and said you like me too right? And I just asked hat time it was I didnt want to be late and thats was my attempt to move his hand and he said there was time to talk and anyways he leaned to kiss me and he kissed me and I felt so sick to my stomach. I felt so gross and all I could think about was wanting to be with my bf and how much I regretted even trying to help this guy. I hated my friend for this . It wasnt his fault but because he killed himself and he left and fucked my mind up and left me with guilt I was stuck here because of this stupid shit. I hate when my bf says I could have said no or pushed him off or screamed but I was fucking scared! I just couldnt do anything I was stuck. I just tried to act like I wasnt there . I avoided him for weeks and he asked what was wrong and I just said no nothings wrong? And he said I seemed like avoiding him and I denied it and he said so were okay? And I said yeah ? But I was so angry, but more at myself because wtf why can I go off on a random person but I cant fucking scream at someone whos touching me in a way I hate from him????? Im so stupid. I felt so guilty around my bf. I cheated and I hate myself for it because i could have spoke up for myself and said no and not cared about offending him or hurting his feelings and just told him I didnt feel comfortable. I was scared of telling someone that. Even talking to him to help him was the start of wrong. I wish I never cheated ever . There is no excuse absolutely NO fucking excuse. I should have kicked and screamed because fuck whats the worst they would do? Kill me? Get offended and feel uncomfortable? Now I speak my mind completely freely . I call anyone out that tries any shit with me. I really dont care anymore because if they try to make me feel uncomfortable, thats not okay. I dont need to tolerate it just to avoid hurting other peoples feelings. I wish I never learned this way. I really fucked up my relationship and soon after he found out, we separated to give him time to think about it and heal and when I called the guy to tell him I couldnt and didnt want to be in his life and that day my bf found out I went to meet him and got angry and left that night to go hookup with a bitch he once jokingly asked me is he should text and ask her if she wanted a threesome. They hooked up and he told me in Valentines Day when we were back together. Only because he slipped up. Later on I ended up getting pregnant and wanted it. I was just looking for someone to tell me I should have it looking for confirmation and not judgment. I ended up going to have an abortion and even while in the office I wished I had him in there to see the look in my eyes of how much I really didnt want to do that. They showed me the baby laying in there innocently and clueless of what I was about to do. I saw for a few seconds his heart beating perfectly good and strong. Doctor said it had a healthy heart and I wanted it so much more. Right before they gave me the pill I wanted to tell them I wanted to make a phone call but I was so scared that they would be upset and like really? After now having the pill in my hand. I teared up and put the pill in my mouth I was so numb. I walked out crying and hated myself. I wanted to make myself throw up but I know it wouldnt do a thing to the pill. Later I had the worst cramping and almost passed out when I felt it falling out as I was in the toilet and I caught it before it fell in. I saw it and it was the worst thing I have ever done. I held it and counted its fingers and toes over and over crying. It was eating good, I miss my pregnancy and I miss my baby so much. I remember never feeling alone after arguments with my bf. I remember I would drive home crying and think I had to do so much bettter and focus on my life for us. Me and the baby. That I could do it by myself and I would tell him that I loved him so much and hold my body close . I hated feeling stressed or depressed from arguments because I was so scared of the baby feeling that. I would talk to it to myself and say how I would raise it. I wanted it so bad. I know having him would have really changed me and made me happy too. I loved him the moment I sensed that I was pregnant. I loved him and was strictly eating good to prepare for a healthy pregnancy even though I was going along with my bf asking about the abortion. I held it off so long so that hopefully he would say it was too late and not have a choice but to keep it. But noticing that he really didnt want it really broke me. Because I was so confused I wanted it so bad. Its all Ive ever wanted. I have a cap that I kept from the restroom that I put him so that he wasnt in just a napkin. I saw how much developed he was and I felt like I was in a really really bad nightmare. Had I just told my sister, She would have told me to keep it. I was really close to but I was scared. I think about him all the time and wish everything back. I hate every stupid decision that Ive made. Its all because of me any hurt I have and any hurt others have. I wish I could just let go of everything and leave. Ive cause enough and I dont want to be here anymore"
15,vulnerability,depression,Struggles putting trust into romantic and friendly relationships,1,hykpew,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hykpew/struggles_putting_trust_into_romantic_and/,2020-07-27 13:25:34,"Im a 17 year old male. For the past, I would say seven to eight years I have been a pretty lonely person. In grade school my personality was so annoying that most people just didnt want to be around me, and even though Ive been in high school with all new people, Ive still had trouble creating relationships and friendships. I keep my body and mind strong, I know how pretentious that sounds but I workout and exercise daily, as well as read a lot and keep myself informed. Ive still remained friendless and lonely constantly. Im constantly riddled with self loathing and downright self hatred on the daily. Summers especially are the worst for me, since I dont have that guaranteed social interaction that school provides. I always end up just going to the gym daily, and spending the rest of my days wasting away, either reading, playing video games, or watching YouTube. Im tired of it, it sucks. Every time I summon the courage to ask people if I can hang out with them and they dont reject me or laugh in my face, I usually either get really quiet in an effort to not annoy them, or try an impress them or whatever so I can show them I have value, which never works. To make matters worse, my love life has faired even worse. Most girls who I end up talking to are put off by my emotional vulnerability, self hatred, and clinginess. Im such a mess, that I cant even make a relationship last more than 2 weeks. I was talking to one girl, and looking back on it, she was a major bitch, but she showed me attention, flirted with me heavily, and made me feel somewhat good about myself. She said I was cute, and told me she told her parents about me, and about all the skeletons in her closet and I told her about mine. Welp, turns out she used me for attention, and I was probably using her as an emotional crutch, and she went off on me, and when I told her I wanted an actual relationship she called me a creep, and a lonely pathetic freak. I always found it hard to trust other people and feel comfortable around them, but she made it nye impossible for me to attempt to put myself out there. She also destroyed my opinion of myself, and I tried to end it all multiple times because of her. Ive tried to get out there in the dating scene, and everytime I meet a girl who is cool or whatever I always have that gut feeling that she is going to destroy me emotionally. Ive been talking to this one girl recently, and shes amazing, but I feel both the drive to both be distant so she doesnt see how clingy I am, but also keep myself in her life so she doesnt fade away. I cant take another person hurting me like that, its not fucking fare. Every goddamn day Im alone, and Im depressed and it doesnt matter how active and positive I am, it always comes back. I feel like Im destined to end it all, and that its just a matter of time before people who treated me like shit pretend to care, and then forget about me. I always see groups of people my age going on little escapades or whatever, hanging out at parks, going to parties, going out to eat together, getting high, having fun, and every goddamn day I spend alone. My brain thinks its fucking normal that Im this depressed, that Im this lonely. My mom thinks that Im just a freak even though she would never say it, because when she was in high school she was wild and got arrested a bunch of times and did every type of plant, root, and powder there was. And no one else knows how draining it is living alone. Im destined to either live as a hermit for the rest of my life or short myself in the head during or after college."
16,vulnerability,depression,Hope,1,i17p25,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/i17p25/hope/,2020-07-31 23:41:11," If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything thats in it, Andwhich is moreyoull be a Man, my son!  Rudyard Kipling Isles of hope in the depths of despair. Rills of respite in the glades of gloom. But an iota of hope can keep at bay the darkest of night. A ray of hope to cling onto as eventually and inevitably our fantasy become reality. A beacon of light to lead way as eventually the demons disintegrate to dust. A prophecy made legacy in due time. Hope against all odds. Hope as a lifeline in lifes darkest hour. Lifes most brutal, unforgiving hour. The hour of destiny, hour of agency. Make it or break it, use it or lose it, the chances are there for taking. The hours come and go. But tooth and nail we keep going regardless of the catastrophe. Tooth and nail, you are the hero of this story. Battered and brutalized, but the spirited never bowed. Ravaged and ruined, but a grit never broken. A lifes work broken but never will the conviction break. Hope beaten down by the rough times, times most cynical, hypocritical. But we never forget how we felt once upon a time in better days in the kingdom by the sea. Broken from the inside and defeated from the outside again and again. But can there be value with no defeat, no hardship? But humans never die as the heart is eternal. A heart bleeding, full of battle scars. But scars to hone the sword, temper the will. Dreams left unfulfilled, but we dream anyway. The why is there and so the how should be also. One foot always ahead of the other. Aesthetics in conviction so unsightly. Will the mind, the body to try again, to fail again and again until we gain an inch. Inch after inch until salvation comes. Will a hope to carry out the will even after death. A will to transcend the fickle fate. A grit of truth beyond mortality, vulnerability, disillusionment. Hope born from a nothingness, a chasm of hopelessness. Hope beyond hope. Agony of desire. An agony sublimed into hope. No dearth of death in the abyss imminent. But also, no dearth of hope in a sea most tumultuous as hope transcends context, make irrelevant external circumstances. Hope to give vision to the blind, the maimed. Hang on to a life to fix the broken. But the broken come back the strongest. A hope needed today to make way for the citadels of tomorrow. Hope as a beacon, a catalyst to veer over risks and obstacles as we make headway to the castles of our dreams. Hope to keep the soul afloat, breathing as we drown in the torrents of fate. A rising tide to lift all boats, not just your own. Patience comrade, for your throne awaits. Your people need you. Tomorrow needs you. Would not be the same without you. A throne not worthy of any unworthy foreign usurper. Dont give in, for the throne is there for taking, never flaking. Just out of sight over the horizon. But there nonetheless forevermore. A long road ahead yes, but a road we take nonetheless. A big risk yes, but a risk we take nonetheless regardless of the outcome. Risk-taking itself is fruition to suffice. Suffice to hold on to hope. An unforgiving, unrelenting, unremitting road yes, but kings never go softly into the night as they know that in the end the world is theirs forever and everything that is in it. Promises to keep, though the night is lovely and deep, miles to go before we give in to sleep. Do not go gentle into that night. Rage in surly pluck against the dying of light. In sight of the possibility of astronomical dividends and to preclude the astronomical consequences otherwise. Did you fall so far that you can finally discern the light in the pitch black of night? Was the despair so overwhelming that a redeeming of truth finally broke through? Or was it so dark that you went down the wrong road and could not find the truth anymore? Have you mistaken it for false hope? A risk taken with no regard for the risks taken. Stake our all on one idea that we have full faith in. With a heart for any fate. Meet success and failure with open arms and treat both impostors the same. Painful to see such profound sacrifices made. Will it even be worth it? What if there is nothing at the end of this road? But doubt rings loudest in times most challenging, most pivotal, most decisive. Regardless if there is nothing at the end. An eye towards the impossible knowing full well it is possible. An eye toward what it should be toward. A naive hope bold enough to overcome the cynicism so ingrained. If the wisdom of old age means death of a dream, then let me stay young forever. Let the youth burn bright their first days, and the old simmer profound their last days. Face the reality of today, but do not leave behind the dreams of yesterday. A hope to overshadow lies so entrenched. A cynicism that deprives a life of its greatness. A pessimism to deprive a king of his rightful place in the game of life. A pitiful heist. A life so shackled to lies, lies that hijack the truth to put to waste. Feed off the specter of lies as we hasten our way to the grave. Lies to distort the truth beyond resurrection. Lies that render a heart compromised, a life truncated. Lies to blot out the sun to usher in an indefinite reign of night. Hope there are gaps in time when truths rise above lies. But hope has an intention, an understanding beyond the day-to-day realities. The intention rather than the reality of things. The orientation rather than the reality of things. An intention to unveil the reality of the king as you should be all along. A reawakening, revival, rebirth of the powers lain dormant, lain suppressed. An ideal to uphold. A symbol to the people. A duty to the people. A favor to yourself. An acknowledgement of the powers bestowed, a privilege accepted, an obligation met. A pillar of hope to endure the test of time. What eternal deeds can escape the oblivion of the sands of time? What truths do time not belie? A hero in the strife. A smile in the time more dire, most fatal. A hope though not uncoupled with realism. A hope that reveals the beauty of human endeavor. A battle that we will in the end come out victorious by virtue of nothing else as everything withers to dust--- hope."
17,vulnerability,depression,Coronavirus has been a sledgehammer to my mental health,1,gw4nrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gw4nrh/coronavirus_has_been_a_sledgehammer_to_my_mental/,2020-06-04 08:48:22,"Strap in because this will probably be long and haphazardly written. So, I was diagnosed with depression and general anxiety disorder 6 years ago at age 14. I haven't had any major stints of depression except for maybe high school. However, during this age of coronavirus, my mental health has taken a massive hit and I am the most depressed I have ever been in my life. &amp;#x200B; I am already very introverted (which is something I would really like to change) and have literally 0 friends at all. You'd think that the stay at home orders an introvert like myself would already be prepared. You'd think that there would be no significant change to how I live. Well, no. The first few weeks were fine. I had my calculus class online which kept me busy and engaged. I had my guitars. I had video games. Well, I don't have my calculus class anymore. I still have my guitars and video games. However, 0 social interaction with anyone I can remotely relate to. &amp;#x200B; I do still live with my family, however, I just can't seem to relate to them anymore. I don't have friends to talk to. I really don't have anybody. I've tried making friends online but to no success. Fuck, I even made a Tinder account to try and make friends. Getting no matches at all isn't exactly conducive to making friends and is akin to a bone saw to the mental health. &amp;#x200B; I have tried tons of those self help ideas or activities that a lot of websites suggest you do. I've tried taking daily walks (I still do), I've tried making friends, I've tried setting schedules (I can never keep them because my motivation to actually do anything on the schedules is next to nothing), I try watching positive videos on YouTube, etc, etc, ad nauseum. Nothing works for me at all. There is no change. &amp;#x200B; I am admittedly emotionally enigmatic nowadays. I feel emotionally numb, but occasionally when my brain goes to the thoughts of loneliness, I become incredibly sad. I have next to no motivation to even get out of bed let alone do a lot of the activities I used to enjoy. I feel trapped in my own vicious cerebral prison with the key thrown away. I've become damn good at wearing the mask of normalcy and hiding my feelings from everyone. The mask has unfortunately fused to my face and no matter how much I'd love to remove it and express my despair and vulnerability, an invisible force stops me. I'm not only literally alone in terms of human contact, but also alone in my own self made prison. Let it be known that I am absolutely not suicidal. Fuck, if I was, I'd be actually feeling something. But that's beside the point. &amp;#x200B; I have tried everything to at least feel some sort of pleasure. I made a financially irresponsible move and bought myself a $950 guitar with only about $1,500 in my bank account (don't get me wrong, the guitar is great and I wouldn't trade it for the world). I try playing my guitar every day to find some creative outlet. However, I am unable to focus and find myself really just going through the motions on the guitar not really feeling like I've accomplished much. That focus issue is also pretty major in video gaming. I have bought 3 games in the last month. I have been unable to finish any of them due to lack of focus and lack of motivation. &amp;#x200B; Speaking of lack of focus, my seemingly stream of consciousness I had going on while writing this post has dried up. I have literally forgotten what else I wanted to add to this post to convey what I am feeling (or not). So, I guess expect some updates in the future; or not, I don't even know anymore."
18,vulnerability,depression,How do I overcome my ego?,1,gw5yf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gw5yf3/how_do_i_overcome_my_ego/,2020-06-04 10:00:22,"Posted this in r/Advice but no one replied. Ego might not be the right word for it, but hopefully my explaining will make it more clear what I'm seeking. I've been at this acting school for 30 weeks now (it's a 15-month program for an Associate's so we're halfway to the end). Since day 1, I've had problems with grabbing my classmates' attention, being socially intelligent, and just overall someone that people would like to hang out with. Not that I don't have friends, but my main friends are people I've known for years, before acting school. I'm 24F, a few years older than most of my classmates but not the oldest person there (I already went through college but discovered this new passion later, like a later-bloomer of sorts). Some of the rules we've been taught at this school are letting go of self-consciousness, relaxation, and overall being vulnerable. I struggle with all of these. Especially vulnerability; my whole life I've had a hard time being 100% my honest self with strangers and letting myself go to make a joke, like I'm too worried it won't be funny enough. I've noticed though that when I'm doing exceptionally good in a scene or monologue, or a performance in general, I get confident and let loose, talking louder and talking more to people I otherwise think don't really like me much. But when I'm having an average or below average day, I kind of shrink into the background. I try to make plenty of small talk but it usually gets ignored for louder, more charismatic people, and the more it happens in a day the more I get tired of trying (for that day). I just, I don't know how to not be this person who struggles with normal conversations and is always held back by self-consciousness. My classmates probably perceive me in a way that isn't how I want my ideal self to be and I don't know how to close that gap. Any advice? P.S. I'm planning to audition for the school's improv group b/c I believe it could help me in the long run. P.S.S. Adding this part after seeing that r/Advice wasn't much help. I have depression. I've only had one really bad ""experience"" with it where it really consumed me (back in 2017). Overcame it but I've seen as i get older it lingers in the background and any one thing can make it flare back up, like not being included in hang outs with classmates and not getting any cheers before and after a performance when one or 2 other classmates almost always do. There's a very noticeable favoritism of 2 specific guys in my class, they're both very charismatic and great conversationalists. TLDR: I want to be noticed/acknowledged more by my peers. I struggle with being vulnerable and open with strangers. Don't know how to be a good conversationalist where people want to talk to me."

This is my first ever post so please forgive me if I make any rookie errors. Theres this strange phenomenon that occurs in my family wherein no one is allowed to show any emotion or vulnerability. Now, as a child, if this rule was broken there were severe punishments (i.e not getting fed for days). Now as a 17 y/o the punishments arent really in the same category, but rather I get dismissed, told Im stupid, or flat out ignored. This could be in response to me expressing my opinion or just... having an emotional reaction to something. You can imagine this has made me pretty depressed and uncomfortable with myself, so I made myself a second family with my closest friends. Sure enough I felt great around them, and comfortable enough to share my feelings. But then I started hearing things about how Im so depressed I just make everyone else depressed and Im always ruining the mood with my feelings. I lost touch with that entire group and my best friend of 5 years because they didnt want to deal with my depression. As a result Ive really started to punish myself. Ive conditioned myself to keep in my emotions through self harm. I manage to put on a pretty good mask these days and Ive made a new group of friends who keep me at bay. Things with my family are even going okay since Ive learnt to keep my mouth shut. I can never be myself around them, but I guess thats okay for now. I used to wish I could be myself and express my feelings without being punished for it. Now I just dont feel anymore."

21,vulnerability,depression,Man cheated. Secret pregnancy.,1,h8t1sn,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/h8t1sn/man_cheated_secret_pregnancy/,2020-06-14 22:35:10,"So I met this man at the place we both worked. I knew better to date coworkers but I was in a depressed and lonely state at the time and wanted/needed someone to lean on. He was married at the time and has a now 4 years old son. I also told myself not to get involved with men with children and nevertheless married. Off to a great start right? First it all started with him pushing me away out of respect for his wife (he seemed so determined to love her) then he started opening up. He told me all the awful things she put him through and how he found out she cheated and with everything piling up over the years and not changing for the better he decided to leave. He slept in his car for a while then I told him he can stay with me (not I realize you attract people at the same level in like youre at) we were both feeling like we hit rock bottom. He was back and fourth about fighting to stay with her and choosing her but she wanted NOTHING to do with him (good for her) and I always thought maybe it was so easy cuz she decided to move on with the man she cheated with. I always wanted a good, genuine man cuz I know Im capable of a functional relationship despite my personal issues. So I took him in. He was heartbroken and going through a lot of emotions of depression and even talked about wanting to kill himself. I saw an opportunity to tell myself and him that I can show him better. Things between us felt so right. We talked. I understood what he was feeling to an extend cuz nearly every relationship Ive been in, theyve been unfaithful. I made it clear and explain over and over what I was expecting out of him and this relationship. He had talked himself up about how all hes ever wanted was simple. To be a husband and a father. He jumped into his previous relationship with his first wife so quickly. Within a year they got together, engaged, pregnant then married. I always told him that dating and for a period of about 3 years you really see someones true colors and if you see red flags then you know better and leave or choose to accept it but not expect much. We were inseparable. Worked together at the same place, a one hour difference in work shifts. Spent all day in bed, out and doing fun things. Everything together. When we werent it was constant texts and calls, FaceTimes filled with I love you and I miss you. So I felt pretty secure. I felt I was obsessed and nice to see the same effort in him to talk to me throughout everyday. I started to have problems with seeing red flags and feelings of being put aside when I saw him flirt with other women. He had such a cocky attitude. But he told me thats how he was and didnt see anything wrong with this or that and I was just being insecure. Eventually every feeling I had was a me problem. I started to believe that wed be happier if I looked into myself before speaking about things I felt I was being insecure about. Ive always had trust issues. Looooong ass story short, the month of his anniversary he wanted to keep busy and distracted so we took a week off and traveled and had fun elsewhere. It still wasnt enough cuz when we got back I felt a strong urge to go through him Apple Watch. Its was the first time I ever went through his personal property. I found texts to his ex about how they should work things out and missed her blah blah blah and he caught me there reading it and hurt. We talked about everything and I eventually decided we can work through it but I couldnt fully trust him and he was gonna have to change that. As the months went on I occasionally brought it up cuz I was still hurt from it. I struggled on a daily basis about staying in the relationship. I thought itd all be worthwhile and shows how strong we can come out of this and other things that may arise. Fast forward to two days ago. I was at work and a new hire and I were talking and at work NOTHING is professional or private so he knew we were dating. Anyways here its is.... We were bringing up things just talking and he had stated that heard about another coworker being pregnant with twins and that my man was the father. Of course I defended him and didnt believe it. It weight heavy on me til I got home. I one him up telling him I had heard this rumor and he said well people are gonna make up stories, nothing but drama in that place. I asked him again and told him he has to be honest with me and why would people come up with this idea. Why him? I told him its okay if he did but to own up. Well to my surprise he admitted it to be true.... Needless to say heartbreak. I asked for details and it killed me. I got this rush of motivation and energy to leave. I always wanted to move away from my small, toxic home town and I grabbed my clothes and drove all day to a whole other state. I was experiencing sooooo many different emotions. It was like a roller coaster. Feeling strong and proud of myself then in the same instant thinking I reacted too quickly and making a mistake. To sobbing and screaming my hurt feelings out on the road. To feeling numb. I had to much support from friends and family which never been so close to me before and their excitement made me feel I was doing the right thing. Of course he blew me up with calls and texts and I never spoke so emotionless to anyone like this before. Monotone and just dishing it all out to him. Im not necessarily strong enough yet to let him go and weve been talking like we did before all this and with promises of everything I want to hear and some I didnt but he was finally being open to communicating and being honest. We went back and fourth to decided what was best was to not have contact and move on cuz he didnt deserve me and I deserved better. Then next call or text crying about how much we loved each other and considering to work through it all. Im conflicted. Stupidly. And such a waste. I feel betrayed, embarrassed and not respected. I feel pathetic. I just want it all to stop and looked forward to my new life without him. But still showing my vulnerability for him. I know what I need to do. No question about it. He did it cuz he wanted to have some fun and excitement of the adrenaline rush thinking he could get away with it meaning if she didnt get pregnant not worrying at all about being caught and to be completely honest THAT type of thought process has me worried and hurts THEE most. We talked about moving out of state together. We talked about starting fresh together. We argued and nearly broke up a few times cuz of this and that. And I always begged and he was always so quick to drop me like I didnt mean anything. That hurt too. But now it all makes sense. He knew he was in the wrong and was gonna lose me but hoped I had enough live for him to work through it. I dont see how if Im not that strong and already throwing his stupid and careless previous life decisions in his face. I thought it was a five month secret saying he cheated five months ago (January, I believe) then not only knowing about her pregnancy but checking in on her (cuz thats what she requested) and he admitted the same month (remember, October) that he had made the mistake of getting caught messaging his ex when things were bad and we argued all the time he started talking to this other girl who got his number without his permission, from our office and bashing my name about how Im a hoe, but yet here she is, knowing were together. I dont believe at all he ever had any love for me. I was something he needed at the time and a distraction. And easy way out of his previous bad situation. I mean I cant really be too surprised. Talking and confiding in each other is how it all started. I dont really know what Im expecting out of posting this, I just need opinions. Or motivation or a hope that we can get through it. Whatever you (the reader) are thinking. And most of all I needed to get it all off my chest. And maybe even a journal entry. As a reminder later in life about what I endured and seeing whether we made it through or not. Any and all opinions are welcome. Thank you for taking out such time from your day."

Usually the people I live with dont notice my moods but for the past few months my step daughter has been taking things personally when I just dont want to talk and be left alone. She also has the worst timing and seems to want to spend time with me most when Im very depressed. I dont know how to tell her that its not about her- her dad and me have tried to explain that how I am/respond is not her fault but she still takes it personally. Then I just get annoyed because I dont think Im asking for a lot- just some space. Maybe that sounds shitty... Shes just very upbeat usually and my personality is the complete opposite. We clash. She gets upset when I dont match her level of enthusiasm over something. Shes 16. I guess Id rather not tell her that I struggle with depression because I hate vulnerability and intimacy so Id rather her hate me :/

25,vulnerability,depression,I'm never going to be loved,1,hb5rq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hb5rq1/im_never_going_to_be_loved/,2020-06-18 12:23:05,"That's the constant thought that runs through my head. I feel like I've been stuck at the bottom of an empty well my entire life. I just sink further into the dirt and the light above me continues to fade. No one has ever loved me. No one has ever cared out me. I'm not important. I'm just an option. Someone to fill a space until someone better comes along. I've been emotionally neglected and touch-starved for as long as I can remember. I don't even know what to say when people ask how I'm feeling. I don't know how to identify emotions. I don't know how to soothe myself or ask for comfort and support from others. I'm so used to being told that I'm being dramatic and that I just need to get over it already and stop ruining the fun. I've never felt comfortable in my body. I hardly ever feel at ease in social situations. Even if I do, it all comes crashing down when I start the drive home and realize that it's all fleeting and never meant to last. People can only pretend to like me and tolerate me for so long. They just invite me out of pity, because it would be awkward for them otherwise. All of these years, I've just been in denial. Desperately clinging to optimism in the hope that it'll get me through. But there's never going to be a moment where things shift and change and turn out for the better. There's never going to be a time when people want to be around me, or when I'm the first person that someone thinks of when something nice happens, or when they can't sleep because they can't stop thinking about me. So, what am I supposed to take away from all of this? What am I supposed to think when I get excited for something, only for everyone to cancel the day of? What am I supposed to do when I take a risk and show vulnerability, only to have it blow up in my face? It all just shows that I'm unworthy. That I deserve everything terrible that happens to me. That I must be a terrible person to have such an empty, unfulfilling, and lonely life. That I exist to be rejected. I exist so other people can feel better about themselves. I exist to show average people that they're nowhere close to disgusting or ugly. I exist to show other single people what they don't want in another human being, in a friendship, in a relationship. Like hey, you might be single, but at least you're not stuck in a relationship with THAT THING. It doesn't matter what I do. It doesn't matter how happy or funny I try to be. It doesn't matter if I try to dress nice. It doesn't matter what I give people or what I do, even if it terrifies me. It's not good enough. It can never compensate. I wish I could just turn it all off. I wish I didn't have to feel despair and anger all of the time. I don't want to live this life, nothing that I do changes it. I can claw at the sides of the well until my hands bleed and my fingernails break. I'm always going to lose my footing, or someone will be waiting at the top with a pole to shove me back down. I don't want to die. I just want to be happy and loved. I want it more than anything. But wanting something means nothing. Some people never get what they want or need. I'm one of those people. I just need to shut up and accept it already."
26,vulnerability,depression,"There is something absolutely terrifying about the truth of learning life lessons, understanding gratitude for life, and understanding the truth about real life that have made me feel really depressed and nihilistic about life. I seriously need to cope with all that horrifying shit.",6,hcuakb,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hcuakb/there_is_something_absolutely_terrifying_about/,2020-06-21 07:37:58," This is going to be a very long rant, but I seriously have to get over something that I've had to repress for a long time to remain sane enough to live, which is the idea of learning gratitude and how we understand it, and learning lessons from life experience. I am absolutely not against the concept of gratitude in life, and like every decent person in society, I believe that everyone should be grateful for all the good things in life, and live life to the fullest. In fact, I genuinely appreciate my life and everything good about it, and I know that my life is such a miracle. However, I have a lot of problems about gratitude and other life lessons needed for someone to be successful that make me seriously question life itself, to the point it subconsciously tortures me no matter how happy I want to feel about life and causing me to feel existentially depressed. What makes me seriously pissed off, angsty and terrified is just how so many people say and believe that we will never be able to truly learn gratitude for life and empathy for others until something really bad happens to us. They say shit like ""You really do not know how good you have it until it's gone"" and ""Imagine losing everything you have and everything you love"". There is something absolutely horrifying about the statement that most people take life for granted and only truly understand how precious and fragile life really is when some terrible tragedy happens, as if it serves as some kind of wake up call or harsh remainder to reflect on priorities and values in life, put one's life into perspective, and to become a better person or something, because it essentially means that such terrible suffering is needed to understand gratitude, meaning that whatever gratitude one experiences after such a tragic event would owe its very existence to the pain and suffering from whatever tragedy happened. I hate how people say shit like ""some people have it much worse"", ""imagine being in a much worse situation"", ""imagine living in horrible conditions with no food, water, and whatever you need to survive"", ""things could have been much worse"", and so on whenever someone else angsts over something bad happening to them. And I can't believe that so many countless people say shit like ""Life's NOT fair, shit happens, so grow the fuck up, be tough and deal with it! NO COMPLAINING AND NO EXCUSES!!!!"", believing that the the only way to get over all the painful suffering in life is to unconditionally accept all the horrible shit we have to go through in life, learn whatever harsh lessons from it, and move on. So many people say ""count your blessings and be grateful that you get to wake up in the morning because this could be the last day of your life and you could die tomorrow without even realizing it"". But I feel like that for every blessing I count in life, I find some kind of curse behind them. Every time I think about something that I should be grateful for, like having enough food, water and other basic necessities to survive, living with enough safety and security to live without paranoia of some horrible fate that could happen at any time, having enough freedom to live one's life the way one wants without fear of persecution, and being able to live with family and friends, I think about just how lucky I am and how lucky I had to be just to enjoy all this stuff that we take for granted until life brutally slaps us in the face with a harsh reminder that life isn't fair, and about all of those unlucky and unfortunate people who live shitty and terrible lives in crapsack life conditions that really suck merely because they were unlucky enough to be born at the wrong place at the wrong time, without all those things that allow us to appreciate life or are even necessary to survive, thinking about just how horrible and how much it would really suck ass to be them, struggling to survive in such horrendous conditions, and just how lucky I am to not live like them. All this ends up with only two options for coping with suffering and tragedy: running away from it and wallowing in self-pity, shame, and depression, and never getting better, thus becoming an empty shell of yourself, or learning from it, accepting it unconditionally as a part of life, and embracing it for the sake of personal growth and positively changing society. It means you can choose to be a victim or a survivor. Of course, the victim mentality is never the solution and only makes things worse, which means that the only valid option to get over suffering and trauma is to embrace the survivor mentality. For years I once thought that by embracing one's identity as a survivor and accepting and finding meaning in suffering and trauma, one would be able to move on with life and be better. But eventually, I found out that in the end, that learning and growing from suffering as a survivor is just as bad, if not worse, than running away from suffering as a victim, because I realized something extremely disturbing, terrifying, and fucked up to the core behind all of this character growth. Even if one gets better and can move on with life by choosing to be a survivor than choosing to be a victim, there are still a lot of horrifying implications that come with it. While it doesn't mean condoning, approving, or glorifying suffering, it still ends up rationalizing the harsh realities of life and justifying the necessity of learning from suffering for character growth. So many people who have gone though and survived these kinds of terrible events and experiences in their lives say that whatever they went through was horrible, and acknowledge the pain and suffering that happened, but they say that they wouldn't change what happened to them in the past even if they could, saying that in hindsight and in retrospect, going through rock bottom made them what they are, made them stronger than they were before and gave them new opportunities, relationships, appreciation for life, spirituality, etc., and that it taught them very important lessons in their lives that they needed to learn the hard way, and that without such a harrowing experience, they would not have become who they are now, and not as strong or developed as they have become. It is absolutely horrifying to realize that one is so grateful for all the good things in life because someone had to suffer some kind of tragedy and deprived of happiness, and that the character growth one has experienced throughout life was because of someone having to live through a terrible life. While I know that it is important to grow up to be a better person in life, that fact that I or someone else would be a better person because of some bad thing happening to someone really makes no sense at all, because every little bit of pain and suffering ends up rationalized by the very lessons they teach brutally, leading to a horrible cycle that makes suffering an end in itself, no matter what meaning we decide to make out of it. What it all goes down to in the end looks like this: ""The reality of life is fucking harsh! Shit happens and real life WILL kick you in the ass at any moment, especially when you least expect it! Life is NOT fair and it should NEVER be fair! Accept the harsh facts of life as a part of life and learn from it! Being tough is the only way to get through life! No whining and complaining about how life is unfair, and absolutely no excuses whatsoever! Oh, did something bad happen to you or are you feeling bad about life?! TOO BAD!!! Accept all the harsh realities of real life as they are unconditionally, live with it, and never ever even think about resisting it!"" I know that the universe doesn't really care about us, and that there is no ""great evil force"" in the universe conspiring against anyone by controlling our fate and forcing us to exist under corrupt, oppressive rules for any reason, no great reason that things are the way they are, stuff happens randomly without any ""greater purpose"" behind them, and that nothing is inherently ""good or bad"" because it is all subjective and depends on our perspectives and circumstances on whatever happens in life, and that by mentioning all of this I am going into a lot of really serious, deep, difficult and complicated philosophical questions about real life that we will never find clear answers to. But regardless of what fundamental beliefs one has about life, it is absolutely horrendous that countless people in the world, especially at the high points of their lives, live their normal-ass lives as usual, becoming complacent about life and taking their normal lives for granted, feeling like they're invincible, and thinking that ""it's not going to happen to me"" and ""nothing really bad could possibly happen to us"" until some really bad, shocking and life changing event happens to them, robbing them of their innocence, taking away something so critically important to them and critically disrupting their once-normal lives and personal beliefs about life and what the world is like, with all of this cruelly revealing to them and reminding them of the sheer preciousness and fragility of life, the vulnerability of their very sense of self, and just how easily life can change or be taken away from them unexpectedly, at any moment without warning, and therefore should never ever be taken for granted. The sobering reality that we will never be able to truly understand the meaning of gratitude for the things that are extremely important to us in our lives until these critical things are forcibly taken away from us by some shocking, life changing tragedy that break our very souls, that we will never be able to truly relate to, have empathy for, and understand the plight of others who have suffered terrible circumstances unless we suffer through those terrible circumstances and learn from such terrible experiences, and that the only way for us to really cope with and move on from the terrible and shocking events that disrupt our very lives and inflict terrible suffering, trauma and tragedy is to accept the fact that they happened, find or make meaning out of them, learn from whatever terrible suffering one has went through, and integrate them as a part of one's identity and life, embracing whatever lessons one has learned from them and using whatever they have learned from these terrible experiences to develop character and bring positive change to society, which would therefore owe this positive change to the horrors of all this suffering, reintegrating the suffering back into real life and thus rationalizing it as a part of life when there are terrifying implications disturbing to the very core that result from such rationalization of suffering, and that we will never ever be able to truly ""get over it"" and have closure from tragedy no matter what we do, feels like a self-contradictory, dysfunctional system full of insidious hypocrisy that makes life feel so disturbingly dystopian. It makes life structurally feel like a cycle of abuse within an abusive relationship, because at first we live our lives like normal, then things start to get abnormal and feel a bit off, but we still think we can handle it until suddenly something really bad and shocking happens, then we are forced to deal with the aftermath of what happened, then our lives go back to normal again, then the cycle repeats over and over again, causing more and more suffering as time goes on. It feels like something that should have been a obviously huge lie instead of the harsh, sobering truth that we are forced to confront and deal with every day. It feels like such a horribly disturbing self-contradictory abomination of real life that has absolutely no justification for its existence no matter why it even existed in the first place. Because of all this, it makes me feel so existentially terrified, depressed and full of weltschmerz, that I've become a nihilistic edgelord who subconsciously rants about how much real life sucks, and so pissed off about real life that if every single one of the billions of neurons in my brain had the word ""hate"" written on them, it would not even be close to one billionth of the hatred I feel for it at any moment. I know that this has been an incredibly long rant about how much real life sucks, and I understand that everything in real life is really complicated and because of that I will never know everything about it. I understand that real life isn't all black and white, and therefore cannot be easily described in absolute things. Even though I know there are many people out there who believe in learning from suffering and negative experiences, I understand that nearly all of them are not crazy masochists or sadists who condone all the bad stuff that happen in the world, or say that there should more suffering in the world. I know that life isn't perfect and will never be perfect, that there will always be ups and downs in life, and that there are a lot of things about life that are out of my control, and therefore I am NOT asking for a perfect life that gives me everything I want. And I know that life isn't all pain and suffering, that pain and suffering are not the only way to learn lessons in life, and that we don't necessarily have to go through terrible suffering to learn important life lessons. To anyone who reads this rant, I will seriously remind you that I am not posting this because I am some pathetic retarded self-pitying crybaby who does nothing but whine and complain all the fucking time about how life isn't fair and can't handle the hard and challenging stuff in life. I am posting this because I am extremely horrified about all the harsh realities of real life that I mentioned above and that we somehow must accept them for what they are and learn from them to get through life. It feels so disturbing and fucked up to the core that accepting them as part of life feels like living under an oppressive totalitarian government and doing nothing to resist or at least speak out against all the horrible things it does. The reason why I refuse to accept those harsh and shitty facts of life is not that I am weak willed and lack strength of character, but because it feels so wrong on so many levels like child pornography and other really fucked up stuff. In fact, I absolutely hate how so many people out there scold and berate each other for being ""stupid crybabies who do nothing but waste time complaining and whining about how life isn't fair"", ""pathetic weaklings who can't deal with the harsh truths of life because they don't have enough strength of character"", ""self-pitying losers who do nothing but wallow in their misery lamenting about how much life sucks"", and other horrific, derogatory slurs for people who angst about how bad life is. I'm sick of people playing the sickening and reprehensible game of beating each other up for being too weak to deal with the harsh realities of life. This game is so fucked up that I'm never going to even think about playing it and everyone should quit it immediately because it should never ever be played in the first place. I'm going to admit that all those harsh, sobering and terrifying realities about the world and about real life have really taken a terrible toll on my sanity. I feel like that I'm addicted to the red pill, trying to fathom all those harsh facts about life and brooding about the horrifying implications they have on what life truly feels like. All of this has led me into becoming a cynical, brooding, angst-ridden doomer who feels so hopeless, terrified and nihilistic about life that I just can't give a fuck anymore about real life. I know that real life isn't some grimdark place that does nothing but inflict horrible suffering all day just for the sake of it, but all those harsh facts about real life have really corrupted my mind, my attitude on life, and my worldview. No matter how hard I try to resist it by focusing on thinking about the good and uplifting things about real life and no matter how many glimmers of hope I find, I keep feeling like having to ruminate about all those terrible things in the world and in real life and how horrifying it would be to experience them, even when I am not required to do so. I understand that I shouldn't deny the existence of all those terrible and depressing things about life that I described in excruciating detail no matter how easy and comfortable it is to be ignorant of them. But I still seriously feel that accepting and learning from all those harsh, sobering and inhumane realities of real life is fucking reprehensible and irrational for the reasons I explained above, even if we don't support or condone them whatsoever. All of this irrational and fucked up self-contradictory bullshit has left me feeling like real life is nothing but a horrible, inhumane joke that is so depressing and heart-wrenching that trying to cope with it has seriously been driving me insane. I seriously need to find out how I could possibly make sense of real life without succumbing to this horrible cycle of depression, hopelessness and insanity."

I'm only 19. My father is emotionally abusive and manipulative (narcissistic and mentally ill himself), my mother only takes care of me in a primitive sense (any emotional talk is just shut down), I love my sister dearly but there is some toxicity in our relationship that will just slowly continue to escalate because if I speak up, things will come crashing down especially since she's pregnant. Receiving this behaviour from my family make me feel like I deserve to be treated poorly. As someone who really cares about beauty around them and looking beautiful, being ugly really really sucks. I have really bad acne and I'm overweight. Ew. I'm naturally unfocused and exhibit symptoms of ADD. Can't do anything in a timely manner and stimulants don't work. The career I want to pursue requires lots of schooling and the ability to talk to people to find opportunities. My shitty time management, inability to focus, and anxiety (especially during interviews) make this impossible for me. Fuck. My want for a lavish lifestyle and financial freedom is never going to be satisfied. I'm too stupid to get rich for the reasons above. In addition, I can't just marry rich because I'm so fucking ugly, no one would want to be with me. And also, I'm a sensitive person, so almost every type of critism feels like an attack on my whole being. My strong need to be loved doesn't allow me to marry someone that can fulfill my materialistic desires. My ability to openly lover others and need to make others happy makes me put myself last and makes me a target for people who take advantage of others. My conflict-averse nature and ""emotions and vulnerability is disgusting"" thought process make it very hard to confront someone if they hurt me (which leads to resentment as they continue to do the thing that hurts me and it eats me up inside) and causes me to internalize and put away my feelings. It's also hard for me to cry or talk about anything that may indicate that I'm weak. My love for food makes me fat (especially since I'm an emotional water), and dieting to lose weight brings upon some type of eating disorder behaviour in me. My non-commital and easily-bored nature makes it hard to stick to something even if it's good for me. Healthy clean eating and regular exercise only lasted for about 2 months before I fell back into old habits and reversed all my progress. Depression makes me feel like half a person because I barely have any cognitive abilities which make me feel stupid and inadequate, which ties into my academic career AND real life. The cherry on top: My dramatic and overthinking nature makes all of these things so much worse. I hate everything about myself and wish I was never born. My life is a waste, I will never accomplish anything and I just used up 19 years worth of resources that could have been used for someone who's actually worth it.

Last year was especially hard. I tried to leave my emotionally abusive (and now sexually abusive) husband. I couldnt financially support myself though so I asked multiple people for help. Everyone basically told me to fuck myself. My dad tried guilt tripping me because divorce is wrong and evil or something and his marriage was toxic as fuck, so apparently that means everyone should put up with toxic relationships. Since no one I knew would help me, I got a stranger to move in with me. Which turned into a total disaster. He was a piece of shit, always in trouble with the law, and he took advantage of my vulnerability to have sex with me. After a few months, he was arrested for molesting a 6 year old child. Everyone judged me for putting myself into that situation, even tho they pushed me into it by refusing to give me any help. I ended up starting to talk to my husband again and we were talking about getting back together, partly because of my dads guilt tripping, partly because I felt like I had no choice, since I couldnt support myself and no one would help me. Before he moved back in with me, I tried to kill myself. Well when that happened, everyone was suddenly so concerned, but they also acted so shocked that I would do that and be that desperate. Even though they all knew how much I was struggling and I begged for help. No one wanted to give a shit then. But when I almost died, then everyone acted like I was so important. For a week or two. Now, its been nine months since my attempt. Im still with my husband, but the abuse has gotten worse. Everyone is back to pretending like everything is perfect and pretty much ignoring me most of the time. I feel hopeless and worthless and regularly think of suicide. I feel so alone and like I have no one to turn to. Everyone who should care has proven that they really dont. Theyll help me, just as long as they dont have to do anything substantial or terribly difficult. I dont know what to do. I work, but I have a shit job now and dont make a liveable wage. I had a decent job but between my bipolar and anxiety, I lost it. The only job I can seem to manage now without getting constant panic attacks and trying to harm myself is at this shit gas station. So I cant support myself, and no one I know will help me.

This is very personal stuff obviously and hiding it all for 4 years didn't make it easy. He said I might need to stay in a hospital so that they could monitor me whilst on the medication or whatever. He said the tiredness would go away before the depression and I'd gain motivation to kill myself. Waited at the hospital until 1am that night where I waited to talk to a psychologist or something. I ended up going home. Haven't got medication yet though. If I make it long enough to use the medication I wonder what it would feel like to have the tiredness go away. I can't remember what it felt like to not have it. The delay of not going to school stopped my motivation to kill myself. I know that's no excuse. I can't get out of bed. I'm so tired. I've exposed so much vulnerability and personal info and I don't know what will happen next. They have hope for me, My mum and dad. I have no hope at all. I can't see any way out of this. I have no hope because it'll all end soon anyway. I'm starting to think this was a mistake. I never ment to tell anyone in the first place. I just know that I'm tired. The dullness is so, so heavy. I really can't care."

She was caring and thoughtful. She came from a great family, she worked hard and was pursuing a good career. She was optimistic, she subscribed to the idea that things could go on and get better. I wasn't ready. I was insecure. I still held fear of abandonment from the last one. I was bereft of proper adult principles; sticking to a tough yet promising job, handling my anxiety, valuing long-term relationships, facing vulnerability for the progress it brings, holding fast to my own priorities rather than peer influence. I fucked it up. I didn't reciprocate. I didn't trust. Even when she suggested I see a therapist, rather than understand she was accepting and supporting me, I feared she would see me as damaged and leave. I didn't consider, realize, or internalize the value of what we had, and what it could become. I didn't do my part. And I fucked it up. She was the best thing for me I'd ever known, and I don't know if I'll ever have the chance at an opportunity like that again. I convince myself to assume that I will, because I couldn't go on knowing I fucked up my only chance."

34,vulnerability,depression,Feel like I fucked things up with a person that meant a lot to me,2,ge334e,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ge334e/feel_like_i_fucked_things_up_with_a_person_that/,2020-05-06 04:21:43,"Fair warning, this is kind of an embarrassing post. I never thought Id be the type to get buns up on a person or let someone else cause me so many issues. Basically, I spent most of my life dealing with mental health issues, mainly depression social phobia, and what I would later learn was ocd, and as a result was really afraid of vulnerability and people in general so I went to great lengths to never share too deeply or get emotionally intimate with anyone despite really badly wanting to. I was just really afraid of ending up in a situation of bad emotional pain I think and I also believed I wasnt worthy of that kind of connection or that I would wind up wronging someone in some way. Because of this, Ive never had a girlfriend or even a really a close friend. Anytime a girl expressed that they liked me in some way or wanted to get to know me better Id distance myself. However, after hitting a particularly low point, I ended up going to a mental health treatment center for two months and met some really great people there that I allowed myself to get close to and form close bonds with. It was awesome, best experience of my life and it taught me a lot about myself and the importance of having people like that in your life. Among them was a girl who was was the person I got closest with and was honestly to me was the perfect person. Very kind, empathetic, warm, I could go on and on about how great she was but she had this quality that I cant really describe, we just clicked I guess and she seemed to really like me platonically, though would mention often that I was attractive and compliment me on my personality or character. We got very, very close and she seemed to really care about me. Once it got closer to me having to go back home she told me often how sad it made her that I was leaving, how much shed miss me, etc etc and we spent a lot of time together. I should also mention that she had borderline personality disorder. At this point I shouldve known better because my mother suffers from the same disorder. After leaving, she called me everyday for months and wed talk for long periods of time, hours. I cant even describe how great of a feeling it was to just have someone care about me on that level and actually want to talk to me so much. At one point, out of nowhere, she said shed have to stop talking to me because she had romantic feelings for me and she was weird with guys she was romantically interested in. I of course didnt understand this, I had feelings for her as well and to me it seemed like a good reason to keep in contact if anything and I wanted to pursue that feeling for once because I really liked her and had gone through enough emotional growth to not be afraid of it. Anyways, it really killed me. Looking back I shouldve just left it at that but I persisted because I was so afraid of being alone again and we kept talking. Months go by and all is well then things start to break down. I start having to be the one to initiate conversation, she seems to start to be more distant, I start upsetting her without me even realizing what I did. Then we talk on the phone and shes happy, telling me I should come see her, that she wishes I was there, all this stuff. Eventually she calls me and tells me she got back together with her ex. I ask her if we should keep talking, if talking to me is a good or bad thing because I didnt want to be anything negative to her, etc etc and she responds that its up to me and that she feels neutral about it. I get the hint and it sends me into a bit of a breakdown, looking back Im a bit pissed off that I let myself get so weak but one of her main things was that she was afraid of abandonment and I have a very low sense of self worth and tend to feel like I have nothing but a negative impact on people so I felt that I had really wronged or hurt her in some way. I texted her and expressed that I was sorry if I hurt her in some way and was sorry that I had done something to make her start to dislike me so much seemingly overnight, and she responded simply with stop. Im so embarrassed about that now because looking back its so clear that at that point she simply didnt care about me at all. I dont want to seem melodramatic but that hurt me really, really bad. I essentially just spent a month drinking and taking Xanax and oxycodone and laying in bed almost every day after that. Its four months later and that was the last I heard from her, and looking back I realize that the whole thing was just unhealthy and I feel like Im making too much of it since we werent even really dating, but I just wish I would hear from her and know that shes doing well and that she cares about how Im doing. I told her things Ive never told anyone, and it was closer than Ive ever been to anyone. It just felt so good to have such a deep emotional connection with someone. Now I feel more alone than ever and its even worse than it was because now I know what Im missing out on. Again, I dont want to seem overly sentimental or anything, but I truly loved her as a person. I dont know that I was necessarily in love with her but its the closest Ive gotten. The whole thing has left me so confused. In one way, its a confirmation of my fears of being vulnerable with people and Im sort of mad at her though I realize she has mental health and emotional issues as well and its not her fault, if anything its my fault, but in another way Im almost grateful to her that she showed me how positive it can be to open yourself up to others and for giving me such a great experience when it wasnt tumultuous. Either way, I still find myself thinking about her often and I really thought Id be over it by now. The hurt has definitely lessened, but shes still on my mind often and I still worry about her. Ive never been in this situation before so I guess I just dont know what the timeline is for something like this. Is there a rough estimate of when I might get over this completely? Is there anyway I can stop ruminating over what I couldve done differently or stop worrying about the emotional pain I may have caused her? I realize that she probably really dislikes me now and that makes it a bit easier, but I still hold out hope that she might check up on me at some point or let me know that shes doing alright. I dont know, at one point she expressed to me her general distrust in people and attachment and I feel like I made that worse for her and I wish I could make it right. I just wish I could be over this, its made me feel really weak and immature and uncertain about myself. And the the worst part is that this has been such a huge thing for me because of how much Ive distanced myself from people my whole life while it probably meant absolutely nothing to her."
35,vulnerability,depression,Cant connect with anyone,1,gfhz67,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gfhz67/cant_connect_with_anyone/,2020-05-08 09:40:59,"I dont miss anything from the past except for the purity and vulnerability of my relationships. I felt like I could bare my heart and soul to my friends, and when I did I received so much love and support. It was so beautiful. I dont feel that anymore, havent felt that for a while. Its not the fault of my friends and family at all, the issue is on my end. I feel some sort of barrier between me and them that leaves me feeling like there is still something that was left unsaid. There is some curtain between us that prevents me from being as vulnerable and expressive as I truly want to be. Theres some gap in communication, something thats not being translated from my heart to my words. Something left unsaid and not understood that I feel like Im just always carrying around. Some unseen weight that someone cannot temporarily help me with. I know no one will ever understand me 100%. But there is a level of vulnerability and connection that i could reach before that I just cant reach anymore. And I crave that level of connection because I crave healing, and I cant be fully healed if I dont reach that level with myself, my therapist/doctor, and my loved ones. Theres still something lurking in the shadows that hasnt had light shed on it, some unknown species of emotion or thought that has yet to be discovered. I know its there but I cant reach it. I just feel like theres something Im always hiding even when Im trying to be as open and vulnerable as I can. Theres a level of catharsis that I am desperate for but just cant reach. I literally reminisce over hugs I got months and even years ago because of the lack of affection and connection I feel now. Just feel numb."
36,vulnerability,depression,It's my cake day and it's been 10 years,2,gfvycj,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gfvycj/its_my_cake_day_and_its_been_10_years/,2020-05-09 02:08:11,"I'm not sure if this belongs here, but this morning I woke up and wrote myself this letter and thought I'd share it. Dear my older self, It's been rough, I'm at the lowest point I ever will be. I have nothing I am nothing. No one talks to me, I have no friends, the one I did have abandoned me and I don't even blame her because who would want to put up with me, I felt sorry for her for even being seen talking to me, for feeling like she has to talk to me. If I know now what you know, I wonder if I would feel this desperate. You've always written to me to soothe me, calm me, protect me, free me. Now on this day, 10 years after I plan to kill myself, I write to you. If you had told me I would rebuild my relationship with my family, that I would have not just one but a few loving supportive friends, that I would be working in a job that's my passion and that I can get paid well for then I would not have believed it. If you had told me that the anger and heavy void I feel like concrete filling my being would slowly heal, that I'd find ways to work on myself to nurture what I never had, to learn from my experiences, to know myself better and be capable of vulnerability and love, I'd say impossible. If you had told me that I'd go through a string of unhealthy toxic and damaging relationships that broke me in ways I wouldn't even understand right now, but led me to a man who is everything I don't know I want right now, who is kind and loving, forgiving and accepting and cherishes and adores me like the ways I can only read about in media posts, I'd not even entertain it. You tell me it's possible to have all this yet it seems like it's not written for me, it's written for someone else. And maybe that's what needs to happen, I need to fundamentally change who I am. I cannot continue like this and although I don't believe the future u describe is possible for me, it sounds too good to be true, anything is better than this. I want to believe I can be successful in my work and receive sufficient wage to live comfortably on. I want to believe my family will feel like mine again. I want to believe I will have real friends, I want to believe someone could see me that way and treat me as such. I really want to believe that I can change, that I dotn feel this way, that I don't have these thoughts, and I know it's a long road, a ten year long road, I'd be surprised I even make it to next year. Knowing what you have, that it's possible, I want that. I can't even imagine what it must feel like to be older and have this life, you must be so happy so fulfilled so grateful. And I imagine still socially awkward and insecure, but I'm sure you're aware of all that and find ways to manage it. You've looked after me, now let me look after you. Whatever it is that you are finding difficult, I know you have it in you to overcome. You've come out of this feeling which I never thought I could, you've accomplished and worked hard not only in your career but in your relationships with other people and within yourself. I mean look at me suicidal af and writing to you. Whatever it is that you want, you can work hard and manifest. There are no coincidences, there are no mistakes. Everything has meaning and you deserve to be happy. Take it from this lost broken empty soul, you've been here and you've progressed and not only survived but thrived. Don't be so hard on yourself, you can do anything you can handle anything. If in 10 years I can be you, I can't even begin to think who I can be in another 10. Keep moving forward, for me, I'm cheering you on too x"
37,vulnerability,depression,Realizing that I may have a problem.,1,gln2z5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gln2z5/realizing_that_i_may_have_a_problem/,2020-05-18 06:49:57,"This is very hard for me to explain at first, so if I go off topic out of nowhere, then my apologies. I just have a lot of thoughts on my mind right now. Recently, I haven't been doing so well at work. Getting in trouble for the littlest things that could have been avoided. After getting counseled yesterday for the second time in the span of a week. I really had to do so thinking. For the past couple of months ranging all the way back to October 2019. I've been irritable and quick to get defensive. I could only sleep for four hours a day and still function fine. though I knew that i was extremely tired. My eating habits weren't the greatest as I would forget to eat some days or I would finally cook a decent meal but only stomach one serving before getting too full. you would think that i would lose weight by that, but I didn't. Exercise was getting harder to accomplish as I was just feeling so sluggish and apathetic. Though through all this, I kept a smile on my face as much as possible. I was always making light of everything and being a jokester. I just though it was just stress from the job, I knew that would be inevitable. I'm in the military and I work in law enforcement. I'm a woman with a petite stature, so I had to fight tooth and nail to get where I am. I never showed signs of weakness or vulnerability. I loved my job especially with my first command as I worked side by side marines, and worked in a more grunt high intensity job. Sure i had my stress bouts here and there, but I didn't let anyone know that I was feeling a lot of pressure and sense of hopelessness. I just couldn't. Things got better when I met my boyfriend and I assumed I would never feel like that again. Last night I found out how wrong I was. I'm at my second command and it is vastly different from my first. I'm not training close quarter battles or inspection scenarios. No, I am now sitting at a desk doing paperwork for twelve hours a day. I know this job is so lax, so that's why it never occurred to me that something was really wrong with me as time went on. Like I said, I loved my job, but now I despise with a passion. Going to work is an effort because i have to put on a brave face that things are ok. make up an excuse on the spot when i let my anger get the best of me for something so minor. I just thought it was just me being hormonal or something or the loneliness as my boyfriend and I are in along distant relationship (don't worry our relationship is strong as hell.) So when my boyfriend decided to show up at my door step to surprise me I thought 'Thank god. get me out of this idiotic episode I'm in.' Though I never realized until now that I he even made me irritable, which never happened before. I wasn't passionate as I was before with him. don't get me wrong. I love my boyfriend to the moon and back, but I just didn't have the drive. Another sign is that my grandma messaged me and asked how I was doing. and I felt guilty because I never realized that I hadn't spoken with her in months and we were very close as I grew up with her and she taught me many things. I never realized that I was cutting people off. That the way I talked was either sarcastic or mean. That's not me. So last night I decided to bite the bullet and take an anonymous online test from one of the military medical aid in mental behavior. I really didn't like my results. 'Moderate to severe depression.' Now to many that may not seem like anything, but to me it felt like a punch in the gut. I always strived to be happy and make others happy. Never let my emotions get in the way with the job. I was angry and ashamed. I didn't want anyone to know that I was this far down the hole. I could do this on my own. I've taken care of my self my whole life. I've been through and seen some shitty things growing up and yet I came up on top. I refused to let myself get held down by things as silly as depression. I always believed it was something that you 'just get over' than move on with your life and never let weakness hit you again. Though with me getting worse and worse at work. I knew I needed to do something. I confided with a trusted coworker and he surprised me that had been in my shoes before. he recommended me to talk with my team leader as she knew first hand what depression does if it's not treated. I was very adamant at first because that would mean that I would have to open up with emotions, and I've never really done that with anyone except my boyfriend and he fought tooth and nail to get me to finally trust him in the beginning of our relationship. I really didn't want to, but I also knew that this wasn't healthy. I couldn't keep going on like this. I confided with her and to no surprise i had to give her my gun card. Which I wasn't insulted over as I knew it was protocol. She was very receptive and told me to make an appointment with medical. This is all very scary to me. So many emotions are just running wild but my main ones are anger and shame. I'm just angry that I let it get this out of hand. I don't want to reveal anything about myself. I have major trust issues as I've been hurt before in the past. I feel shame because no matter how down low this incident is being taken care of. I know everyone will know something is wrong with me. I don't want them to skirt around me like I'm a land mine or give me looks of pity. I'm scared, but I really needed to let this off my chest."

To be frank, I am lacking the motivation to do most of the things I get told, but I really don't think it can change my negative mindset and high emotional vulnerability. Also I would consider myself pretty reflected, knowing which things in my life are bad and how to improve them. However, I just lack the energy to do so and even if I would get rid of these points, I am still depressed from what I know from my experience. Since changing the type of therapy would imply to change my therapist, I'm not doing it because the wait time for that is extremely high and due to corona, even higher. Has anyone here had any success with behavioural therapy? If so, what was your diagnosis? I am especially interested in people with recurrent episodes (ICD-10 F33.\*)."

I don't know if I'm just unfortunate, playing the victims or if everyone's lives seem quite fucked in adulthood? I used to have such strong character, integrity and inner compass. But I'm progressively becoming more and more lost. People around me have relationship issues left and tight. I come from a great family but my parents are in old age now. Apparently a brother had to get taken to hospital in an ambulance a few weeks back. Dog had to be put down a couple of months ago. The girl who for years I thought was the one and she did too for sure at one point has cut me off so I'm guessing she found somebody else. I was unemployed before cpronavorus came along. Ive never felt like this but it's been building and building up this feeling that I have nothing anymore. No place in the world. No trust in others. No love. Barely speak to my friends as we're worlds apart now. I just don't understand after such a great start in life my life has been progressively worse since I was 15. I just feel like it's been 1 step forward 2 back for so long that I'm starting my entire life from scratch. I hate vulnerability as much as any man but it's all I feel right now. I'm seen as being strong so I don't have people to talk to. Up til 6-7 every day with so many things haunting me. I've tried being spiritual and living for God. I've tried being worldly. I've tried reaching for success and everything just seems to come to nothing. All I need is love but there is so man barricades to it. Every relationship falls apart without the other areas of your life working. I'm just gutted at the whole thing. I used to be that larger then life person. Now I'm the one that them people don't want to be around because my vibes aren't on there level. I know what that feels like,not wanting to be around anyone who drags you down. But where's the loyalty in this generation? When I was doing good I brought everyone up to my level. Everyone else fucks over their friends there family and lovers just to live on a constant high. It's disgusting. And he worst part is I used to be the same. Only when your life truly fucks you and destroys the vanity you didn't know you had do you change and your values change. Everything just seems a contradiction. I envy those in poor communities who still have clarity and there lives weren't clouded with ego. That love and appreciate each other. I envy the spiritual strength my dad has even now in his old age. We're losing it in our generation. I miss the days I would wake up and feel fresh looking forward to things I wanted to do. I'm too young to feel this old and the worse my depression gets the worse decisions I seem to make. I know I'm slowly digging my own grave. People who used to know me say there worried. Others tell me how I could be great. Others who know me best know I'm doing my best. But I've gone through so much now it's hard to know what the best decision is to make. I know I'm young, but I want my mind to be at peace before I die. I want to of built my own heaven on earth knowing I did my best. I don't want to die a lonely sack of shit that lost his way. I see all these posts from people about how there losing there minds from a week of quarantine. Yet there the same people that made me feel awful about how I was unemployed Asif it doesn't effect your mental health. Now it's ok that there moaning too because we're all in the same boat. Well imagine how hard it is when we're not all in the same boat. When it's just you in that boat and the rest of society is in a bigger one looking down at you because they can't see what your growing through. I just wish I could have a fucking refresh button on my brain. I used to have a beautiful mind. Now it's full of shit and I don't know how to change that."

I feel guilty because in my eyes they seem so unjustified, I manage to be in a neutral mood most of the time, I can usually enjoy myself in the company of others and the life I have is one I'm extremely thankful for. The only problems I have that I know for a fact change my mental state are physical problems including, like chronic fatigue, chronic pain and frequent injury due to scoliosis and hypermobility and weakened joints,tendons and ligaments. Due to these I often reserve myself from doing activities I've loved since I was still chewing pencils in school learning about multiplication, such as Competing in track and field events and now even simpler things like going for a jog daily. Starting with feelings of boredom and disinterest in my hobbies and social interaction it slowly spread and mutated, boredom becoming apathy and disinterest in socialising becoming complete emotional isolation from all my 'friends and most of my loved ones'. It stayed like this for months until eventually I started to wonder if life was worth living. At this point I'm time it was about 2 years ago just at the start of Fall, I started to hurt myself but I never felt like I needed to. I kept doing this until eventual I thought about how it would impact my family, and just like that I stopped. Being around other people in my life who had openly talked about similar experiences to what I was having I felt a small dagger of guilt press itself into my stomach as I thought about how often they deeply struggled with soul crushing relapses. For the other people around me, it seemed to haunt them like an inescapable burden, yet I almost wasn't affected by my decision to stop. I felt/feel like a fraud, telling myself I did it to feel better but yet being able to get clean with almost no difficulty. It wasn't right and I feel like an attention seeking poser when I think back on it. I hid it and I only opened up to people who reciprocated the circumstances and yet I feel like my ""faking"" the need for it was nothing more than an insult to everybody else who truly struggles with staying clean and safe. Ever since then I began to think about suicide as well. The greatest mistake of my life was the first time I seriously considered it. Except the only thought I had on it was how people would react. Convincing myself I was going to do it because I would be better off and not because I wanted to see how people would act. After once again talking to the people around me about it and having them tell me to take care of myself and that I'm loved. I made a pathetic half hearted attempt to kill myself. Only to very predictably survive and once again have people support me in my state of ' vulnerability '. During the time I felt as if it was all very real, I'd never blatantly fake something just for attention. But looking back I feel so ashamed that I worried people around me who have struggles much worse than I do and worried them over me when they could have been focusing on helping themselves. I leeched off of their empathy for me and stopped them from doing what they needed to do to be better. Since then there's been a dagger of guilt stabbed in me, slowly being pressed deeper into my body. Since then I've gone through cycling waves of, feeling bored but fine most of the time and only sad/happy or anything other than disinterested about 10% of the time shifting into weeks and months of almost complete apathy in the company of others and sadness so bad it sends crippling waves of pain pulsing through my chest whenever I'm left alone with my own thoughts. But because of the way I used these issues in the past as a guise to let myself be convinced I was deserving of the attention, time and care given to me by people much more deserving than me. I can't trust myself that these feelings are real. I don't trust myself to not do this purely to get some sort of sick gratification from people worrying about my own safety and health. The last 6 months I've been in a state of constant sadness whenever I stop moving (figuratively and literally). With pain so bad sometimes it almost paralyzes me wherever I am, with the feeling of my insides being rotted away by guilt and pain from these episodes. Suicidal thoughts became more and more frequent until now I can't go half a day without vividly imagining killing myself. Despite everything I still have the same thoughts as I used to. Every time I think if dying my initial thought is of how would people around me react, what would they all do. Then of course my thoughts flit away to how it will make my sadness go away. I can't trust myself enough to know whether all of this is real or if my mind forcing me to suffer just so I can stay relevant and significant to the other people around me and I guess myself. This is all I think about anymore and I can't believe in my own thoughts because I know how much they lie to me and persuade me things are different to how they actually are. I don't know if this pain is real or just a sick excuse for me to continue and validate my reason to share my 'struggling' with people close to me to feel important and cared for. I don't know what to believe. I can't trust what my mind is telling me I'm really feeling. Maybe this is payback for all of the worry and effort I stole from people who needed it for themselves. Karma fulfilling the issues and pain I convinced myself I had and now I'm getting a taste of properly. I don't know what to believe. I just feel so guilty that for so long I relied on people who were fighting so hard to keep themselves going, just to indulge whatever disgusting subconscious need I had to get from their attention and worry. I'm not sure what I expect from this post, and I don't know what I really want from it either. But please respond. At the very least I need to know whether or not I really am leeching off of others. Based on what I've said please tell me if I'm as bad a person I think. I feel so guilty about making my problems out to be bad enough that I got others in worse positions than me to give me empathy and support I needed only to gratify myself by capitalising on such horrible things as committing suicide. I'm suffering so badly now and I need to know if this is penance."

I also have a trust issue that Ive been dealing with my entire life to where Ive never been 100% honest with anyone in my entire life. I have never expressed my true feelings to anyone because I am afraid of the vulnerability and what anyone would think. I dont know or even remember what makes me truthfully happy to wake up anymore. I know the drinking is just masking my depression and if anything making it worse. I dont want to go through life unhappy and Im afraid Im headed down that path.

I cant eat, sleep, or function. Ive tried to get sober over and over again, been through detox after detox, and program after program, but Im to weak minded to be able to walk on this earth while living in my own skin. I have let everyone, including myself, who has ever tried to help me walk through my addiction down so whats the point of even trying to stop anymore. When I do stop and get sober, forced or on my own volition, my perception of life and myself doesnt shift so I just throw in the towel at the mere attempt to ever get clean again. I dont believe I will ever have the capacity to build my life up to a point where I dont care about burning it down. Ive realized that the drugs arent the problem, I am. The drugs are a product of my own perceived self worth, a product of the impending doom and crushing fear that engulfs me every time I walk outside, a product of my past trauma, and a tool thats a necessity to function through normal everyday life. I havent looked in the mirror in months because I hate what the fuck I see. I see the bridges I burned, the people Ive disappointed, the years of regret, my selfishness and manipulation, the physical toll Ive put my body through, the lies, and the unparalleled number of shortcomings I have under my belt. These thoughts loop through my mind on repeat with each rotation feeling like a gut punch of anxiety tearing me apart. I genuinely fucking hate every part of who I am inside and out. I dont leave my apartment unless its to buy drugs. I dont interact with other people because I believe I am not a decent or likable person. I wear the same clothes everyday, i barely shower or brush my teeth, and I dont answer any calls or respond to any texts because I just dont have the motivation to do so. I cut off everyone who used to be close to me because I have the core belief that I dont deserve anyone or anything, and feel as though I am a blatant annoyance and a burden. I feel like I deserve to feel this misery. Ive been clean from heroin for 3 months after getting a sweet tease of death from an od, but now I just want to IV fent into my arm, turn blue, and finally stop existing. Finally stop recycling through the pain, anxiety, regret, and sadness that manifests my life everyday. Finally stop looking through a lens that only can discern different shades of black and grey. Finally stop living in the skin I hate. Im not trying to seem like a charity case, I usually compartmentalize to the extreme and am a wall when it comes to vulnerability, but the blackness that has consumed me recently is to overbearing to put a cap on and blatantly avoid. I just need to get it out and this is my outlet. This is just the reality I put myself in and the reality I desperately want to end. I feel like Im handcuffed to drugs, especially meth my DOC, and its slowly tearing me apart limb by limb. I feel like a shell of my former self trapped in this vicious cycle of chasing a euphoria thats just out of reach until I find myself either in psychosis, the hospital, locked up, or losing the relationship of someone who I genuinely care about. I keep trying to climb out of this hole that I keep digging deeper for myself, but Im to exhausted to continue this losing battle. Im just to tired to keep fighting. Years ago I could fight this feeling and could take strides towards the dim light in the distance, a beacon of hope that I fantasized about one day being able to capture and utilize, but that light has long disappeared. I have been engulfed in darkness only looking forward to the miniature bursts of fabricated dopamine and serotonin spikes from the meth I abuse to keep me toxically afloat. I just want it to end. Ive paralyzed myself to the point of no return and the implications of my decisions dont leave that many optimistic outcomes. Im only 19 which is degrading in and of itself being that Im this much of a dependent crack head so early into my life. Im conscious of the fact that addiction is a progressive disease and I can vividly envision where I could be in the next 5-10 years, so why pull these chains of misery any longer? Maybe Im just somewhat psychotic because I havent slept in like 3 days or maybe this is just me fully wrapping my head around my shitty life and the fucked up trajectory im on, either way I am not okay. Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks if you read this."
46,vulnerability,depression,my story,2,g9a8a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g9a8a2/my_story/,2020-04-28 07:47:31," Just thought id take the time to share some opinions of mine and to express how i feel emotionally. As lockdown progresses its inevitable to feel like each day is being lived with less purpose and the memories of my happiness and content are becoming more distant. Coming from someone with a very unique mindset and a history of mental health issues i feel as though insanity and helplessness is inevitable during this difficult time although for some people the feeling of isolation began far before the coronavirus pandemic. I feel at the stage in life where each day feels wasted and i envy my past self for taking happiness for granted. One of the few things ive ever been good at is hiding my real emotions and this feels like something that im going to have to keep up for the rest of my life. Most of you who know me personally will know i engage in daily cannabis use, sometimes as much as 3 times a day and while many of you think its just a bad habit it really does go deeper than this. It seems to me that the only time im not constantly hurting inside is when im under the influence of cannabis or alcohol and as much as id like to stop it doesnt seem like a possibility for the foreseeable future, as much as i know that it worsens mental health and also damages the brain sometimes i genuinely feel like without it i would be spending my entire life in complete misery. While its unarguably a great thing that people talk about mental health more than ever it also creates a false sense of relatability between sufferers and average people. The days of my happiness ended around the end of december 2018 when i fell into a rather vicious circle of self destruction and constant grieving, I have came to the conclusion that when my grandmother left home i began feeling an emptiness inside caused by her absence. Since i was a young child my grandmother is the only person ive ever felt truly safe around and able to confide in, as many of you will know i had to endure years of abuse as a younger child right up until my 13th birthday when it ultimately came to an end. I know now that the things i had to see and hear have both mentally and emotionally scarred me for life to a point in which i will never fully recover. i have vivid memories of getting beaten, horrassed and stolen from in my childhood as well as witnessing my mother and younger sister being abused and as much as i would never wish any of this on my worst enemy sometimes i wish people could take a step in my shoes and then maybe they would understand my vulnerability but enough dwelling on the past, the reason im writing this is to focus on my life right now. Every day i feel more distant from my family to the point in which it feels as though we are nothing more than 3 people living in the same house and while i do have a father i have always felt lacking of a father figure and have never really known how it feels to be in a family. It seems highly likely that the only way there is a possibility of me being happy again would be to completely start fresh somewhere else, maybe in a foreign country where i can have the opportunity to start fresh and meet people who have genuine interest in my life and get things back on track although unfortunately Its becoming more and more unlikely that this will ever happen because i have came to the soul crushing realisation that nothing i do has ever or will ever be a success and i will forever remain in the depressive and self destructive rut that i am currently in."

I applied to 3 schools. One offered and I really dont want it, the second school with an interview that Ive done and waiting for the offer and the last with no response. Cant blame anyone but myself. I just cant bring myself to study and thats the results I got. Initially I was really optimistic about my life. Whereas my dateline was 1st June. Everything that didnt happen according to my liking can end in the date that I set. But now it seems that I cant bring myself to the bright side anymore. 24 May 2020 will be the dateline. I dont want to care anymore and I really dont want to live. Call me selfish or whatever but I really just cant. Im just really worried about my friend, shell tell me whatever is gg on and Im the one shell call when he is having a panic Attack or crying... wish I could do the same but I cant. I dont want to show my vulnerability to her even though its okay. Once I read my offer the first thing that happen was a mind blank. I cant imagine the adult life I would want to have and all I could do was panic and cry. Not sure if youre still reading. I really cant go on with this life anymore. Im really trying my best trying to be the best I cant but right now I cant do it. This is so tiring I cant live anymore."

I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, anxiety, dysthymia, and chronic fatigue syndrome. This week has been a little extra rough. I'm having trouble with my landlords who I live with, pretty sure one of them just absolutely despises me, personality clash even though I try hard to be friendly but mostly stay the hell out of her way. I got totally reamed on Reddit in another ""safe"" community when I asked for advise about my living situation (called a loser and absolute failure at life; I don't really disagree). Found out the last ex boyfriend who dumped me without explanation (no closure) is engaged three months later to the girl he got with not long after me. Had some female cycle issues. Got screwed with a huge bill from my psychiatrist office which I am in the process of contesting. Feeling isolated and low energy. I have been massively suicidal this week, though I'm not at risk this exact moment because I would want to have several things in place before I burden my family with my death. I am trying hard to take care and do my coping mechanisms, but things are not going so hot with that. I called the mental health resource line offered by my work and they escalated my case because of my suicidal thoughts and then never called or emailed me back. Struggling with working from home today because I woke up at 3 AM with a panic attack and couldn't get back to sleep. My therapist can't have a call-session with me until Sunday. I thought I might go out of town to visit my family this weekend to get a change of scenery but my sis shot me down and said she can't deal with people right now. I just went for a walk to clear my head and my neighbor's three dogs escaped the house and attacked and bit me (I'm fine). These are all minor happenings, but in my state of vulnerability it felt like more blows and a big Fuck You from the universe. I'm looking for signs that I should keep going, that life is worth living, that some Godlike entity loves me. Thank you for reading or any thoughts. You can be real or harsh but try not to be cruel."

Wrote this as bulletpoints in my notes app thats why theres the circles. TLDR: I cant really bring myself to summarize it because I feel it does a disservice to my experience. It actually kinda hurts to try to do a summary but heres an attempt at a summary. Verbally/physically abusive alcoholic parents push me into a deep dark depression, I go to a very challenging stressful college and take out loans I cant pay back. Mom attempts suicide for the second time, blaming me before my final exams, I talk her down somehow over the phone fail my exams and get put on academic probation. Ive got repressed anger issues from an abusive football coach that tried to Adam Sandler style Waterboy me as a kid. Hes in prison for murder. Meet a girl over the summer. She keeps me on the hook, flirts with other guys in front of me. Shes in my friend groups, works at the same place, so that sucks. Develop drinking/drug addiction. Get abused some more. Drink more. Girl (who Im not dating but I made my feelings clear to) fucks somebody at a party that we both ubered to together. Alone. Loneliness depression anxiety anger. I get super drunk and lose my shit. Cause +$5000 worth of property damage (nobody hurt). Roommate snitches on me, I get thrown in the psych ward. Crazy guy heckles and beats off in front of me while were stuck in a padded room when the nurses left to change shifts. Was in the holding cell 9 hours then put in the psych ward for 6 days. Finally got out made it back home for spring break. Covid starts and were stuck at home. And Im essentially back in the psych ward haha. Stuff is calm right now though. AND IM 2 MONTHS SOBER SOMEHOW. Heres most of my life story related to why I am the way I am  Dad cheated on my mom caught a bad STD  Gave her the STD  They got married because my mom got pregnant with me, they were scared and stuck with it  They hated each other before this, with my mom verbally attacking my dad almost every single day  Cant divorce because its a family buisness, without the two of them working then they both lose the house, their jobs, and have to completely start over  Mom develops schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, already had slight OCD I think  Verbal abuse doesnt describe the warfare that my dad underwent. Theres a difference between seeing someone cry and seeing someone completely broken, their soul crushed, dismantled at the core and unable to speak, unable to think. Saying she broke him was an understatement  This whole time Im the peacemaker. At least I was at first, trying over hours to calm her down. Until I couldnt anymore, then it just was try to keep her from actually killing him.  Neighbors heard screaming from my house every night for weeks, finally called a domestic officer when she lost it even more than usual, my dads mom and sister came over who she hates.  Had to hold my mom back, to keep her from assaulting my grandmother right in front of a police officer in the middle of the street, with neighbors watching.  Shit keeps happening.  Oh btw shes an alcoholic as well, like downs at least 1-2 bottles of vodka per week its almost impressive. Day drunk etc.  She drunkenly cries and tells my little bro shes gonna kill herself with the bottle of pills in her hand, and leaves the room. He runs to get me freaking out not knowing what to do.  I run to her locked room and kick in the door tell her to calm down that I love her, etc. etc. etc.  Btw {redacted college name} is wicked expensive, and we dont have money like that, my parents wanted me to go to {X public college} I wanted to go to my one, showed them numbers demonstrating that the price would be similiar. When I accepted my offer, 1 month later the new bright futures scholarship that I would have applied for changed from $5k to a full ride, meaning I would have no debt rn if I went to X. So my parents were mad about that along with my shitty gpa  Back to my mom she blames me and my dad for her feeling this way, that her life is fucked because of me, and that Im a waste of money, that I was a bad investment for acting like a dumbass up at -, drinking, fucking around, and partying too much(I really wasnt)  The suicide help hotline is bullshit by the way haha, I called them before I kicked in the door they had me on hold for 30 minutes, then when they finally answered they said they couldnt help me talk down SOMEONE ELSE from suicide that they could only help if it was me, and my mom didnt want to go on the phone so I hung up  Eventually I calm her down somehow  I then went completely numb, emotionless for a month afterwards, a coldness started to develop in my chest  Moms alcoholism gets worse, starts getting physical with my dad  Little bro is all alone while Im at college, I always protected him from this so that hurt me the most, because they would come unlock his room and fight in front of him so he couldnt escape  He got really good at guitar to drown them out  One night my mom attacked my dad, he took her laptop phone and something else and threw them on the roof around 3 am on a school night during little bros midterm week  Shes too drunk to climb the ladder, wakes him up and tells him to get his ass on the roof to pick up the shit, he gets out of bed, no shirt, no phone, wearing pants thats it.  He climbs up the ladder grabs the stuff and reaches down to my mom to hand it down, she climbs halfway up the ladder, takes her hands off the ladder to get the stuff, falls off the ladder twisting her ankle really bad, knocking the ladder over.  She goes inside and passes out on the couch, she kicked my dad out of the house so hes not there. And little bros all alone on the roof with no phone, no ladder, no shirt, and nobody there for him when he has school and exams the next day.  Thankfully its a shitty one story house, but he had to jump off of the roof about 12 feet, in the pitch dark, onto a downward slope covered in dog shit in order to get down  Gets inside and calls me and I lose it, because Im completely helpless, I cant help at fucking all from 700 miles away.  Life goes on  About 5 months later its either April or May my sophomore year, Ive got 4 hard final exams in 3 days, with the two hardest both on the same day  The night before the 2 hardest exams (same day) I get a phone call from little bro, the same situation with my mom is happening again, only this time I cant tackle her or stop her from taking the pills, Im completely truly helpless to stop her and hoping she doesnt kill herself over the phone, little bro gives her the phone and leaves because he cant handle it. I respect that, Im glad he did that, I didnt want him to see that.  But I sure as hell couldnt handle it either. But I had to. There was no one else. And I dont want to watch my mom die drunk alone and crying on FaceTime.  Phone call lasts about 8 hours  Im exhausted and hadnt studied  Fail both exams the next day, fail one class and shouldve failed another but a teacher gave me a pity C- I didnt deserve and Im grateful for it  Summer plans are fucked, Im freaking out, the failed class was a prereq that can only be taken in the spring, Im afraid I might be forced to take a year off.  Im put on academic probation.  I also found out I failed right before my birthday haha, thats why I was sleeping in the airport on my birthday, was because I was flying home to try to figure out what the hell I was gonna do  Ended up taking 3 classes that summer, only got 3 non-consecutive weeks off. Got some bad phone calls there as well.  2/3 classes were taken in {study abroad place} on financial aid (that was nice, def couldve been worse.)  Met a girl there that I really cared alot about  There was a 10:1 ratio of guys to girls on that trip, felt like I was on the losing end of the bachelorette haha kinda drove me crazy but thats whatever  Started to develop a drinking problem there, to cope with my pain from dealing with my parents, and seeing her flirting with all the other guys, right in front of me. I knew that I could be good enough for her but I wasnt because my head was still so fucked up from the abuse my parents put me through (forgot to mention that earlier, my mom would fuck with my head a lot if my dad wasnt there then she would come fuck with me, meanwhile I have to be her safety net, I also have to be my dads safety net, I also am protecting my little brother as much as I can, so the whole family is basically reliant upon me because Im good at talking people down, and they dont want to go to psychologists, and Im good at helping people regain sanity. And I still am. But I lost my own sanity in the process)  Anyways Im still fucked up from my mom so I cant be the person that I could be in front of the girl, kept fucking up, didnt get to show her my real personality at all, just the awkward ass shell of it.  We come back to the states yada yada  School starts  Sorry yeah this totally isnt bulletpoints at all I kinda just have to tell the story like this  The girl I cared about and tried to get over is also a (blank) major, is my roommates best friend, my roommates girlfriends best friend, is a member of a sorority we mix with, is an employee at a place where I work, has a class with me, wants to be friends with me, is the little of an ex of mine that Im still friends with. Basically I see her everywhere. Things go well, until they dont, which is later.  Rewind, I started developing anger issues in the study abroad. One night I got another phone call about some fucked up shit little bro had to deal with. Im drunk at the same time. The whole group is hanging out inside drinking and I walk outside for the call. Right after he tells me this I start to lose it, Im punching bushes at the resort were staying at, listening to music to try to calm down, just kinda freaking out. The girl comes outside while Im doing this with this guy thats a lot funnier than me, it was clear they were headed back to a room. She was laughing, joking with him. I dont see them coming, she asks if Im okay, I told her to fuck off. Walk all the way over to the street and start looking for a car to jump in front of. But it was late and the streets were pitch black. None came some time I walked back and went to sleep.  I didnt want to die, there was just a thing about impact that I learned from football as a kid that made my emotions highly tied to physical actions.  Ive played tackle football since I was 8 up through high school. The little league coach I had for years (thats currently in prison for like decapitating and dismembering a prostitute in his home while on drugs) would try the water boy technique with me. If you havent seen the Waterboy by Adam Sandler, basically somebody fucks with you, or pisses you off, then you get mad, and when you go into the game because youre mad you hit harder and do better. So he did this with me and it worked. Everyday he had the other kids on the team bully me, steal my gloves, push me over, mock me, call me names and shit, just generally fuck with me. Then when I want against them in practice Id fucking destroy them. Just kinda get tunnel vision and this beast with no control, no thoughts, would come out. Brain working at full power, but no fucking control over it.  ^this worked great for football, I was amazing, wrecking people that were a lot bigger than me  It also fucked up my developing brain, making it so that when I get angry, adrenaline goes through my veins and if I dont act like a fucking animal then I dont know how to cope with my emotions  If I dont hit or get hit then it just stagnates in my chest.  Being a functional human I eventually grew out of that, but alcohol can bring it back. Never against people though.  My alcoholism turned into a moderate drug addiction.  One night I did about 14 whippets in a row, my roommate and his girlfriend were in the room talking about the girl I liked. Saying how she was torn between dating these 3-4 different guys. I was all alone and her biggest problem was that too many awesome guys wanted to date her. And I get thats hard in its own way. But you also have to understand how much it hurts to hear that. A loneliness for mere companionship was what I had. Just feeling worthless after being told that so many times. I quietly went into the closet and started doing whippets, and I didnt stop. For that 40 second high I was on the top of the fucking world and nothing could touch me. Your uncontrollable pure laughter echos inside your head as you close your eyes and sink back into your chair. And then suddenly its over. And suddenly the pain is back. And suddenly I realize Im sitting sad and alone in a literal dark closet to gain enough privacy to induce my brain into a hypoxic manic state, literally killing brain cells as I numb the pain, while my roommate and his girlfriend helped the girl I cared for pick her next boyfriend over FaceTime weighing out the pros and cons. And Im not on the list. And its a small room and the closet door is thin. I can hear all of it. I grab some headphones to drown them out as I sink back and do another one.  And another one  And another one  And then the 4th or 5th one doesnt hit so hard, so I hold my breath longer and do 2 in a row (not good)  And this progression continues  Around 4 am my roommate opened the door and stopped me saying he was scared for me and that his girlfriend (who was still there, shes basically a 3rd roommate in our 1 room dorm) was crying because she thought I was trying to commit suicide. I wasnt, but I definitely knew I was killing brain cells and didnt care at fucking all. Knew I was actively retarding myself but didnt care. I was chasing that agonizingly dull numbness from pain because anything was better than what I was feeling.  Time passes I quit doing whippets for a while  Wake up to a phone call  Apparently my mom the night before counted up all of my dads medication, poured them out on the kitchen table, counted them and put them in labeled plastic bags. She found 1 missing viagra pill, which my dad receives for hormone adjustments not just sex, and was convinced he was cheating on her again.  Hes sleeping in my room, she opens the door while hes asleep and starts beating the shit out of him screaming in his face. In a daze he throws her off of him, (because thats what ya do when ya wake up to being punched in the face) and runs outside. She chases after him and starts attacking him in the street. My neighbors come outside because theyre woken up by the screaming and yelling and come over to try to calm my mom down  The neighbors a 70 year old sweet heart of a man.  When he gets close to her trying to calm her down, she starts attacking him too.  He says fuck it and leaves going inside, my dad leaves the house, my mom goes inside.  The neighbors wife, an absolute sweetheart, calls me in shambles over the things my mom said to her. Says shes so sorry for us boys and she had no idea. I calm her down and tell her we turned out alright and itll all work out, lying in a soothing cheerful tone as tears well up in my eyes.  So Im told that over the phone first thing in the morning, and Im afraid my moms gonna attempt suicide again  Call her over the phone she hangs up, its 8am, shes already drunk.  She keeps hanging up, blaming me saying fuck you and stuff. I tell her to get help she hangs up  I tell her if she doesnt get professional help then Im gonna call the cops because I dont want to lose you, and Im scared for you, and I dont want you to die. After more swearing, she says okay fine fuck it.  I tell her to get in the car. I hear her get in the car.  I tell her to start the car, she starts the car.  She says There ya go I just started the car are you happy now fucker?  A dark thought crosses my mind.  I tell her to open the garage door.  She laughs and hangs up  I call her back 3 times no answer  Text her no answer  Call dad hes not there  Call mom again no answer  I call 911, but Im not in my home state. Turns out 911 only connects you to police for your area code, I have to call the non emergency number for my area code yada yada.  About 5 minutes later Im finally on the line with a police officer, they make me tell them the whole story before sending someone over.  It took like 35 minutes for them to get somebody to my house to check on my mom, who now hates me because I called the cops on her out of fear.  But she didnt kill herself.  My drinking problem worsens, theres a bar at my school that works on the food plan and fake IDs work there so I become a regular to the bartender.  Skip to winter break yada yada  Im home  Moms mad at me screaming in my face.  Shes trying to build a court case against my dad for abuse by screaming randomly, so that to the neighbors it sounds like my dad is abusing my mom, when hes never laid a hand on her.  I start videotaping her while shes screaming to prove that shes faking it.  She then she starts screaming at me, throws my food for dinner on the ground and slaps me in the face, then tries punching me again. Im a lot bigger than her so I block it and just go outside. She apologizes later  My Drinking problem gets even worse  Return to school from this most recent winter break  Im drinking heavily every single day. I didnt skip a day from January to February. Im blowing through my food plan, spending more on alcohol at the bar than I am on food. Like way more.  I start to do more and more drugs  Start doing cocaine, Xanax again, whippets, shrooms with drinking, poppers, Percocet, anything I can get my hands on to get off of this plane of existence  One night I got drunk, took a xanax and a half, and an eighth of shrooms. I freaked out had a terrible trip.  If the Xanax hadnt made my coordination so bad that I couldnt stand up or walk, then I wouldve killed myself. I intended too. I passed out on the ground because my bed was too high for me to pull myself into. It was like that scene in Wolf of Wall Street where hes crawling on the ground because the drugs were too strong.  My story comes to its peak one week after that, which was one week before spring break.  Im going partyhopping one night. The girl from the study abroad is with me the whole night, she wanted to split an Uber with me between the parties, played pong with me, were hanging out all night, we laugh and have fun. The nights going good.  Im having fun for what feels like the first time in a long time. All of my friends are there, were all drunk, you get the picture.  Im really underselling my relationship with this girl, by this point Id told her most of the stuff about my parents. Shes told me her story. Were close. Weve got a lot in common. I really like her.  Ive tried getting over her, multiple times by now and I just couldnt at all. No matter how hard I tried I couldnt and she was everywhere.  So that night were party hopping and having fun. Im not trying to score or anything, Im just painfully alone, and really care about this girl.  Throughout the normal days my depression and anxiety combine to make adrenaline that would sit unreleased, feeling like an actual weight in my chest constantly pushing down. Every SECOND of every day, PHYSICALLY feeling my depression and loneliness was just killing me. And it totally didnt help that my roommate and his super nice girlfriend had a 5-star relationship. They shared the same bed, shared clothes, brushed their teeth together, it was amazing. I was really happy for them. And also painfully reminded of how alone I was every single day. I became a permanent 3rd wheel within my own room. It started to make me go insane because this other girl would keep me on the hook. Shed flirt with me and then go flirt with other guys, knowing that I liked her, I gave her a rose on Valentines Day, I mean it was pretty clear. But she just kept doing it, and then checking in on me.  So the partyhopping night she meets some random guy at the last party were at. Ive been there for her for a fucking year and she just finds some random guy. Which is fine. Consent is important ya know, and if she doesnt want me thats her choice. She has the right as a person to turn that switch on or off for me whenever she likes, she doesnt owe me shit, I get that, I know that, I have nothing wrong with that.  But it just hurts to be nothing more than a fucking light switch to her ya know.  They go alone into a locked room together, its safe to assume what theyre doing, and I cant be mad at her, its not like were even dating! So I chuckle at a shitty joke some drunk idiot is saying. And I drink. And I pour. And I drink. And I pour....  And by this point my liver had trained my tolerance pretty freaking high from drinking straight bourbon at the bar every night, running up $70 tabs on the food plan. So Im somewhere high in the double digits just pouring alcohol down my throat. The guy that couldnt stand up straight looks over to me confused and tells me to stop drinking. Youve probably had enough man  I start laughing, thinking to myself haha youre right man. I have had enough of this shit  I say Youre right man I have had enough, and Im gonna keep drinking.  Alright man, like really, you gotta stop dude  I tell him to fuck off, he tries to take my drink, I step back and finish half a solo cup of straight shitty vodka out of spite.  Doesnt matter Im going home anyways.  I walk out the door into the hallway  Around that same time the girl comes out of the room (they were in there for about an hour) and follows me out into the hall  are you okay?  yeah im all good, have some stuff in the morning so Im gonna head out  wait no really are you okay, I dont believe you...  yeah im really great, it was a fun night. im just gonna catch the next bus  My face kinda expressionless as my toes clench up in my shoes. Im counting to ten, trying to hold it back, Im almost gone just get out of the building come on motherfucker just get out of the building thats all you have to do. I turn with a wave and start to walk towards the stairs.  She reaches out and grabs my shoulder No really Im serious you have to tell me whats up  A defeated laugh comes out of my mouth as my vision gets blurred.  I say alright  Then I stumbled into a painfully eloquent speech that I only remember half of. My alcoholism at the bar had kinda trained me to be able, when drunk, to speak very clearly and accurately. But I also had no filter. I didnt swear or yell at all to be clear. But my frustration was clear.  I tell her how much I care about her, that Ive got a crush on her, she says I know.  I tell her I just legitimately want you to be happy, that thats why I gave you the rose, (this wasnt just bullshit this was true) was because someone as great as you deserves to have a rose on Valentines Day. And I just needed her to know that she is cared about.  Yada yada  I tell her something like:  I like you, and I want to be something with you, but if that not mutual then thats totally fine! Tell me, I wont hate you. Ill still be friends with you. But I cant do whatever THIS is anymore. Its bad for my health and my parents have already left me in pretty bad shape.  She gives me a hug and says she wants to talk about it in the morning. Im pretty out of it.  The guy comes out in the hallway. I laugh and shake his hand  Hey whats up buddy hope youre having a fun night.  I think he could tell that Im kinda being sarcastic, or its kinda forced. but I pull it off well enough that he politely replies  Haha thanks man you too, fun party right?  The girl looks very uncomfortable. It almost makes me feel better.  Yeah man, I was just about to catch the bus, Ill let you two get back to it  I walk down the stairs.  I make it out of the building.  I start laughing again, as my eyes well up.  The beast is out.  When Im out of sight I start running.  Sprinting.  Shouting and swearing.  I dive shoulder first into a bush, in a football style tackle. The bush snaps in half, I scrape my knees and elbows as I slam into the ground. The broken branch cut up my arm a bit so now theres a little bit of blood.  But the beast was still there  God was laughing at me and I didnt think it was fucking funny  I walk back to campus, drunk out of my mind, stumbling in the fucking road. Alone again, with my thoughts to keep me company.  If I ever had any chance with her I totally blew it. Its not like there was no one else, there was other girls I was talking to and stuff. She was just the only thing I could see ya know just freaking blinded by her. And I was pissed because I knew that if I could be the real me then I could show her, and shed see what we could be together, how happy we could be.  I get back to campus, Im drunk and shouting, the beast is back, my chest weighs heavy as hell on me, the physical feeling is killing me.  I see one of those swinging bench/tables, its like if a picnic table were a rocking chair ya know.  I flip it over and completely destroy it. Beyond repair the administrators told me.  Its a $5,000 bench  Im still losing it. Now Im cold, and my card isnt working to get into the dorm. And I left both of my jackets back at the party.  My roommate hears me yelling outside from our room across the quad and gets two large friends and comes outside to restrain me.  He was scared of me because I was going fucking psycho  Between my mom, and the girl, and the stress of schoolwork, my alcoholism, drug use, depression, abuse, and fucking hatred over who I was, I was just burning inside and was in a bad mental state. I was so pissed off, and from years of football I got burned into my brain that if somebody fucks with you, then you hit them back harder. Well now there was nobody to hit. It was the world fucking with me. It was god laughing at me. So I started destroying the shit around me.  They calmed me down and I got to bed  The roommate snitched on me to substance abuse about the bench, said he was worried for my safety and his own safety (fucking pussy. When he came out I calmed down real quick)  The school Substance abuse place called me when I woke up said that I could either come to the substance abuse office or have an officer come to my dorm room and take me there. I said okay and went there.  From there they made me talk, I told them about my mom a bit, nothing about the bench. They told me the roommate said something about a destroyed bench. But said that my safety was more important. They wanted me to go to the hospital in order to get checked out, make sure I didnt have withdrawals from substance abuse, shouldnt take more than an hour ended up lasting 6 days.  I wont get into all of the different ways the administrators tricked me, took advantage of their power over me as well as my vulnerability because there was a few. But they screwed me over  In the hospital they took all of my clothes and belongings, stripped me down, and then put me in a normal hospital bed.  Then they said they wanted to move me, but only if that is alright with me. I said okay sure, not knowing where they wanted to move me. I assumed another hospital bed.  They put me in a fucking padded room. Like the ones you see on tv with 4 other psychos in there, for 9 hours with no phone, 1 tv without the remote, and some shitty food. It was the holding cell for the psych ward.  Halfway through my 9 hours in that room this crazy guy comes up to me and say hey do you have a cigarette? A retarded but fair question. Im not wearing my own underwear right now how the fuck am I gonna have a cigarette, much less a lighter?  I replied Nah man I wish (trying to be polite)  He says Aw damn...  Alright no cigarette, DO YA WANNA FUCK!?  I say something like Nah fuck off dude what the fuck? Get the fuck away from me man  the nursing staff had just left for their lunch break. Im stronger than him so Im not really afraid but Im sussed out. I dont know what its like to go through what other people went through this was just what happened to me.  He says alright, then be like that ya little bitch takes one step back and starts beating off right in front of me.  Now I want to beat the shit out of this guy, but theyre already thinking Im crazy, Im in a fucking padded room, and I just want to get the fuck out of there. If they come in to see this guy in a bloody mess on the ground theyll lock me up and call me unstable.  Once you enter the hospital for mental related reasons they can legally hold you there for as long as the doctors like. AS LONG AS THEY WANT.  So I just sit there watching the same shitty news channel play on loop in the clear plastic box its locked in, while hes staring at me beating off, with no safety button I could press, no nurses to deal with him  Finally they move me into the psych ward from the holding cell.  This is already really fucking long so I wont Go into too much detail but it was fucked in the psych ward. Imagine living in a waiting room with a bunch of batshit crazy people for 6 days, no phone, they dont trust you with pencils so they give you fucking CRAYONS. They do safety checks on you every 15 minutes, including while youre in the shower or asleep. They shine a fucking flashlight on your face while youre trying to sleep every 15 minutes, every single night, throughout the entire night. And then when you tell them you didnt sleep well, they write that down as another symptom. And EVERYTHINGS a symptom. And you have to tell your whole story 5-6 times to 5-6 different people. And they are in control of every single thing you do.  Theyll wake you up in your bed at 7 am to have a meeting with 5 doctors and a social worker for no reason. I had to defend my case in my fucking underwear in front of 5 people first thing in the morning with no warning. They treat you like a child, but also like youre in jail, while not giving a shit about your general well-being and acting like they do. But they really dont.  Ill post below a picture of the drawing I had to make in the group session while I was in there  Oh also I told the doctors and nurses about the guy beating off, they CHUCKLED, and said Haha yeah Ive heard some pretty crazy stories about that holding cell WTF. Like I didnt want that guy to go to jail I know hes just messed up in the head but I expected them to do something to change that so it wouldnt happen again. Nope.  (Also my roommate laughed at that story. Fuck that guy, Im sick of him, weve been roommates for 3 years, thought he was like a brother to me. I flew him with me down to Florida one spring break. Then over one week he snitches on me, gets me thrown in the fucking psych ward then laughs at me being fucked with, fuck him)  Some guy left a journal in my room there hidden under the bed. Long story short for that he was only supposed to be in the psych ward for 6 days, ended up staying locked in there for a month and a half. So Im freaking out  There was an insane amount of breaches of privacy by the nurses the doctors, and they dont tell you anything about what theyre planning to do with you. They lie about the release date, Were gonna need a couple more days for -  I start making friends in the psych ward (HAHAHAHA)  Some crazy motherfuckers in there but I built up conversations and friendships to keep myself sane. Some people were in there waiting for court dates, others for other things. But nobody judges you.  The substance abuse lady from my school comes in and tells me that I might face consequences for the bench. Drunk and disorderly conduct. Yada yada, I tell her I expected confidentiality when I confirmed those statements, they had no other evidence it was me, when I said that I was in a very vulnerable state, and basically politely told her how fucked it would be to pursue punishment on me right now when Im held against my will in a psych ward that SHE TOLD ME WOULD BE A 1 HR CHECKUP. And I think I guilted/scared her into not pursuing legal action. But they wanted me to take part in a biweekly random drug testing program on my release  Eventually I get out and make it home, decide Im going sober as soon as I get out for as long as I can. Im not going back to that fucking place. Im also thinking to myself How the fuck was that experience at all good for my mental health?  Im totally over that girl, she wasnt worth flipping a bench over and definitely not going through all that shit for.  Im currently 2 months sober and feeling better because of it  And I think they canceled the drug testing program because of COVID  End of the story, I come home for spring break around when the covid started happening  All is good for a few days.  I tell my mom I love and forgive her for what she put me through, that shes the reason I was in there but I just want to put it behind us and move forwards  She starts attacking me while saying shes the real victim  Craziness ensues  Craziness dies down.  Right now were all at a stable but very delicate equilibrium in the household, so as long as nobody fucks with anybody else, nothing bad will happen  And it needs to be that way because we cant leave haha  And now Im here  My Zoloft has taken that weight off of my chest though so thats good, and Im really starting to feel normal again  So yeah thats just about the whole fucking spiel haha."

So i made a post a while ago about a female collegue and I that liked the same guy at work. He is not a direct collegue but comes by at work to hang up flyers. He is in the music industry and does some promotion on the side. So my female collegue is really pretty and sexy. A lot of guys like her and fall in love with her or like her for sex, in both ways she is very popular. Also she is bisexual and open about sex and while she is kind of perfect because she is very pretty and sexy, she also has a kind of girl next door look and vulnerability (some mental issues) that ironically make her even more appealing. The only annoying part about her is that she talks a lot about her self and her dates and her 'guys'. Even on my birthday she forgot it was my birthday but talked endlessly about the date she had last night. She seems to like to be the centre of attention, and if she isn't she will say or behave in a certain way that does maker her the centre of attention. So we like the same guy that comes to work once every week. A few months ago she almost wanted to ask the him out but then suddenly met someone else, a friend of a friend. They got into a relationship for a while. At that moment i thought i might as well give it a go and asked the guy out that we both liked. He turned me down and told me he had a girlfriend. At that moment i felt like this wasn't true and he just wasn't into me. I was a bit dissapointed of course to be rejected. My female collegue now broke it off this week with her boyfriend. As much as she was crazy in love and into him and had to hear stories about them being in love, now she is suddenly over him And now she and the guy from work that i also like are going to DATE.!!! He asked her out so that means he doesn't have a girlfriend and prefers my collegue over me I don't know what i expect from this post but i just wanted to vent and get some sympathy I guess and to hear that i still matter even though guys will prefer 'better' girls and that i still matter even though i feel like other people are 'gettting' everything, or have it all."

Ive learned to cope in many healthy ways. Im finding it extremely difficult now that Ive lost the one rock that I could always count on, my best friend. This person meant the world to me. Their family did too. I was able to work through my depression by talking to, spending time with, and feeling a part of something. Ive also been in love with this person for a long time. However, in my selfless ways, I never let that be a complication. Until recent I found out they were terribly unhappy in their marriage for many different reasons. I was here for her to speak her mind, offered her sound advice as her friend kept the love I felt seperste. I Respected her vulnerability and never compromised that. She then was so overwhelmed with everything and dropped the biggest blow on me that Ive ever felt. Shes been having an affair for a year and a half with some other guy. This crushed me and everything I ever knew. As a friend I was mad. As a lover Im heart broken. I feel horrible for her kids, for her husband. Now, I feel sick. I feel broken. But this isnt about me I kept telling myself. But then she said that this guy listened to her, was just like her, understood her, so on so forth. And then I ask, what was I to you through this time? That was the hardest thing to hear her say. Then she asked me,  do you love me? At this point I knew things will never be the same and I said, yes. She said why didnt you tell me... I felt the same way for a long time... I said because youre married with kids and I never knew you were unhappy, besides Im not that guy to home-wreck. I would never do that. Im better than that. I wanted to wait until she was settled and on her own two feet. But Id be there to help at all costs. And she knew that. Now Im left with nothing. I dont have my friend. I wont ever have the love that I felt, be real. Ive lost the relationship with a family that I care about. It will never be the same again... I cant shake this feeling of complete loneliness. I feel sick. I have no appetite. I cant feel anything. This level of depression is something I havent felt in a long time. Ive come here to just share... I know in time this all will pass, Im just looking for somewhere to share what I cant share with anyone in my day to day. Thank you in advance."

The more I try to push myself to think about myself and my future in a positive way, the quicker I keep hitting this impenetrable wall. It's made up of the fear that I'm irreversibly broken by mental illness, that I've developed some fucked up personality disorder that I'm not strong enough to recover from. That I'm incapable of love and honest connection, and that I'm unlovable and unacceptable to everyone on top of that. The only thing that helps is knowing I'm not the only person who feels/thinks this way, but that's not much comfort. Are we truly 'broken' forever? &amp;#x200B; For quite some time now, I've been coping with this feeling by not confronting it at all, desperately distracting myself when the anxieties bubble up, small-talk bullshitting my way through the conversations I couldn't manage to avoid (which I don't do fully consciously, I'm still wanting to pursue relationships with \[P\], \[B\], \[S\], and some others), and just staying stagnant (and rotting) in my current stage of life, which is living with mom and dad, trying to convince myself and others I'm actively looking for work/fixing my mental state, and frequently, ""secretly"" drinking and consuming weed/nicotine in any form I can find them (it almost feels like an obvious fact that mom, dad, and I have silently agreed is hopeless to bring up, or maybe I'm imagining this). Sometimes I'll watch a new movie/show/youtube channel, or hear some new music. I still haven't moved past my most recent fixations, The Smiths, Slipknot, Depeche Mode, Parasite, Hereditary, some Pixar movies, etc., it feels so rare to stumble on entertainment I really love, and I'm clueless as to how to discover more that really resonates. One new way of thinking I've managed to pick up is how I don't constantly, actively shame myself for my current life circumstances, I feel like my current perception of myself is slightly more grounded in reality and more thoughtful of others + humans' limitations, and more compassionate. Sometimes with \[P\] I feel warm, almost safe, even though I'm in my own head/world so often. I still don't trust those warm feelings completely, and my trust in myself/others isn't anywhere near restored. Sometimes trust and vulnerability with him feels like an achievable goal, and I still act as though they are, because I now consciously understand that's how I need to act to feel connected to anyone at all. We understand a lot of each other's feelings and ways of thinking, and he's really thoughtful and gentle. I use better emotional boundaries with everyone lately, I don't fake contentment to avoid conflict as much, don't overshare, I recognize which ways of my thinking are overdramatic or open to nuance. &amp;#x200B; I'm just in a weird-feeling spot in life overall. I feel hopeless, terrified, and alienated still, but I also feel a little capable and open to problem-solving. Like I've sort of grown up a bit. I don't know. That's it for now. Writing all this down somewhat coherently was helpful. &amp;#x200B; \[Wrote that stuff in my notes app earlier, and I've been feeling so detached lately, so I'm not just lurking here today.

My friends have started to notice as well but i dont want to show vulnerability or speak to them because i dont feel right speaking my emotions out so i just decide to isolate myself at home instead.But yeah pretty much this whole academic year has been really shit for me...
55,vulnerability,depression,Im afraid if I open up once Ill never be able to hold it together again.,1,fg7qlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fg7qlg/im_afraid_if_i_open_up_once_ill_never_be_able_to/,2020-03-10 14:44:19,"Sorry this is so deep and literally just all about my problems. But thats what Reddits for I guess. Loneliness makes way for a lot of introspection. My number one problem is that I never say what I want to say. I cant express my feelings at all, ever. Even to myself, I rarely cry, and when I have, it has felt forced and meaningless, not relieving. I cant fully open up to a single person in my life, so they all think Im just level-headed (or cold to a degree). Ive gone through two periods of depression and nobody in my life knows. I convinced myself that Im all I need, and I do still believe that, that I dont need the reassurance and advice from people who dont know me as well as I know myself, but I see now that Im self-sabotaging with my inability to let anyone in. I dont know how to fix it and its driving me crazy. So Ive been trying to think about why I so adamantly refuse speak my feelings. And I think its because Im scared, not of judgment or vulnerability, but of making my feelings real. The one person I let myself fall in love with... I told him I was in love with him and suddenly I was consumed in our feelings. Just telling him I loved him was all it took for me to find myself attached to him. He was so fucking good to me, but eventually he gave up on trying to get me to commit. And I dont blame him. It was when I lost him that I realized that this is exactly why I dont open up. Im terrified that Im going to say one word and never be able to stop the flood of emotions that bursts out. Somehow, holding in all of my feelings one hundred percent of the time keeps them from being real. If I can just keep it all in, I can deal with it my own way without people pitying and tiptoeing around me. But simultaneously, keeping it all in sets a limit for how deeply I can connect with someone. And Im learning this too late. Fuck."
56,vulnerability,depression,Short Memoir of my Depression,1,fiwjkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fiwjkz/short_memoir_of_my_depression/,2020-03-15 16:28:53,"I'll start by saying this has been something I've meant to do for awhile now. During my time with depression I told myself if I ever found my way out of it that I would post my experience so that maybe someone out there who was just like me could stumble upon this and get better at least just a little bit. So this is me sharing my story along with things that really helped me in particular. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; For most of my life I would have described myself as a happy, optimistic person. Good family, good friends, good life in general. That's not to say my life was free of any emotional hardship. Specifically relevant were a couple of times I think I had a couple brief encounters with shorter term depression. In 7th grade there were a few weeks where I was very low emotionally. Feelings of not fitting in, some weird form of bullying. I remember being at my lockers when someone who was something of a friend came over and asked me if I was alright, and that shocked me into realizing I wasn't feeling alright even though I just deflected with ""I've just been tired lately."" That brief encounter kind of snapped me out of the negative mindset I was in. In that instance I think all I needed was to know some of my peers actually did care about me so I've always been very grateful to that person in a way they aren't aware of. The rest of my middle school and high school experience was very good overall. The other brief encounter was just a random day during my freshman year of college. I got back to my dorm after classes on a beautiful Friday. So much stuff that I could potentially do, outside activities with friends, online videogames with friends from high school and elsewhere, any number of campus activities. I sat down and was just overwhelmed with this immense feeling of *boredom.* All this opportunity at my fingertips and none of it appealed to me at all. In fact in that moment it felt like there wasn't anything in the world that would stop this feeling of boredom and that quite nearly brought me to tears. This actually scared me afterwards and over the next few weeks there was an uptick in me going and doing things I thought were productive and fun to make sure I didn't feel that feeling again. I was not so lucky as to avoid it forever. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Flash forward to the start of my senior year of college. I had just wrapped up a typical summer working hard, spent some time camping with my family, and was excited to be back to classes. My friends and I had founded a new club at the university, the classes themselves were engaging, and everything was going great. A couple months in and things just started to, I don't know, slip. The fun of anything I was doing just started to fade out slowly and because of this I started to withdraw from doing them. Less and less attentive with the club, less attentive with my social life, less attentive with classes, less attentive with physical fitness. By the end of the semester everything had *really* slipped, including my grades, and I just felt really burnt out on everything. I kept telling myself that winter break would be the recharge I needed. Some time to relax and refocus. Of course I didn't fully comprehend my situation at the time and was totally wrong. Over winter break I had gone back home and spent a large amount of time sleeping/resting. Even when I was awake I really wasn't doing much. At one point I had gone down for yet another nap and my mom came down and asked me if anything was wrong. She noticed the slip in my grades, the sleeping, etc. When she did that it made me briefly aware that something was indeed wrong even if I didn't know what, but I of course deflected it to just being burnt out from last semester and trying to rest up. By the end of break I told myself that I should have my energy back to really finish strong. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; For the first month or two of the semester I came out swinging. I was extremely on top of everything, ahead on all my work and getting good grades on it all. Back to my normal gym routine. And yet I had this feeling that I was still just *behind* and despite how well I was doing, just unfulfilled. This was making me uncharacteristically anxious and would cause me to suddenly feel extremely tired. The tiredness led to slipping on things, missing classes and assignments more and more frequently. Eventually I had stopped going to classes altogether. Shortly after this I had started regularly crying myself to sleep, each time this happened pushing me closer and closer to calling my parents and breaking down to them. They beat me to the punch when I got a knock on my door and it was a police officer doing a wellness check because I hadn't responded to my parents for awhile. I broke down on the spot. The officer was very respectful and polite and encouraged me to call my parents, and left shortly after I called them. The next day my mom was out at my university, which was no small trip as it was 1,600 miles from home. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; The rest of the week was a whirlwind that shot my stress through the roof. A lot of this was necessary, some of it felt overbearing. I remember getting texts from various people wanting to talk and feeling so exposed, as if my mom had just outed me to everyone regardless of what she actually told them to trigger these responses. She wanted to constantly be around me even though I told her repeatedly that I wasn't going to self harm and didn't feel alone (both completely true), and the lack of space didn't help anxiety levels. However she also pushed me towards all sorts of necessary meetings. With the Dean of Students, with Student Counseling, with professors, with Student Health. Student Counseling, at least at first, was somehow the least considerate of my situation. I remember that meeting clearly, the lady doing the consulting talking to my mom and giving off a vibe as if she thought I was just slacking off in my studies due to poor work ethic and distractions. She did a 180 when I actually started talking about the gradual fade of enjoyment from virtually everything, voice quivering while I was not very successfully fighting back tears, and immediately recommended me to Student Health. The doctor I met with there was much more considerate and recognized the depression right away. More tears were shed, this time from fear, as I faced the realization of being prescribed and SSRI and becoming aware of just how much my situation had escalated. With consultation from the Dean of Students, I did an All-Withdrawal, packed/stored my things, and flew back home. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; The next year or so was a rough one, and contained the absolute lowest points of my life. I was a shadow of my former self. Thinking back to that time a lot of it was a blur of feeling empty punctuated by moments of extreme sadness. Even now, when I no longer consider myself depressed, simply thinking of them to type them out has me tearing up, and when I talk about it out loud my voice breaks and I can no longer hold back the tears. The spring/summer which was essentially ""family camping/get together"" season was very tough. Going on camping trips with the fifth-wheel which felt like torture as I laid trapped in a setting that I used to love now forced to realize it gives me no pleasure. Family events where I felt I was only showing up to show-face while spending the rest of the time holding back depressive tears surrounded by loving family and friends. At some point I had started therapy but I wasn't at all consistent with it. Not because it wasn't good or because I had something against it, just because depression had sapped all my self motivation to engage with it. I would still interact with friends but it was extremely taxing. It felt inconsiderate to drag anyone else down with me so I would spend a lot of what little energy I had to still interact positively with people around me. Only a few people really ever saw how I was actually feeling behind it all. I'm sure my friends loosely pieced together some extent of things but I doubt they had any idea of the full picture. Like knowing I was subtly lower energy or slightly down in mood, but unaware of the depression specifically. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Going to sleep eventually only led to dreams where I also felt depressed. Long nights of crying from the emotional pain and frustration of my situation. Constantly asking myself ""*Why do I feel this way""* and desperately searching for a solution, hurting more and more every time I came up empty handed. Strangely enough, it was never really self-esteem involved which made it all the more confusing to me. I *knew* there were many people that cared for me, that I was intelligent, that I've had many good experiences in my life, that I had value as a person. And yet none of that mattered to me and only made it that much more frustrating to feel so miserable. There were a couple of months where I hit my personal rock bottom. I had fully disengaged from everything in my life, I couldn't even muster the energy to so much as play a video game. For about two weeks things got exceptionally bad. I was never actively suicidal or thought about self harm, but during those two weeks and maybe some surrounding them I felt to be what I consider passively suicidal. I no longer actually cared to be alive. I hurt all day, and hurt in my dreams. The only relief I had was unconsciousness between REM cycles. I wasn't going to kill myself, but the idea of just falling asleep and not waking back up, or just withering away to nothing, appealed greatly to me (It took me awhile to type that sentence because of all the powerful feelings it brings up even just thinking about it). For those two weeks I did almost absolutely nothing but lay in bed, either staring at the ceiling or trying to sleep. I barely ate or drank at all, some days not eating anything and the others likely less than 500 calories. If my parents came to check on me, I'd quickly pull out my phone and make it appear as if I was at least doing something minuscule then immediately putting it away as soon as I was out of their attention. Maybe in some way I really needed to hit this point, as shortly after began the slow climb out of the pit of my depression. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; I don't know exactly what it was, maybe just absolutely crippling boredom, but one day not long after that two week period I decided to go back and play a videogame I had started but never finished. May also be in part to having decided to be more consistent with taking my prescribed SSRI (which I had not been at that point). To me this was the moment things began to improve, albeit slowly. It wasn't much, but it was infinitely better than passively killing myself. I slowly started to reengage over the next few months with very basic things like videogames and some of the online friends associated with them, with TV shows/movies, streams etc. I still largely felt numb while engaged with these things, none of it felt satisfying or truly enjoyable but it at least distracted me from some of the pain. Soon my younger sister still in high school started having late night practices multiple times a week which I would provide rides for. Because I didn't want to waste the gas to drive home just to drive back down and then back again (10 miles from the house to the school) it was an easy way to work the gym back into my schedule. Soon I was being much more consistent with my therapy sessions and SSRI use. I was engaging more with my friends. As things shifted into the summer I wasn't feeling nearly as low even if I still wasn't experiencing any happiness. I felt stable enough to take an online class to further my already almost finished degree. To me this actually highlighted the current issue I was facing at the time. I was completing everything on time or earlier, getting almost perfect grades, and not feeling exceptionally sad or stressed. However, I was extremely apathetic. An ""A"" on a paper or assignment felt meaningless, zero satisfaction where I felt it could have been an ""F"" for all it mattered to me. This scared me a lot, and I started reading Reddit *a lot* looking for all sorts of different perspectives on life/activities, desperately hoping to find one that appealed to me. And while I learned a lot in general about many different things, the true way out of my depression came from self reflection. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; At some point I resigned to my apathy/anhedonia. Never feeling pleasure was a tough pill to swallow but it was considerably better than emotional pain bringing me to tears on a daily basis. Once I accepted it is when things started to drastically change, because I started treating it almost like a super power. I was just so impartial to everything that in the same vein that otherwise enjoyable activities did nothing for me, otherwise boring/tedious/demanding tasks did nothing either as apathetic boredom was the staple of everything I did. So I figured if I can't be happy I could at least be productive. Took a part time job, upped my gym/fitness routine back to normal, started to live with my grandmother whom, at 93, needed constant help around her house and with errands. She was (Passed 3/4 of a year ago now) an incredibly strong woman and one of my biggest role models, and at the same time could be incredibly finicky and stubborn to the point that she would rapidly wear down the patience of her three daughters. I've always been an extremely patient person and my ""newfound"" apathy made me perfectly suited to help her on a constant basis. At some point I had also stopped taking any SSRIs (without letting anyone know), as they had helped me get out of that extreme low point but now I had my physical energy and all they were doing was giving me restless energy with no impact on my state of mind. Eventually I transitioned from weekly therapy sessions to biweekly. I stopped drinking soda entirely, not that it was really limiting my health, I just figured I got no pleasure from it so now's the best time to drop an unhealthy part of the diet. While I still couldn't feel pleasure and that I was largely just unsatisfyingly going through the motions of life I did feel as though I proved I was stable enough to return for my last semester of college at the start of the next year. My parents and therapist agreed with me, maybe even more so after I revealed to them that I had taken myself off the SSRIs months beforehand and remained increasingly stable. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Going back out to college I had fiercely crafted a productive routine consisting of very little besides classes/studying, exercise, eating, and sleep. About 8hrs of sleep, 5hrs of exercise (Combination of yoga, weight training, swimming, and running), 3hrs of eating (To maintain high enough calories for all the exercise), 6hrs of class/studying, and 2hrs of free time per day (More free time on the weekends). Every day was packed but it was easy to keep moving as long as I stayed moving because there wasn't anything that I actually *wanted* to do that could distract me. I was also going to group therapy twice weekly, and this is something that I think benefited me immensely even now. A lot of CBT along with just being able to talk and share experience with others directly that really aided my ability to feel comfortable with being vulnerable. I became aware that *inactivity* was a trigger for my depressive feelings. Because I was so apathetic, if I ""stopped moving"" there wasn't really any motivation to ""start moving"" so to speak, which made the weekends the more dangerous days of the week. It was also a fine balance of trying to determine whether or not it was physical/mental exhaustion that legitimately required rest, or simply depressive/apathetic thoughts pretending to be the same thing. I had created a mental image of a physics block diagram that had all the factors of my internal motivation and how depression fit into that. Spring break almost caused me to slip out of things entirely due to the sudden week+ long void in my routine, and the after effects were still felt for a few weeks. Luckily the gains in vulnerability paid huge dividends with getting myself back on track successfully. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Even more optimistic, I had started to get a number of very brief breakthroughs against the anhedonia. The first one almost brought me to tears. I was finishing my last lap on the track and *really* pushed myself on the last sprint and felt a deep internal focus and drive I hadn't felt felt for a long time. I wasn't just pushing myself to be productive, I was pushing myself because I *wanted it.* I probably would have broke down and cried on the spot but I fought back the tears because I was still at the gym. The second time was during a night run and as I came up over a hill I looked over the town lights from above and at the big starry sky and felt the cool air and just had the brief feeling of legitimate happiness. Something I hadn't experienced in over two years by that point. Because I was all alone I didn't even fight the tears this time around and just let them flow as I continued my run. Another time was when I had just got done with my evening yoga and was on the way back to my place listening to some comedy online radio station. It was just some dumb joke but I actually laughed out loud at it, which stopped me in my tracks because I realized I actually *enjoyed* it. Each of these little moments were fleeting, only maybe a couple seconds, but they were so incredibly powerful to me. They are still incredibly powerful to me, I was in tears yet again just typing them out here. It truly put things into perspective for me of just how starved for happiness I was, and I clung to those tiny moments intensely. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; The next and maybe biggest challenge was still just down the road. While I finished the semester with a strong GPA and walked at commencement, I still had to take a summer field course. This meant no access to group therapy. Camping out in remote locations working on stressful assignments with little in the way of all they typical comforts from home. This would last for nearly two months. I won't lie, it did make me quite anxious. It was testing a lot of skills I had learned prior to my two year break from school and it was a sharp change to go from two group therapy sessions a week to none while removing comfort and increasing stress. And really it turned out to be just what I needed. About 2-3 weeks in I was starting to regularly experience freedom from my depression. Much longer lasting moments of happiness as a more frequent occurrence. Anxiety driven by Imposter Syndrome subsiding as I started doing exceptionally well on each project. Not that my emotional well being wasn't being tested. There were nights in my tent that I had felt very low and resulted in crying. My grandmother that meant so much to me passed away three weeks into it (I still got to talk to her on the phone that same day). And even though these challenges came at me it was just more and more proof that I could process them effectively and not get caught in a downward spiral. I finished with straight A's across each section and felt *satisfaction* finally. I knew somewhere in the field course experience the grip of depression had finally loosened and I felt I was starting to get some space to live. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Flash forward to now and I feel as though that grip is gone almost entirely, save for in my memories. It's tough to say when I actually felt totally over it. Not quite right at the end of the field course but also before the last few months where my life has actually been going exceedingly well. I do know that it will always be a part of me, an incredibly important part of me at that. It's something I think about quite often, and doing so typically brings tears quite easily. But they aren't tears of sadness or feeling weak, rather tears of knowing the strength that I had to fight a war with such an insidious opponent and come out victorious. I even sometimes think now that I'm grateful for it all in retrospect, as I am so much stronger of a person because of it. That if I had the opportunity to go back to the start and magically prevent the depression from ever occurring in the first place, I wouldn't. I know my situation was considerably less severe than that of many others out there. People driven to self harm or suicidal thoughts, depression that has lasted much longer and/or that has been coupled other terrible things like abuse/anxiety/bipolar/etc. But I do think that regardless of when you find your way out of it all (And you will), eventually you'll look back at it with a strange fondness for all of the strength and growth it gave you. How positively it shaped you in the long haul, even if positivity is a far off concept for you now like it was for me. To maybe help some people along this path I'd like to share some things that worked really well for me and hopefully they can for you too: &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; * **Please, please, please, get help!** This is not a battle you want to be fighting by yourself. I assure you that there are so many people that want to see you get better and help you in doing so. Many can be complete strangers. For me it was my direct family, my grandmother, my friends (Even if they didn't know the extent of things), my therapist/counselors, and so many random people on Reddit I never even directly interacted with gave me crucial perspective on life when I needed it most. Speaking of, I would feel more than happy to be one of those people to help anyone struggling so don't hesitate to message me if you want to talk. * **Vulnerability.** This goes hand in hand with getting help. You are **NOT** weak for being vulnerable. You are **NOT** weak for seeking help. Vulnerability is one of if not *the* greatest strength I have taken away from my experience with depression and what has helped me the most when fighting back against it. Just openly talking about my feelings with others in group therapy was liberating, as was openly listening and accepting the vulnerability of others. When I think back to my lowest points I felt so incredibly weak, but when I think about the moments where I vocalized and shared those feelings I feel so strong. * **Therapy**. Undoubtedly what ultimately got me through it all. Both one on one therapy and group therapy worked very well for me. Everyone can be different though. You yourself might respond better to one type or the other, with one style of therapist or another, with a certain personality of the therapist, with a certain frequency of visits. It's important to spend the time finding the fit that works the best for you. And this fit can change for you over time. I felt like I had kind of capped out on one-on-one therapy on a biweekly basis after a certain point and switching to group therapy at 4x the frequency benefited me greatly. However I needed that one-on-one time to even get to a point where the group therapy could be beneficial to begin with. For you it might be the opposite, or it might just be wildly different. Whatever you feel comfortable with and works. * **Medication.** The idea of being put on an SSRI was terrifying to me in a lot of ways. It crystallized the severity of my situation and the idea of taking drugs to intentional alter my mind was not appealing to me. I had an off and on relationship with my consistency taking them. It was definitely necessary to get out of the lower depths of my depression. And as my depression evolved so did my medication needs. If I was more consistent with my medication it might have sped along my journey. While going off of them towards the end was ultimately the right call it was admittedly quite risky to do that without consultation first and I would not recommend my behavior in that case. Like therapy, it is very important to find that ""right fit"" of medication, whether it is none at all or some developed combination of SSRIs you and you psychiatrist have determined over time. * **Engagement.** As depressive thoughts would take hold of me I would disengage more and more from different things in my life. It always felt easy, even like the right thing to do, under the excuse of ""just being tired."" In reality it was the opposite, I wasn't *truly* tired, and the more I disengaged the easier it was to get pulled by depression. It was slowly reengaging with things, even if the happiness was gone from them or diminished greatly, that triggered my recovery and eventually led to moments of lucidity long term. That's not to say you should just jump back to everything in your life all at once. I know that would have overwhelmed me and cause more of a backslide. Just a gradual reintroduction of things you used to enjoy and maybe some new things you've found along the way. Maybe a simple routine and some light responsibility that you can steadily add to as you feel comfortable. Things to keep you moving and not trapped in place where depression wants you. * **Positive Reframing.** If I had to mark the point where I really started to fight back against depression it would be when I reframed how I thought about my anhedonia. I found the silver lining to what otherwise felt like an incredibly hopeless situation. Making peace with potentially never being able to obtain happiness again so I could then focus on at least being productive. Like I mentioned before, I became mindful of it almost as a super power. I couldn't do anything to make myself happy so I no longer concerned myself with that. On the flipside I could do incredibly boring but highly productive things seemingly endlessly and not feel any different than doing something I would have otherwise enjoyed. My happiness was no longer in my direct control so I put my attention on what was, and that was productivity. * **Smiling.** This last one might sound a little weird, but sometimes its the small and odd things like this that can really help someone. I was doing a lot of outside work during cold winter months and was frequently wearing a facemask. At some point I started just putting an almost loony smile on my face underneath as I worked without fear of looking like a weirdo and without actually feeling happy either. Overtime it did feel as though just doing that would lead to small upticks in mood. Nowhere near happy but it added to the slowly building positive buffer keeping me from sinking back down. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; So that's my story when it comes to my depression, from start to end. Doing this has been something I had meant to do for awhile now, as far back as when I was only starting to truly overcome it. Some of the most beneficial things to me during that dark time was reading different perspectives of people whom had faced their depression and come out the other side for the better so it only feels right that I pay it forward now. Anything I've spent thinking about writing this, actually writing this, and shedding tears on this would be immediately worth it if only a single person finds something even marginally useful out of it all. Don't hesitate to comment on this or message me directly if you want to talk. Discussing depression is never going to be a burden to me because I choose not to let it be so. I also encourage others like me, whom have made it out of the tunnel, to share your own experience. Nobody should fight depression alone and I sincerely hope that anyone in that fight right now who reads this realizes even a random internet stranger like me is rallied on your side."
57,vulnerability,depression,Always in the background,1,fmavo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fmavo0/always_in_the_background/,2020-03-21 17:43:34,"Hey /r/depression, I sometimes journal just locally onto my computer in a word doc, and I sometimes post here. I'm living in ""lockdown"" down to prevent the spread of COVID and my mental health support group just got cancelled so I'm feeling like I took a hit to my self care armor. I had been going for like a dozen weeks straight since discovering the group. It checked so many boxes for me; providing a routine event for me to form a habit around where I don't look at my phone for two hours and interact with people in a open, honest, and vulnerable way. I guess sharing here feels like some fraction of sharing in support group because I assume that at least a few people will read my words. So, what's been going on with me? Well, lack of self worth is a trend for me. I essentially never feel good enough, never feel worthy of stable, steady optimism. Just this past week I realized a nuanced new development. I used to feel like I needed to be doing things constantly, I needed to be optimizing and pushing myself constantly to do more, to be thin, to save as much money as possible, to advance as much as possible in work. I had to do everything to the n-th degree, in order to feel ""good enough."" If I saw someone out running to get exercise, I immediately questioned if I was exercising enough. Anytime I spent money on entertainment or comfort or luxury, I questioned if I was being foolish. Anytime I saw someone studying hard or putting in the effort to maintain a healthy diet, I looked critically at myself. Which was clearly an ever unachievable bar to meet, and a super unhealthy habit of comparing myself against others at the deepest levels. But all that is what I thought I was doing in order to make sure I *was* making the grade, up to snuff, etc. Now, though, after calming my mind and getting myself closer to this feeling that hates to be examined, I realized a truer truth. That pressure to push myself and do as much as possible, apart from being clearly unsustainable and toxic, it also had nothing to do with making me feel better. It was primarily a mechanism for distraction, and maybe also obsession with control over something to at least give me something to feel solace in. The self-hatred never went away. It was like an ex partner at a party that I knew was there the whole time and wasn't leaving, but I just kept myself occupied by constantly talking to any other person there, never taking a break at the risk I might leave myself open to confrontation. Anyways, more broadly, I'm feeling pretty terrible. I've always been a pretty solitary person. Someone who spends a decent amount of time alone. I thought it was because I'm an introvert. But really I think it's because due to some traumas I haven't pieced together yet, I avoid the vulnerability and stresses of being among people and retreat to the internet, which has been designed to be so addictive that basically only it can take me completely away from reality. I don't get joy form being alone. I'm rarely productive from being alone. I feel incredible when I'm around a good group of people, when I'm just being fully present with other people who share my sense of humor or are being equally vulnerable and also want to contribute positively to the moment. That's how I feel at support group. That's how I feel when I met people who got me to open up in college and such. I think it's quite possible that I'm not an introvert by nature. I love going to concerts and being surrounded by people listening to the same music. I love walking around the hearts of downtown and passing by loads of different types of people all doing their thing and just taking in the energy of the place. But really, I think the truth lies in the fact that I am sensitive. I am sensitive to dysfunction. As much as I love all these social situations where people are in accordance, collaborating, sailing smoothly with each other, I really feel pain and discomfort when I have to be in situations of angry people, spiteful people, inconsiderate people. I feel like I have no barriers for these things and when I am around acts of aggression or ill will, even to other people, it just cuts right to my core and shuts me down. I'll have to keep meditating on that, to find the next steps of where to go knowing that I am being alone more than is beneficial for me, that I am on the internet more than is beneficial to me, that I can derive energy and inspiration from being around ""constructive"" company, but that I probably need structure/procedure for handling de-structive company. Well, with the rest of the week, since I've been mostly along, but busy with work, have been slipping with my habits of exercise, quality sleep, eating well, I've been feeling quite bad. I've been feeling like I want to get the virus and die. I've been feeling like I want to get in a car accident and die. I've been feeling like I can't wait to die, but of course I don't have the courage or the plan to make it happen myself. And one thing that I've been feeling especially is that I wish I could have died in the place of former friends who died young in the past decade. Friends of mine who were good people, working hard to earn their education, working with purpose, bringing joy to others, bringing other people up with them as they grew, bringing people together for the sake of noble causes. I know at least 5 people who were personal friends of mine who have died from freak accidents, from abrupt out-of-the-blue diseases, and such, and the world would be so much better if I could have died instead of them. My family would be very sad. A lot of their time and energy raising me would be wasted, and a different set of my friends (who weren't friends with this other person that I died in the place of) would also be sad, but I think overall the net effect would be a better caliber person would still be around. Well, it's gotten really late because of how I periodically got distracted while I was trying to write this. I guess another thing I have been thinking about is how families pass down their traumas, their personalities to some extent. I think often about my siblings, how they turned out different, how they had the clarity of self to realize they needed to go against just what they were inheriting. And how I either didn't do that, or did that too quickly at a young age, was reprimanded, and never tried to do it to any degree later. I feel like I'm finding out way too late things like the fact that my dad didn't want to have kids, but he did anyway because my mom did, and lots of aspects of how I was raised and how I act now I think makes more sense with that information that my dad basically didn't want to be involved from the get go. Also the mental health problems and unhealthy parenting that happened to my parents, how that affected them and how it manifested in the way they raised their kids. Always something to come back to, often a deep taproot feeding the stubborn, persistent symptoms that are visible now. Well, /r/depression, thanks for letting me vent. I should have been more focused and deliberate about it. I had moments of clarity earlier today that I don't think I was really able to bring back while I was writing this, so there are some realizations and ideas that I didn't do myself the favor of articulating as well as possible. I'll have to revisit those (whether life has purpose or not, for example). Thanks for being here, as a place where I can spew out thoughts. I probably won't cry myself to sleep tonight because even though deep down I still know all those problems are there, and I am still stuck in this chamber full of ideas and thoughts that cause me to feel the deepest doom, I have stumbled around in the dark and mentally mapped a few of the perils and pitfalls in here, so there is at least some semblance of progress towards an understanding, even if I don't know if/how that can be turned into lasting improvement. As they say at the support group which I really could have used this week, ""wellness is a process not a destination."""

I am a 29 year old male. I have no idea if providing a brief background about myself would contribute to better feedback in this discussion. To be frank, I just need advice. I know it is a shot in the dark coming to a place like this for mental health issues, but I have an extremely small circle of friends, and even I don't like opening up to them about my self-perceived issues. Over the last couple years, I have found it utterly difficult to find drive, motivation, and curiousty to want to better my life. I have the most difficult time giving myself to a woman, because I almost feel it is pointless in today's age (I have been divorced since 2016.) I am single (have been for many years) and I have no children. I have a great job that pays me well, especially for living in Kentucky, and I absolutely hate that I don't appreciate it as much as I should. I have extreme difficulty getting very happy or very sad. I am a veteran, and I work with many veterans, but it is absolutely not the kind of job where one can feel welcomed to open up emotionally with out feeling some vulnerability to an extent. My curiosity toward discovering new hobbies and interest is a chore to fire up. My ability to socialize, even briefly, brings me anxiety. Ultimately, I just feel lost. I know I was all over the place in this, but I will gladly elaborate when given the chance in the discussion. What have some of you done in these mental situations to cope or even conquer the funk of ""going through the motions?"""

It all started in 15 I had a rape civil and criminal case against a huge hotel chain for there security guard breaking in and raping me w the dna. That's not what's bothering me that I dropped due to me being a stripper in my 20s w breast implants I was branded a whore I waited 4 years and even got gloria Alred on my line which I'm proud of myself but after all is said and done nothing came out of it but feeling suicidal. In 17 I started dating we will call him Joseph he was very attractive, and was in love w me in like 2 weeks. We were engaged by a month. I asked him if he cared that I had a past he didnt, he said he would fight w me till the end. I fell in love or at least codependent on his love for validation. He was a drunk I didnt realize it at first cause he played it well. Until 3 am came he would say I deserved to be raped I was in the mortgage field at the time he would steal all my bosses cards and threaten to call him as the only reason I got good jobs was from sleeping with my bosses. I quit one mortgage company went to another same bs. I loved him when I didnt love me. He would tell me at times to leave him as he is not a real man. I got him jobs, he hurt himself on the job, i got up daily to call temporary disability and got him 1400 to which i saw nothing. My capital one slowly went from 5 k to maxed out to support his fireball habit and newports. Thinking I'm getting 3 million I guess that didnt phase me june 2018 I got us a 3 bedroom it was a surprise since we were engaged and planning a family. He went back to his child's mother they have one child together and blocked me on all avenues. I guess I got a little crazy but nothing like him I called, I went looking for him, I called his mom who was a total bitch who said I was pyscho he's a drunk they have been planning his funeral for 20 years. That made me fight harder for him I even got a hold of his child's mother against my better judgement. My friend's I went to school w knew her and said she has been off since a child leave her alone. She said his loyalty was forever to her that she was putting him in the passenger seat of her car and coming to kill me. I was so afraid but I had moved I didnt call the police as dealing w the police for the rspe I was all policed out. I spent summer of 18 in my bed never came out, took benadryl and valium round the clock to sleep. September 1st I moved back to my mom's my therapist said you know why dont you move I said I want too. I chose Florida I started saving all my money I have a fashion store online and started selling a lot of my stuff and selling stuff on craigslist I watched karma enfolded in front of my eyes. His child's mother slept with his best friend. She actually wanted to speak w me so I could tell her everything I knew about his bestie well if you think joseph has an addiction your new lover is on booze and heroin. Sorry truth hurts I'm not an addict or alcoholic so he left me for her for her to fuck his best friend. New years eve 2018 called my lawyer if they cant give me a payout by tomorrow im writing a tell all. It's dropped sir im done. I made it to Florida celibate since joseph met a jehovah witness I told him I wasnt looking for a bf I was crying when he met me he took advantage of my vulnerability well that only lasted 6 months of me being checked out the whole time. He was obsessed with me it scared me I never wanted him but he wouldnt leave. Finally justice for me he grabbed my car keys, my purse, and phone this is what he always did to make me stay well I screamed so loud he let me in my car i felt empowered I'm here for me he followed my car and i locked all doors and called the cops i sat on the horn for 12 minutes they came he was arrested on the initial domestic and picked up 9 stalking charges after he posted bond. He got 7 months to serve and my rapist three years probation his charge unlawful restraint in the first degree the 7 month charge domestic battery. Joseph is gone, I'm free from slut shame, I have my online fashion store I do pretty well I hit a depression about ten days ago I havnt bathed really havnt ate, and the days are intertwined together. I know if i get out to my storage and get to work i make new memories or even if i get a little job as well. I'm an overachiever I'm not afraid of the coronavirus i know how to do iso I'm a pro. I would like to think this is one of those times everyone is going through it. I really am writing a tell all as the world needs to know. That's my story it hurts but who said life would be easy. Therapy appts. Are pushed out for a month as i dont want this to turn into the summer of 18 i found out joseph upnorth still refers to me as a whore and says I'm completely crazy we were never engaged I'm a lying whore. Gosh people are so kind fuck what he thinks I'll never date an alcoholic again I tell you that. Now I have been celibate since june I have 0 interest in dating till I love myself. I'm finally free and it's petrifying."

My parents hypervigilance over me as a child has deeply affected me. I feel like the need to act in a certain way, even my transgressive acts need to feel socially acceptable. I hide certain things I eat, Im obsessed with presenting this perfect image out to the world. Even when I tell others about my mental health problems I only show others what I want them to see. I feel guilty about my spontaneous lazy nature, and have trained myself to suppress this, forcing myself to watch programs that I dont enjoy, finish books I dont want to finish, because I constantly feel the need to be on and perfect. My natural authentic self is highly confident one day, self hating the next, so i hide it. I feel like a facsimile, and the self help society around me encourages everyone in the world to be obsessed with this bullshit superficial growth. Help me break the loop. Even though I know people are imperfect and unhappy, and everyone I speak to reassures me that theyre insecure as hell, I still desperately feel that this is untrue deep down in my soul, and that i still have to have my defences up for fear of showing vulnerability."

Why can one encouraged me to open up my depression problems that had been bottled up for a long time and all of sudden she decided to leave. Why it only lasted for such a short period when i thought i finally found some joy in life after a lifetime of being depressed. It's killing me and im left with empty body without a soul in it. Why do i ruin everything with everything i do or feel.

I hate feeling like this all the time. I hate making people uncomfortable. The only way for me to make people have a sense of normalcy is to never express my emotions or open up, because when I do say anything about how I feel, my friends become uneasy, they drift away, they stop talking to me. I kind of wish I never showed any vulnerability. I guess thats also my fault. No one wants to be friends with someone whos a Debby Downer. People get exhausted, they cant stay in our lives forever. No one wants to talk about the same issues over and over again, they just wanna move on with their lives. So the only way to get through this is to just help ourselves. But it becomes difficult having no one at your side. No one to knock on your door and say Hey, man. I got pizza. You wanna talk about it? Instead Im alone in my room, I play games to have a sense of achievement. No new texts and messages left on read in my phone. Im left alone. I feel numb, I feel empty. I wanna reach out to someone, anyone. But theres always this fear that when I get close to any person, theyll just leave. So I just pretend to feel okay, I pretend to be fine, just for everyone around me to feel comfortable. Still, it hurts, and I feel invisible. How can you scream without troubling anybody? How can you tell people that youre not feeling okay without them drifting? Whenever I ask for help, it feels like theres a huge door with a sign that says Closed for today. Please proceed to your therapist/significant other if you want to vent. I keep hearing the same advice over and over. Just take your meds. Write on your journal Do some skin care Meditate Its exhausting. Ive been trying. I feel pathetic. Why cant I just be normal? Why cant I ever feel okay? Why cant I go through a day without having the urge to open up to someone? Why am I so awkward that I make people stay away? Why do I even exist at all?"

Some small action can trigger me. Not receiving a call back, no one checking in, etc. Confirms in my head Yeah, they really dont give a fuck about me. It makes me mad I even tried to put myself out there and show some vulnerability. Feel like basically cutting everyone except the people very closest to me off completely. Acting cold to them, ignoring them, act like they dont exist. Am I overreacting? Yes, probably. Ive felt like this before and did cut people off, and after a couple weeks I realized how it was all in my head. Its irrational but it feels so fucking real. Like as soon as I let myself feel open to any sort of friend or romantic relationship, try to get involved with people, no one wants to be around me. Then I say fuck all of you in my head, and start doing my own shit. Then I get people saying You seem different. They dont give a fuck. The few people who actually do see the pain in me when Im hurting try something. I need to get help soon I think, or Im going to kill myself. God is playing a trick on me. I get a little glimpse of happiness and then it gets ripped away and I feel way worse than before. Id literally rather always feel shit than get tempted with what it feels like to feel good. Its become torture at this point. Nothing has ever gone the way I wanted for more than lets say 2 days in a row in the last 4 years. I fucking despise this shit. And I put on the fake smile because Im tired of people who dont give two shits questioning me. Fuck them, if I told them whats wrong they would run away or talk shit about me. If it wasnt for the ~4 people I have, I would have offed myself so so so long ago. Honestly just dont want to make them go through the same pain Im feeling. I just want to drift away..... far far away. I dont understand how a normal person functions in this world. I know this cant be normal because if everyone felt this way there would be a lot more evil in the world."

Sometimes I give it an earnest try to understand a little better. But I only end up failing. I've lost the hope that something will come and somehow will make it okay.

I make sure to avoid her like the plague for my own sake, and we attempted friendship that got turned into a very bad falling out over money (she wanted reimbursement for gifts, ones that I never asked for: she is not the most genuine person on the planet). She told me to leave her alone, she no longer had positive feelings towards me and that she's moved on - I should too. Didn't speak to her again starting about a week before Christmas. Some time 3 weeks later, she messages me simply asking for money again regarding a gift she got me last year. I ignored it. Another week and some change later, through a shared platform (one a game, another a chat server) she approaches me in silence or indirectly, says nothing, idles, leaves. That's it. The chatroom, in particular, she makes a short profile change that reads ""im better than u"" for probable self reassurance or more likely to try and snidely comment at me. I do not respond or engage. Most recently, so another week and some change later (so now, February), I am having a conversation with a mutual friend that she scarcely communicates with, granted we apparently share this group chat (hard to know, she never used it). She attempts to hijack or insert herself into the conversation so I drop it, start up another one about an hour later, and she does it again. So these few interactions have spurred great anxiety in me, to a point I am dreaming about her again in trying to decipher her intentions. I doubt she misses me. She has nothing but resentment for me. So I do and don't understand and try to read it beyond surface level. I so badly want to reach out to her but she has used and abused me and my emotional vulnerability so many times as it is. Has slandered my name, lies compulsively, makes me out to be a thief. Among other things. She refused to see wrong and apologize once things escalated, she seemed to before until I got serious about wanting to break up over these issues. I don't know anymore. I'm already drained and helpless feeling. I can resolve the issues in theory and have spoken some of it over with my therapist and whatnot, but that nagging feeling keeps crawling back in. It's embarrassing that I give so much stock to things that matter so little. Sorry for the long post."

I wasn't able to interpret my own situation until I finally added words to these feelings that have been bubbling up under the surface the entire time. After I put them all down, I reread them. It's clear depression is back. Everything written I now see is inaccurate and irrational, in no way does it reflect the reality of my relationship with my partner. This isn't my first rodeo and I know my next steps, I'm sharing what I wrote because I just need to feel like someone, somewhere heard it even if no one does, even if no comments follow. I'll still feel heard and that's all I need right now. Trigger warning as it's incredibly dark and may be difficult to read. &amp;#x200B; I want to be in love with someone else, anyone other than him. Do I want to leave him because I dont like him or because I cant ever confront him about how fucked we are. Hes everything I could ever want. Literally, hes the person Im searching for when I say I want to be in love with someone else. How fucked up is that? Maybe all love has an expiration date regardless of how perfect the recipient is, maybe its never sustainable. 50 more goddamn years? 50 more years of me secretly despising him and viewing him as an incompetent fool? I know its all me. Im barely tolerable in small doses and he wants to be with me every single day. Fuck. Ill never be normal, Ill never be healthy. Which just makes me think hes the only idiot who doesnt see that. I should spare him. I should leave while hes still young and has time to bounce back and settle down with someone kind. I saved his life and now all Im doing is pushing him down below the surface so that I can catch a breath of air. Im drowning him. The truth is, I dont care if I end up with a piece of shit. Im a survivor. And I manipulate. Id rather be strapped to some scum of the earth who deserves to be a pawn then someone who mistakenly perceives there to be some part of me thats good. Anyone who gives me the benefit of the doubt is cushioned in naivety and anyone who exalts me as someone worthy of admiration is a hopeless fuckin pathetic victim in waiting. Ive never been good news to anybody, Im broken and I scrounge, I pretend and I am devious, I use and I am indiscriminately merciless. I can take solace in the knowledge that he never truly knew me, in seven years I never once fully let him in. It makes it easier to walk away uninhibited, I dont have any losses to cut on my end. Vulnerability is for suckers who are incapable of surviving on their own. And in this world, relying on others is an obstacle you willingly place in front of yourself. It is a burden you opt to be encumbered by. It is a hurdle you know you cant clear. I will leave him soon. And I will spin my severance into terms that he can process and take forward with him into the rest of his normal life. Hell continue on until his final moment carrying the fabricated delusion of our relationship that Ive created for him for 7 years. Hell believe it was real, and my final overture as I cast him behind me thoughtlessly will be allowing him to do so."

I was a loner in high school, and had my first depression and anxiety mood swings, that I think we all have, I was a ghost for 4 years, and I think high school changed my life for the worse in a way. I didnt have many women in my life, lets see, the girl I was crushing on my whole childhood, was my girlfriend for a short time at the end of middle school, but she didnt want to ruin our friendship (because we live in the same building), the second girl, was the sister of my best friend, and we were in a secret relationship, I felt like scum, and I was scum, anyway she cheated on me with a dude she is married to today, guess I deserved that. The last one is a weird story, a girl that approached me exactly 3 years ago in a month from now, and never spoke more than 5 words, we had a deal that we will make out if I find her house, and if I dont I will dye my hair green, I found her house by some miracle, and we made out but hooked up like 8 months later, we were in a 4 month relationship, and then she got back with her ex, yeah. From then on out, I dont rush into anything, I wish to have a long period of knowing a girl, before wanting to have anything with her, trust before better than after you get into a relationship. I lost many people I loved, some have died in front of me, and God knows how much you feel helpless in that moment, when you really know you lost someone forever, but you didnt say goodbye. I learned to forgive others and myself, I never felt loved by anyone else but my family, and I sometimes think that its selfish of me to ask for more, but I know that its not, I feel like Im a walking contradiction, but I know I will find my way and I know that I can make a lot of people truly happy and maybe even change their lives, Im a demon and an angel trapped into an old soul.Today Im a loner poet, that writes to keep his emotions in check, so I want to say something to all off you reading this far. Today I want to encourage you to lead with love, not fear. Never doubt that you are enough and that you can change the world, because ripple effect of your positive and loving words and acts are incredible. So lead with integrity, honesty, authenticity, vulnerability, kindness, patience and compassion. Be the LOVE you want to experience in the world. At the end I would like to say that I have realized that I can feel emotions again, and that I deeply care about one person that has got close to me, and her health and well being mean a lot, she made me realize that I care about people, but that Im just bitter people dont care about me haha, but that is fine, as long as we lead with love in our hearts we can be sure that no matter how hard life gets, peace will follow, thank you all, God bless."

I started to explain the situation to him, that the main reason of my vulnerability was because of a feeling of rejection from my surroundings. I had a hard time making my point and I told him (as I do often when we meet) that I felt what I was saying was pointless and irrelevant for the therapy. He let me speak the hole time, I could hear message notifications and keyboard sounds in his background, I really felt like he didn't pay attention to what I was saying. I kept on saying bullshit, trying to come to an interesting point about what I currently feel, but around 5.55pm, he told me that the discussion was over and that we should talk more in person the next time in his office. I told him that I felt like he wasn't attentive to what I said, and he told me that in fact, it seems harder for me to express myself when I'm on the phone and that this mode of communication can also have an impact on his attention... The session lasted less than 25 minutes when it was supposed to last 45, I really needed to talk today as I have nobody I can talk to about these stuff, and I felt like he gave up on me. I felt abandoned again, when it's precisely the reason why I needed this session. I'm a bit mad at him, I had a very good impression of him at the beginning of the therapy, but I start to feel like he doesn't take this work seriously, at least with me. I know therapists are not supposed to be blindly reassuring or to do charity work with their patients, but I mean... I found it really ironic that the subject of my concerns was rejection and that he ""rejected"" my need to have a long phone session. I felt like he just wanted to finish his work day prematurely. I thought about calling him back to share my thoughts about the situation and even to convince him to stay with me at the phone for an extra 30 minutes as I felt I needed it, but I changed my mind thinking that firstly, it was impolite of me to do so and secondly, that I would make a fool of myself... So now here I am, trying to finish this session in a subreddit, how clever is that? \^\^"

Ive been struggling with depression for about 7 years now, and Ive been declining faster and faster these last two. I was nervous to reach out and try medication and I still am, but its not what I thought it would be. Medication always made me nervous because I heard people say, it makes me feel like Im not me, and the idea of taking medicine to change the way you think and feel is nerve wracking to think about. I was also hesitant to get help because its hard to admit theres something wrong with you, and to accept help from others, but Im starting to realize its not some weakness or fault of mine but an illness. Literally. For years the stigma around mental health deterred me from ever thinking about getting help or approaching others as most of the time its just a vulnerability, and I was afraid to show this side to people I surrounded myself with because I thought I could just take care of it myself, I was just a narcissist asshole who hated people... right? About 2 months ago I hit some of my lowest points, and I broke down and reached out. After a bit of therapy and getting diagnosed and a prescription I feel optimistic towards the future. Ive started to notice things being... different. I dont feel mentally constrained or docile like I thought I would. I feel like the fog cloud in my head is starting to clear and Im sinking into my head less and less. Ive noticed... side effects, sure; but after a few days of progression Im willing to keep trying them. Theyre not working wonders and Im not cured, but I feel change, and thats something I didnt think Id ever feel and it excites me. At the 4 week mark my doctor said well decide to switch prescriptions if I dont respond well and I think Im willing to continue trying until I find what works best for me. I had blind hope for years that somehow things would be better, I would be happier or find the solution and it never really came. It took me reaching out to find there is hope to be found for me, and that medication isnt the,docile happy pills, I thought they would be, but instead are a tool to fight back. They may not be for everyone as everyones biology and situation is different, but I used to think I was above medication and that I didnt need help. But I realize now, its such a nave thought. If I knew then what I know now, I would have reached out much sooner because now I know why I kept going, why I thought thered be light at the end of the tunnel. I found there is justification in hope sometimes. Its not perfect, Im not exactly happy, but theres some change, and its nerve wracking... but exciting. Stay strong everyone, its a hard, cold road but there may be a light at the end of it yet. Youre not weak for medicating, youre not less of a person, or less,you, youre always going to be you, you just might have a few pounds of weight lifted off you to make the journey more bearable."

Whenever I do bring up how I feel because I just need to let it out *and mind u I don't do it much at all in fact I dont like the feeling of vulnerability that comes with it and I don't wanna seem like I'm looking for pity,* she just changes the subject and acts like I didn't just say I fucking hate myself. Idk tbh a response like ""You're always fucking depressed"" would have been fine, Idk, It's just that the way she acts lately screams I dont fucking care. Sure whenever I tell her about myself in general she just changes topic like cuts me off and starts talking about her own shit and the only time she's interested in what I'm talking about is when it's about her. Like I just dont know why is it that when I'm talking about my emotions and how fucked up they are it feels like I'm a criminal confessing to a crime."
74,vulnerability,depression,It's been a year since Brody Stevens committed suicide,1,f8e563,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/f8e563/its_been_a_year_since_brody_stevens_committed/,2020-02-24 06:13:10,"He was an excellent comedian with his own struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts. It hit me hard. I didn't know him personally, but I do. I saw myself in him, the same way I saw myself in other comedians. Some ended up killing themselves as well. I recognize the pain. Like I try to look to see if there is someone like me who is just dealing with things and is hanging around. I want to believe it gets better, that at some point the voices screaming at you telling you you're worthless just shut the fuck up permanently one day. That one day I will wake up rested and ready for the day. I want to have a day where I'm not constantly fighting myself. I have run out if hope. I have depression. I hate talking about it with people I know. I feel like a lot of times people don't believe it's a thing, or if it is I actually have it. But it's something I've always had. I went to therapy a couple years ago, something that I did not want to do ever. I always sort of known I had depression. I didn't want it to be real and have it be a thing to deal with. But I wasn't in the right state of mind. Dark thoughts that I've learned to silence for years had bubbled over to the point where it felt like deafening screams. If someone gets curious and snoops, you might find a comment about something traumatic in my childhood. The just is I was taken advantage of a female family member at a young age several times. She was removed from her home because it turns out she was being molested by someone herself at her home. So, in a way I can understand I guess. Don't forgive her, never will. Haven't had contact with her. I've never felt right after that, never told anyone in my family and I don't plan on it. I cut school a lot in middle and high school and it wasn't to be with some girl or to hang out with friends. Most of the time I would lay in bed staring at nothing or sleep. I've never felt like I was good enough. There are moments, not days, fleeting moments when I feel super motivated and ready to tackle on the simplest thing like making myself breakfast and then every other time when I really just want to lay down and wait for the day to end. Anytime I'm doing stuff is me forcing myself to do it to function, it's me battling to be normal. Because I've always refused to give credence to these feelings. I had a very normal, very standard life after that incident. I did my best to put it away in the recesses of my mind and have functioned very normally with love from my family and had a very normal life. And yet I still felt like shit. So I just told myself ""no, what the fuck is wrong with you? Man up."". I didn't talk about the depression ever because it made it too real. I became a master of emotional deflection. I hid behind laughter. I am good at making people laugh and pretending to be happy myself. Its like a fake it till you believe it thing, I guess. If I keep laughing I trick myself into thinking I'm happy. Probably why I always admired comedians. If I wasn't so shy and scared, I would be doing standup. I don't want anyone in my real world to know how I really am. I always just tell them I'm great. Introvert with depression, asking me how I'm doing will cause the opposite of what you want. People want to make other people feel the ""right"" way. That's why my answer to the ""how are you"" is always going to be ""Awesome"". I don't want to tell them how I really feel. I don't want to tell them that I woke up way before I needed to and laid in bed staring at the cieling for three hours. The truth is I feel horrible and most of the time I don't know why. Sometimes there is a very clear reason, but more often than not it's something inexplicable. It just feels like there is something missing, like a void inside of you. You do what you can to fill it, to satiate some need that you don't understand. So you eat, and you drink soda, and you ""self care"" till it hurts, and you bite and pick at the little bits of skin at the sides of your fingers till they become wounds then you pick and bite at those til they become holes till your fingers throb with pain every single second but its the only feeling you know is real and not something you're telling yourself to feel, and my motivation for things that I love is just lacking, and you push people away because sooner or later they will see past your facade and see the hurt that is there and see you for the absolute waste of space nothing you truly are and not want to deal with you or your pathitic bullshit anymore anyway. My daughter is the best thing to have happened to me. There are few times when I can tell you I felt legitimate joy and I was sure it was an actual emotion and not just me telling myself enough times to where I believed it to be true. She makes up 90% if those times. She brings me pure joy. I love being a father, I love all the good times and all the headaches. I don't really know how to end this post. In a perfect world this was just me screaming into an empty void and goes unnoticed so that I don't have to talk about anything. My brain is screaming at me to end on a punch line, something to take the sting of vulnerability away, because it's what I always do to keep them away... but I'm just tired of finding the joke."

My energy to engage in my hobbies is completely gone I say I'll try my very best to get better, but inside I know I'm lying, and I know there's no hope or help for me.

77,vulnerability,depression,At My Lowest Point,1,fclsk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fclsk1/at_my_lowest_point/,2020-03-03 11:09:54,"I usually don't enjoy making posts like this except for in dire situations where I honestly just need any words of reassurance to make sure that I am not just a lunatic that has finally succumbed to the absurd and gone insane. But recently I have been at a point of depression that has been so strong and overwhelming that it has aroused an amount of anger and hatred for the world around me that I can't even express. In a way, my problems have become completely contradictory. I constantly yearn for companionship and for someone to love me, and yet I have become so entrenched in hatred due to the times I have been hurt in the past that I prefer isolation to anything at this point. I can honestly say that I wake up every morning in utter and complete contempt for the day ahead of me. Since high school, I have been very restricted in sharing feelings for people. I've always had a rather dim view of people, and I had been rejected so many times that I learned better than to just throw my feelings out there to anyone who cared about me. And yet, this last one was the one that did me in. It was a girl that I had been close to for over a year. I was closer to her than I had ever been to anyone, and I saw her as the only truly caring person I had ever met. I felt like she was actually someone who cared regardless of how I acted, because she loved me for who I was, and I loved her for who she was. Then, after hanging out three or four days a week and texting constantly for a year, I finally had the nerve to share my feelings after a date party she took me to for her sorority. Of course, originally she put it off by saying ""thank you for your honesty"" and ""I just need time to work on myself, and maybe in a year we could try it."" I wanted to believe it so much, but I just knew better from my past, and I knew that it simply was a pity rejection. Once I spiraled into depression over it, she was nowhere to be found. She basically blamed me for the whole thing and any time I got upset she would simply act as if her problems were bigger and I was simply being an inconvenience to her. Then, after saying she needed time to work on herself and wasn't planning on being involved with anyone, she hooked up with a friend of mine several times, something she still doesn't know that I know. And now we aren't even half as close as we once were, and every time she contacts me and wants to act like we are still great friends I just can't get those thoughts out of my mind. I can't stop thinking that the person I thought was finally special ended up being like everyone else. I honestly can't fathom it anymore. I don't know how this sounds, and I'm sure assumptions can be made that I just expect sex or love from whoever I like, and that I shouldn't even be depressed, but I can say honestly that it isn't true. I've just dealt with the same rejections again and again throughout my entire life, and at this point even if life is just a game of chance (which I believe it is) I must be on the extreme losing side. I'm at a point where I have no interest in really talking to people or being social, and my biggest want right now is just to be left alone.I don't want it to be this way, and I know the people around me are concerned, but right now I hate almost every person I come into contact with, and just assume the worst about their personality and motives. If someone is nice to me, I assume it is for a selfish reason. I feel like I have ruined my life and like it's over, even though nothing really serious has even happened. I just feel utterly alone, and it's getting to the point where don't even want to talk to anyone about it, because vulnerability is just ammunition for people, and I'm learning that more and more. Once you become an inconvenience to people, you can kiss that friendship/relationship goodbye, and it's starting to become a really sad fact of life. I have no drive for anything anymore, and sleeping is the only thing that gives me true solace. I appreciate any support, just feel absolutely lost right now."

For me, it's all apathy and lack of energy. I'm pretty sure depression runs deep on both sides of my family, but my parents are emotionally undeveloped and fairly old-fashioned people when it comes to mental health. They'll listen to me if I tell them about MDD and ADHD, but it's sort of in one ear, out the other. My mom seems to put the onus on me to calm her down or assure her that I'm not going to do anything to myself (I've never been close to suicidal) and my Dad is just kind of a blow hard who seems to hear whatever he wants when you're talking to him and then gives bad getmotivated-type advice. Deep down, I can tell they still have irrational fears of antidepressants too. Not only do I feel like it takes so much effort to talk to these people who don't have any idea how mental health really works, but they also don't really remember or incorporate the knowledge of what I'm going through into the way they treat me. It feels as if they think my laying around all day is just being lazy or that I don't understand how important it is for me to get a job when I have crushing student loan debt and now credit card too. (I quit my old job a couple months ago and just moved back home for a bit until I can figure out what city I want to work in/find a job.) They pile on new tasks, or bits of advice, or bring up the same stressful burdens I'm obviously constantly worrying about. I'm in a war with my own mind. It takes all of the energy I have to not to hate myself. And yet it also falls to me to educate those people around me every day or withstand a barrage of ignorant statements. There are days when I just want to feel proud of myself for getting in the shower. Proud that I got outside, even if it wasn't until 3pm. There are days when I don't want to judge the fact that I only have the stamina to do an hour or two of job searching, but feel good that I was able to do a little more than last time. And yet I feel like I'm still being held to the standard of what a healthy person should be. I know part of the normalcy of how they treat me is based on my own ability to seem normal. But I'm a dude, which taught me emotional repression and to avoid vulnerability. I have bad ADHD, which taught me to bullshit well even when I'm falling apart. I'm a comedian, so I make jokes and have normal conversations no matter how dark I may feel the rest of the time. Part of this was obviously a venting session, but if anyone has similar stories or practical advice, I'm all ears."

You continue to mope and hate life until one day you realize that how you feel isn't how you are supposed to feel. 2- Honestly I'm still half-convinced that maybe there's nothing wrong with me except that I'm absolutely the laziest piece of shit that ever lived. No one else around me seems to have problems getting out of bed and getting shit done. 3- I'm with you on this. I always tell myself there are problems that exist way bigger than the issues I have or the way I feel. I pretty much dismiss my negative thoughts because I feel they're not even of value. At the same time assigning less meaning to my sadness has made it easier to deal with. Or maybe I'm not dealing at all by thinking this way. 4- Logic is how I handle it and it works really well for me. I have learned to take my feelings, box them in, and logically think it through to determine if the feeling is justified. If it is then out it comes. If it is not then I try to determine what triggered it, things I can do to help it go subside faster. By doing this I have found I can predict bouts of depression and sometimes even prevent it. Logic has been the reason I have been able to function and get out of the way I used to be. It took years of practice though (early 20's) and a willingness to want to let the depression go. I have found that some people that struggle with depression for a long time have let it become their identity and not only struggle with it on the front end but also subconsciously struggle with the thought of letting it go and spiral themselves into it even more. Don't do that... 5- My sadness goes away but my depression is a lingering, leeching cloud of head fog. It makes me not feel the world anymore. I'm just existing and I don't know why. At least with sadness I'm feeling something. 6- often times when i get angry, my chest burns and i see red. my stomach turns and i feel dizzy for booting this stuff in which has gotten me the reputation of being really quiet. but i know bootling things in is no good either. been on meds for depression for a couple of months now and i usually feel really sleepy but sometimes I feel like death. main issues are uni, an ex and friends. i feel like all of them hate me. 7- I just had about 3 rage attacks in the same day and the 3rd was the absolute worst as it had me on my knees. I wasn't shouting, but I was breathing heavily, and twitching, my face felt so red. I just stayed like that for a full minute, I couldn't even think. I had no real outlet and I don't think putting another hole through a wall would solve it. I've settled down a bit but this just hit so damn hard. 8- Sometimes I'm up what feels like all night crying because it just hurts so badly. I never show vulnerability. I don't come off as desperate. I've been told I'm stoic and intimidating once, even 9- i truly wish i was never even born. i really fucking mean that, and if there was a way to just go back in time and undo that, i would. i dont know why i was brought here. i wish my parents never met. 10- I truly believe it's basic human nature to compare yourself to others in an inferior manner. To me it's where competitiveness is developed. We always want to strive to be something more and idolize people who have that something that we want. It's just a matter of chasing after it and achieving it 11 - It felt like the person I had been for the last 20 years of my life had died and been replaced with a shell. Happiness, excitement and laughter were replaced by anxiety, apathy and desperation. All the people I loved and cared about before suddenly felt like complete strangers. I couldn't bring myself to have a conversation with anybody except my mom, and even then I felt like I was talking to a stranger who just looked like her ... Very bizarre. Five months of that and I went back to normal just as quickly as I got fucked up in the first place 12 - One day I woke up and everything was just wrong. The colours were wrong, the angles of things, the smells. I felt like I couldn't understand dimensions, there were too many layers of things and it was impossible to concentrate. I was utterly alone, trapped inside my head with this cruel, sick bastard who wanted me dead. 13- The only reason i havent ended my life is because of mild curiosity. Im so fucking sick of the constant chest pain and the dread of what the next day will bring. Are my friends gonna decide theyre done with my shit? Im curious, and i want to know. every single day hurts so bad, but I want to know. I dont understand why. I probably wont do anything remarkable or important in my life. But im curious. so here I am, another day of hell just to see where the ride takes me. Im an idiot. ps : the 14th is my birthday.."

No wonder we are depressed, lonely and insecure. We were encouraged to be suspicious about everything to do with love before we even experienced it first hand. Most of us with depression can almost link it to some trauma an adult inflicted upon us as children and unknowingly so, like in my case, my parent divorce without a care on what it did to us. Never once did either one of them ask us how we were, they both were too focused on their own pain, I doubt they even considered us. The next time after that that I felt whole was when I fell in love. But of course, I didnt know healthy love. I soon became insecure, cold and of course my brokenness had attracted the most manipulative and cunning of the male specie. I mistook the love bombing and obsessiveness for movie love. And the discard once he had woken up every insecurity I had, was almost kind. Except that he ruined me. He violated me. I did things for him that I will probably never recover from. But by some miracle, I held my ground, I resisted all his attempts to draw me back. He was evil enough for me to know I would have sooner killed myself than go back to him. But will this huge psychological scar ever heal? Is there coming back from this? What kind of evil preys on vulnerability?"

He was an amazing person. His smile was contagious and he excelled in all that he did. He hid his depression deep down inside and no one knew how bad of a place he was in. The night before he took his life, he told his dad that he had never felt happier. He didn't want anyone to know. A few months ago, I had a dream that I was watching my friend at a distance play basketball (he loved basketball and was quite good at it). I had a covering like a mask over my face. My friend noticed me and asked why I was covering my face. I didn't answer. He asked multiple times and I stayed silent. He became angry and started to cash me to beat me up. I started to run but he easily caught up to me and grabbed my arm. I screamed, ""It's me! It's me! It's me \[my name\]."" I tore off my face cover. My friend's eyes lit up. ""Why didn't you tell me?"" he asked. He gave me a huge hug and said, ""I love you."" Immediately my whole body was washed over with a love I have never felt before. It was incredible. The dream has lots of meaning to me, but one I want to share is *vulnerability*. I struggle with depression and anxiety and also sometimes try to hide it as weakness. But you are not afraid to show our authentic selves to family and friends, it enables you to fully experience their love for you. Let's not hide our trials and our ""weaknesses"" behind a facade of perfection. Everyone struggles. Depression sucks. That's why we need each other. I'm grateful for my friend. Also, if you are having suicidal thoughts, please tell someone who loves you. I know it's hard to open up about that. I wish so badly my friend would have told me.

I have a good paying full-time career, I work out, play sports, am healthy, I have a lot of friends, and I have a great family (my emotional upbringing is another story). I'm not sure if I'm just used to the sadness, but I wouldn't realize that I'm going through something until I realize that I haven't eaten a meal in a couple of days and I consistently make excuses to get out of social events. Is anyone else like this? I already have a hard time being vulnerable with friends, even my boyfriend. So when anyone asks me if I'm okay or asks me what's wrong, I tell them I'm ok. The most I would say is telling my boyfriend that I don't know what's wrong with me and I leave it at that. Partly because I am afraid of vulnerability (I'm scared he'll not want to deal with me and end up leaving me so he wouldn't have to put up with my roller-coaster emotions), but mainly because I can't figure out why I'm so sad. Sometimes I stay up crying while he's already fast asleep, or I'll break out into tears while driving somewhere. A friend noticed that I might be going through something and told me to talk to someone. I'm too afraid and confused to talk to anyone in my personal life, so I ended up here. This is my first Reddit post (hello Reddit!). Okay, this is the end of my rant."

It's therapeutic and allows more coherency in my thinking. I'm 23 and deeply lonely to the point that I 've spent everynight crying. Ever since I was young, my parents abused me said I was worthless, physically abused me and told me everything was my fault. A lot of shit got involved with the police/social servies but they've now reformed. They've clearly changed now but I don't think past trauma has healed. I came to the UK when I was 6 barely knowing english. In my teenage years I was always the outcast, girls would call me ugly. *""wow, like....you're so attractive, I bet everyone wants to date you.""* ""Even *\[x\]* is more attractive than ***me***\*"" - overheard a conversation\* I was insecure of everything about myself, but adhered to the fact that teachers told me I was really clever. I've barely developed any social skills at this point. I've never learnt how to interact with girls, and I'm pretty sure I'm an Incel without the hatred (well only in myself). I was diagnosed with anxiety a few years back, and with my compulsive behaviour, alongside my inadequacies, I have developdc a habit of continually exercising, studying and meal prepping. Exercise was suggested during my brief time in therapy. *Have you tried exercising to realease the feel good chemicals?* I craved the admiration in myself when I was young, I looked to the future me. What would I see in me in the near future? I would ask when I was 18 I had a vision of what it really was to be a man, that I was going to be some greek-god physique, confident and some smart figure. I wanted to be mould myself into someone I would like. I wake up, go to my standard coffee shop or library, put on spotify (I have \~2000 hours on spotify in 2019 btw) , do work then work out. Looking back, I would be happy at the surface of where I am. I'm doing well at university, something that gives me satisfaction in helping a greater cause. Everyone admires my physique, in and out of the gym. ""damn, you've got good genes"". People have told me I should consider competing internationally. In the gym, a dude said ""damn, you're good at everything, It's always impressive when you lift."" I constantly crave validation, question my own intelligence and compare myself to others all the time. I count all my calories and macros in my head, I'm extremely focused on my diet. I tell myself If I don't have my 5 a day, I'll appear unnatractive. Some girls have actually straight up called me attractive but everytime I look in the mirror I see this ugly monster that should die. *No one likes me. Holy fuck you're weird as shit, remember when you were over there and did this? I bet everyone saw that you fucking weirdo.* Today I called an emotional support hotline for my anxiety, my dad walked in and I panicked telling him to go out. Later, on the phone cut off and The talk I had was my only sense of comfort that I've had in a long time. I cried. After washing my face , I went downstairs and saw my dad looking at the ground, ""who was that?"". ""oh nothing I was just discussing PHD topics with a supervisor"". I was extremly anxious that my parents overheard me. I've never seen my dad with the warmest smile ever, he said "" I thought you were talking to a girl"". As if he was deeply happy for me. I desperately crave an emotional connection. I want to be in bed, with someone in a state of physical and emotional vulnerability, to open up, expose my weaknesses, while she holds me tight as I cry and tell her to never leave me. I don't know if this expectation is absurd at this point, I've feel as though I might be disconnected from reality. I sometimes wish I could drown slowly, to escape reality while also reflecting the level of hatred I have in myself."
91,vulnerability,depression,Understanding what depression feels like,1,e7xhc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e7xhc5/understanding_what_depression_feels_like/,2019-12-09 05:40:19,"(Note: this post includes a description of feelings of depression / loss / may contain emotional triggers) &amp;#x200B; I have a close friend who is suffering from depression. As someone who is more anxious than depressed, I have been trying to get a sense of what their depression ""feels"" like. It occurred to me recently that I might be able to understand how it feels. I've been brokenhearted more times than I'd like to admit. When it's fresh, nothing seems to give me pleasure: I don't want to go outside, I don't want to do the things that usually make me happy, I don't want to invest in myself by going to the gym or wearing nice clothes or traveling. Seeing loved ones make me feel ashamed; their happiness and normalcy feel like turning a bright light on after hours in a dark room. I'd rather see them when I'm feeling whole; not when I'm falling apart, when it feels like the whole world knows and is judging me for it. Contact from other people either makes me feel pressured to say yes or say no. The promise of new relationships or new friends hardly register; our interactions seem unimportant and unfulfilling in comparison to my loss. If they fail, my pain is justified. If they succeed, my happiness is not enough. Little things make me want to sob. Crying is less a release and more a recognition of some terrible loss deep inside me, a loss that can never be recouped or recovered. The whole world presses down on me and the adult fades away leaving only vulnerability and powerlessness and raw humanity. Fixing myself is harder than ever. The loss absorbs me; I inspect it from every angle, analyze every word and sentiment and decision that brought things crumbling down. If I start to feel better, some small thing brings the loss into focus and it occupies me completely. The more I think, the more real the pain becomes; the more real it becomes, the harder it is to put it aside and heal. My mind starts to go. My memory is no longer reliable. Information slips out like sand through a sieve. I struggle to make and follow plans. I struggle to perform at work. I struggle to sleep, and that makes things all the worse. I've got goals and plans and things I'd like to do, but feel too tired and overwhelmed; to afraid of failing. Instead, I watch TV. I sit around. I ruminate. I lean on friends. It feels like all I want to talk about is the loss. I might feel good for awhile, but some insecurity pushes it all back to the surface and I need to be reassured again. They're growing frustrated. They're getting tired of reassuring me, of putting me back together. I'm feeling guilty for needing so much help. When I do go out, it takes time to change gears; I feel a subtle sadness, suspect that my friends or my dates can tell that there's something behind my eyes. They'd be right. A few drinks and suddenly I'm able to let it go. It's still there, but at a distance, and I'm able to forget for a time and be the person people expect me to be. Sometimes I have to pretend, but mostly that's okay. It's still nice to feel normal and to be reminded that happiness is possible. But then I get home, and the room is dark, and the TV is off, and it's just so quiet and it all comes back. Faster than it should. Pretend that there never was another person, that your heart wasn't broken, but simply is broken. Is that depression?"

(on the lowkey this is a venting post so I dont fuck up by putting it on facebook) alright so let's explore the same 5 questions my therapist gives me every week 1. how do I feel about my general wellness on a scale of 1-10? a solid fucking 2 because the only thing that's keeping me going is the idea of escaping into a new life with none of the responsibilities or expectations that I currently have. 2. how do I feel about my general wellness in regard to family? A solid 2-3 why because I spent time with my family I suppose but in that time my father questioned my mother's thoughts and actions and expected me to agree with him, and I felt powerless to stand against him and stand up for my mother and myself because no one deserves to be pushed down like that, just have a logical discussion what the actual fuck. 3. how do I feel about my general wellness in regard to work based relationships? this is probably the only place I'm doing reasonably well at a solid 3-4 because I've made headway with a new guy who use to work for the company however I feel as though my supervisor has been lying and manipulating myself and other team members to his proffesional and personal advantage. 4. how do I feel about my general wellness in regard to friends? a solid 1 as I feel like I cannot form a solid friendship with anyone, the 1 person I can I accidentally hurt a couple of years ago due to curcumstancially being unable to contact due to outside forces and never able to forgive myself for. furthermore current connections feel shallow due to my inability to show vulnerability and verbalize true thoughts and feelings due to fear of how they may affect another's thoughts and feels. 5. how do I feel about my general wellness in regard to life in general? well that's a solid freaking 1. I want to be alone, and isolated because I feel that way anyways. I want to die because life is endless ups and downs and if it's all gonna average out why not die before things can get worse? I just want something more than everything I am I'm sorry if this ruined your night cause I'm sure if you were scrolling through r/depression you were already bummed out but I just needed to vent some thoughts and feels. but hey if you wanna comment and make sure I have a somewhat happy morning feel free to. and yes I realise how clickbait-y that all seems after writing this but seriously a bit if support does help. night y'all, have a better day tomorrow."

I hold everyone at arm's length even though I desperately need the emotional warmth of another person. I feel like I'm failing in every aspect of my life because of the way my personality ended up developing. What's worse is that my parents and husband frequently remind me that I'm failing in some way or that im not living up to expectations no matter how hard I try. The only person who doesn't seem to see me in this light is my daughter, but I feel like I'm failing as a mother because I don't know what I'm doing. My examples of a parent weren't the best and all I know is that I don't want to raise her the way they raised me.

My parents divorced, my relatives who I was raised by teased me so badly that I defecated in my pants until I was 13 years old. I can remember being laugh as a 10 year old on Christmas morning with actual shit in my pants at my Aunts house. My family used to say I was retarded, useless, and not good for anything except shitting myself. My parents would just let this happen. I think I was honestly just a mistake, because they never wanted anything to do with me except abuse me. When I finally went out, made friends, and eventually started partying as a 17 year old - they put me in a treatment facility, cutting off all ties with anybody I knew. When in family counseling, they would roast into me how much of a nuisance I was to them and how everything was my fault. Months after graduating, my only favorite uncle, only favorite grandma both died in the same month. The month prior, I got a tumor in my knee. That same month my brother, the only one who pretty much primarily raised me, tried to commit suicide multiple times. I had over 20 episodes of kidney stones and surgeries from 20-30, recently being diagnosed with a rare gene disorder known as CASr. I will have to take medicine that will dehydrate me substantially everyday for the rest of my life or suffer a stent in my urethra. The only love of my life(5 years) and only real gf Ive ever had left me for another man. I had to drop out of college because of surgeries. I got injured and will never be able to work my dream job again. Recently my dog just turned 12 and isnt doing so well. I just had to drop $2000 on my car repairs in the last 2 months. I had to move back in with my sadistic parents, more sadistic then ever, recently due to break up. Im in crippling debt from school and hospital bills, my injury does not allow me to make the money I need to surpass this anytime soon. My ex-GF is obsessed with letting me know shes fucking somebody else. I have not 1 friend nor family member I can trust. But despite all of this, I guess Ill try again tomorrow. This time Ill come at it different, this time Ill know Im going to fail inevitably. And its going to be all be OK, there was never a shred of hope in my life to begin with. And tomorrow I will expect nothing less, going back *home* to my parents basement defeated and worthless. Ill go back again tomorrow, I can see pain on a person from a mile away. I know it with every sensor, I know exactly how to comfort them. How to make them feel loved. If it wasnt for the two long dead relatives who showed me their compassion, I might not be *this*. Tomorrow, Ill have 7 texts from 7 different people, all waiting to dump their emotions, sorrows, and struggles apathetically towards me. Lord knows not 1 of them will ever to do it for me. But Ill help them anyways, because I never want anybody to experience the true depth of loss for which Ive felt my entire life. I will wake up and physically push my body to the limits, until there is nothing left. To do anything less would mean to feel again. For me, to feel anything at all anymore is a death sentence. Im so grateful for my shitty job that I put in overtime to not even make my bills every month. It consumes me and makes me forget. Everybody around me is pissed off and ready to go live their happy lives outside of this shithole. Im sad to leave. I will face m reality once more when I get back *home*. My past was dark, future darker. But now, well, Im tired. Too tired to think, only ramble off a bit before my next shift. Which I will go into working as hard and precise as I can, making considerable progress, and my coworker who does nothing all day will continue to receive the raises and promotions. I will go into work dead tired, doing laps around 3 fully rested, terrible mood coworkers. I will congratulate them on how well they did. I give this to you, my dear reader: I feel like my life has been the most intense training session ever. Because the very few times the fog has cleared, Ive found little to no competitors worthy of what I set my goals in. So much pain and heartbreak, never catching a break. My family is absolutely terrified of me. Not that Im terrorizing them on purpose.. they simply cannot fathom the smile on my face that drives them back into their shells. The confidence they created from telling me Im worthless my entire life. But most of all, my adept ability to see **true pain** from almost anything - a fake laugh, an ego, an aggressive attitude. I feel invincible sometimes, and its my vulnerability that has allowed this. Now, fuck me if I cant catch a break here soon. fin."

Extremely important. Important enough that I believe every Human being should focus on maximizing small victories and healthy pleasure in their lives. So, I'm gonna come right out and say it. I live with major depression. (**WARNING BLOCK OF TEXT IN BOUND FEEL FREE TO SKIM ONCE YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH.... I KINDA RAMBLE ABOUT MY CURRENT LIFE AND THAT ALWAYS SEEMS TO GET ME GOING TL:DR AT THE BOTTOM**) She (trust me, naming your pains really helps) comes and goes as she pleases, but generally she tends to follow a pattern of intensity depending on how healthy I am in mind and body. Even at this point in my life, at this point where I would consider the past two months of it to have been the most liberating and self-awareness-boosting months of my entire lifetime, ~~(no fucking joke! I just had to edit all of this grammar down to really drive home the point I'm trying to make when i say~~ **~~LIBERATING~~**~~)~~ I **STILL** experience bouts of horrible depression. The type of depressions that numb the human in me down to a resentful and violent-minded ball of fire while ripping my body of so much of its energy that not even the fucking adrenaline can fuel me enough to move a god damn muscle. Like, scary type, ready to kill something type, like myself or a relationship or a state of mind or an entire day or sometimes even other beings type depression. Horrible stuff, and I wish it upon ABSOLUTELY nobody at this point in time. As such, I actually couldn't see *anybody* that I know personally benefiting from some of the more sinister aspects of depression, such as: |*Psychological*|*Physical*|*Both, at the same. time.*| |:-|:-|:-| |*Extended periods of hopelessness*|*Body fatigue so overwhelming it puts athletes' recovery periods to SHAME*|*Suicidal ideation* (feeling suicide physically is NOT fun)| |*Delusions*|*Entirely absent appetite*|*Persistent, intense rage.* This wreaks absolute havoc on the body. Both during and after.| |*Anhedonia*, which is the mental state where ""interest in anything, even that which you've previously loved"" is difficult if not impossible.|*Thick grease from not showering*|*Loss of interest in human connection*. Without our brothers touch we really struggle to thrive, imo.| |\^ This is a main reason that *Joy can feel impossible*|*Shocking fluctuations in weight*|*Loss of empathy towards yourself and others.* Really turns ya sour.| At the moment I run cross country and sprint for my school. I train individual muscles whenever I feel like I can. Weather permitting I practice and engage in tennis. I have cycled 50 miles, albeit before I ever experienced my devil-degree depression, with very very little rest to the point where my legs gave out on me. Whenever I lift weights or use my body I go all out. I'm no stranger to intense exercise so while I might not have been worked at a slave camp or anything, I certainly have put myself through some incredibly painful workouts. Considering, I believe exercise to be overwhelmingly beneficial for a variety of core reasons; one of the most important of which being that Humans **NEED** *some* degree of pain and suffering. I'm largely pacifistic overall but I think every human needs to hurt in order to heal. I also try my hardest to speak as much of my experience as possible when attempting to spread knowledge. I feel like experience is what teaches us the most. So, when I speak my ""sermons"" as I've been calling them lately, I always try and add in some stories and real world examples from my past. Piggy backing off of that, I've done exercise to the extent that I have been taught that there is no pain we can inflict upon ourselves during consensual, healthy exercise that can ever outmatch the physical pain, exhaustion, misery, and even suicide that we as human beings can sense on our skin and in our muscles -- from a depression or not. I might not have cracked rocks or mined ore for a whole day, but I understand nearly puking and nearly blacking out from exhaustion; Intense exhaustion, slow burning exhaustion. All of our suffering (and joy!) is totally real and totally tangible. It's also real to believe that you aren't depressed when you are. We can reach a certain point in our misery that we finally lose the last part of ourselves that cares for the Human in us. Once we reach this point I believe that it becomes very hard to feel empathy for ourselves. It becomes very hard to ever speak nicely about what we do. Or create. Or even what we think. It becomes very very very difficult to wake up, eat food, *exercise??? exercise while depressed??* (that shit seems impossible when im depressed like god cant someone just carry me to the fridge for..... haha nevermind too depressed to eat) It's not always possible to be functional during depression, either. Humanity boasts about the resilience of himself but **beneath his pride is hidden the importance of being weak.** Of being a sniveling, disgusting mess, screaming on the couch after breaking a glass or something. Like sometimes we just got so much shit in our heads that something so stupid and minor as dropping glass in our home can send us off the deep end. As such, we might be resilient in the marathon but god DAMN those blisters hurt!!!! We're pussies short term! We're weak, mushy, clumsy, and erect sacks of meat and meat-juice (blood). Of course words are gonna hurt us, our bodies are made for brain function for Christ's sakes.... As such, people can, but ***definitely*** shouldn't be able to make you *believe that you're* useless and sub-human/lesser. It's not fair to those of us who already hold that belief anyways. It's not fair to those of us who suffer, and it's not fair to themselves. Why are they okay with degrading their own sense of worth like that? Making someone's misery worse? And then watching their reaction to you, either ignoring it or missing it entirely, then living life after???? Like nothing ever happened?????????Who ever asks to hurt more? Is that even? Morally acceptable? Uh, duh? Why do I even have to ask myself this question???? No it's not fucking morally acceptable. Feeling that way is just part of the human experience, but if you regularly define your worth based on the negativity of others you're bound to succeed. Succeed how, might you ask? Well let me tell ya! **Humans love negativity!!!!!!** So much so that we can focus on it so regularly that it becomes all we talk about. So much so that the news is all about death and all of the wrongs in this world that would take hundreds of people collaborating all at once in a single group to fix. So much so that gossip even has its own dialects. So much so that there isn't a single school or a single workplace on this planet that doesn't have a human in it that bullies others. Or even *themselves*. Ever think about that? We bully ourselves all the time. Check the definition: `v. seek to harm, intimidate, or coerce (someone perceived as vulnerable)` Must I say any more? I personally don't believe we allow ourselves to be as open, compassionate, loving, understanding, considerate, gracious, honest, and/or trusting as we should be (if we care about mental health, of course! ) I have done further thinking in the past on all of these verbs **and** the subject in which all of these verbs rest under, and it is **vulnerability**. As such, I have come to the resting belief that vulnerability is one of the most important pains we must experience based off of the benefits we gain in the face of the negatives. It even seems too good to be true, as with due time it becomes second nature. It becomes necessity. A sometimes painful necessity. When interacting with truly kind people, though, I believe that vulnerability will be reciprocated and accepted. I believe everyone deserves some vulnerability in their life. I also just so happen believe that the root of vulnerability could, when involved and utilized in appropriate ways, potentially be able to create the solution to any problem we're having in this world. **And the root of vulnerability is** ***love.*** So, once you really get thinking about it, depression doesn't have to be a disease. The word disorder has already gained so much hate and controversy that it's not even worth calling it one anymore. The word **disorder** is defined in **psychology** as **a condition or state of mind that inhibits smooth functioning in every day life.** I think we have to find another word to describe this. I think we need to find a better way to communicate our pains to eachother, including those who don't suffer like we do. While we all may get depressed as human beings as it's part of life, the ""disorder"" part of MDD (major depressive disorder) comes into play when our suffering is so harsh throughout the day that we begin to lose functionality in ourselves long after we've already lost uninhibited functioning in society. I absolutely believe that there are Humans out there, myself included, who are much much more sensitive both emotionally and physically than many others are. This makes a perfect environment for pain. Add on some curious genetics and you have a recipe for Major Depression. It's this major depression that, when left unchecked, will undoubtedly knock us off our feet. If we don't realize our mistakes by then, well, best of luck to you. You'll be soon on a train to nowhere, my friend. **The horrid, absolutely revolting darkness that is inherent in all of life, Humanity especially,** ***has no bounds*** So, then, after all this, please answer me this question: If society can consider perpetual versions of Inherently Human Psychological States *(depression, anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations, obsessive compulsion, delusion, psychosis, etc.)* deemed inherently negative *(You know, like when people say stuff along the lines of ""How could anyone alive* ***possibly*** *benefit from something like* ***that****????)* can be considered a disorder, then **maybe its our** ***collective society*** **that's the diseased one**. Just think about it for a second. I'm not accusing anyone of anything nor am I proposing any solutions to any deep-rooted problems that exist here in our society. Society is necessary, I believe that with my whole heart and mind. Logic and emotion tells me so. But nowadays, it's pretty fucking hard to be spiritually healthy in this country; America. Let me break it down some. Some spiritual necessities, in my opinion, are.... &amp;#x200B; |Mind|Body|Spirit| |:-|:-|:-| |*Meditation*|*Meditation*|*Meditation*| |*Vulnerability*. It's soul food, and love is very important. It's how we connect with other human beings and other beings, like animals. Life is the most important thing on this planet, am I wrong?|*Raw foods*. Not many cans, cut back on packaging. Always read ingredients/nutrition facts so you know what's in what's going into your body.|*Gratitude.* To be thankful boosts our morale and teaches us what truly matters in life. We always learn as we go, and we should be thankful that we can learn in the first place.| |*Introspection/Reflection.* It's how we gain empathy, learn to solve problems, and connect with the world. Oh, and it makes us better.|*Sleep.* I say this as I write on a computer at 2:49 for the third hour straight now. We underestimate so strongly the importance of sleep on our body, mind, and spirit. If anything were to be listed under an ""All of the above"" category, it would be sleep. I'm just up so late because I'm editing this to a degree I deem comprehensive and cohesive. I want to make sense, all of this means a lot to me. Oh, and I've read this entire thing aloud to myself, as well.|*Reading, and any art consumption for that matter.* Think about it. Another human being just like yourself took their sweet time to express themselves in *language with grammar* that they have passion for, then re-read it multiple times so they could edit it for human consumption. Sounds like a recipe for purity to me!!| And some reasons it's so damn difficult to do these things could be..... &amp;#x200B; |*Inhibitor*|*Opinion*| |:-|:-| |Money|I feel like money plays a huge role in spirituality and overall human health for plenty of reasons. Pure foods are much more expensive than processed garbage I wouldn't even want to see a squirrel eating. Consumerism and capitalism sure can work together in curious ways.| |Culture|I feel like spirituality is highly misunderstood in today's world society. I'm just recently budding into my own skin but what I know for sure about spirituality is that it has *little to do with religion.* What I thought spirituality used to be for years and years was absolutely shattered once I began to experience and have faith in the largely hidden powers of this Universe. Without curiosity the Universe will never let you in, and without faith you will never come through to the other side. This is a very pseudo-scientific concept, and this society conditions us to stick to the facts. Science and research can't even *touch* certain things. Just look at the history of entheogenic compounds like True Psychedelics (LSD *(lysergic acid diethylamide)*, Magic Mushrooms *(A metabolite of psylocibin called Psylocin),* DMT *(*Any *Dimethyl Tryptamine),* San Pedro *(Mescaline, which is extracted from a certain cactus)* and so on.) These gained traction in the 40's when Albert Hoffman accidentally tried LSD in his lab after synthesizing it 15 years prior. He was simply searching for a respiratory stimulant and was granted something he believed to be truly magical. Not long afterwards the CIA began experimenting on us, some with the knowledge of it and some without, in order to see if LSD could be used for mind control. Funny enough it had the exact opposite effect. Soon after the exponential growth of love and true freedom took place in this country it was then shut down and labeled Schedule I. Only just now are we coming around to allowing *researchers* to take a look at it. *I firmly believe that we as Humanity should be legally and ethically encouraged to indulge our curiosity in a safe manner, regardless of what is considered ethical.*| It's expensive, its pseudoscientific, it's highly emotional, it's intense, it's culturally unacceptable; it's against most if not all of the models created by whoeverthefuckrunssociety that have been placed upon us in order to.......... In order to what? What is the purpose of the way this world is organized? Is it for the gain of the Collective Human or is it for the gain of the Individual? Okay, I'm getting exhausted here. I need to circle back to depression. I could go on and on with details and stories about how psychologically miserable and tortured I have been for quite a hefty length. I have suffered through so many different varieties of mental affliction that by this point I can no longer even *hope* to keep track of all of it. My memories will come in as they choose and I guess just have to live accordingly. I want to be open to my pains because they are what will ultimately aid me in my years years years long journey to becoming the truest version of myself I can be. As such, I can only summarize my suffering as such: I have suffered mental pains harsh and intense enough to bring myself and anybody not on God damned heroin down to their knees. I wear my struggles as a badge of honor because it's toughened me up into the individual I am today. They've also pounded me to a mush, making me the most soft and loving I have ever been in my entire life. Not even as a child have I loved like this. What I don't do, though, is brag about them. Thank you for reading, and thank you for sorting by new. I appreciate all of you, *especially* those who choose to leave a comment! ;) &amp;#x200B; **TL;DR - Feeling depressed and useless is just part of the human experience, but if you regularly define your worth based on the negativity of others you're bound to succeed. This is an oxymoron and I know that it is. It's a success because if you're looking for negativity you're ALWAYS going to find it. Why is this? Well, I say it in my little essay here but it's pretty simple.** ***Humans love negativity!!!!!!!!!!!!!!***"
97,vulnerability,depression,I wish I didn't expect so much out of people,1,ef1xru,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ef1xru/i_wish_i_didnt_expect_so_much_out_of_people/,2019-12-25 01:21:40,"I didn't have anywhere else to go. Maybe I do, but I'm too scared. I can count on probably one hand the number of times I've told someone how I was really feeling deep down, and none of them were in real life. I wish I could talk to people, I wish I could talk to my parents, I wish I could talk to my friends. That's supposed to make you feel better, and I can't comprehend how someone can just do thatshowing someone who you know in real life and who could possibly change your life for the worse, your vulnerability. But I'm a living contradictory, I'm telling you guys how I'm feeling, aren't I? I sound so incredibly selfish. When I texted an online friend a year back two whole paragraphs that exceeded the word limit of a single chatbox each, I deleted them out of self consciousness when I realized they weren't online. Hours later they sent me an oh no and a sad face, how was I supposed to respond to that? I'd understand if you weren't in the right head space to be vented to, but it be nice if you could have told me. Another was when I spilled out my troubles, much like above, to an online therapist who told everyone they could come to her when they were bothered. Weeks later she sent me a paragraph telling me she was thankful I was willing to be so honest and would get back to me since she was busy and she wanted to keep the important ones for later since they mattered to her. I found out later from another friend who tried to do the same thing that she wouldn't help you because she wanted payment. And that's understandable, but it would have been nice to know, before I told you my feelings like an utter idiot. I'll probably clam up in real life to therapists or someone asking me how I feel. I can't do it, it gets caught in my throat. It's not like I don't want to, I can't. I wish I could. And when I told two online friends, whom I was pretty close to, about this fact that I didn't know if I could tell people my problems, they send me a virtual hug. I know they care, I know, but it would be nice to have some actual words like I would have given them. ""It's okay to feel that way."", ""Just know we're here if you need to talk, cause we care."", or ""We'll listen to what you have to say, and we won't judge you."" It's too much to ask, I don't know if I would have told them if they said those things. But something in me needed to hear that. That I wouldn't be pushed away again, that I could talk to people. There's something about actual words. I know they care, but it's like I expect them to say some magic words for me to finally tell someone who cares that they won't brush me off. I wish I didn't expect so much. I wish I could be an open book. I wish I didn't care. I wish I didn't have feelings anymore. Feeling numb might be worse, but now I feel it'll be better than this mess I call my feelings."
98,vulnerability,depression,"As the holidays often hit hard with a feeling of loneliness and misery, this is the first time in over 5 years that I end the year without being depressed, and I want to share how I got here",1,ehstq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ehstq2/as_the_holidays_often_hit_hard_with_a_feeling_of/,2019-12-31 08:55:26," **Long story short :** I have never been sure what I want to do with my life. I followed a classic path with school and when I reached university and learned more about the world and started observing myself, I grew hate for humanity and myself. I couldnt comprehend that we are exploiting the Earth and the poor only to preserve a level of comfort that isnt even sustainable in the long run. This culture that praises fame and looks more than integrity and humility, this culture that wants more, fast, fake and cheap, over quality, I wanted nothing to do with. But I felt like I let that culture corrupt me. I also always felt like I wasnt reaching my potential, like I was lazy, often stupid, not great with women, and couldnt get anything done. This spiral lead me in a spot where I was working for a job I didnt like, where I felt like a loser, where Id rarely go to bed before 3-4 am and couldnt care for anything. I even stopped showering for a few days every now and then, because who cares. I want to mention I never got to the point where I had dark thoughts. I simply could not care for anything anymore. I had no purpose, no reason to look up to the next day. And I spent most of the time more or less consciously denying that I had a problem. **How I got better :** My first step in reaching out was therapy. I heard of a program (in Montreal,QC) that offers 10 sessions of therapy for cheap with students after 1 or 2 years of their studies. Its a specific school that has a specialized approach which consists in mostly listening to the patient. I didnt know if it would help, but I thought what the heck. I went there once a week. Sat in an awkward silence for half the session, and eventually found myself talking about what felt wrong. And sometimes about what I like. And sometimes about what I need. And that last part is where my therapist tried to bring me. To better understand what I need, and to be kind to myself. She also pointed that I seemed to have disconnected from myself. That I had a hard time listening to how I really feel, after denying my bad feelings for so long, but that it was possible to rebuild. I then used the site Simbi where you can ask for and offer services in exchange for points. I contacted a few life coaches and got in touch with a couple of them who helped me a ton. I also grew interest for Buddhism philosophy, which I didnt know much about. I started attending classes and learned a good intro to the concepts of ego, love vs attachment, compassion, peace of mind, mindfulness, etc. Then one summer I offered voluntary work to participate in a permaculture course. Not only did I learn a lot, but I also connected with so many people all of a sudden. There were about 50 students who all had values that were closer to mine, who all felt discomfort towards the ways our society is run, and who didnt shy away from sharing their pain and vulnerability. The experience was so strong I felt like crying when it was over. It brought me a ton of hope in humanity. Then I started reading self growth books. One like Mark Mansons The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fuck really helped me pinpoint certain key concepts of what helps happiness and what doesnt. To name a few examples of ideas he elaborates on : * Unhappiness comes from avoiding problems : Either through denial or victim mentality * Realizing that you are not special (many others live the same, and victim mentality is a form of ego because you are more concerned about yourself than others) * We cannot change until we change how we see ourself I also enjoyed Don Miguel Ruizs The Four Agreements, and The Three Questions. These books made me reconsider who I am, and that helped me letting go of always trying to identify to this or that, and to simply look at what is within with no judgement. Then, last summer, I had been chatting a lot with a girl I had met at a festival. I took a chance and travelled where she lived to meet her. We spent three weeks together and I completely fell in love. She was the most simple person I knew, but also the wisest. She would only see the positive in everything, would live only in the present moment, and would find joy in contemplating the most simple things. Unfortunately she did not felt like maintaining this could-be-relationship, which left me completely heartbroken, more than I ever was. But even with all the pain I felt through accepting that it was over, the feeling of being grateful for experiencing this Love and opening my eyes to the beauty that life can bring would outweigh the negative part. I also experienced with magic mushrooms, most often in cases where we called them Sacred Medicine. Because although they can be a lot of fun, they and people have opened my eyes to the true potential of this medicine. If you approach it with respect, with an introspective intention, they can truly help you heal your scars and fears. I have to mention that you shouldnt use them if you have serious mental illness in the family, and that you should do proper research beforehand, and make sure you are in the right set &amp; setting. My strongest advice is to allow them to take them wherever they want to, know that you will come back to your normal self eventually, and accept whatever happens with Love, even if it feels negative. Since then I have developed a whole new different perspective on Life. I keep learning about everything wrong with this world, but only because I want to find out how I can try to build something different, something that makes sense to me. And that starts with learning about myself. And thats done through experiences. I asked my boss to work part-time now and thankfully they agreed, so I started working 3 days/week in December. I used long weekends to see my family, friends, and visit projects and communities that I like. I try to watch my thoughts, to let go of my inner Judge, to not take anything personal, to do my best, to do whats right even if its harder, to remain honest, to listen to my intuition and to what feels right, to congratulate my success, to accept my failures, and to keep faith in that process. And to be honest, looking back I see more clearly the downwards spiral I was stuck in. And I feel like I am not going in the other direction. I have kept doing better in general, and the more I do, the better I treat myself, the more energy I have, the more I do things I love, the more I share this Love, the more I feel good about myself, the more I want to keep learning and growing and sharing. With that mindset, I feel way more resilient, because what used to bug me most likely wont bother me anymore. **My message** So to those who are in a similar spot than I used to be, my message would be this : Keep faith that life can be good, and that problems are there because there is something to learn from them. Seek help, seek answers, dont be afraid to get out of your comfort zone, dont be afraid to question your own beliefs, your own culture, your own identity. You are not doomed to be like this or like that, you can change. In fact, we constantly change, it only depends of how much we are willing to let go of who we are now. Be kind to yourself because you are worthy. You have every right to exist and to be yourself. Being depressed is okay, but it is not a 'balanced' state. Don't deny your negative emotions, but also don't do nothing about them. Don't be shy to talk about them, as there is absolutely nothing wrong with them. You deserve Love, so learn to love yourself and you will learn to love life. Learn to love life and you will learn to love yourself. Because they go together. Do things you love, and find good people to chat with and to be around. Easier said than done. I know. But the good things ain't the easy things. But I guarantee you, once you reverse the spiral, every thing gets easier. So keep faith that its worth it. I love you."
99,vulnerability,depression,Christmas Noose,1,eik1qj,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eik1qj/christmas_noose/,2020-01-02 03:20:59,"Impending like a noose reliant upon the slightest pinch of gravity, Christmas came, descending the world and everything in it to the brink of the obsolete. I had just come home from being abroad for 16 months; a trip one would hope and expect to be tickled pink with engaging stories and comedy, wisdom and knowledge to be shared. but i was depleted, and the expectation of this hearty social spiel put me off ease. I had come to witness and suffer a lot about myself in the past months, a personal revelation of sorts. and it's nothing new this sort of thing, but this time my self inflicting alienation was pushed to the brink of possibly no return. Now factor in relationships of mixed dynamics, uncertain and weary groundings and my vulnerability to inevitable triggers, you have my worst major depression of my adult years. Family burst through the doors as joy flooded the halls alike the day Christ walked the earth. All sin and past troubles forgiven, personal strife and habitual feuds overcome. Tensions in themselves silenced while penance was dealt and checked; for this one last Hurrah of the year, together we'll ring in the bells. The house was falling down with good vibes, positive feeling caressed past failures of what Christmas stood for any year before. It was going to be a merry Christmas for everyone, no doubt about it. Barr the one unsettled trembling in the shadow of its wake. 23rd, my brothers birthday; it was the only time I felt the fear of a real attempt. Any time previously was mere ideation or desire, the epitome of justified wallowing where i could alas drift off to sleep. I left a birthday card on my brothers bed while everyone was out; making errands, seeing friends, soaking up the immanent joys of the Christmas spirit. I was at home checking online the Hangmans knot. My wardrobe called to me sinisterly as it was just the two of us alone, it took the form of regrettable reminiscence that all these years before it stood there towering, i was oblivious to its fate. all at once so obvious but startling that thats where it will end. standing inside of it was as if it was made for me. It's size and stability; another dimension. In a way alike luxury, to go out like this. but all at once so painful that the odds were exact, it was clear more than ever i needed to get out ASAP. My dressing gown belt, soft like a teddy bear, mint green like a babies crib took on a form so ugly as it tightened itself around the wardrobes bar, securing itself so firmly, its dark potential indiscernible. As I let my weight go and blood filled up my head, it was the closest i've ever come to initiating death. As consciousness blurred and the grasp threatened control, there was indeed something putrid that the act embraced. Feelings of letting others down, as i cower and take the easy way out. The innocence of man so faraway and sweet. Who will deal with this and what kind of scar might it leave, forever taunting them unsubstantially with the horrors beneath. It wasn't right, and it wasn't the end. We take with us precisely what we leave with; The knots need to be undone first. That night I drank wine, as i failed in feeling, thought and form. To go on as usual keeping undercover this malignant crime. All angles whispered deception as paranoia gurned from the cracks. I was falling away from reality and cowered under a mask. In silence and in fear, there was nothing left to say. I had killed the Christmas spirit but was around for the aftermath. My mind looped furiously convincing the monster to die away. Such narcissism void of goodwill, urging to trade good tears for cold blood. Such a vile abomination, what a disgusting creature i've become; lurking above, friend to no one. The future had spoken and this is my fate, judgement day was here and now it's too late. Trapped in a coil, unable to liberate, the pressure was unbinding; as theres no way to turn back time. The blackhole from where I lay reflected what I've become to this day, I woke up and prayed for night, just to hide away. Empty and alone, far away inside. Sucking soundly on destruction, damned off the face of the earth. Life still existed, it's exuberant treasures and delight. It's infinite possibilities, its eternal flame alight. I see the potential the soul interplays. It's creative reciprocation between the parts; but in darkness and in solitude you forfeit the power to engage. This type of doom, you can't just walk out of. It's exceeds shame and guilt, with the regret and the pain it spreads. It is a malignant stain that can't be erased, the choice of sorrow against the light of day. The denial of the transitory and fighting against time. The refusal to give up the demons of the mind. The evidence was loud and clear, this karmic debt was in. I will have to work my life in defeat if I ever hope to make it back. There was no sound sleeping for anyone in the house; who tried their best to ignore. There is no point using words, it empowers the cause even more. As days harshly passed, and cold winds pierced the heart. A raw and withered longing crept in once more. The Will to surrender to the hand up above, who provides tremendous shelter and pushes you forth. The memory of humour and Soloman's song, the play shall wait for you to accept your part."

I really want to go to your school. And the truth is, I didn't always. In fact, I didn't until recently. I would say, that until about 3 months ago, I didn't really want to go to any college. Growing up, my highest aspiration for a while was to go into marketing. I figured, ""hey, you can write, you can work photoshop. Make it a career."" Then, I found a girl. The light of my life like you wouldn't believe. She was awesome and amazing, and she pushed me to pursue my passion for writing. I didn't even think I was going to go to college at that point. My game plan was to publish my book in my senior year of highschool, make enough money to live off of while we built our house in some small town somewhere, and just be happy. When she left, those dreams pretty much imploded, and some late spring night, I was stuck, crying over my laptop, realizing what I'd written, that book that was gonna send me on my way to doing what I loved, would never be published, that it would never see the light of day. And I just cried. I cried and I cried and I cried. And then, after that, I just wanted to fucking die. I really really did. I didn't have any friends to talk to, any family who cared, and as a guy I couldn't even fathom the idea of asking for help from a professional. One day, I found myself, sitting at the edge of a cliff, wondering if I could finally fly my way out of this life that I hated. Desperate, to cling to something, I posted on a subreddit. r/depression. I wrote a post saying that I didn't think that I was okay, that I was scared, and hopeless, and that nothing I did seemed to make me feel any better. And two people, two people, they replied. They said that they understood, and that I should hang in there. And I did hang in there. I fucking did. And I learned something. I learned about the power that comes with vulnerability. How I looked up to people who had the bravery to fight for their damn lives and be honest about it. I learned how fucked the system is, how people who desperately want help can't get it because they can't afford it. And I learned that the most powerful five words in the english language is the simple phrase *I understand how you feel.* I don't have the words to say, what it's like to feel so alone, and then to have someone reach through your computer, and tell you that they understand. It's like seeing the face of God. &amp;#x200B; And so, I decided. I fucking resolved. That I was going to be successful, and that I was going to make a difference, and that I was going to do it, as the kid who almost killed himself. As the kid who is depressed, as the one who's fucked up. To fight this goddamn stigma, to stand up for people who are just trying to fight for their lives. That's the thing, all we want to do is fight for our own damn lives! And I resolved also to be the best damn computer programmer of all time, so that I could make an army of fucking algorithms to march out and make the world a better place. I was gonna end the financial troubles that make people want to off themselves, and make a form of social networking that actually networks people rather than monopolizing their goddamn time on vanity and social competition, and I was gonna solve all the worlds fucking problems. And then, at the end of every day, I was gonna go to a depression support group I'm gonna start in my own fucking home town, and I'm gonna look people right in the eye, and rather than talking down to them, rather than giving a fucking spiel about ""oh you've just got to do this and you'll be happy."" I'm just going to empathize, and I'm going say the five fucking words that saved my own damn life. **I understand how you feel.** And we're gonna stand up for eachother, because dammit who else will? &amp;#x200B; Your school is the best school in the country. If you let me in, I'll study harder than anyone else, I'll fight harder than anyone you've ever seen, and when I graduate, I will do what I've said I will do. Because if depression taught me anything, it's how to fight with every breath I take. Sincerely, A hopeful applicant."

Probably gonna add some other stuff into the mix. I don't need help. But at most, just lend an ear and listen. Right now, I feel tired. As generic as that sounds, there's more than that. There's always more than that. What am I tired of right now? I'm tired of putting so much effort into people. This goes from helping, which I've been doing for years because I wanted to do something bigger than myself, and I'm fucking exhausted with being the one putting in the effort in friendships, relationships, etc. I'm fucking done. Thing is, I'll get over this exhaustion and repeat the cycle because I'm caring. But that's besides the point. I have been thinking for a long time. I do so much for people. It's all well and good. But. I kinda wish I had someone care the same way. Noticing when I'm feeling this low and support me. And I'm shooting myself in the foot here because I'm very private. (Reddit is an exception because of the anonymity) I guess you can say I'm hurting in silence. Mainly because I grew out of opening up to people, it ruined my friendships and relationships and I generally hate to be the one to show vulnerability. It isn't like I never had someone care about me. People have. People I loved dearly. They meant everything to me. But as you can tell by ""meant"" they're no longer with me. They're gone. I feel like the more I've gave in and opened up, the more people ended up leaving. Because in this fucking world, it's always a one sided thing. It's always about them.. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that, we're all selfish in some shape or form. But I wish I had someone just as invested in me as I would be to them. I genuinely need love, affection, intimacy, etc. (Not asking you guys) because I feel so deprived of them. I've always been deprived of them. And here I am, giving people exactly that so they wouldn't have to suffer through the feeling of being deprived of those core things in life. But I guess it doesn't matter. No matter what I did. No matter what I've done. I lose people all the same. I feel a sense of loneliness. Even when there's people around me. I just. I feel like I always have felt. Irrelevant. For so long. Since childhood. that's always how I felt. Yeah, now I am at peace with it. More so than how I used to feel. But I still feel it. I tried. I did so much for people. Hell, most of the time people show great appreciation for me and how I've made them feel. But I'm tired. I will take a short break. And I kinda wish I had someone to take that break with. Someone to hold, someone to prioritize. Yatayata bunch of shit you don't have to hear. I'm tired"

But life threw me an unexpected turn. After college my mental health suddenly declined. Anxiety turned into phobia. Depression turned into despair. Frustration turned into rage. Irritability became wild mood swings I went from being a happy, social person, full of life and humor, to someone who desperately wanted to avoid the world and couldnt tolerate its onslaught of stimulation and slights. **\*\*\*Welcome to the Circle\*\*\* is my story** and the multitude of lessons Ive learned along the way.

I reconnected with family and friends around the globe. I started a successful global initiative for Wikipedia. I met my strong, brilliant, and beautiful wife. I became a loving stepfather. Along the way I learned and practiced how to help others find their own way into recovery. **My mission is to impact each person** who has personally experienced or witnessed the struggle of mental illness. To end the stigma and shame that prevents people from getting the help they need.

107,vulnerability,depression,My previous two relationships ended with me being manipulated and I feel like a bad mistake,1,dxzylf,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dxzylf/my_previous_two_relationships_ended_with_me_being/,2019-11-18 18:28:01,I had my first serious relationship at the start of this year. We dated for around 4 months and I loved him incredibly so. We are both guys and he has always considered himself gay. In the final month he was very distant and I found out he was cheating on me with a girl. I was devastated since he never mentioned these feelings to me and then ghosted me and started dating her. He now claims hes straight and now I feel like nothing but a bad experiment. We were all coworkers so it was incredibly hard to deal with seeing them but I stuck through. They eventually both left this job which took a lot of the pain away. About 5 months after all of this happening my boss would mention to me how strong I was for continuing to work through everything that happened. He came onto me and I allowed him to. It felt so nice to be loved again and I finally felt like I was moving past my ex. About a month later he came to his senses I guess and stopped everything suddenly. He told me it was a mistake and shouldnt have happened. Since then Ive just felt manipulated and used. I spend my nights crying knowing that both relationships I tried to be in ended with both of them viewing me as a mistake. And thats how I feel all the time now. Like a mistake. My first ex used me to figure out his sexuality and my second ex is my boss who took advantage of my sadness and vulnerability. Im so tired of feeling this way. I cant enter any relationship due to these feelings and the baggage that I have to deal with everyday.

He lives abroad so I went to visit him once in October with basically zero expectations. However it went so well and even though he has mental issues and depression, I'm depressed too so it worked out that week. After I left I couldn't stop thinking about him and even though we had agreed and booked a visit in December, I missed him so much and booked a visit in November (right now) at 3am one night and told him about and he seemed excited, it didn't feel like too much. Well I'm here now and I've been alone since he left on Friday (we spent a night, around 24h together) and since he didn't text me that weekend I texted him today and he said that he can't do this with me and that he doesn't think he shouldn't see me again. I'm sad about it but I told him I would give him space and time and reminded him about December. The few weeks we spent together and texting, he said he really likes me, he would want to be mine, he would want me to meet his mom and I already know his sister. What I'm saying is that I know he actually felt something for me, and cause of his abandonment issues and depression (and undiagnosed bipolar disorder from what he says) he did this. He was abused and beaten by his dad for being gay and that is likely what did this to him mentally. He posted on his private tumblr (that he showed me as a high level of vulnerability) that he hates that he keeps pushing everyone away. I'm sure we have essentially broken up forever but I want to fight for it, so what do people who push you away actually want? Have you experienced this and how did it go? What side were you on? How did it end up? Sorry for the long post, I just needed someone to tell this and just human contact in general. Thanks. If I missed anything I'll be glad to elaborate if you ask."

I walk around feeling like I'm going to have an anxiety attack but nothing ever comes or I feel like I'm about to cry. I can't be bothered to eat. I had moved away from my family as I was from a disruptive broken home that was very suppressive but now I just feel like I'm drowning slowly in social isolation and mental anguish, despite having friends and a successful work life with sociable colleagues. But I feel like all the social contact I have is only skin deep. I try not to depend on people for my happiness because I've been hurt by so many people and I find it frustrating that I can't seem to cope with living with myself and I don't know what to do. And I really struggle to find any purpose in a life with the only meaning that I assign to it or to find the energy to better myself in this world that doesn't respond to any actions that I take and that I find incredibly difficult to maintain a stake in. All of the progress I have made with my self esteem by moving out and finally being able to be myself unburdened and free to grow I have made under the watchful eye of this depression that has been stalking me for years that I have to combat just to rationalise getting up in the morning. I even tried dating but fucked up my chance with this amazing person I met who was really wanting to be with me and wanting to commit because I was not putting all my effort in because I was waiting for something to go wrong and because I find it difficult to open up and because I was withdrawn. I feel like I can't get close to people and I can't handle the vulnerability of being close to people. All the things I used to take pleasure in I just find emotionally draining or like they're just a distraction for this true feeling of wasting away that I'm hiding from and if I do manage them for a while eventually the lethargy just catches up with me and I find myself sitting in a ball by the radiator. I feel almost like this misery is my natural state of being that I'm just running from all the time. I'm questioning everything, I feel like I have a distorted perception of my own reality and things aren't that bad but I don't have a support network or anyone to go to with these feelings I just have to bury them and try and keep going and that if I just keep going something will click and I'll be ok and it will all fall away but it's not like that it keeps coming back for me. I put a brave face on around my family because we have a lot of problems and I don't need to be another one, and the couple of close friends I have I don't want to give them my depression to deal with but I'm sick of people asking me how I am and just having to pretend I'm ok because that is what is socially acceptable. I have this facade of pretending to be an ok normal person that's just getting on with their life trying to be successful and get what they want out of their existence but really I'd like to explode, I'd like to cry I'd like to just feel like the cloud that is following me around is gone for a while instead of feeling like I'm lying to myself for trying to be happy. I have dreams where I self harm and I wake up looking for the scars. I've even tried turning to Buddhism but that just further reinforced my lack of attachment to the world around me. I feel if I could just let go of this body painlessly I would because I don't believe in life after death and I feel that if I'm going to keep living this marred existence second guessing myself all the time what good am I to anyone? What good am I to myself if I just can't hack it at life? I'm sorry for the word dump but I don't know what to do anymore."

He was always curious about my well-being and asking if there was anything I needed. Thats why I took this very hard because I thought I could rely on him. That was one of the worst presumptions Ive had about a person in my life. My junior year I was on the varsity basketball team full time and I was looking forward to it. That changed drastically once the season began. Nearly everyday I was ridiculed, scapegoated, and neglected. It wasnt my fault we only had 3 guys taller than 6ft. We all knew we werent going to be close to having a winning season. Somehow I got the blame when things werent going right. Mind you, I played maybe 6 minutes a game. It wasnt even just that though. He treated me as a lesser being. When I jumped for a loose ball and called timeout, he was speechless. Like I wasnt capable of making a high IQ play. That irked me. During practice once he stopped play and made it known to the entire gym that I didnt have a partner for the excersize that we were doing. He said things like this is why we dont end up on the winning side. I decided that was it and the next day I would walk into his office and renounce my position. He didnt believe me. He told me hed give me 3 days to mull it over because he thought I was making a mistake. I didnt. My family was outraged and my self esteem took a plummet. I started doing more drugs and partying more all because of this midget cunt that doesnt know a thing about coaching. He resigned after the year was over and I played again the next season, but that doesnt take away the agony and humiliation that he put me through. He exploited my vulnerability multiple times and for unknown reasons. I want to go back into his office to calmly ask him, why me? What did I do to deserve such sudden contempt?

I wonder who it is Id be if I werent like this, who it is Id be if I were better, happier.Approachable. Im not like this anymore. Apparently every thing that was good about me has gone away, leaving behind an empty, sad pathetic casting; a casting that only can observe. I dont know where the insides of me went, and I cant seem to find out what triggered their rather abrupt disappearance which is precisely what kills me. Its just annoying to not know where youve gone when everyone is nagging at the casting as if it can give you an answer of substance. An observer seems to notice everything but himself, the insides must have left when I was watching something else, I shouldve been more attentive. I attempt to retrace, I attempt to understand what went wrong, and how I can fix it. Maybe Im too afraid because I dont want to fix it. Im uncomfortable with being vulnerable and shedding my dignity for the possibility of sincere and warm pity from others. I know though that this is the only solution; vulnerability in its sheer vulnerableness it will only bring reality to the surface, perhaps prompting the return of the insides. Perhaps then they will not see the casting, but will see the insides sadness and sympathize with it, rather than find anger and frustration and confusion with it. I do hope that the insides come back to me. I hope they miss me, and I hope that wherever theyve been, and whatever theyve seen, they enter without hesitation; never desiring another again. I need to say sorry. I never appreciated it, and I never even thought enough of the insides.To tell the truth I was ungrateful. With the insides return, Ill tell them how beautiful and how funny they were, Id celebrate their perfections and improve upon their errors. Ill appreciate them. So, on the fateful day when they do decide to return, Ill say my thanks and appreciate."

There are people in my life who try to help.. but they dont understand it anymore than I do. It takes all I have to hang on, till I can sleep. But even sleep is no escape. The thoughts, this war, becomes my dreams. They haunt me when I close my eyes. I see them on the faces on my friends, I see it when I look in the mirror. It's the first thought when I wake and my last when I sleep. Unwanted, useless, forgotten, pathetic, worthless, used. Words that echo like cannon fire in my head. Every... moment, it plays on repeat until I can no longer take it. It breaks me over and over each day. I feel as if I'm falling... like one day I tripped... and just never stopped. It all fell to me, no it wasn't my fault and yet it was. Logic tells me ""No, it wasn't you.. this is not who you are. She used you."" I do my best to agree... but a louder voice in the back of my mind says- ""and you let it happen, you knew and you let it. It was killing you and you knew it was killing you. But you let it."" ""It is your fault."" ""She was right.. you should've killed yourself.. you are weak because you didnt."" Its dark... it's cold. I've dropped to my knees due to the weight. I've cried till I cant cry anymore. I force this smile, I force this look of happiness. A feeling, I haven't felt... in so long. I dont know what happiness is. I've forgotten. I've forgotten what it feels like to be happy. To have joy. I drag myself out of bed everyday to suffer till I can sleep, only to suffer more. I was ripped apart from the inside... years later and you still have the gapping wound. The heartless... created a heartless. There is no silence... only war. A war I'm afraid... I cannot win."

It's weird to talk about this, but honestly I feel at times helpless. I've built a very strong persona for the people I meet. When people see me they don't see me as a person who has anxiety, a person who has depression or insecurities. I come off as a person who is strong minded who is usually an asshole but has a calmer side. So most people don't see the side that eats me up at 12am. No one understands that side of me and honestly it's a 2 way street I've never given them the chance, and they've never seen me in that light. Honestly recently it's been harder. I have been going through a really tough time, and I want to tell my best friend that I need help, that there are times I feel like he isn't my friend anymore because all these negative fucking thoughts fuck me up. The problem is I don't know how. How do you go through a 13 year friendship of always being that guy that people come to, who is head strong and then let someone know that ""hey, btw I'm actually mentally fucked up, I have a shit ton of depression, mood swings, anxiety and nervousness and I need some reinforcement from you"".

I don't know if it's my pride or maybe it's the opposite, that I'm not strong enough to let them see that side. It fucks me up. It leaves me lost and looking for something and someone that I have never found. Sometimes it gets harder to always be that confident person who doesn't get pushed down by anything, at times I'm just exhausted, but at the same time I don't want to show my vulnerability. Sorry for the long post, apologies for errors on mobile."

Officially diagnosed for two. Before I was the class clown (not the hiding emotions with humor type just hella outgoing and personable) but about halfway through my junior year of high school a switch got flipped. I went from being happy and normal to unable comprehend the idea of happiness. My gpa went from 3.8 to 2. I had friends that I shared my feelings with but they didnt understand at all. All they could say was if you need anything Im here which anyone with depression knows thats the most useless shit someone can say. I felt so alone. My senior year I almost attempted suicide but was convinced not to and went to the hospital. There I was diagnosed with depression and spent a week in the psych ward. After that I started taking Zoloft, and I started drinking a lot. And smoking a lot of weed. I also started to get bipolar which Im not sure is because of the meds or the substance abuse. I could tell my mind was unstable but I felt like I had no control over it. In my vulnerability I got in a hella toxic relationship. I thought itd be good for me to be with a girl who also was depressed cuz finally someone would understand what Im going through. Instead she emotionally manipulated me and trapped me in the relationship by threatening suicide every time I tried to get out of it. Then I went to college. I had a 0.5 gpa and smoked weed every day and slit my wrists and stopped keeping in touch with my high school friends. Second semester of that first year of college I sometimes couldnt get out of bed for an entire day. I had to go to the hospital once cuz I was so dehydrated. I had stayed in my bed for almost two days without eating or drinking anything. I started sleeping 15-16 + hours a day and kept smoking. After I withdrew from that college, I came home and started working. I started Wellbutrin, which works a lot better than Zoloft for me. So now I can at least get myself out of bed every day. I go to community college now too and Im doing ok academically. But I feel like after all that happened I dont know who I am anymore. I let my depression and being a stoner define my identity, and I dont want those things to define who I am. But I dont know what to replace them with. I forgot how to socialize too. I tried reconnecting with my old friends but that same energy just wasnt there like it used to. It felt almost forced. Like they were just hanging out with me cuz they felt bad for me. I can barely keep a conversation now, and I used to be the center of attention. I feel like thats me but I cant go back to that. I havent made any new friends at this community college because my extreme insecurity about my lack of identity and personality give me social anxiety. I dont know what to do. I just want to be normal again I fucking hate myself."

116,vulnerability,depression,Why do parents teach you not to cry?,1,devvkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/devvkg/why_do_parents_teach_you_not_to_cry/,2019-10-08 16:53:30,"When I was younger my mother taught me not to cry, because according to her it was a sign of ""weakness,"" and showing vulnerability was admitting defeat. (Yes, that's literally what she said). She taught me this ever since I could speak, and would hit me over and over again to make me stop crying when I was just a kid. So I was always afraid to cry in front of my mom, because instead of comforting me like other moms do, she would scold me until I stopped. I think she did this so she could make me stronger, but instead it crippled my life completely. I'm still afraid to cry even after all these years, even when I'm alone. It's like I was never taught to cry in comfort and vent out my feelings. It drives me crazy because all this emotional frustration just piles up inside of me and stays there. People say it's an unhealthy coping mechanism, but for me it isn't even a coping method. I was just taught. Now I can't even go to my mom for therapy, because she believes that mental illness should be overcome without the help of medications or psychiatric help, and just shakes off my problems as trivial in comparison to others. I bet she would flip if she found out I was suicidal, because if that isn't a sign of weakness in my mother's eyes I don't know what is. P.S. Just in case people assume I'm a guy, I'm not. I know this is more common among males because of toxic masculinity, so just clearing things up."

Or even just be mentally and emotionally vulnerable with. I guess I just need a girlfriend or something, but it gets tiring. Im in school, working, with plenty of savings and Im looking forward to a good future but I have no one to share it with and no one who cares about how I feel or to hear my thoughts. My family is relatively toxic, and even at its best, its certainly not a place for emotional vulnerability. With thoughts like this, a depressive spell is probably coming back."

I was unemployed (def was both deserved and a job that I was trying to leave before I was fired). Then I spent four months looking for a new job to end up as a temp. I did a great job, great rapport with my boss, good company to work for in my chosen industry, the whole 9. I spent 7 months as a contractor doing try outs to stay to end up in this mortifying half-secretary half-office manager position sitting at a reception desk. Of course, many people would feel lucky to have this job. I, myself, busted my ass to have internships and to work part time through an mba, getting scholarships and making connections at different networking bullshit, getting employee of the year to end up here. I am so frustrated and sad and embarrassed. I swear Id rather wear a t-shirt around with my real, non-drivers license weight on it than to tell everyone who thought I had potential and saw me succeeding end up here. I probably need my meds adjusted. Ive been depressed since I can remember in and out of hospitals therapy whatever who fucking cares because clearly it didnt work. My GP told me I have to slow down on the Benzos that are keeping me employed because I just cant stand sitting where I sit, making appointments, and setting agendas that get eight rounds of revisions. Without something to slow me down it would be impossible to make it through just one fucking day of this coaster is nice maybe we should have them here well... should I look for this coaster? Well itd be nice if we had them . I want to think, I want to do, I want to add real non-shlep value that I thought I could and (to add a layer of whipped cream on this hell cake) I want someone to fucking ask me directly to do something especially if its something shitty a superior can ask of me because Im the scum of the earth, ex temp, rocking the reception desk and I could be power washing their deck if they wanted me to. Im so embarrassed, I have no pride left, I have no man to make these work events where they talk about their kids or their significant others less of a you dont belong here experience. I have no one I can talk to. I cant afford therapy and if I ask my parents to pay theyll shame me and start acting like Im some sort of socially defective leper. Ive had so much casual sex I am incapable of real vulnerability. I think back to a relationship a year ago where I had small indicators of being vulnerable and physically develop symptoms and shame thinking about anything I said. Seriously, gagging on the bus thinking about this shit from a year ago, I have a ton of friends, good friends, but no one I can lay this on. They need me to be the functional one with the good apartment and the solutions and the career and the hope. No one has any value to add to any conversation of solving my problems. Is anything ever going to get better? From the middle school bullying to the family problems to the sexual assaults to the drugs to the career failure to my failure to create a relationship that has other value than sex and witty banter I just dont know. Do we all just live with this stupid blind hope that things will get better when they wont? Are we all living just to save our families and friends from the pain of losing us? Are we supposed to be this selfless doing bullshit for society but utterly miserable for the next 50 years. Idk, it could just be that theres something intrinsically wrong with me that precludes me from being comforted and achieving any goals. Maybe Im too fat or my hair is bad or Im ugly or my personality is flawed and Im just destined to take this hit until I finally get the fucking point. Anyone care to attempt to talk me off the ledge? Probably not. This is probably a pretty shitty cry for help too. Like wah another sad white girl with a job complaining because shes unattractive and unpleasant when there are kids starving in Africa right now. God Im pathetic. Posting mostly to shame myself for allowing this out of the gin and klonopin closet. Posting so maybe some 4chan trolls will invite me to speak with them about what being completely hopeless and useless to society is like so I can verify thats whats up here. Maybe a small part of me that still has hope is posting so that I can make it and be something of value someday. Not sure. Right now I just kind of want to stop breathing and there to be no consequences or cleanup for anyone I love."
119,vulnerability,depression,How do I know if I'm in depression?,1,dglsti,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dglsti/how_do_i_know_if_im_in_depression/,2019-10-12 08:44:45,"Okay guys, I don't know how to put this. When I think to myself, I don't believe that I'm depressed as an illness. But recently, and by that I mean since about 2015, I've been going through a lot. That includes losing my father, which had the biggest effect on me, losing my 17 years old cat, struggling with financial problems, dispute within family etc. To give some more context, first of all, when he was alive, I never thought that I would miss my father so much. But damn, I miss him sooo much. And I live in such a society that I don't trust people to open up to them as they will see it as a vulnerability. But when I'm all alone, the feelings haunt me. I live alone, so that's most of the time. My cat and I had a really strong bond. I adopted her when I was 9 and she passed in February 2018. I miss her too. I see financial problems as something that I shouldn't care much about because it somehow gets solved. I do have a job that pays the average in my country. I'm a teacher. And psychological burdens of being a teacher are exhausting at times, mentally. Like sometimes I can't hold my anger and say a mean word to a kid and think about it for the whole night. And one of the biggest problems is my friends. I never feel as a part of the group. Most of my friends are older than me and I think that's what gives them the courage to belittle me at times. I can defend myself but they will ""jokingly"" say most of things and if you get annoyed with that, they will say it's ""childish"" or ""you can't take a joke"". There's more into that and I think the main cause for me to think I'm depressed is my friends. I don't have a psychologically supportive group. I don't even know if this is the right subreddit to share about these but sometimes we just need some positive words even if they are strangers on the internet. Please give me some advices. I can tell more if you want to know more about it."

I also [published this on my blog](URL /// **""Talk about depressing""** /// There are people you will encounter at some point in your life, including your own friends and family members, who are struggling every day with a condition that is well-known but frequently misunderstood: depression. Major depressive disorder is a lonely condition. People who struggle with it typically feel that they are fighting a battle for their life all by themselves. Depression also often causes a self-imposed isolation and unfortunately, mainstream attitudes towards the condition makes it difficult for sufferers to reach out to friends, family members, and colleagues for fear of rejection or stigma. No one should have to die alone. Stopping the stigma towards depression and suicidal ideation will help save lives. Think about this: If someone you knew and loved came to you this very moment telling you that they had a plan  and a will  to end their life, how would you react? What would you say? Is this something youve ever thought about before? Its an important thing to consider. Despite what advertisement campaigns for anti-depressants depict, depression is not just sadness. Its not just an emotion and its not a cloud. Its also not a choice. Clinical depression is a real mental illness that affects peoples ability to thrive in their life and career and build meaningful, long-lasting relationships. The way we talk about major depression and other mood disorders has an effect on peoples ability to cope with their condition and the way they are perceived by the people they love and work with. Here are a few common tropes that Ive heard over the years and my suggestion for a better response: that sucks = Im sorry man up = Im here for you hide the crazy = it takes all types wherever you go, there you are = we all take different paths they couldnt hack it = they didnt get the help they needed When someone does ultimately end their life, its a loss for everyone in their community. The theme of someone not being able to deal with it or suggesting that someone took the easy way out is a cruel reaction based in social Darwinistic thought in which only the strong survive. This way of thinking is to suggest that the person who was lost didnt deserve love and didnt deserve dignity in life or death. Its simply a way of thinking that devalues life. It also suggests that displaying vulnerability and suffering from depression is a sign of weakness. Were all trying to make sense of the world and our place in it. For some, its much harder than others. Theres also the theme of depression being contagious. It may be unfair to expect too much of any one person or friend when going through an episode, but people who rebuff or put down those who are struggling are only further emboldens the stigma of the condition and those who open up about their experience with it. Why cant you just be normal? This is something sufferers probably ask themselves frequently. Its not easy thing to deal with, and getting older and taking on more responsibilities and higher stakes only makes it that much worse. The trauma of being pushed away by friends, being fired from a job, or struggling to find a partner also becomes increasingly more difficult to bear and increasingly more internalized. We ask men to be more open about their emotional state, but turn them away when they are. Theres more we can do for sufferers than point them to the suicide prevention hotline. By simply changing the way we think and talk about depression, theres a good chance that we can collectively put an end towards the stigma and allow people to seek the help they need. In fact, if we really do value human life, its necessary that do so."

However I did some thinking last night, and I absolutely did not accomplish anything this year, therefore I do not deserve any good celebrations, or in general good things to happen. I grew up in a home with a bipolar step father and depressed mother. Growing up this duo was absolute hell. Ever since I graduated high school I've tried to leave twice, both times did not work out. I was supposed to transfer to a university two years ago. The first time was a no go because of money. Then, the second time was supposed to be this fall but it did not work because I failed at moving out of state. Came back to my parents house within a month because the plan fell through. Since that failure I've gone into nasty credit debt, and along the way my original birth certificate, and social security card went missing. So it's been real hell recovering those docs in order to find a job. Then one summer day I get a text from my mom telling me she's kicking me out. Granted I did my part in helping pay rent, brought groceries, did daily chores, and took care of my little 9 year old sister. It's been about two months that I'm staying over at friend's house with her family. I'm very grateful for them, but feel like an absolute burden. I've lost a few great friends along this year because I've ghosted, or treated some of them really bad by telling them to stop caring for me, or letting out hurtful bottled emotions to them. Overall I've been a real bitch. Don't even get me started on my love life. I have unrequited love for someone who left me in the spring because of my behavior. I knew him for 3 yrs, he was my first everything, and that's my fault for not setting up boundaries. With the intimacy and emotional vulnerability I fell really hard for him , and he fled out of my life because I wasn't in a good mental state. I miss him so much and would do anything to even hear a hello from him. Fuck, I sound like a real victim rn but everything unfortunate that has happened to me is solemnly my fault. And I have learned my lesson through these life experiences. I've apologized to those good friends, but things won't ever be the same because what has been said cannot be unsaid. And I'm currently on a job hunt since the first birth certificate came in the mail not too long ago, but it just seems impossible to find a good paying part time job that pays for an apartment, used car, and will work with my school schedule for the Spring. I'm a first generation student, and I did not expect for this shit to be this hard. I have goals of getting a PhD after my undergrad , but that all just sounds too wild at the moment. I've been quite suicidal since this summer, and death is sounding real peachy everyday. I've never been diagnosed with depression because my Hispanic family has told me to just pray and it'll be fine. Well I'm not fine, and this goddamn mental fog gets the best of me. I'm hoping in the spring if all goes well to finally talk with a university counselor for the first time in letting all of this 23 years of mental baggage build up to be torn open for healment. TLDR; My mental/emotional health isn't feeling good at all and I keep beating myself up to the dirt and don't want anything good to happen to me, especially on my birthday. I haven't accomplished anything, and I just keep feeling like a burden to the world. I've ruined so many good opportunities and friendships with genuinely good people. I don't deserve any blessings or goodness. I deserve to suffer and feel the pain of my careless actions. I want to die."

The only time I feel like I can relax and unwind is when I think about how I would kill myself. I wouldnt do that, I have too many people close to me that I dont want to hurt, but the thought is soothing. I want to move forward with my life, but I feel like this will always hold me back. I know if anyone comments, they will say to talk to a therapist and or get medication, but I dont see myself doing that. The only trait I got from my dad is his fragile masculinity and inability to admit vulnerability or weakness. Hopefully I can sleep tonight.

During this time I got exposed to /r/breadtube and more leftist ways of thinking, and quite rapidly went from a socially conscious progressive, to identifying as an anarchist far from the main stream. I then saw a video talking about how the alt-right radicalises people and part of it was covering how they can target depressed people searching for indentity, meaning and answers; things that extremist views can provide. It kinda clicked that maybe I had been a victim of that vulnerability, although in a more positive (I like to think) direction of course, and that maybe it is something we should try to be aware of in ourselves. Have any of you noticed your views on anything getting wildly more extreme during the worst times? How has it affected you?"

It's a response of how bad I want to live. When you can feel your heart thumping, you get more afraid of it stopping. Paired with insecurity, the faster it beats the more aware you become. Those with health anxiety know what I mean. Insecurity. You're self conscious. Conscious of what reality is. Realizing you're all alone. In a purgatory where people live in their own realities. Their own Worlds. They see what they want to see. They hear what they want to hear. It's *that* shallow. All while we we're taught to get excited for becoming someone. With society as my teacher, it held my hand towards becoming someone. I was bullied. I was shamed. I wasn't enough. Society made me uncomfortable so I let loose of the hand. But when I let loose of that hand I realized I was *""someone""* all along and that I had no ""someone"" to turn into. When I realized I was someone, I realized how alone I really am. I looked left and right but there was no one around. It was only because I was someone, that I became aware of my mortality. It was because of my mortality, that I became aware of my vulnerability. Only when I attained, was I afraid to let go what I never had before. At some points I became so desperate for a way that I thought letting go was the only one out. I refused. So what then? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ You look around you and people become like dreams. Worlds of their own floating in their own sense of reality. They care and love because in their World, they're doing what they think of as good. They fear and hate because in their World, they also, are doing what they think of as good. We also, do what we do because we think of it as good. I feel bad because I think of it as good and feel good when I forget that in fact *I am*. It's why it feels so exciting to feel understood and welcomed. It's not because you're there for me, it's because I feel related to. Like my reality isn't that crazy. When I'm taken seriously, when I'm cared for, that's when I forget. Ironic isn't it? **Only when the genuine me feels seen, I forget to see myself. And how can I be self-conscious when there's nothing to be conscious of?** Though people don't experience your reality. Your reality is yours. You're the only one who hears your music. When you show care and dance people who never learned to listen will outcast you. You won't feel seen. You will be self-conscious. You will become unmotivated. You will become complacent from life. You will become depressed. If Heaven is on Earth, then so is Hell. Depression is Hell. Those who don't learn to dance in Hell, can never wish to ever be in Paradise. And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music. Go on and dance. Stand up and feel how your body wants to move. Don't think. Dance; Take care."

I invested money, time, and emotion into this. This girl has boxed herself in and completely forgot of how she felt towards me. It was as if we had never dated, she now views me as someone horrid and terrible (devalued), whereas five days ago, she viewed me as amazing and wanted a relationship (idealised). Something happened between now and Monday/Tuesday. I must have said something that threatened her fragile and brittle sense of self. Whether that be insecurity, rejection, abandonment, or vulnerability issues I do not know. What shocks me the most is her lack of awareness - she wasnt even aware that she was placing a gap between me and her. It honestly went from her telling me how much she liked me, sleeping with me, and then a week later nothing. Literally a switch flipped and now I am inherently bad. I hate the nature of this disorder, when she was her normal self things were amazing. Also, why did this happen to me, none of her ex-boyfriends were dumped quickly, however on two occasions this has happened to me with the same girl - am I special in someway? I did send her a long message this morning outlining a few patterns of behaviour and how I felt, as well as me not wishing to be friends anymore. She responded by asking if I would like to meet. I followed up by saying I am uninterested in meeting up face-to-face but wouldnt mind calling. She opened the message and didnt respond. I feel awful now."

Ups and downs and just struggling with my mind. I immersed myself in poetry writing and connecting with other people online, but in the real world I was alone. After I log off for the night, I am alone, but if I stayed up all night talking to people, then I'm fine. Eventually all that stopped when I chose to get off medication. I went from do-nothing depression to functional/smiling depression. I went back to school, found a job, got my own place, moved to a different state after graduation, thinking that depression would finally leave me. It never did. It always stuck around, reared it's ugly head into my life when it found a vulnerability (sad day, small mistakes, etc.). I try new things, try to go out, trying then became nothing, working and eating became scripted on autopilot. Played a lot of MMOs during that time to get some of those happy feelings back. In my 30s now, I went to another country, found the woman of my dreams, thought that depression would disappear finally since I found love. No. It came back, it's dragging my wife down too. I now have a new emotion, guilt and low-self worth. Guilty that I'm hurting people I love, guilty because I can't snap out of it, guilty that I cannot let my past go, and guilty because I let depression overtake me time and time again. Low self worth led to suicidal thoughts and two attempts within the last year, but hey, being functional and still on autopilot, and getting myself a decent job helps somewhat. So it's not all bad, am I a fraud? Am I just overly sensitive to things? Is this part of my personality? Whatever it is, I fucking hate it, I fucking hate this life....oh no I'm scaring my wife, she thinks I'm going crazy and mental. She'll ask me on my good day if I'm normal again. How I feel inside? I'm tired of life. I'm 35, 5 more years I'll be in my 40s. I'm physically sore when I get up, but I'm not allowed to complain. My support systems tell me that complaining is for bitches. Men aren't bitches, we hunker down and we weather it out. I guess I am a bitch. My support systems are built on tough love. Baby Boomer love. Where the depression is my choice and that I chose to have it. What they don't know is that it's my choice to not continue this life. I have the means to end it. My brain also tells me there is hope. My depression tells me there is no hope, but I'll make you tired to where you can't die. I visit these subreddits, I've had other depressed persons tell me that my depression isn't real because it doesn't follow the same traits as others. I feel guilty again and remind myself that I am alone in this world even if the entire world is depressed. I cannot be in that support system of like-minded people. When both Internet and real life tell you that your depression isn't real and that it's made up in your mind to garner attention, that hurts. Makes me shut down everything emotionally, but I still work, eat, and take care of my home, everything is scripted, everything on autopilot, and now I'm a fake human being. Thank you world."

New to this sub. I graduated college in April and since them have spiraled back into a bit of a depression, not knowing what to do with my life. I've identified my problem behaviors and thought up things to replace them with that would make me happier in the long run. But I still cannot seem to kick my bad habits. It's strange, because I'm consciously aware that I shouldn't be doing whatever it is while I'm doing it. I have a plan. I know I cant get over this alone. But I also dont feel comfortable reaching out to friends or family; I dont like revealing my vulnerability to those who are close to me. And yeah I understand that isnt healthy either, but that's a discussion for another time. I would like to find somebody who is currently going through something similar to do, well, let's call it an experiment. If anyone reading this thinks that this may be something worth trying, here's what I would like to do. First off, no names, no pictures, no gender. Completely anonymous. I've been keeping a journal of my thoughts and I would like who ever decides to do this, if anyone, to do the same. The general idea is to tall to each other about what we're dealing with day to day and bounce ideas off each other. It's nice to have someone other than yourself to analyze your thoughts. But another huge part of it would be to plan out things we want to get done each day, things that are productive and could replace unhealthy problem/coping behaviors, and hold each other to those things. As I touched on I know what I should to to improve but making myself do it is extremely difficult. I need someone who can remind and encourage me to do these things so that I actually stick to my own word. And I believe a mutual relationship like that, where I in turn remind and encourage someone to gold true to what they want to get done to improve, could be extremely beneficial. If anyone wants more information, please direct message me. I can't guarentee that this will cure either of us, but it's something I really want to try. After all, it's making an effort to get better, which cant hurt."

I feel so useless and pointless and don't know where to go with my life anymore. When my father started showing signs of dementia, I was a junior in high school. The reality of the situation didnt hit me until freshman year in college. At the same time, my grandfather in India was ill, and my mother spent most of her time outside the country. In terms of paying tuition, I was set. When it came to living expenses and emotional support, I had no one. I didnt think it was physically possible for the human body to shut down. I didnt know that a human was capable of crying for hours without calming down. I was surprised that I could lie in bed for hours, wide awake, without having any will to move. After conversations with my therapist at the time, I speculated that my growing isolation was my fault. I didnt reach out to people. I decided to change that. I reached out to acquaintances, people I just met, everyone. Many of them took advantage of my emotional vulnerability. And one night, someone took advantage of me physically. My school was under Title IX investigation. Our disabilities services was inefficient and unhelpful. Professors and classes were known to give students zeroes on exams, even in the event of an ER visit. I would have no institutional support. In the process, mutual friends either cut me off or refused to stand up for me. All my relationships became strained, as individuals who claimed to support me were suddenly too busy to help. The one thing folks dont tell you about sexual violence is that the event itself isnt the most traumatizing part--its the aftermath: the victim-blaming, the shame, everything. I was traumatized for years. I can count on one hand the number of people who stood by me in undergrad. My brain shut down. I skipped classes out of fear that *he* would be there. I avoided libraries out of fear of running into *him* I chose isolated spots just to cry myself to calm. Its astonishing how much time one can spend in front of a book only to absorb nothing when the mind is repeating a bad memory. I was surprised that I didnt fail out of school. I couldnt tell my parents. But when they asked me why I wasnt applying for medical school straight out of undergrad, I could only open my mouth and say nothing. I could not say that sexual violence had resulted in multiple Cs on my transcript. I said I needed some time. But thats when I started to fall apart bit by bit. I took pills hoping to go to sleep and never wake up. I shaved so heavily into my skin I drew blood. I sent rants to my friends, pleading for an escape. None of what I did worked. I knew I had to pursue more education if I wished to go to medical school. A masters degree posed more financial use over a post baccalaureate program. I went to graduate school, got straight As, and applied again. But every single time I applied, every time I was denied an application due to my academic record, every time I was asked why I had academic difficulties only to burst into tears...I remembered that night and what followed. While I can work on healing, medical schools will never forgive me for what happened. And now, I can't either."

Anyways since the beginning of my A-Levels I keep feeling this emptiness in my life. When I was in high school I had a very tight group of friends and was very friendly with everyone in my high school, everything just felt fine. But now we are all at different colleges, and the few friends who are with me in my sixth form almost feel like we are forcing a friendship that was once really good but now we really don't have a genuine connection. I see them thriving in school, talking to new people, making new friends and I feel as if I can't socialise with anyone anymore than the surface level. I find myself bored with the conversation and finding everything futile, yet I envy those who can talk to anyone and anyone wants to talk to them. I always self criticise and believe no one wants to talk to me, or if someone does it is not about me it is about my work or friends. I feel like I don't belong in my school, but I don't see my self fitting anywhere either. I look at myself as an outsider, an observer watching people work forward in their life. An extra in their life, an extra in my own life. I don't see myself anywhere, I don't see a future or goal in my own life. I just want to find a meaning in my empty, empty life. I want to talk to new people but these people in my very small sixth form is very hard to talk too as we already have our groups formed and we all knew each other since we were twelve and so if we wanted be friends by now we already could have been. I think another reason is that everyone has romance in their life, someone likes them or they like someone or they are dating. Me on the other hand has never been liked and I desperately want to love someone but there isn't anyone to love. Every time I think someone is cute they always like someone else, I just feel like I am not even a person to be considered to be loved. I just feel like an empty, passionless piece of bones wandering through life. I want to stop feeling so empty but I don't know how.. It just feels like my life is moving forward but spiritually I have not grown up. Thank you for anyone who reads this, for making me feel like I have a voice that can be heard."

Ive been struggling with a plethora of personal issues but a girl I got really close to made things incredible. I forgot about all my issues and I was happy. But I didnt make any moves. I fucked it up and missed so many opportunities. I just thought things would happen, until they didnt. We hooked up a couple of times. It wasnt just sloppy- it was intimate and pretty incredible. Wed hold each other after. I fell hard for her but I was too worried to tell her how I felt for risk of losing her. She was fairly fresh out of a messy breakup so I guess I was worried she just saw me as a fwb. We would tell each other how much we mean to one another and yet I still didnt think she cared for me. Im so fucking stupid. We probably had a good 5 months where we talked everyday, called at night and hung out on the weekends, and yet I was too naive to think she was into me like that. Slowly though she started to distance herself- right at the peak of this relationship. I re-read all our texts last week after she told me shes starting to fall for someone else, and yeah- that was a bad idea. How did I genuinely think she wasnt into it? How could I do this? I could almost sense her frustration through my screen as I read these old messages where I seemingly gave her nothing. I feel so stupid now looking back as it was obvious she sent so many signals. I guess if anything Ive learnt what a lack of communication can do. I was so scared to be vulnerable again, now I feel more vulnerable than before. Her friends told me she was hurt that I didnt seem into it, so she had to move on and distance herself. It fucking hurts man. Knowing that she felt the exact same way as I feel right now- but she was able to move on, or try to. Fuck it hurts. I cant get out of bed, cant get her out of my mind and my self hatred and pity wont go away. All these problems that I thought had disappeared have come right back. I had an anxiety attack after reminiscing all the intimate moments that I missed. I know people say you shouldnt rely on others for happiness, but my god she was like no one else. She made me a better person. Things were going to be so good with her. And I lost her because I was scared of my vulnerability. Things were really looking up for the first time since, well, forever- but now Im dreading the months ahead where every second Im reminded of how things couldve been. I cant be alone with my thoughts so Ive been fucked up on oxys and alcohol. I dont know how to cope. Fuck self pity. Fuck regret. Its the worst feeling imaginable. Sorry for the vent but I had to get that out, I doubt anyone cares but it felt good to type this out. Thanks"

It's so easy for girls to find a better guy when you match with 98% of your Tinder swipes. Then I lie in bed alone and just imagine what it's like if she were there. The sensation of her skin touching mine, the comfort of not being alone, readily available and welcomed conversation, sex. Natural impulses follow and I might watch porn, which sometimes makes me want to cry. It's like sitting in a homeless shelter watching Jeff Bezos do a house tour."

My ""friends"" ask money and extreme favors from me and I feel like that is the only reason they keep the relation alive/burning. I have helped people financially and with many other things before, they spread it everywhere and that's the only reason people are interested on me. They think I am dumb, stupid, naive girl but I am not. I am too kind, I always feel like they came to me because they have no one else to go to, most people around me are very strict, stern and never shows any sign of weakness or vulnerability, I get made fun of and they call me a moron for believing their lies.

I will be turning 30 very soon and I still do not have any job even though I have a degree on MBA, my Professor actually kind of broke my spirit by saying I cannot have any promising job without work experience and its going to be extremely difficult. How can I gain experience if no one is willing to give me the chance to gain one? I am a good student and have been raised by extreme strict parents who never let me socialize or hang out with friends much, they controlled every aspects of my life, starting from what subject I should chose to study? who should I marry etc they went out to destroy every person I became close to and they put me through extreme emotional pressure and always kept me confided in my room to study constantly. If I told anyone how I felt lonely and miserable I would get into serious trouble with them who would call me names and verbally abuse me. I have been harassed by men before and my parents almost did nothing to protect me, instead blackmailed me back stating if they do anything they will get sued etc. They used to very abusive to me physically and emotionally on my entire teens years and early twenties and I have been sexually abused by a family member who still goes on with their life peacefully and happily. I left home years ago and came 8000 miles away to meet someone I met online. I am married to him and he changed after a few years and blocks me off emotionally, I cannot even tell him anything because he takes advantage of my insecurities and things that shakes me to the core. No he does not abuse me physically but he does mentally and puts me down way more than a husband should even though I try my best and have fault myself and I am the type of person who eats herself alive with her own thoughts especially if I hurt or misbehave with someone and I apologize constantly. Because of all these I do not even wish to have kids because I feel like that's the best thing I can give them-----never be born on this sick, twisted planet full of hypocrites and be like me. I am heartbroken because I always wanted kids and loving family and warmth of home sweet home but some people took away my childhood and dreams and wishes forever. I am a coward who fluctuates between whether I should end my life or not. I hate to admit that I do not have the courage to end it but living becomes unbearable some days and tonight is one of those night. I wish I could get help but I do not have health insurance and everyone around me tells me that psychologists are rubbish. I did went to one once but he was super mean and rude to all patients and I stopped going. My experience was horrible and they ask sooooooooooooooooo many questions it physically hurts my face because of all that talking. Lastly, I apologize for the long post and I am sorry if you have been reading about how pathetic and a loser I am up till here.

I'd rather maintain an aloof and if pushed defensive demeanor to anyone who wants to ask me if I'm okay and what's wrong. I know it's not supposed to be this uncomfortable and personally off-putting to have even the smallest bit if emotional vulnerability but whatever. Being a socially fluent person is just a skill I really despise I guess. I just don't want to have to go through all this fucking effort. I swear to god, this whole understanding social Dynamics and even having to think for a second about what I have to say or should say just pisses me off. I don't want to have to TRY to connect to people and if I'm going to feel uncomfortable doing it than fuck it and fuck life. It's not worth it and I don't WANT to be better at it. I don't want to have to deal with this bullshit. Just leave me the fuck alone when I'm in the house and if you notice me doing something like sitting in a bath for more than two hours don't bring it up as a concerned party because I am not interested in letting you in or even trying to think for a second about how I could effectively communicate anything to you. I hate emotions. I hate emotional connection and I despise other people because everything you say and how you say it is supposed to convey emotion to them. FUCK emotion. I don't want to communicate emotions. I don't want to think for a second about how what I'm going to say to you will make you feel, as long as it isn't abjectly rude. Hell, I don't care if you do think I'm being somehow rude. Yes, I will be Curt and straight to the point with you and no I'm not going to ask about you or get into any kind of discussion about literally anything because that's just more brainpower attributed to a skill that I despise and which makes me resentful if the fact that I exist at all.

I'm not interested in accumulating information about anything or studying anything or applying what I've forced myself to learn in the real world. I just wish everyone was gone. Maybe I would go crazy, I don't know. All I know is I HATE vulnerability, and I hate people for the fact that what you say to them and the way you say it has any impact on them at all. I don't want to communicate. I don't want to share ideas or feelings, and I sure as shit am not going to share with anyone an emotional moment. I hate people in general, just for the fact that they exist and I am supposed to meaningfully interact with them. I don't want to let go of the hate. Hate is all I have. Fuck love and fuck happiness and fuck other people and fuck people for how they would react to being told that. I don't want to let you in. I'm not going to share even one significant emotional moment with anyone. I hate emotions. I hate happiness. I don't care how simple the interaction. No, I don't like smiling at you. No, I don't like listening to what you have to say. No, I don't want you to listen to me. No, I don't want to share an iota of a ""pleasant moment"" with anyone. No, I don't want to connect to anyone based on negative feelings. No, I don't enjoy interacting with or better understanding people.

I'm not willing to go through another year or more of battling it and I have only made marginal progress in my social skills anyways so fuck it all, fuck practicing, fuck studying, just give me a fucking gun already. In not willing to put in this much work in ANY sense. Fuck doing this shit to try to get better everyday and honestly fuck trying to actually UNDERSTAND socializing. I'm not willing to look back and see what went right and what went wrong and all that and I can't do that shit anyways because I'm either too stupid or too anxious or both but either way I'm far from interested in trying to remedy either situation. I just fucking hate this shit and I'm tired if trying to come around and actually love people. I'm too used to just hating everyone, I can't humble myself to remedy the problem. Guess I'm just to broken to admit my faults. I only feel secure around people by feeling like I'm better than them, that there is a reason for me to feel like I am better. I can only find things about people that I hate, but never what I love, because I don't really love anything about people, and to try to logically convince myself why I should value them or what I should like about them is simply too far a change from who I have become fundamentally.

In interstitial periods we talked on the phone, skyped, and frequently texted. In the process we developed a bond. However, she's clinically VERY unstable, very erratic in her moods. One of the many problems I have - and I know this, and will own it - is that I'm drawn to broken women. I have a nurturing quality that has defined many of my relationships, and I gravitate to extreme vulnerability. This lady - let's call her Erica - has a LOT of problems. One is her extreme sensitivity to everything; I once compared dating her to walking through a field of mines and tripwires, and take one wrong step, she blows up. As a result, we fought a lot in the beginning, though in time our ability to get along improved considerably - as we ""learned"" each other. The conflicts diminished, our communication improved immeasurably, as did our ability to resolve conflicts. We made active plans for me to move out there, and I was set to move October 1, and spent much of the past year building job/networking contacts in that city. I was supposed to move in with this lady and her mom, while I found an apartment - and she was to come out and move with me, across the country. Until we weren't. About a month ago, she started getting cagey, and completely backed out. First it was ""why don't you just live here for a while,"" then it was ""for a month, if you need to,"" then it was ""I don't want the responsibility of this, find your own place."" Then the breakup conversations started, and she began initiating. Then she totally broke it off. And tonight, she turned MEAN. And when I say mean, I mean bitch on wheels, cruel, no holds barred, fuck you, get away from me, I never want any goddamn thing to do with you, I tried to tell you this, I'm NOT interested in being your friend, goodbye for life. Obviously, I should be grateful on about a thousand levels. I hung up pissed. I actually said to her at one point, ""I have zero interest in being with someone, or being friends with someone, who doesn't want to be with me."" Tonight I saw a side of her I hadn't seen - she was sadistic and nasty. Actually said to me, ""I don't give a damn if you still move here, my exes live here, and I never have to see or talk to them either."" And I thought, ""Lady, you must have Clorox bleach in your veins."" I felt relieved, like I'd just dodged a massive bullet. Thing is, I'm still somewhat sad though. This is someone I let into my heart, and into my life, and to whom I gave my trust. Her pattern in the past seems to be like a borderline person: push-pull-push-pull-push-pull (and she may actually have BPD). So part of me suspects she might actually come around again. But of course there's no way in hell I would take her back. It just feels like there is a massive hole in my life now. And my future is suddenly up in the air - I have contacts in her city, and really dig her city, but is it foolhardy to move somewhere, where I don't yet have a job and don't know anyone? I do hate the U.S. state in which I live."
139,vulnerability,depression,"Shame, Vulnerability, and ""I am bad.""",9,cs3f1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cs3f1z/shame_vulnerability_and_i_am_bad/,2019-08-19 02:32:58,"Yesterday I watched a Ted Talk on vulnerability and the consequent video on shame by the same speaker. She studied shame for years and discovered that the fundamental belief that ""I am bad"" is what fuels it in difference to guilt which is founded by ""I did something bad"". Shame often times becomes a part of our central identity. It motivates our behavior, changes our feelings, and can deeply impact how we interact with others. Sometimes the ""I am bad"" narrative develops at home and is rooted by our own parents, a frustratingly common occurrence that is unnaturally normal. In relation to myself and my own self-taught therapy, for better or worse, God help us all, I learned the ""I am bad"" narrative from my parents. My parents taught me that I was inherently bad and undeserving. To this day my mother reinforces the ""I am bad"" narrative in our everyday interactions. This belief that I am bad is so ever present that when other people treat me like sh\*t I actually believe them. When someone tells me I'm stupid, my reaction is ""I agree with you. I AM stupid."". I came to the obvious conclusion that it's a symptom of the ""I am bad"" narrative. Shame is a symptom of depression and trauma that we're all used to hearing but don't talk about as much. Recently I have been going through a harder time than usual and figured that I have clearly not sorted through these issues, I had just been ignoring them. It made me want to ask this particular group of people, why are we ignoring this shame we live in when it is such a huge source of our problems? If shame is a common issue than why are we using it as a weapon against one another? I feel constantly humiliated by people using my shame against me to hurt me. Sometimes when people see a weakness they exploit it. People in my life have been exploiting my shame as a weakness of mine and have been using it to hurt me. It's like we're all walking around with an open wound and stabbing each other in it, but nobody is talking about it. If shame is the key to vulnerability then why are we using it to kill each other instead of help each other connect as human beings?"

I am new here, but I have been through some serious shit. I decided to give myself permission to be me. And create me. And be that. In doing so, I wrote music about my journey over the last year. Upon sharing my music, I noticed people began to open up about their own struggles and journey. It was an amazing sensation. Overtime, I decided I wanted to share my music. Not because I want the attention, but so I could help show and also create a safe place to express. It is ok to not be ok and it is ok to be vulnerable. I wanted to share with the hopes it reaches some of you to remind you, that you are not alone. And I don't know if anyone will respond, but I will be here, as best I can be. &amp;#x200B; please check it out, and if it does anything for you, pass it on. No need to come back and tell me about it. Show the world it's ok to be vulnerable. &amp;#x200B; forthee.bandcamp.com"

Every word, space, kiss or no kiss, hug or no hug. Then the pain on top of actual physical pain. The standing, staring, mumbling, numbing yet excruciating fucking pain of it all. She loves deeply and hard. She cries intensely and often. She searches for clarity that never comes. She hurts, she hurts, she hurts. She wants more from people than they can ever give her. Her vulnerability thick like smog, hanging around her. She wants to be touched and held. She wants to feel something that doesnt confuse her. When she does, she wants the feeling of excitement and warmth to engulf her and never leave. Drugs, sex, self harm, all windows through which to temporarily breath. To slow the ragged breathing and racing heart. Today the pain is worse. It is clawing at her from the inside. She is exhausted as the silent tears fall. She is a joker, a clown, a person uniformly thought of as a beacon of positivity. If only they knew, she thinks, that sometimes the biggest smiles hide the biggest pain. She stopped talking to the other guy - the online guy. She deleted her profiles, she disappeared completely. She couldnt trust herself not to want to be wanted. She took a bath and lay there, in too shallow, lukewarm water, and she just stared. There were thoughts but not formed ones. There were so many contradictions, criss crossing. She takes baths often so she can cry alone and not take others down with her. She doesnt know why it has to be this way. She doesnt want to hurt anymore. She submerges her ears and listens to the strange underwater sounds and she cries. When someone calls her by her name, Lucy, it takes a nano second or two before she can connect it to herself. She rarely knows what the feeling she has is, or why she has it. It is a constant preoccupation. Searching her face in the mirror for traces of herself, who she is really. Never at peace. An end without an end. She had long since learned to keep things to herself and her family and friends preferred it that way. She didnt want to cause trouble. Now that buried pain has surfaced as physical pain. Tight knots in her body. A neck that creaks and aches. She struggles with the idea that this is forever. That this is her. Lucy. That these waves will always be crashing, relentlessly battering her, washing her away. That she will never know stability. That she will always hurt and one day, sure as she is breathing now, she will drown."

I no longer enjoy hearing the sound of my name, or taking photos throughout the day, or listening to my favourite melodies because I'm reminded of him. I no longer have the courage to seek for comfort anymore, nor will I ever allow myself to show this amount of vulnerability again. I've come to realize that I would always feel more for others than they would for me, and that it's time to stop expecting a similar attraction in return. I opened my heart up for the first time, and I'm grateful that I finally felt how it's like to feel cared for and understood.

What happened? That's a question i can't stop asking. Somewhere down the road, i lost something very important and didn't even know it. Is it my fire? My will to live? My determination? My optimism? I have no answers. Maybe all of them. Then i looked inside myself once more, with a faint hope something remained, that somehow it magically survived all this time in that place... But i didn't find what i was looking for. Instead... I found you. Just you, standing there in the dark, with a grin that is both devious and sickening. Sometimes it is just a cold, emotionless smile. I could feel that you were trying to make it look friendly and genuine, but i did not pay much attention to it, i was desperate and with hindsight, i truly regret not doubting you more. Then you talked, and i answered, and before i know it, it was a ongoing conversation between me to myself. I enjoyed that accompany, but slowly i felt something changed. I was already falling before this, but then it got worse. I started spiraling down, suddenly and endlessly, without any idea how. But then i remembered. You... You...... . . . . 'But how?"" ""You are my friend..."" ""There's no way!"" I came back to you right after the realization, you were there, waiting. You greeted me with a warm smile, something i didn't think you could do. Usually, you enjoyed my company, but you seemed annoyed most of the time and from time to time you would start mocking me with bitter sarcasm, or start lashing out violently(for some reason a strange bubble would form around me and protect me when it happened). I didn't know why you hated me so much then, but that time i finally did. I knew why we got along so well. I knew why our emotions are always the exact opposite from one another. And most importantly, i know why you seemed so familiar... We complete each other. You're........me. He stopped smiling. In fact, he did more than that. His expression changed to that of a wounded animal, a crazed maniac. He glared at me with the purest hatred and rage, grinding his jaws and clenching his fists, seemingly really for a fight to the death. But just as quickly as it came, the expression disappeared, he returned to his normal calm and collected manner while i stared in shock. He took a sip of his coffee, turned away from me, walked off a short distance and asked with a sigh. ""So i take it you know the truth?"" ""Yeah"". I answered. ""Then let's cut to the chase. Now what?"". He growled, his voice seemingly breaking. ""I...uhh....i don't think i know anymore than you do. We are one, remember?"" I replied with great uncertainty. ""Hah. Great to be us, ain't it?"" ""Haha, i know right?"" I said while shoving him with full force. He didn't budge, though. Unphased, like most of the time. ""Watch it kid, i can knock you out without breaking a sweat."" he warned. I didn't like his arrogance, but he was right. He was double my size, a dark figure seemingly consuming all in his path. But then i wondered, if i am his opposite, then what am i, exactly? I closely examined my hands and body as if they were some sorta extraterrestrial objects. Suddenly i noticed something i never did before. Something that should be obvious and impossible to miss. Am i..... glowing? Wwwow.... This is awesome!!! Just out of curiosity, i formed a gun gesture and pointed it forward. Unexpectedly, two beams of light shoot out from my fingers(well maybe it is expected, now that i think about it) and one of said light beams hit my shadow self. He reacted violently and aggresively, transforming into a wolf-like creature and growled at me with deafening volume. I was scared out of my mind, needless to say, but fortu ately, he realized what he did and quickly turned back to his normal self. He stood there for awhile, hands hard-pressed against his knees, breathing heavily. Then he yelled at me with justiable anger. ""ARE.YOU.FUUCKING.KIDDING.ME?!!!"" I let out a meek and barely audible whisper.""Sorrryyyy....."" He sighed. Again. This one much heavier than the last. And then, silence. Just silence. ""I think... he is thinking?"" ""He does that a lot, anyway"" But something told me this time was different. That went on for awhile. Before i attempted to break that silence however, he cut me off. ""You know we are one. But do you know what we are? What we inevitably must do? The fate we can't run from?"". He asked while a frown formed across his lips. I said nothing, knowing i won't like what i'm about to hear He knew what my silence meant. He clears his throat and i shifted my focus in what he wanted to say. ""We are the opposite of one another, so that meant we are bound to fight each other. One of us will come out victorious, but the other wil, well........ i do not know, for it has not happened yet. We only know once the result of the clash is decided"". He stopped, and stared with an expecting look, apparently to see if i have any questions. I do, but strangely it was only one. ""Why must we fight? You're my friend..."". I almost choked here, for i realized what i might need to do to my dearest friend. I couldn't have that. ""There must be a way..."" ""There might be, but like i said, we don't know until it is finished"". He shrugged and sighed with a defeat look in his eyes. Shaking his head with eyes closed tight, he quickly regained focus and continued. ""Your question. Like you already figured out, we are one, yes? We complete each other, and together we make up something, but what, exactly?"" ""A mind?"" I instinctively said, without knowing how i know. ""Yes. To be more specific, our combinied version is the conscious, and us seperately is the sub-conscious, where the deepest, darkest as well as the most virtuous parts dwell."" He explained. ""Woooow. So there is another version of us? A combination of all our qualities?"" I enthusiastically enquired. ""Indeed"" He confirmed. ""But why don't i see him?"" I asked with great confusion. ""I wondered the same once, but the most likely answer is that we can only know in the aftermath of the battle."" ""How do you know so much? I thought you were just as clueless as i am?"" I became more confused. ""Ah. Well, it's quite simple. Opposites, remember? The more curious you are the more knowledgable i am. There are limits, of course, so that things work a certain way. You, for example, were created from our combined self's - let's call him Grey - recollection of his childhood when he was at his best - happy, cheerful and social. He, in turn, assossiated that period in time with his best qualities and visions of the person he wants to become, therefore creating you. I, on the other hand, is everything that he had become. A dark, lifeless shadow who sole purpose is to destroy, including and not limited to, himself. You might be wondering, then, how am i so calm and collected right now. Well, i am not a demon or a ghost, i became those things because that's how he sees himself. I am the manifestation of his darkest desires and thoughts, but also the amalgamation of all his negative emotions, like shame and regret, the parts that scream helplessness and vulnerability, covered up by all these other explosive, toxic emotions, as a defensive mechanism to keep me alive."" ""..."". ""I know it's a lot, but you need to take all of it in for you to even have the slightest chance at defeating me. I am not the light, you are. I can't purify myself, but you can. I am your dearest friend, but sadly, i am also your greatest enemy. The one you must put down at all cost, no matter what. Do you understand? This is the only way you can help Grey. To reach him. To give him the strength he needs to rise above the darkness and become what he was meant to be. You are the key."" ""I understand"" i uttered a quiet, but clear response. ""Good. One last advice"" he paused slightly, then proceed to finish his thought."" Just like how i have the light in me, you have darkness within yourself. Do not be afraid to use it. Fire against fire. The unknown is part of its - mine power. Learn it. Understand it. With that knowledge, you might even be able to overwhelm me completely, led alone defeating me. Go now, it is about time"". ""W-what???!"" What do you....mean?"" A cold feeling ran up my spine. ""You understand everything now. And because you are who you are, albeit helplessly optimistic, you will undoubtedly try to find a way to ""make peace"" with me. And again, being your opposite, i won't have that. I WILL FIGHT BACK! I WILL TRY AND KILL YOU IN HORRIBLE HORRIBLE WAYS AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!! YOUR NAIVE NATURE WILL BE THE DEATH OF YOU!!! YOU CAN'T STOP WHAT'S COMING CHILD, YOU CAN'T STOP IT!! YOU CAN'T STOP ME!! YOU WILL DIEEEEDJDIDDJDJDJDDJDKFKFKFFK########*******.........$*%&amp;$&amp;$&amp;$*$#*##*#*$$**$*$*$"". ""HAH HAH HAH "" He breathed heavily and frantically. ""IT'S HERE SOONER THAN I THOUGHT. I THOUGHT I COULD CONTAIN IT LONGER!"" He actually panicked, something i've never seen before, nor did i think could happen. He rushed forward, struggling to keep balance, grabbing my shoulders tightly."" IT'S TIME, KID. REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU. I WON'T BE ABLE TO BE THERE FOR YOU ANYMORE, BUT KNOW I WILL ALWAYS BE THERE WITH YOU. MAYBE WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN WHEN THIS IS ALL OVER, BUT UNTIL THEN, DO NOT SEE ME AS YOUR FRIEND, BUT AS THE GREATEST THREAT TO YOUR EXISTENCE THAT NEEDS TO BE TERMINATED MERCILESSLY. NOW RUN, RUN LIKE YOU'VE NOT RUN BEFORE, GATHER YOUR STRENGTH BECAUSE I WILL DEFINITELY BE GATHER ING MINE. I BELIEVE YOU CAN SAVE THE BOTH OF US, AND CONSEQUENTIALLY, HIM, TOO. GOODBYE, LITTLE LIGHT!"" he confided in me for the first, the last and the only time. A surge of power could be felt inside my being, i was filled with newfound hope, strength and determination. I was moved, and immensely empowered by his words. I ran up to him and hugged him tight, and he seemed really taken aback, maybe because of my disregard of danger, or maybe the fact he was touched i showed him such affection in his current state and who he was, although he knew full well that is what i was like, and that was who i am. ""I won't let you go. I won't let you die. I will find a way to bring you back, no matter what."" I surprised myself with how self-assured and determined i sounded. ""W-wellll, we c-can hope, can't we? And i know you will kid. Thank you for being there for me."" His voice weakened, gradually turning into whispers. ""You too, Shadow."" And with that, i ran. I think i saw a tear ran down his cheek. He never ceased to surprise me, for better or worse. I will surprise him too, this time. Definitely for the worse. Or better. I don't know, really. Hah... His dark figure faded away, became smaller and smaller and then eventually, i couldn't tell it apart from the all-encompassing darkness that surrounds this place. I heard something, though. A scream. A very familar one. With that same anger and hatred, pure as always. But that time, it didn't feel restrained, more like unleashed. Like a beast that's out of a cage. The kind of beast that can end it all. ........... ..................... ................................ I miss you already, my friend. But this place could use some more light. Funny, you thought i was the only light around. You didn't know you were one, too. P/S: I think a P/S is required, since this post is different from the usuals, as you can already tell? I'm pretty sure it doesn't violate any rules sooo i'm good, i think at least. Anyway, this is just my garbage imagination and overthinking exaggerating what probably is not that serious of a situation? I know many have it much worse than i do #edgydepression, but it's a piece of my mind i wanted to get out there, so if you bothered reading the story and then continued reading this unnecessarily long P/S for some reason, here's a virtual cookie and the award for the greatest time waster of all time, i mean seriously just imagine all the better things you could be spending your time on right now oh wait you're depressed oh no boo hoo okay okay imma shut up now bye."

Being able to love again little by little what I use to love. Shutting off those bad voices in my head. Choosing vulnerability and receiving a lot of support. I'm not completely fine.

I don't feel alive... It's not enough to say that I don't have interests... I don't even have the most basic motivation to accomplish tasks. I don't get the dopamine signal so everything feels so pointless and gray. It's been 6 years and I've been ruminating over a few stupid events for the past 3 years. Why did this happen? I was fine before this. Why can't I FEEL. I'd love to feel sadness or grief. All I ""feel"" is an infinite loop of self-punishment/error-correction/negative-conditioning mode, and an endless sea of doubt and cynicism.

When I've spent the last few years of my life pretty much alone. It sucks to see my youth run away. And now I'm in my mid 20's I feel like the young romance phase is already dead. Now everyone my age is way too serious about everything, and the vulnerability and careless fun is no more. Sometimes I thought I was trying too hard. So I relaxed. And still, nobody fell into my life like they did with everyone else. It's the most frustrating feeling. Everyone thinks I'm incapable of leading a 'normal life' when I tell them I haven't been in a lasting relationship in the last few years. There's literally nothing I can do but wait for the right person to come along. It's almost like it's a failure when I tell people. But I can't force people to like me....."

When someone does talk to me, I oftentimes struggle to think of a reply that isn't nodding or an ""mhmm"". I am unable to keep conversation going and interesting. I am too mortified to approach my classmates - I do want people to me as pitiful or desperate but I think that they already do. I barely, if ever, talk to my family members (sans my little sister). I can't remember the last time my parents apologized to anyone. I can't remember the last time they said ""I love you"" or ""I'm proud of you"" either to their children or each other. My uncle is a homophobe that thinks I'm a lesbian. I do not know any cousins, nor have I befriended any aunts or uncles. The friends that I have had before disregard me. I message the group chat and it takes them weeks to reply, if ever. I have stopped messaging in the group chat. The only person I really talk to is my little sister, but she has a friend group and life of her own. The only person that I truly felt comfortable around has disappeared off of the face of the Earth. Nobody even knows if she is dead or alive. I have no internet friends. I am too shy and afraid to join Discord chats or talk to people on the internet. Admittedly, I also have problems with intimacy and vulnerability. ""The mortifying ideal of being known"", as they say. I kind of blame my younger self. She spent her time playing Facebook games and looking up fanart rather than socializing.

I apologise if this is the wrong place to post about this, but I really need some advice. So, to set the scene - I have a colleague who is, and always has been, a very unpleasant person. She gossips about everyone, constantly tries to backstab, is full of paranoia and speculation about the future and spreads malicious rumours. Her political opinions are a bore to listen to as well, but she never lets up even when people tell her that we don't agree. ""Freedom of speech!"" Everything is always someone else's fault and she makes everything a massive problem, even if it's completely trivial. She can blow up at the slightest thing. She makes everyone in the office feel really down and on edge, and as a result no one really wants to talk to her unless they have to. She's getting worse as time goes on. We feel she is isolating herself. She said a while ago that she feels depressed, which was an unusual moment of weakness and vulnerability, and my heart went out to her. I've always been the friendly face in the office, and I try to include her in things where other people don't, and try to point out when her behaviour is inappropriate, but it's really hard as her actions and behaviour get me really down too to the point where I don't have the energy to even approach her, and sometimes can't even face going into work. There are times I really just don't know what to do. Management won't go near her with a bargepole as they are too scared of dealing with her properly - they won't discipline her for her seriously inappropriate and bullying behaviour (which has caused people to leave our department, many many times), they won't offer her help, they won't suspend her as these approaches have all been tried before and she just blows up in their face and always has an answer which usually involves tirades of taking them to court for one reason or another. Their advice is just to wait it out until she retires as they can't do anything more. Helpful. Everyone else in the office just cannot be bothered with her at all anymore, and this situation basically makes us feel that we all just want to leave as management won't do anything. It's a really awkward situation as I feel really bad that she feels that way, but her behaviour and way of talking to people is so inappropriate at times and it's really draining to everyone else. She cannot see fault and takes any criticism directly to heart and goes out of her way to make your life a misery i.e. she starts bullying behaviour, but it's always clever things that you can't prove. She also will not take on anyones suggestions of joining a club and making new friends outside of work, or even doing voluntary work. She doesn't like anything and has excuses for everything else. From what she says, I think she's actually quite a lonely person, and doesn't realise that people don't really want to listen to in their spare time. She seems to have no friends outside of work and is super clingy to colleagues. She's found out where I live and I'm worried she'll start leaving me presents and trying to come into my house. She has done this to people before which, in one case, the person moved out of town and never told her - she was so hurt when she found out and made that person's life unpleasant. As it turns out, she lives quite near to me. It's really starting to get me down, because I want to help her, but I don't want her taking over my life. I've tried to make it quite clear that I like to keep work and social life separate, but she knows I'm quite friendly with other colleagues and seems to think that means I should be her friend too. My other colleagues don't talk about work outside of work, whereas all she talks about is work/gossip/maliciousness. Urrgh, sorry for this wall of text, I guess I just needed to vent. I love my job and have made great progress there, with good career prospects and I don't want to have to give up my job because of her. I also suffer from chronic pain and chronic fatigue - I simply am running out of energy for this. TL;DR - what to do you with someone who obviously is hurting, lonely and depressed inside, but goes out of their way to make everyone else's life a misery? How do you help them without hurting them or flaring up the situation when they take every gentle offer or mere suggestion of help as an offence? How do you protect yourself in this situation? If you made it this far, thank you for your time. I really appreciate your patience. Strength &lt;3"

I didn't get anything productive done but I was enjoying watching Netflix, listening to music, and I even made myself dinner. Today is a complete turnaround from yesterday and now I'm doubting if I was even happy in the first place. Am I really feeling happy/content or am I just distracting myself from my negativity? Whenever I am happy/okay I'm always scared of the inevitable darkness that seems to always be around, waiting for any bit of vulnerability to come up so that it can latch on and swallow me. Sometimes when I'm happy I start to doubt my sadness. If I'm happy now why do I become so low, to the point of not wanting to exist anymore? Why can't I just recognize all of the good things around me? Maybe I'm not feeling anything at all and my mind is just pretending to feel emotions that I think I should be feeling."

In the past I went to therapy but it was unsuccessful, and I later tried two additional therapists. Some days I think I'm ok; I think I have it together and I always get what I need to done. I always deliver. But I think I need someone to tell me I'm not ok and I need help. I spend my days alone, talking with no one but my parents and sister (and it's usually less ""talking"", more them criticizing me or barking orders). I feel empty, lost, and suicidal. My long distance boyfriend has been my sole saving grace. I just feel at the end of my rope. I can barely get out of bed; I dread waking up. I look like shit. I can't look at myself in the mirror, and I've thrown myself into baking in an act of desperation (though I'm enjoying it). My dog doesn't even like me; when I sit next to her, she gets up and goes to the other couch. As a small example of what living at home is like, today my younger sister mocked me for having ""no friends"". Another is my parents life philosophy that a life well-lived is a life of work. If you're happy though, you're not working hard enough, and you're not supposed to be happy. Basically, life is supposed to suck, get used to it. I feel like, why do I bother anymore? &amp;#x200B; My dramatic decline I think has also been triggered by: * The instability of my chronic illness (cystic fibrosis) * Loss of my single passion * Got a dream job which turned out to be an absolute nightmare where I was overworked, lied to, verbally abused, deprived of food, etc. * Beginning to resent my major * Finding out that I can't ever really leave my country even though I hate it here (due to my health condition) * Losing all direction and vision for my future, now having to reexamine my career options and realizing I will never be as financially successful as my parents * Back in February escaped my ex who abused me sexually, emotionally, verbally, mentally for roughly 2 years * Living with my formerly abusive mother who I'm still afraid of (but cannot leave for a long list of reasons) &amp;#x200B; The problem is, I don't want to spend money. Additionally, I don't want to tell my parents I need help because they'll read it as a kind of vulnerability and weakness, and they'll take advantage of that later. I am also chronically ill and have taken a large amount of pills my whole life; I don't want to add to the pile. And most of all, I don't want to be hospitalized or put in a psych ward. All in all, I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place."

Anyone get tired of pretending to be someone their not, and the second they show there true depressive colours they get labelled as grumpy, not confident, weak or just all together abandoned? I've spent years studying psychology/body language and have careful watch over my facial expressions, tone of voice etc all to convey someone that's confident and not depressed. The problem is that it's exhausting and takes a lot of my energy. It goes like this: *Regular social settings:* \- **Act like self (Depressed)** where I seem kinda monotone, keep to myself, maybe show some vulnerability. I'm being my honest self as I feel depressed. I'm not one to even talk to people about my depression (learned along time ago with family there's few people I trust with that) so I keep to myself ---- the below results are all WITH ME keeping to myself. **Result**: Chided for being a debbie downer, labelled as grumpy, treated like a child, no one wants to have anything to do with me, my phone never has notifications from anyone and generally actually am picked on?.... *Versus* **Act with pretend confidence** where I enthrall a lot of people. I can make people laugh and have a good energy about me. I can take jokes, crack them off and force myself to sit with people (Despite wanting to be alone). I honestly may even come off as a bit of a prick at times but it doesn't even matter. **Result:** Included in social events, people reach out to me, if I'm ever the centre of a joke it's actually good natured (I can tell the difference), people go out of their way to sit near me etc..... Now I can speak to this (Almost like a social experiment really -- I've had 3 environments within my work place \*\*each different watch/group of people will be a different letter\*\*\* and these were my results. (I get different people may treat you different but these examples have proven true outside of work with the same principle applied). \-------------------------------- A) is being depressive self // B) is fake confident // C) Is a hybrid (Going from B -- A ) \------------------------------- A) I started off being ""myself"" or depressed --- ostracized, picked on, chided, disrespected B) I fake being confident the entire time ---- invited out to after work parties, people wanted to sit near me, respected, in fact I was even popular... I even had two women that confessed how sexy they found my confident. Hybrid environment: C) I started off being fake confident like B // Then ran out of gas a few months in and slipped back to a watered down version of A \----- Initially: People all went out of their way to say ""im glad you were placed on our watch, you fit right in"", messages when I missed work asking how I was doing, people constantly asked me questions about work due to trusting my confidence, I was invited out to after work parties, I even slept with a co-worker within the first few months of getting there and had a proposal from another \-----After showing depressive symptoms: Almost the EXACT same thing as ""A"", people rarely talk to me now, the jokes are becoming kind of demeaning versus funny, I get called grumpy, the woman I slept with now avoids me, and texts mostly go ignored, people stopped asking my work questions and will ask people with less experience than me. \*\*These are all work examples but this type of change happens in my personal life, work examples were simply the easiest way of expressing this concept\*\* I literally had a woman tell me ""You came off way more confident than you actually were"" How do you guys retain the gas to keep up your facades? Don't you get tired of walking around knowing the second you let your guard down you'll get eaten up. I've had depression since I was 7, and I recently went on Wellbutrin which has really helped.... but had a bit of a breakdown recently when adding clonazepam. I don't think I've ever felt so alone and shitty, I don;t have a good relationship with my family (long story but in a nut shell my family didn't believe in mental illness, i was rejected psychology treatment and just looked down on for years). Woman stick around because they enjoy confidence, most women will fall out of attraction when you're depressed (I've seen exceptions to this rule but its rare for sure) Most people can't be bothered to deal with your depression (despite you not saying a word about it lol) So what do you guys do?.... how do you endure? I'm tired. Tl:dr people discard you when you stop acting fake happy and you're left alone"

i hate it when people feel bad for me or see a vulnerable part of me because i feel like they have some sort of power over me at that point, like they've seen the deepest and saddest and most personal parts of me and that's a fucking terrifying thing to give away to someone. i hate thinking that that could change their image of me, or that they'll see me like a charity case or an abused puppy or some shit, idk. logically i know that telling someone you trust about things that you've gone through or venting about how you feel is normal and okay, but i just can't get past this irrational block in my brain that just makes me physically and emotionally incapable of expressing how i'm really feeling or doing. last year i experienced some of the worst months of my life, i completely avoided my friends and when they tried to check on me i just acted like i was busy or tired. this went on for a few months until one morning i just walked out of the middle of class &amp; took an uber home and tried to overdose. after going to the hospital i notified a few of my friends that i'd be gone for a while because i was getting bakeracted for a few days (involuntary placement in a mental facility for all u non-US dudes) &amp; i told them what happened &amp; let them know that i was okay, and i felt like the scum of the earth for putting that kind of weight on their chest. i knew i wasn't going to die when i took those pills, i knew i wasn't going to keep them down very long, i knew i was going to end up calling the police or my mom or something, i was just in such a disconnected dissociative state for so long and going through the same daily motions with all of this depression and trauma built up inside of me that i just had to do something. i guess it was kind of a cry for help sort of thing, i just couldn't get out of this fucking unbearable state for so long and i couldn't express what that felt like and i guess i sort of wanted someone to notice without actually having to say anything, i'm not really sure. i might be framing the situation wrong, i can't really explain what my headspace was like at the time because it's like i was on autopilot. i don't really know why i'm typing this or what the purpose of it is or what i'm looking for from this. i never want to feel like that again. i never want to make anyone i love feel the way i made them feel ever again. no matter how much pain and damage she's put me through, i never want to see my mom look at me the way she did when she walked into my hospital room. she still has a tracker on my phone and for months after the incident she'd blow my phone up with texts and calls when i didn't answer her during class until the point where she'd start calling the school to find me in class and make sure i was there. she'd cry to me and say i can't fucking do this, i can't go on not knowing where you are and how you are at all times. i hate myself for making her feel that way. through all the years of gaslighting and abuse i still hate that i made her feel that way. it's all just so convoluted and contradicting and confusing i can't really put it all into words, because the logical part of me knows its okay to ask for help, it's okay to talk to someone when you're feeling down, and i don't think any differently of someone for talking to me about how they feel; infact i find it extremely validating that they trust me to that point, but something in me just can't bring myself to do it. something in me just fucking hates myself and forces me to let these emotions fester and build up until i just completely detach from reality and feel like i'm not even there as a way to cope with an unmanageable amount of depression and sadness and stress and anger and hatred. i have a psychologist, and it took me 2 years to briefly mention one example of the trauma i went through as a kid. i don't understand myself at all. i wouldn't wish anxiety or depression or unresolved trauma on my worst enemy. but yeah i just needed to brush the surface of some stuff i've been bottling up for a really long time. sorry if none of this makes sense or if there's some run on sentences nd stuff. &amp;#x200B;

I'm a college student attending community college and that's going great, but as far as my mental health goes, I feel ""upside down"". For so long I have repressed my emotions due to pressure, societal expectations of what a man should be, and not feeling understood. It's hard to open up sometimes because I grew up in an environment where a man would get called out for expressing his emotions or showing vulnerability. I started to develop depression very recently because of feeling like this and how much it's taken a toll on me. Anxiety always was my main struggle. Life right now just doesn't seem to get better at the moment. I've been looking for a job and have applied to countless applications and still nothing. I want to work so bad so I can provide for myself, my family, and become financially stable. But without money I can't go nowhere or do barely anything. I know it's been more than 50 applications and none of them have replied back. As materialistic and selfish as this may sound,money would solve most of my problems. I see so many teens have a job, and get their life together and that's something I also want for myself. Why is life so hard sometimes. :("

Ive been slowly.. painfully slowly, like a sloth on Xanax slowly.. pulling myself out of the deepest downswing in my depression cycle Ive ever experienced. The last year or so has been a constant uphill battle for me, and Im just now finally to the point where I recognize the upswings and try to harness the mental clarity in those moments to better prepare myself for the next downswing. What starts sending me spiraling downward, though, is the realization of just how isolated Ive made myself. Ive pushed away good people, and completely ghosted on really important relationships in my life because Ive been too ashamed of my mental state, and the choices Ive made because of it, to admit that to anyone. The longer it goes without speaking to these people, the more ashamed and anxious I become, despite desperately wanting to reach out. What Im asking is, how do you make that first step toward reconnecting with the people who care about you after your depression has pushed them so far away for such a long time? How do I overcome the fear of them not understanding, or being rejected? Or even the fear of being understood and accepted.. because reconnection and vulnerability are scary right now too.

They abandoned me suddenly and refused to communicate with me. After my friend let go, I told them I cared about them. Every couple months I wrote them a letter trying to explain how I felt during the latter end of our friendship and was vulnerable about who I am and my experience with life. I never got a response. As someone who was in a fragile place myself and did not have a person I felt connected to, my friend leaving spiked my negative emotions and was the final push into my depression. My life history is complex and I won't get into that here, but I have spent a good portion of my life alone and not by choice. I have a good spirit of discernment when it comes to trusting people. Many young people are frivolous with trust. Every new person is immediately a friend and they expect closeness, connection, and vulnerability off the bat. As they age they will realize that friendships, genuine friendships, take time to build and not everyone is fit for the job. I am aware of that. To this very day, unfortunately, I have only experienced seasonal friendships -- people who resonate with me and I with them, but they walk away at some point. I promise I don't try to place blame on others. Everyone I have spoken to, including my therapists, agree that the way these relationships ended was unfair to me and how I was treated during portions of them, unkind. Constantly abandoned, I hurt deeply but I do all I can to remain emotionally intact. I do not let my pain hurt others. With that said, the manner in which my friend treated me in our final year together and how they ended our friendship was painful. The depression that followed was all encompassing. As life continued to take its toll, I developed suicidal tendencies. It took me all I had to mend myself during the year apart. While I did not expect any response when I sent my letters -- that was not the point -- a part of me hoped they would reach out in some way. Eventually, they asked to return to my life after not saying a word. Shortly after coming back, they asked to be in a romantic relationship with me. Unfortunately, it only took four months for them to push me away again. They called themselves a monster, claimed I wouldn't care about them if they died, and questioned repeatedly if I cared about them. I tried to assure them that I cared and expressed that I wanted to remain in a relationship with them and provide support. But the moment they ended things, their tears stopped. They assured me that they weren't crying because our relationship ended. I felt as if I could see them withdraw in a matter of seconds. They said they still had feelings for me multiple times and did not know what to do. Speechless because of the hurtful things they said and this being the first time they let me know they felt suicidal and depressed, we parted ways with a hug. Two days later, after my emotions settled, I text them to let them know that I understood how they were feeling and I was there for them. All I got was silence. A month later, I checked on them via email. No response. The last time I went through this, my reaching out to them did not do any good and it was hard to be so vulnerable. We broke up in February of this year. The last time I reached out to check on them and got no reply was in May. While I care for them dearly, I can't keep putting myself out there. Looking online, people always advise the person who was pushed away to constantly fight for the other person -- to constantly show their support. My heart is with them and a part of me hates myself for that. I care about them so much, but I also deserve to have someone there for me, right? I deserve to have someone who wants to remain with me. I deserve to have someone write me a letter. I deserve to have someone who wouldn't cut off contact so easily, right? Honestly, I did not think I would be back here. Should I just try to forget about them and move on? I don't mean to be insensitive, I just don't know what to do. They won't even speak to me despite asking to be friends. I waited for two months after the break up, but eventually said yes. Still, they haven't spoken to me since February. How is this okay? Although I am depressed and actively suicidal at the moment, I wouldn't treat someone this way."

Lately in recent years, the thought of death has given me more inspiration to wake up more than the thought of living. The yearning for a major accident, stabbing like 17 times on the chest has given me much breathing space than any happiness I have experienced in the last 4 years. Today I walked to work and i realized i had not zipped my backpack bag, i wondered if the guy who helped me close it thought it was funny or he could see my discontentment with life. You know they say things will get better... somehow I am waiting for the day getting dumber, feeling slow, feeling rejected gets categorized as ""better"" cause that's where I am going. The reason I haven't killed myself yet is cause I cant take the thought of letting my nieces see a coffin of me inside now, yet I desparately yearn to die and find peace. This is not in anyway to discourage those who are fighting, I hope the world gives you justice. And if there's God, I wouldn't even want his embrace, I'd ask him to let me die. I guess like the rest of us, it happens to the best of us."

I was lonely. I was lonely and I was happy; all my loneliest nightmares had already spoken themselves into reality. There I sat lonely. I was alone, but lately that is just another thing I am. I am 18. I am a boy. One covered in scars. I am a boy who is hurt often and falling apart.. but choosing to let those things determine my mindset is a choice that really takes a toll on me; and settles me into a behavioral cycle of self abuse that can drag me down to the deepest depths of regret-- to the likes of which I can't escape. I was thinking to myself how nice it was to not be in love and how nice it was to have no friends. My quiet life just dragging on as I focused on myself and how I could save myself from vulnerability. I had a moment. I had a stupid. Moment. Where I allowed myself to text you. I opened the gate of vulnerability that's been shut for nearly 9 months. All this progress I made, simply thrown away because somehow after all this time-- I'm still ADDICTED to you. You messaged me how you felt and now we're talking. We're flirting. There's butterflies in my stomach and honestly I feel a little sicker every time you allow a silly innuendo to be sent to my user. Because now I'm unsure. Do you use me for sex? For love? Or sadistic pleasure? I can never tell if what you're doing to me is an accident; simply a mistake of love. Or maybe it's intentional.. Or maybe I blame you because I'm so hurt that I can't rationalize your actions. Do you ever know what it's like to want someone so bad that you can speak for 3 minutes, and already want to touch them and feel them in every way you know. Breathe and hear them, wake up in their arms and simply be near them. Because I know. I know. I want you so bad every time I'm around you but by now I know. I need to keep you away from me. It hurts but it's the truth. We need distance. We need boundaries and a new understanding of each other. Because our old way. It's just never worked out. I was just talking the other day how I got over you and how I was going to move on. Ridiculous.. -Fakushi"

165,vulnerability,depression,Posted to r/anxiety. Felt it was relevant to this group too.,2,c52ckg,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/c52ckg/posted_to_ranxiety_felt_it_was_relevant_to_this/,2019-06-25 14:21:08," TLTR: I suffer from anxiety. These are my experiences of living with anxiety. Hopefully you get something from relating to someone with these issues. Ive literally just joined this group. Nice to see theres one available. I suffer from anxiety and depression. I have been medicated on a cocktail of pharmaceutical psychiatric drugs in the past leading to catastrophic consequences Im lucky to have survived. They do work for some people, not for me. I havent taken them for nearly ten years now. Ive been better since, but did go through a time of being a one-stage-away-from-peeing-my-pants alcoholic, a functional cocaine addict, and have smoked forests of marijuana. Marijuana is the only recreational drug that I use daily now. Besides nicotine. It helps take the edge off my anxiety and depression; despite they are still quite palpable. I am totally functional on it. Past doctors have said that as much as they dont like to admit it, its a substance that suits me. I believe this to be true, even though I do somewhat depend on it. My drinking has slowed right down. These days I often go nights without a drop. Its rare I have more than three quarters of a bottle of wine in one sitting now. I went through a time of drinking two bottles of wine, minimum a night; a time before that was about sixteen large cans of beer a night. Thats just the evening drinking. Id wake up every morning and grab a beer from the fridge. That was for about a year and a half. I hardly ever touch cocaine now despite it being available to me. Stephen Fry labelled it a pernicious drug; I would have to agree with him from my past experience. I am thirty three years old. Right now I am anxious: About the times earlier tonight my friend would be talking and Id interrupt him mid-sentence because I was jumpy and not actively listening; anxious I did it too much and eventually he wont like me, thinking Im rude. About the last time I worked with this same friend. Despite I was later told I did a good job, I talked too much because I was nervous. So tonight I went to observe him work and spoke much less; because I was anxious that I might talk too much again. Im anxious that my involvement wasnt adequate. About a fight I had with my girlfriend two nights ago, a day before celebrating one year since we met. I was feeling depressed and anxious and took something the wrong way, blowing it up into a total clusterfuck. I was totally self obsessed and caught up in my bullshit that I wasnt wise enough in the moment to see what was going on and I hurt her emotionally. Before the end of the night this fight ended and we made up. She suffers from anxiety, depression, and dissociation herself; the way I acted makes me feel selfish that I didnt treat someone with these conditions the best I could. Someone I love more than I ever did my first love. This IS my first love as far as Im concerned. I didnt know what love was before meeting this person a year ago. We had a dear anniversary the day after the fight. Things have been loving and supportive since. Weve talked about the fight. Ive taken responsibility for everything I did to hurt her. Ive acknowledged that Im not well, despite how relatively functional I am in current day to day life. I am anxious about the pain she will still be feeling from the fight, and the temporary knock to her trust and probably respect towards me. Since that night things have been beautiful. I am optimistic about our future together, I know she loves me dearly and is also optimistic about our future together; but I am anxious about my ability to keep a lid on it at all times so I can be the man I want to be. Her rock. About that despite marijuana is a positive thing in my life, (theres plenty of respected scientific research to suggest its potential positive effects), Im dependant on something to take the edge off pain I inherently possess. One day I hope to not feel a need to escape my intolerable affect in any way, be it with drugs and/or alcohol, sex, exercise, video streaming services, you name it. I am anxious this will never happen, and that Ill never be fully alive. About the fact that weve moved to a new country two weeks ago for a year to see how we find it. Im anxious about it potentially not working out well for me professionally and it going really well for my girlfriend. Im anxious about us potentially having to make that decision in a years time about the future of where we base ourselves. If where we currently are only works well professionally for one of us; and that one person wants to stay here. About my bisexuality. Im in a relationship with a beautiful person who is bi herself. She understands and loves me for who I am. I am anxious about the conditioned shame and guilt I feel regarding my sexuality. Im anxious the femininity in me is unattractive to my girlfriend, despite shes made it very clear she finds it to be my defining quality helping shape my enormous heart, which she loves. Whilst I am proud of what I like to call my androgynous nature, it also comes with much pain and fear. About regular flashbacks of past traumatic experiences that haunt me regularly. I dont actively cling to them. Theyre just there. Im anxious when its been a while since Ive thought about these past episodes in my life, wondering when theyll ambush me again. About the fact that its 3:22 AM and I have a lot to do tomorrow. Im anxious that Id rather sit here right now alone in a quiet room writing this than snuggle up with my girlfriend and fall asleep; because in this moment life feels overwhelming. I just want to put my head in the sand. Im pausing life right now. The list goes on. I have times when my mental health is strong and Im the man I love to be. I equally have times when I feel reduced to the little boy I was once was in vulnerability, not the tall, generally optimistic young man I am now. I find some comfort in anonymously sharing this piece given the current state Im in. Thank you for your attention, it means the world to me."

I've started actually considering opening up to some of the people around me. But.....what do you even say? I've been depressed for a long time, on lots of meds, etc., so it's not that I'm uncomfortable with people knowing I struggle with it. It's more because I feel like if I talk about it, my hurt feels less justified. Along with that, my mind just kind of goes blank when I try to explain what I feel - like I'm subconsciously avoiding vulnerability for the sake of feeling that my pain is justified. It would wreck me if at the end of it all, I was simply being dramatic or attention seeking or whatever. I would hate myself for wasting so much time and letting people worry about me when they didn't need to. I don't know if anyone has any advice for this, but I thought shouting into the void would be good for me."

I used to think I sacrificed everything for friendships and others. I provided genuine advice, accepted plans, befriended those who were lonely and let them open up. And I still do that. But now I realize how closed off I am and how that affects not just me, but my relationships. I always knew I had a problem with vulnerability, but I just thought that was my problem to deal with, alone and by myself. But it hurts other people just as much as it hurts me. One person who considers me her best friend told me how much I meant to her, how shes never met anyone else like me and in her previous toxic friendship, she just kept wishing she could come back to me. But I dont feel the same way. In fact, Ive been stressed from the friendship ever since we got close but its so hard for me to be open with her about how I feel, so I put on an act for these past couple years. Another girl told me I was her best friend, and I actually reciprocate the feelings. But its been so rocky and Im afraid things wont go back to normal. I want to put in the work, but afterwards I feel like Im not happy, and it just doesnt feel the same. Theres other people I distance myself from because I dont want to hurt them, or for a while they hurt me. And now Im in such an odd, lonesome, mentally tolling area within all of my relationships. I want out, but at the same time am so afraid of losing anyone. And its so selfish of me. I used to cry myself to sleep just because I had no friends, and now I do. I have friends who check up on me, but for some reason it just makes me uncomfortable and frustrated when they do. I have friends who want to hang out, but I cant bring myself to fake being happy for a couple hours and then go back to feeling numb. Some of my friends have genuinely been toxic, not saying that theyre a toxic person, but personally for me its unhealthy for me to continue being their friend for various reasons. Theres people I really do want to keep in my life, but sometimes I dont know if its worth it, and I know they deserve better. There was one point this year where I distanced myself from most of my close friends, even those who I previously mentioned were toxic for me, and I was still miserable. They were worried and Im lucky they even noticed, but it just showed me that if I stay in these relationships or if I dont stay in them, Ill feel like a shitty person no matter what. I cant win. Its weird because when I give advice to people, I tell them that it all ultimately comes down to them. Put energy into yourself first, make sure youre happy with yourself, and those who truly deserve to stay in your life will be there no matter what. I tell them that its important to take time for themselves and that people will understand, and that they have to trust what life throws at them, because itll help them grow and become who they need to be. But when it comes to me, its like all of that is thrown out the window. Im the worst. Im stupid and my inability to be open ruins everything and hurts everyone. Even when I have told people how I feel, I end up regretting it and still feel sick to my stomach. I dont know what I want."

The constant insecurity, the numbing pain, everything. Getting out of bed is a challenge. Talking to people is a challenge. Being alone is a challenge. I just want it all to stop. Then there are those times when life gets just a bit better and you feel like you can push through it, then it all comes crumbling down when you realize how much depression has already stolen from you. I know my problems are insignificant compared to others. I know that I'm not special. I shouldn't be depressed, but here I am. Here I am. I'm stuck. I'm trying my best to put it into words. Right now, I feel like I should say ""I'm sorry"" to you all. Thinking about it I guess that's something I'm probably unconsciously brooding about. I'm sorry to everyone I've ever encountered in my life that I've brought down with my depression. I'm sorry for not being grateful. I'm sorry for not being there to help. I'm sorry that you ever had to get to know me. I'm sorry for existing. I'm sorry for rambling. I'm sorry for not being good enough. I'm sorry I'm not interesting. I'm sorry for being me. I'm sorry to myself for being unable to accept myself. I'm sorry... I know this post isn't very well structured, I'm honestly sorting it out as I type now. I guess insecurity is a big fault of mine, huh. Well, this reminds me of someone actually. He's a friend, but throughout college whenever he would talk about grades, he would always ask what I got on say an exam or something. The problem I had with this is that I consistently did worse than him, and it was predictable every time what the outcome would be. At first it was okay, no big deal, but then it gets to the point where I ask him if he's just using me as a basis of comparison to feel better, half jokingly, half not. He tells me pretty blatantly that yes, I am just that low bar to compare himself to. Now we've been friends for most of college and this legitimately hurt to hear. I felt betrayed and that everything I ever said to him in times of emotional vulnerability is just going to be leveraged against me in a subtle act of saying ""I'm better than you."" And then I started thinking about it, he never really shared any concerns with me unless they were just superficial. There was a distance between me and someone who was supposedly a close friend... sorry what the hell is wrong with me. This is irrelevant, huh? I'm just... sorry I don't even know what I want to ask anymore. I don't even know what to expect if I do ask... Help? How? One of the worst parts of depression is that it's constant, it's not just a passing mood. So if you rely on someone, you'd just be draining their strength until they'd no longer be able to handle you. It's a burden that spreads... so, here I am, alone, literally in tears coming to strangers for help that I know won't last. What the hell am I supposed to do? I feel so lost right now. I feel broken and that seeking help would break others... I honestly don't know how to continue with this. I apologize for the length of this post, and give my thanks to anyone who decided to read it"

Ive been going thru a pretty serious depression for about a year or so now and its gotten better... but now had come back or resurfaced or whatever you want to call it bc of my crippling anxiety with reaching out and/or opening up to anyone. I grew up with friends but as we got older (42M - single dad) things change, people leave etc. but I cant seem to ever find anyone that I really feel a connection to or that wants a connection with me. Naturally I understand the latter part bc I dont want to let anyone know Im weak or vulnerable. I have had one girl that I tried not to, but fell for and fought it every step of the way. I cut myself off from society for awhile when things were at their worst. Which means I cut myself off from opening up to the one person I wanted to. But guess what, she didnt reach out either. But thats not the point, the point is I never had the ability to tell her how I felt or that I even just wanted to talk about my life bc I was scared of both rejection, judgement but mainly that someone saw me as struggling. She is beyond hot, can have any man she wants, but she actually wanted me. So I ran. Now Ive been feeling better and thinking of reaching out and just found out shes now dating someone. So I lost my chance and that has really opened my eyes to the fact that whether it be her, or anyone else, I cant find and dont have anyone that I feel close to or consider real friends. I feel so lonely... its crippling bc I want it so bad but apparently have no ability. What confuses me is this: how do so many others have groups of close friends at my age and people they do things with? It seems so simple yet so foreign to me at the same time. Ive always been popular and feel Im a good catch, friendship or more, but it seems like an actual connection with anyone is miles away and damn near impossible. I dont know... its a weird feeling. Why would I want to burden someone new with my problems or scare someone away by seeming needy or whatever. I just want someone to give a shit about me and it feels like no one does. Im desperate for human connection more than surface pleasantries and it just seems so far away and it makes me feel so lonely and scared. Anxiety then takes over and here I am... lonely, sad and constantly nervous about how to not feel lonely and sad."

Harvard.edu says that there are many possible causes of depression, including faulty mood regulation by the brain, genetic vulnerability, stressful life events, medications, and medical problems. Its believed that several of these forces interact to bring on depression. \[[1](URL According to me; depression is a state of awareness. Just to be clear, these are my ideas and I dont claim any truth in them. Im just thinking out loud. Depression is a state of awareness I say and I add: People with depression or other mental disorders actually tend to have a more realistic view of the world. Lets compare my idea of universe with [symptoms of depression](URL According to Helpguide.org, depression has 10 common symptoms. **Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness** The world is dying. Society is in a constant war. People are starving. We spend 20 years for education only to sell ourselves for the rest of our lives to a company just to earn money which we have no time to spend on leisure. Is it absurd that I feel hopeless? ## Loss of interest in daily activities As stated above, the world runs in a smooth system and if you are trying to block the well-oiled-machine by asking questions, you end up hopeless and this leads to a life where every daily activity feel pointless and empty. ## Appetite or weight changes Henry D. Thoreau says that we feed our inner fire with food. If you want to get warm, you eat. When you feel hopeless about life, this might effect the way you eat. Well I dunno. I cant really explain this symptom. ## Sleep Changes In my opinion, sleep is the closest we can get to death, without dying. Perhaps our body is trying to tell us by being excessively sleepy or reverse? ## Anger or irritability Everyone is going on with their life, getting married, having kids, graduating etc. while you are stuck hopelessly. Maybe this is the reason behind our low tolerance against people. ## Self-loathing We are all worthless pieces of garbage. Is it not true? We are not unique. We are not delicate. I believe it is the healthy thing to do to accept that we are not one-of-a-kind. ## Reckless behavior This can mean a lot of things. One: Im trying to enjoy life a bit. Two: Im trying to escape reality a bit.Either way I think reality is not bearable. ## Concentration problems Whats the point anyway? Reading a book- why? In the end life is still meaningless. ## Unexplained aches and pains I dont have much to say about this. But depressed people tend to exercise less. That can be the reason of aches. ## Loss of energy There is a rule in physics: Energy is never lost. Its still in you, in me. But there is nothing meaningful to use it."

I also have a habit of being overly honest and share things about myself others probably would not. As a result of this, a lot of people treated me like shit. I don't know where it says in the book of life that kindness is the same as weakness. My open and accepting attitude caused a lot of people to dismiss me outright and others to bully me. Some were especially condescending, doing really fucked up things ""for my benefit"" when they would never in their right mind speak that way to anyone else. At first, I thought there must be something wrong with me. Since so many people are treating me this way, it must be my own failing. After analyzing things to death, I've come to the conclusion that I'm far kinder than the vast majority of people in that office, and have almost a complete lack of conceit and self-regard. Individuals that think themselves wiser than me for employing tactics or acting in a certain way to appear more competent or able are actually far less evolved in the grand scheme of things. But it works. Walking around like you're a somebody works. Even if you're a person of low moral character, if you act like you're a somebody others will believe it. Even if you're a total piece of shit, as long as you're good at being a phony you will succeed. I hate that people feel the need to do this and will, at times, deliberately make a show of vulnerability because we shouldn't have to live this way. I'm just so tired of how the world is. Appearances are everything, and no matter how much I feel truth should supersede cursory observations people will always assume the worst before anything else. Maybe there's nothing wrong with me. Maybe the whole world is crazy and I'm the only normal one."
178,vulnerability,depression,Recently diagnosed with depression but I think Ive been ignoring this problem for far too many years now,2,bsscf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bsscf6/recently_diagnosed_with_depression_but_i_think/,2019-05-25 18:38:30,"DISCLAIMER: This is gonna be a very disjointed post as I try collect all my thoughts not only in the past 2-3 weeks since I considered that I had mental health issues, but basically stories of my entire life. Basically, I just wanna put my thoughts out there to the world. Also, for context, Im a 20 yr old woman who lives in Australia. So about 2 weeks ago I made the decision to go to a GP at my regular medical centre who I knew had experience with mental health issues and I am so incredibly lucky that she was thoughtful and kind the moment I set foot into her office and started to cry, telling her about what Ive been hiding for years now. After listening to everything I had to say she said that it sounded like I had depression and recommended me to meet with this particular psychologist. Once again I got super lucky as she was kind and thoughtful yet also offered fantastic explanations for why I have been feeling the way I have. Why am I telling you all this? Well, purely because of the fact that after talking to these two amazing people I have realised that Ive been ignoring these feelings of sadness Ive had since I was a kid and just wasnt sure about how to cope with them. For instance, this may be chalked up to me just being a very, and I mean VERY sensitive and emotional child but I would cry every single day at primary school over the most stupid and small things. It got to a point where my parents gave me this sticker chart where I would receive a sticker for days I wouldnt cry, with a week of stickers meaning Id get a prize (needless to say, I didnt get many prizes). Moving onto Grade 6 student-teacher conferences, my teacher told me and my mum that if I didnt stop crying in high school Id get bullied. Even though its a shit thing to say to a young and sensitive kid, it actually stuck with me to this day and from the first day of high school I didnt cry. However, in order to stop being so emotional I decided to wear this mask that Ive kept on to this day where I dont share my own feelings but would much rather be that kind and patient person who would listen to my friends concerns. I didnt want to show any vulnerability to my friends and peers that would cause them to pity/make fun of me. So instead, Id be cheerful all the time at school, basically pushing down any emerging feelings of sadness and loneliness. That being said Id be super cold to guys because I was (and in many ways still am) afraid that if I fell for them theyd turn around saying it was all just a joke. Id never go out using the excuse of a lack of money and a desire to do my homework and getting good grades. The getting a good ATAR was my major driving force throughout high school, so while I did enjoy hanging out with friends at school i focused on getting a good score to get into any uni I wanted. I was able to get a super good score at the end of high school (even managed to get a perfect score for one of my subjects) and I was ecstatic! I was looking forward to uni as I got into my dream course (even though I didnt need to get an ATAR as high as I did), but it was at this point that I realised that I didnt put need to do so well in uni as I only needed a credit average to do a friggin masters degree and get into grad programs. As such, I lost the major form of motivation in my life that distracted me from feeling sad. Fast forward to this year (3rd and final year)and I have lost all motivation to do well in uni. I used to thrive on deadlines and a feeling of anxiety that forced me to complete assignments on time, but now I just couldnt give two shits about it, and I just feel lost. All my feelings of loneliness have caught up with me even though I do have a good batch of friends purely, because I struggle to make that initial effort to meet up with them. I now have no physical energy to do anything unless I have to go to my internship where I do work hard and have that semblance of the old me who wanted to do well in whatever I did. Im eating so much more now than ever before and will go straight to sugary foods to try to find some sort of energy I no longer have. I dont even have an appetite, I just cant stop eating. And now Im just lost...I dont know if the career path Im heading towards now is what I truly want and Im worried that Ive wasted 3 years of my life for nothing, even though I do find my internship (which is an organisation I would most like to work for in the future) incredibly interesting. Im also feeling this mask of mine breaking rapidly and Im terrified. My major coping mechanism has always been listening to music, its like the only thing that allows me to calm down when Im feeling anxious or gets me feeling happy and pumped up when Im feeling down. Before I would just lock myself in my room and cry to myself, or just sit alone watching YouTube to find some sort of easy entertainment that made me somewhat happy. Ive also been snapping at my family (who I love so goddamn much) a lot more recently and have said things I dont mean just to hurt them, and Im just so worried that Im going to hurt our relationship if I dont get help now. But now Im trying to confront what Ive been ignoring for years. And since Ive ignored my feelings for such a long time Im worried about how Ill react if I find out through counselling that I am much worse than I thought I am. Im incredibly lucky that at this stage Im not contemplating suicide, as well as the fact that I decided to seek help and talk to people now (including my family) before I get to that stage. For now, I just hope that I can open myself up to not only other people, but also myself and face this depression Ive got. Hopefully this subreddit will allow me to be more vulnerable and share my deepest feelings that I dont feel comfortable sharing. After all, reading through all these post in have seen a strong community who will support one another for concerns that are far more serious than my own. As such, I also want to support everyone on this subreddit. Thanks for listening (or not, either way Ill be fine if no one reads this because I just wanted to write down my thoughts to try to make better sense of them)."

With myself. Nothing is as catastrophic as resistance. Resistance, when the earth beneath you has cracked and you're falling in the trench with no ground in proximity. Not in a fun way. Everyday I'm closer to give it all up. Give up my virtues I have carried on for the longest time. To work hard, and to work without considerations or care for being kicked down by the world. All my virtues have been laid out bare in all their vulnerability. But I lost my biggest possible opportunity so far into this. At least the one I was aware and profusely fond of. What is my purpose if my bleakest effort isn't worth a move forward into progress? Where is this going? Why am I doing this? There's only pain no reward. There's only an individual suffering every single day precisely I chose to participate in with all my life. It's been rough. It was never easy. For the longer moments of my days I stare into nothingness and question my competence and it's resultants with sore throat and teary eyes. I don't know what to do. My best bet is to stick around, fight it with everything in me and allow myself to lose my shit until I've nothing more to lose. Bear the biggest burden I can bear and bear it for as long as I can, as long as my times done or I collapse into another realm of liberation. Whichever comes first."
180,vulnerability,depression,What does a lifetime of depression look like?,4,bv00bs,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bv00bs/what_does_a_lifetime_of_depression_look_like/,2019-05-31 09:17:59,"TLDR; 47 - Horrible marriage, 3 kids, tons of debt and suicidal as shit. Here's what a lifetime of massive ongoing depression looks like. &amp;#x200B; First time posting to Reddit, but been reading content and comments on the site for years now. Going to try to avoid this being a wall of text, but there's a bit of ground to cover. Putting this out there as catharsis and to maybe help others going through the same thing to know they aren't the only ones out there. &amp;#x200B; I'm a 47 year old, married (legally only, as we pretty much don't relate to each other) I have three kids - a 17 year old son, a 14 year old son and an 11 year old daughter. &amp;#x200B; I believe that I have had clinical depression for my entire life. I don't have the clearest memories from childhood, but I remember always being somewhat sad, self conscious and saw no real point to much of anything. Those feelings have only magnified over the years; with the pat 10 years of my life being almost unbearable because of depression and anxiety. &amp;#x200B; In my younger years I had a couple of suicidal episodes, but looking back they were cries for attention/help... taking a bottle of over the counter meds, cutting my wrists, etc... Depression wasn't taken too seriously back then and the typical solution was to get over it, maybe get some counseling and then suck it up and get on with life. &amp;#x200B; This was especially true for boys/men that grew up in the 70s and 80s. Admitting to having feelings of sadness, loneliness, vulnerability, feeling like a failure, were likely to get you labeled a sissy. ""Men/boys"" we were told didn't cry. They didn't ever admit failure. They never questioned their thoughts actions and just got on with life. &amp;#x200B; I think I saw this pattern of ""being a man"" and began internalizing thoughts and emotions at a very young age. Add to that an indoctrination to hellfire and brimstone religion at about 6 years of age, and it's easy to understand how I managed to become the colossul fuckup that I am today. &amp;#x200B; I'll not spend too much time on childhood/teenage years other than to say my parents (though still together and happy today in their late sixties) had a very volatile relationship when I was growing up. Lots of arguing, screaming and yelling. And a few times where things turned physically violent. I started smoking pot, drinking and experimenting with other drugs at about 12 years old. I started hanging with a rougher/older crowd at about 15. Quit school at 16 and moved out of the house before I was 17. &amp;#x200B; Throughout all of that time I believe I was masking my emotions by stuffing them down and being a man and self medicating with drugs, drinking, jumping from one girlfriend to another and engaging in all kinds of risky behavior. I was lucky to not end up in jail and squeaked through my late teens/early 20s by doing a lot of partying and essentially doing what I could to drown out all of the pain and insecurity that I felt. Self medication continued to grow worse. &amp;#x200B; At age 23 I met a girl and got serious with her. By the time I was 25 we were getting married. We were no match made in heaven, but we did okay. I managed to learn a bit about computers and switched over from manual labor jobs to doing computer work. Had our first kid when I was 29 and the depression continued to fester - along with a very disfunctional marriage - but I crammed it down and tried to be the best father I could be. &amp;#x200B; Three years later our next child was born - depression grew worse and I put more effort into covering it up/overcompensating. Three years later our youngest was born and the pattern continued. A few months after my daughter was born, I had a life threatening illness that required emergency surgery. This condition led to multiple surgeries and sickenss over the next 9 years. As I was getting beatdown physically, the depression continued to increase. I kept hiding it. About 7 years ago things began to crack, I was pressured into talking to a doctor to get some help. That help ended up being several attempts at different SSRIs over the next few years that never did much of anything, but a few of the meds/dosages/combinations made things worse. &amp;#x200B; My marriage continued to get worse and worse. My wife and I grew apart over the years. The depression certainly didn't help matters. She is one of those people if you tell her you're depressed she tells you to cheer up; think about all the good things you have. She is a christian, I am an anti-theist. She is very driven to always be on the go, while I'm a bit more laid back and like to let people be themselves. Long story short - we're different people. I love her, but our marriage is a joke. We were separated for a year, but I could no longer afford paying for two households. In the process of being separated, I had to use credit cards to pay for groceries for the kids and a ton of other expenses that I didn't budget accordingly for. That along with some other mistakes (including binge spending when my depression gets very bad) has resulted in me being buried in debt... For the past six months we've lived under the same roof, but pretty much avoid each other like the plague and stay on opposite sides of the house. Not an ideal situation but it is what it is. &amp;#x200B; The one constant companion I've had is depression. I drink every evening to excess to numb myself to it. No drugs work so far. Counseling has not worked. I contemplate suicide every day. I have a plan on how I will do it when the time comes. I've stopped myself so far by telling myself that the kids are better off with me here. Lately, though, I don't know if that is true. I know they would be sad if I was gone, but I don't really think they would be worse off without me here. They are certainly no better for me being alive. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, there's more to my story and I'd be glad to elaborate. My drinking problem has been out of control for years, but it is the only thing that helps me to keep my personal demons at bay. I have held down a professional IT job for the past 16 years with the same company. I have a huge phobia of growing old; so being 47 is no walk in the park. Lots more to talk about if anyone is up to it. &amp;#x200B; I have pretty much given myself between 1 and 1,000 or so days. That's about how long it will be until I'm 50. I really don't want to be 50, then 55, 60, on and on and dealing with the same shit day in and day out. That's the short version of my situation for now and a sketch of what a lifetime of depression and bottling up negative emotions will do for you. I hope those of you out there that may just be getting started down this long and lonely road can get the help you need to choose a better path than I have. I'm 47 and have failed and wasted it all."
181,vulnerability,depression,Masks,1,bvkrvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bvkrvm/masks/,2019-06-01 23:26:17," Masks help. You see them there, you colleagues, your friends, your family, you acquaintances. They are talking to each other, they are laughing, they are discussing something interesting, they are working and being productive. Always. And, to be a part of this club, even if its for a brief moment, I need to put on a mask. I have to appear to be one of them, or else I'll never be one of them. However much people claim otherwise, they feel comfortable among their own. Well, I have no ""my own"". So, I have to put on a mask and pretend to be one of them. That's the only way they'll tolerate me. Love, affection, friendship, those would be nice. But, toleration is the most I can hope for right now. And its right that it be so. We get back what we give and I can't really give or receive because I want nothing. With a mask, tolerance. Without a mask, pain. And that brings me to the second function of the mask. To protect myself from pain. It's a terrible circle. Interpersonal relations at every level have a strong possibility of misinterpretation, it's in the nature of communication. And with this I am leaving myself vulnerable. If I removed my mask, people could hurt me. But consider the inverse. Only if I remove my mask can people connect with me. So, are the obvious benefits of human connection worth the cost? This is where I fall back on experience. And it's also why childhood abuse is so pernicious. If all I have ever known in vulnerability is abuse, why would I ever allow myself to be vulnerable again? Why would I ever remove my mask? I remove my mask when I feel protected and safe. Unfortunately I only feel that way when I am alone. And so, I can only be myself when I am alone. It's a terrible thing to not be able to trust anyone..."
182,vulnerability,depression,What the hell's wrong with me that I develop crushes on female therapists and any girl who gives me emotional support,3,bvurgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bvurgf/what_the_hells_wrong_with_me_that_i_develop/,2019-06-02 16:55:00,"I'm a guy. Like the title says, any of my female friends (most of the friends I've had have been female) who show me any kind of sympathy or emotional support I practically fall in love with and I know it's ridiculous and messed up. I've just throughout my life had almost nobody I was emotionally vulnerable with, including parents/family. Talking about my feelings at all to anyone is something I've only done within the last few years and I'm in my early 20s. Whenever I have this emotionally vulnerable relationship with a girl my mind thinks that's romance and I end up getting too attached and needy when all they were doing was just doing what a friend normally would for anyone. Even worse - - - I've even had two female therapists that I felt like I had feelings for. They were only a few years older than me and I found them attractive, then after seeing them for a while I felt like I had feelings for them and it made me feel extremely awkward and uncomfortable going to them and I eventually stopped. Why am I so messed up like this? Why can't I just interpret emotional vulnerability as a normal part of being a person and not some soul binding connection? I hate myself because I've made several female friends uncomfortable after saying I had developed feelings for them and of all of them I only made up and still talk to one. It's kind a catch-22 because I feel like I can only show or talk about my emotions to females but then I have this problem."

I try so hard to reach for the stars but there is always a set back. I was accepted into a graduate program but now it looks like I wont be able to attend because I cant afford it. I dont want to take out tens of thousands of loans that Ill be paying off in death. I need to go to grad school if I want my career. I may have to stay with my parents next year instead and they literally make me sucidal, bless their hearts. They still treat me like a child. My mother slaps me and says she can do so simply because she is my mother. She thinks Im a doll she can do anything to because she assumes she owns me. My father is a sexist prick who raised a son, obviously my brother, who thinks rape isnt that bad. They mean well but intention means nothing when the result is chaos for another persons heart. Honestly, they just are not great people. I went from barely being around during undergrad, where I still had terribly horrific depression, to being home where things have gotten dire. My one solace is my boyfriend who I only see on the weekend and he has vulnerability issues. Why cant I have the things I work so hard for simply because I am not from a family with any means? When will the future Ive been working so hard for show its face without any setbacks? When will the setbacks end?"

I started in a PHP (partial hospitalization program) which was a daily 6-7 hour group therapy session with medication management as well. I did that for about 3 weeks and was then discharged. After my discharge from PHP I went another facility for IOP (intensive outpatient program) which is 3 days a week and 3 hours of group therapy. I can not say enough good things about my experiences in both of these programs. The honesty and vulnerability shown by those in the group gave me the courage to do the same and it has truly changed my life along with medication. Today was my final day of IOP and I am now looking to find a group of sorts to attend on a regular basis from now until basically forever. Something a kin to an AA program I suppose. It was suggested to me to check out celebrate recovery and/or Re: Generation. In doing some research on these groups, I found that they are both Christian faith based organizations. I grew up in the church but have since more or less abandoned that upbringing in favor of a more agnostic view. I would rather not attend a group that pushes this ideology. Does anyone know of any similar groups that would possibly be an option for me? TL;DR looking for a non Faith based group type therapy environment similar to AA but for depression and anxiety."

I really need people to talk to. I just feel so much shame and I can't cope with that vulnerability. So recently I've been isolating myself a lot.

My teacher once said, I was trying to figure out colour you werent wearing today,but then I saw the little bit of red on your socks. I never forgot that, it stuck. Those words are still with me because it made me feel noticed, and that someone saw that I had all of the colours with me, and that I loved it. In grade 1 I went over to my teachers house. She has a greenhouse in her back yard and goldfish in a little pond in her backyard. She invited my dad and I over and we walked around in her backyard and I remember her showing my dad a drawing that I had done, and it was for a project that was like, If you could be any superhero, what would you be? and I said that I would want to be my mom. I felt really important that day. I miss grade 9 and getting on my bus in the morning. I felt so alive. And ready. I was so ready for grade 9. The vulnerability that I felt when I used to talk to people for the first time, I need it back. I miss feeling so absolutely anxious and happy. I miss being upset with my friends and crying that I could possibly lose them. I just miss sitting in a classroom and listening to a teacher and learning. I miss learning how to play the piano. But I wish I made better friends back then, because I wasnt happy. I felt self conscience and judged a lot. But I miss learning and feeling excited for it. And doing projects. I wish I listened to my heart, I regret not putting myself out there and making friends that were actually kind. I should have stuck with piano. Ive been so mean, my whole life. I use people constantly and ask for so much in return. I feel the need to be guided constantly. Why when Im feeling like this I just become and baby and do stupid things? I really need to work on being nicer. I have such a short temper with the people that I love the most, and I feel awful about it. I wish I just said what I thought, and did the things I want to do.

As a primary context, yes a lot of my damage stems from my family and a lack of validation. All of my problems are small, everyone elses is big and I should just shut the fuck up. I tried killing myself in December 22, 2013. Dad belittled me after the last time, I stole his gun, walked to my car and tried to shoot myself. The magazine fell because I was a dumbass. Too scared to try again, I called my brother. Made things worse. Dont kill yourself but your problem is just your perspective in life, I have 3 mouths to feed and I think of killing myself too lol, just hang in there and everything else to try and belittle my problems. Went home to dad, berated me more. You tried killing yourself because I said your only value is that youre good at video games. Yeah, on top of every belittling things Ive had to deal with in life. Just gotta keep it in. Fast forward 6 years. After being a manager at a collapsing company for 4 years, I left. I learned self actualization where you dont really need external validation anymore. I lied to myself after living years with low confidence. I lied to everyone, believing that fake it til you make it. I did gain confidence. I was good at my job and was only 1 of 4 employees after a big cutback (the company was dying and the owner was faking everything was going to be ok). I was a lowly draftsman and eventually worked my way to being the de-facto VP. If I left, everything would turn to shit, and when I did leave, it did (my friend kept me updated). Needless to say, I was on top of the world. Right. That was just a lie. Left, got a job in 2 weeks even though that was literally my first job in 4 years. Aced my first interview. Got a new job doing exactly what Ive been doing for a lot of money in a big company. My confidence is at peak. Until I started. Getting put down for me being new, you dont know how things work while at the same time you have experience right? You need to be on top of everything. In my old job, my word was almost law because in a shit situation my old company was, mistakes were fatal. And the only mistakes I made were trivial because any big mistakes means the death of the company. Now, I make mistakes everyday. Its not even the berating that got me into this. Its myself. I lost that confidence I gained. Everything I told myself was a lie. I was never good. I am in a job I dont really deserve to be in. I have no friends because I refuse to put myself in a position of vulnerability, after being taken advantage of in the past continuously. I cant get internal validation, and I have no desire for external validation. Fast forward to 1 hour ago. Brother wanted to watch Endgame with me. I went. Right away, he wanted to talk about my job (my family always only wants to talk about my job). Its shit. I opened up a little, was getting cut off before I can finish a thought because Im just trying to give you advice and perspective. Yeah, shit hat Ive thought of everyday, and nothing helps. I got frustrated and just unconsciously was yelling my thoughts out loud. I guess its because no one listened. He yelled back at me, saying I think of killing myself every day to but I have 3 kids all that shit I know already. Basically, I just have to internalize everything because you have no mouths to feed and someone, somewhere always had it worse than you. You need help, sure I do. I am asking for your help and you shut me off, pretending that you know exactly what Im going through because youve had something similar. Basically, the same damn thing that happened 6 years ago. Back the. I was in tears and crying. I got kicked out of the car and drove home just now. The most surprising thing is: I still feel nothing. I drove normally and I dont really have that empty feeling you have when youre depressed. Im actually really proud that I felt nothing. Probably because I stood up for my thoughts against my family, for once. Ive had depression all my life. Ive never really changed. My thoughts were always like this since, but I protected my family from it by acting emotionless all the time. The one time o tried opening up, I got attacked. The last thing I said was none of you support me. Every single problem I had, you invalidate because life is shit. Well, life is shit and I know, its why youre seeing my like this for the first time because I kept it all in. I know that no one really cares about anyones problems, like you literally said just now. And the only place I can open up and be myself, after fighting the world and holding it in for the day, you antagonize me. This is the first time youre seeing the real me and you hate me for it. I used to always say that Ive not killed myself yet because that microscopic chance of survival turns me into a coward. Now, not so sure. Coltina-45 years old is looking pretty attractive right now and I might hit her up."

I have for example endured many traumas, abuse, etc. All of this has led to me living an unhappy, unsuccessful life. When I was young - about 7-10 years old - I was sexually abused. By 3 different men. They all took advantage of my very young age and vulnerability. This abuse has seriously affected me because now Im very unsure of my sexuality. On top of the sexual abuse, I was physically abused by mother. She would hit me very hard, throw stones at my back, strangle me, etc. These are just examples of some of the physical abuse I endured. She was also mentally abusive. She would call me bad names and tell me not to hangout with girls. This actually explains why Im very awkward around girls. I was also physically abused by different men. They would hit me as a young kid, and again they saw my young age and vulnerability. As you can see, vulnerability is a theme that resonates a lot in my life. These are just examples of the challenges Ive experienced in my life. I have many more, but this is enough for now. And as you can see, Ive had a very tough life."

Everyone around me has everything and its hard to reconcile being the one that, by most metrics, is categorized as the one thats struggling or inferior. Its like ending it is creeping up faster than ever. Depression sucks. I put on this happy face just to connect with people but my life sucks. My family (widowed mom, sister, two pups) are pretty much homeless, living pay check to paycheck, Ive got a 1.45 gpa in community bc of various barriers (no money to fix car or pay for parking pass), and having started school too soon after my dad passed away. Im thousands of dollar in debt, The coming 2020 recession scares the shit out of me. Im trying to stay away from weed but everyday brings another reason to get back into it. Tbh all I want is someone whos been this low before or currently is so Id at least feel like I have someone. Im blabbering. I feel helpless. When the next recession hits, I want to be somewhere on a hill as I watch everyone panic as I near ending it all. Does anyone else feel this or am I really just alone?"

I don't know why I chose to post this now when some days are actually far worse than today. But have you ever experienced, after keeping all your secrets inside, be vulnerable and share what you really feel to other people? Because I have, countless times. And more often than not, these people I chose to share my vulnerability with use it against me sooner or later. And people ask me why I have trust issues, or why I have trouble giving people my all. That's why. I don't know why I haven't learned my lesson. I thought maybe posting about this could help me not forget that in this world, the only person I could trust is myself. And that no matter how much I don't like who I am, or where I am right now, or who I've become, that's definitely a thousand times better than telling someone everything and be disappointed they turned out exactly what you wished they wouldn't be in the first place.

They told to be more enthusiastic and happier, but I said thats just how I am (depression). Here I am in my apartment alone being depressed and miserable so Im back tracking all my behaviors to make sense of my situation. &amp;#x200B; Characteristics of myself: A) I dont know people, but I act like I do (psychoanalysis) B) Giving myself reasons to not be with someone (wall) &amp;#x200B; Why I am not genuinely interested in people. 1) They dont know me (which is a never-ending spiral) 2) Theyll judge me based on what I show them which is nothing (wall) 3) They dont provide any challenging concepts to consider, just mundane conversation. &amp;#x200B; The people that Im afraid to talk to 1) They have contagious positive energy 2) They just have eyes that seep into me, and I get scared because I feel like they can see through me, so I avoid eye contact a) What happens when I meet them: I start crying because I begin to feel again so I end up not talking to them &amp;#x200B; Why I dont take the first step to set the tone of what I want 1) Reaching out to people (vulnerability) something that Im also scared of &amp;#x200B; All of these are issues that make it hard for me to form relationships, mainly because Im terrified of being myself which is coated in pain and lacking a lot of love. With that said, why not just get out of your comfort zone right? &amp;#x200B; Out of comfort zone is: Me revealing to everyone my cry for help and how miserable I am deep down inside. &amp;#x200B; Comfort zone: poker face mask, shows everyone that Im fine and it creates constant anxiety for choosing to not represent myself fully. &amp;#x200B; Context: I am not unable/uncapable/or unwilling to have a relationship with my family. Its just that theyve proven to me for the past 19 years of my life they are incompatible people with very little to work with. This leaves me with only myself in a depressive state trying to leap forward to have better relationships. But all things considered above I run into these issues. &amp;#x200B; Solution: I dont have a solution unless Im willing to be vulnerable and cry like a baby in front of people hoping someone will want me. Until then, its going to be a day by day process going to the gym and lessoning my negative thoughts."

It's about feeling alone with one's own thoughts, afraid to tell anyone for fear of vulnerability, until you see them for what they really are -- just mere humans, also making mistakes. I sit in a porch of an empty house, Dusk passes, though I am longing of warmth. I stand here now, Nihilistic, stoic, or am I really? For the last pencil lead that breaks, The last cup of water that spills, Or the last small mistake I make May be the one that causes me to break. And you? What would you do? You are touched by endearment In a place sustained by resentment. And though you risk it all, You are hindered by your own falls, And by default, by reason I cannot recall, Gravity let's us stay down forever, by tether, by contraption without a lever. So I sit here, on a porch, and I ask of you, If we can sit together."

I have tried everything to keep myself busy but the moment I dont it rises up again. I am a solitary person, I dont have many friends - and those few friends I do have, I cant share my feelings with them. Most of them have always seen me as a strong willed person and has looked upto me to get themselves out of their depression, if they seem me break they mighty break too. Last I tried to share my feelings with someone I got backstabbed and they tried to utilise it as my vulnerability. I cant share my feelings with parents either they are too busy as a person. Alongside my depression, all the stress has piled up together and its getting too heavy for me to bear. I often started getting angry for no reason lately - these sudden bursts of anger have hampered my life in more than one ways, they lead to destruction of my stuff and self harm. Although I somewhat got myself out of self harm but I still cut myself every now and then out of anger. Not to mention I broke my laptop. I feel like giving up, cant bear this anymore but I am well aware that suicide is and will never be an option. I am so lost, I stopped feeling emotions - sadness and happiness, all I get now is those random bursts of anger against myself. I blame myself for everything. I feel like a living corpse. Depression is like fighting an invincible beast, you can keep yourself busy and it may be gone but the moment you dont it comes back again. And you keep on fighting until you die or you give up. "
198,vulnerability,depression,I cant go on like this. Trying to calculate the dose of Xanax that would be lethal for me. No judgments please.,1,b3m2dd,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/b3m2dd/i_cant_go_on_like_this_trying_to_calculate_the/,2019-03-21 15:10:12,"Ive checked online. Results are all inconsistent and say it would take a lot to cause an OD for someone like myself who has been taking it periodically on and off for a year. It says it fronts on height and weight along with tolerance. Im relatively small - about 53/54 and between 104-106 lbs. If anyone knows of a calculation for lethal dose or how to find it, itd be appreciated. Please dont judge me for this. I cannot tolerate this weight. It feels like my ribs and cracking in my chest and Im empty and I just cant. I have 0.5mg pills, I dont want to just take the whole thing because Im not sure it will be enough, so if I need to save up for a while to get enough pills Id rather do that - Ive had botched attempts in my early teens and I dont want this one to be a failure. Its kind of Ironic, Im in school to be a therapist and see patients and cant seem to apply this shit to myself. If youre judging me for wanting to find peace through death, heres my stupid long manifesto  that no one will give a shit to read, but I feel compelled to write; In my opinion, our concept of life and death is constructed - the only thing that makes death sad/ feared is the ability to mourn our own death. I know it would hurt my family and Im so sorry. I love them. I know I have potential and a lot going for me - but I just cant do this. Im hollow. This isnt living. Ive been through a lot of traumatic shit in my life and always managed to pull through until now. To my mom and brothers - I am so sorry. This will finally free me. Do not cry for me, build something better than I can from this. Find fulfillment and dont let it go. I love you so much and I am so sorry. On the outside things probably seem fine. Im a graduate student at a prestigious university, a high achiever, in the best shape of my life, and a hard worker. But now matter how much I accomplish, I am numb. I have been depressed before, I have attempted and self harmed. If I dont end it myself, Im sure my life will be cut short by some other means anyways. The idea of falling asleep in a Xanax induced haze sounds so peaceful. He gave me a taste and security and love id been craving my entire life and ripped it away. I was not dependent on him for my happiness, but now that I know what it feels like to be fulfilled - and knowing it is unlikely I will ever have that again - Its unbearable. I tried going back on a dating app today to boost my confidence and pull myself out of this 3 month hell Ive been in - only to find he has made a new profile too. I barely even looked at it. I swiped right knowing he probably wont reciprocate despite the mixed messages. How someone I fell so passionately and intimately in love with over the course of only 8 months could unravel my entire meaning in life is beyond me. I thought I was stronger than this. I finally opened myself up to someone and faced my fears - i found someone who was aligned with me in ways I didnt know were possible and the unexpected loss of that love and safety I had finally found is unbearable. For 3 months Ive had this weight on my chest. I cant eat or sleep. This is beyond heart break. Im not some teenager experiencing her first breakup. Im 23 and hes 30. Hes depressed too (or so he claimed), I gave him nothing but support and maybe that was part of the problem. he said he cared about me so much needed time to work on himself and I was cold when I should have been comforting. I regret so much of the way I responded. I waited until he closed the door to my apartment to break down. He was hurt badly a decade ago and that altered his view of commitment and his fears - we both come from broken homes and I thought We shared the same hesitation but also the confidence in our connection. If what he felt 10 years ago in his first major heart break was even half of what Ive felt the past few months - I understand his fear of commitment and why he kept himself from letting us progress once he got depressed and things got serious. If for whatever reason my attempt is unsuccessful, I will never again subject myself to this level of vulnerability and pain. It is not worth the destruction again. I cannot go through this pain and again and cannot imagine finding anyone else worthy of that risk. His decision based in fear isnt fair to either of us. I have no hope for the future. I may have a successful career if I stick around - hell, I could even make a difference somehow. But whats the point of moving through the monotony of existence if I know I will never feel the love and protection I tasted and lost? I am alive to appease my family and friends. But if I was gone, Id just be a sad thing theyd get through that would make them stronger. Maybe my purposes is to be the tragic side plot in someone else story. I see no future for myself, I cannot sustain this emptiness. I just need to go to sleep. I need to sleep and I dont need to wake up. All the success in the world will not give me the fulfillment I had even when I was just lying with him on the couch watching the Office for the 100000th time. Ive felt my happiness and hope and peace, and Ive had it ripped away - I dont need more. I cant see more. I dont want to fake it with someone who will never align with me the way he did. I regret so much. I know I pushed him away at times when he tried and I could have done more. I aborted our child, which seemed like the best decision for us at the time - but now that hes gone I regret that more than anything and feel the loss of that potential life each day. With him I was able to make peace with my choice because I had faith that when the circumstances we right, we could bring a wonderful child into the world together. Now that he left, I feel a sinking grief and shame that I never imagined. I regret aborting his child even thought it was the best choice for us at the time. I am mourning the fact that we will never again have the chance to create a life under better circumstances. We could have made it work. We didnt even consider it. I have made many mistakes in life, but none that I regret more than the way I was cold to him when he tried to have a conversation that resulted in our end and the hasty decision to terminate my pregnancy a few months prior to him leaving. I dont know if he was ever sincere - I made a dating app again at the request of my friends in an attempt to bounce back from this, only to find his profile on the same app. He said he wasnt sure he could give me a relationship Id want and wasnt capable of pursuing that when he was as depressed as he was - seeing now that hes on a dating app again saying hes looking for a reason to not just live for the weekend - I was the reason - we could have been that reason. We aligned so well - maybe even too well. I think neither of us were ready for the intensity of whats we had. I have never been so tied to another, I have never had my happiness depend on someone being in my life - but now that Ive felt it , the things that gave my life meaning before are like ash in my hands and on my tongue. No matter how much work I put in or how much I accomplish professionally, I feel nothing. He gave me hope that I could have a real life, a full life with the first man who ever made me feel safe and thats gone. I cant go through this again, I cant move on from this and I will never be the same. He gave me so much of myself back that I had lost. I will either end this peacefully by taking control or live the rest of my life solely to appease the people in my life. Im not alive, Im existing for the sake of others who, when Im gone will heal in time and rationalize this. I need this to end. TLDR: Im broken beyond repair. I cant fucking stand this pain. I love my family and friends and Im so sorry. But please, someone point me in the direction of a calculation to figure out how much Xanax I need to fall asleep and never wake up. Ive made my mark, Its time for my peace - Im not just doing this because of a breakup, that was just the event that solidified my truth: I will never have the love and family I dreamed of creating as a child, i May have a successful career but whats the point is theres no one to share it with. I never saw myself living a long life and I need my time to be up. Im sorry, its no ones fault but my own. I put myself in this position and I need to control the outcome. Thank you. "

This is going to be a VERY long post. Im too dumb to condense my feelings into smaller vents, and I feel like I need to get it all out in one big mess. Taking it from the top. Im a homeschool dropout who struggles with anything academically, like I have my whole entire life. Im so behind other people my age, If I was in public school and not dumb, I wouldve graduated last year. I feel like if I got somehow magically put into the public school system theyd have to put me back in middle school. Everyone whos taken it says the GED test is soooooo easy but Im stumped by even fake practice tests online. I feel pathetic and uselessly dumb. Thats not everything Im dealing with but its a start Im supposed to be the normal kid though. My older brother has many many mental health issues. Depression, psychosis, anxiety, many forms of personality disorders. He gets treatment for it all, he gets therapists and medicine. He gets coddled by my mother who is slowly morphing into one of the Facebook Autism moms (He has aspergers aswell, but I didnt want to list that under mental health issues). At 21 hes never had a job, tried to learn to drive, and is technically a drop out too (although theres a long frustrating story behind that). But nobody blames him, even I dont. Hes making progress with the help hes given and despite where he is now hes come a looooooooooooooooooong way. But that doesnt make it any less noticeable and something my parents need to handle on a daily basis. My younger brother is an asshole. He was homeschooled but convinced my parents to put him back in public school. He went from a generally cool kid who was at all the punk shows in the area that I could actually get along with, to one of those kids who spend 248297 hours on his hair and love earrape memes and slurs. Hes been getting in so much trouble lately. I put quotes because he doesnt actually get in much trouble for it. He uses awful language towards everyone in the house, stole a condom from my dad, has been caught with weed, lies to everyone, takes shit that isnt his, doesnt do his household work, and neglects his schooling. Then when he starts to get in serious trouble, he breaks down into tears and calls the suicide hotline which seems to scare my parents back into looking the other way. Its like hes using my older brothers actual suicidal tendencies and how theyve affected my parents. I dont believe hes depressed one bit. Theres no mention of it for months until hes called my dad a fucking asshole and gets threatened to get taken out of band class. Thats where I come in. Im the most level headed and rational kid. I feel like if Ive actually done anything right, its matured. Its nice being told that for the time being, but its placed a lot of expectations on me. After homeschooling went under, the entire responsibility of my education was put on me, despite it not working even with a teacher. Me and my dad really want me to get my drivers license already, but again, all teaching was put in my hands. Ive failed the permit test twice despite buying a whole online course and the huge amounts of effort I put in. I havent excelled at anything academically since 1st grade spelling tests, and somehow Im expected to do all this myself. And I get told Im lazy when I repeatedly fail and get more and more frustrated and unmotivated. This is ruining my confidence in myself. I feel like whenever I open my mouth I sound more like a cave woman who just discovered she can wipe her ass. I blame my lack of a vocabulary and experience in writing for my inability to tell how Im really feeling, like there isnt words to describe it. I try to tell them Im struggling, anybody. They all have different, yet equally unhelpful responses. My dad tells me to just focus and do it, my mom offers vague blame towards me for failing homeschooling, and my boyfriend OFFERS to help me study (I.e dont worry well both sit down and go over this drivers ed site together, and take notes together and go over them) but when I actually take him up on it, he flakes and tells me hes not comfortable with my methods when theyre literally what he suggested. (He doesnt have his permit either). He doesnt think its a big deal either, and is genuinely confused that I get so upset over him not keeping his word. (His excuse is that he never explicitly said that he promised, so its okay). Im being taken to try to take my permit test again on Saturday and Im just going to give up if I fail it a third time. I know this doesnt seem to have a lot to do with depression so far. But what Im getting at is I feel trapped, and dumb, and unmotivated and like nobody understands or truly wants to help. My self esteem is completely abolished. Im constantly scared of everything around me and whats going to happen, because I doubt Im smart enough to be prepared for it. And the fact that nobody has genuinely taken the time to help me, or even notice how bad Im struggling and how beaten down Im getting, is making my self esteem worse. Am I just not worth it to them? Am i just destined to fall behind in life. Ive bottled up so much emotions because Im too scared to vent to somebody, and then when I finally get the courage to be completely honest with my boyfriend, he coddles me for a bit when I talk about how I feel stupid and ugly. But when I get to the root of the problem and the lack of support Im getting. He goes quiet. The second any smidge of blame is put towards his direction, he suddenly has no words and needs to think on it. This has happened three times this month. The first two were late at night, after some arguement regarding the topic. And each time I sobbed and told him how I felt and he just couldnt say anything. He couldnt even muster up and words of encouragement or comfort anymore. He told me he couldnt think of anything to say, and then he went on like it never happened. The third time was yesterday. He had promised me again that hed help me study and just like the other times, flaked. And with a deadline so close and stresses high, I just couldnt handle it anymore. I had the biggest mental breakdown of my life. I never screamed like that before. I screamed and threw shit, I slammed my fist into the desk a lot. I just didnt want to do it anymore. He set me up to thinking Id finally get someone to rely on, and he disappointed me again. Im certain Im going to be a dumbass forever. I dont get support from anybody. I have one friend I can vent too somewhat honestly and even recently hes been using those moments of vulnerability to pepper in how wrong I was about that petty disagreement we had and how Im totally an asshole. This is the most honest Ive been about my feelings in years, Ive been working up to this for so long and Ive only been punished for it. I just let it all out in that one moment of frustration before breaking down into tears again. But it was absolutely worthless. My boyfriend got all sniffly and it ended with me comforting him. Telling him I went so out of line there and it was all my fault. It all meant nothing. He got what he wanted and Im left completely dissatisfied and feeling worse than I did the other day. No amount of effort I put into it myself works anymore, whether its regarding academics or emotions. I still fail tests, and I still feel alone. Im starting to just give up. Ive made zero progress from where I was last year. Confiding in people has only resulted in more pain and self hate. I feel nothing but pure stress 99.9% of the day, I just want to feel good about myself again, for anything. I feel stupid and replaceable to everyone in my life. Like if I disappeared theyd be over it in a week. All the things that require effort dont even work, Its starting to make me want an easy out. Im too scared to die, and the unhealthy dependency on any form of attention Ive developed makes me not want to kill myself PURELY because Id be too busy being dead to see my friends and family react to it. I want to just close this chapter of my life and skip to the next one. Then once Im a little further in I can go back to this arc. Problem is I cant actually proceed well without a GED or drivers license, so Im just completely knee deep in this shit situation. I dont even want to try to get them anymore, I just want to stop feeling like a petrified turd for a little bit. Even just a day. TL:DR I might have some undiagnosed learning disorder and my inability to meet expectations is making me depressed. None of my loved ones are making any attempt to help me and it makes me feel even more worthless. "

I'm isolating myself for quite some time now, I mean, I do meet friends occasionally but most of the time, I spend alone or with my mom. I'm 23 now, never had a girlfriend and each day, it hurts more and more. For a long time I thought it didn't matter, but it does. I feel lonely and envious of all the people in relationships. I'm losing myself in fantastic scenarios and otherworldly ideas like mysticism, magic, spiritual energy, becoming some sort of demigod. I know, it's really weird, but these are the thoughts I constantly have. I think of girls that I'd like to meet, only to find out they already have a boyfriend, would probably never be interested in me or simply that I don't have the guts to speak/write with them. Whenever I feel this pain, all these scenarios come up. I've always been into RPG and fantasy stuff and this is the world I'm escaping into. The fact that my reality is so much different sometimes makes it unbearable for me and I feel like I'm drowning in self-pity, demotivation and self-loathing. I always tell myself that I don't really hate me, but I don't like me neither. I can't even imagine myself being in a relationship with someone, simply because I have these weird thoughts and can't deal with my own vulnerability and weaknesses. A lot of people say it doesn't matter if you never had a girlfriend or if you're still a virgin, but to me, it matters now. I've become bitter, self-centered and full of hate and I feel like this is breaking me. I always decline the idea that I might be suicidal, but sometimes I just want to pull the plug.... It feels like there's no magic in this world anymore, which is why I'm always trying to escape into movies, tv shows, books or games or just my thoughts. When it's dark, I feel calm and sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and feel optimistic, energized and ready to do anything I want. But when the day comes, it just hurts. I already take my meds and they definitely help me, but I feel like the problem underneath hasn't been solved yet. I don't expect anyone to answer, I just made this post to get my thoughts down and reflect a bit. If someone feels like commenting, please apologize if I reply late or not at all. I'm grateful for every advice that someone can give me, please know that I appreciate it and will read it. Thank you."

My significant other had depression and as we got closer, there was more vulnerability and I became a shoulder to lean on. As time progressed, he eventually got better by getting the meds and help he needed and it makes me insanely jealous I guess. Hearing him talk about life like never before I wish I had that same outlook. I never got it diagnosed for myself because Ive never said it out loud to another person. I dont think I ever could no matter how much trust and comfort. So now I just watch him live his life and go back only to cry myself to bed at his happiness (after which I proceed to hate myself for doing that). Sorry its kind of pathetic "

They're a piece of shit, my father is the oldest, so he's always take care of his parents, his brothers, his sisters, they don't give a fuck and just took money and more money from his parents, my grandma died in 2007, that was a hard hit on my dad, he kept forward looking out for his dad, and well.. My grandfather isn't a very bright person, he beat my dad through his young years, never accepted my mother and preferred his other abusive kids, anyways my dad is not angry at him, and recently this past december, my grandfather got sick, and you know.. I was never close with him and during those last weeks I got to spent time with him, taking care of him, I made my amends with him of the anger i kept for him, none of my cousins he loved so much ever went to see him, my grandfather died weeks later, and ever since those days, my dad's been pretty low, sometimes I even think he has gave up to keep moving forward, my sister is desperate, my mother is.. She's tired, and I don't know what the fuck to do.. &amp;#x200B; My girlfriend broke up with me today, and for that I gotta say, it's my fault, I spent 3 years with my girlfriend, and everything was beautiful at first, but then it took a turn, a very bad turn, she comes from a very rich family, so from the get go her parents hated me, told her I had no future, I had nothing, that I didn't study at the best universities, at first she defended me, she stood by me, as time passed, she started to behave like them, to demand me stuff, to tell me what was wrong about myself, telling me it was my fault that I was in this situation, I started feeling bad, I started feeling so low like when I was a child, somehow the hate and the rejection of her parents reminded me of the old days of school, when no one wanted me around, it triggered a lot of memories, a lot of horrible conducts, I started going mad, working harder to give her the best presents, and it wasn't enough, I still was nothing to them and to her wishes, so as I mentioned, december was hard, even more cuz I met this girl, and in my vulnerability I ended up on an affair with her, and I started to feel guilty, I started to losing my mind, so I had to leave, I needed time for me. &amp;#x200B; Little note - She's not a bad person, she's just very much into the influence of her family and that's understandable, still I made a mistake, a big one. &amp;#x200B; I've been working hard to pay my title career, to help in my house, and today this girl i met in december accused me of abuse, she started this narrative that I was a toxic person that I emotionally abused her, she posted my darkest secrets online, my problems with drugs on the past, my potential psychotic suicide tendencies, she even said that the reason she felt so bad it was because I felt bad.. As if that wasn't selfish enough, my girlfriend broke up with me, which I totally deserve for my mistakes, though I really hate to be compared to an abuser or a sexual offender by someone who really just wanted to fuck my life. &amp;#x200B; I'm gonna tell you a little secret, I'm a screenwriter, my dream in life is to become a filmmaker, and getting out projects it's hard, I've been working on that, and I gotta be honest guys, I feel like I'm giving up, I feel like every step I try to make it's backwards, that the storm won't end, that the sea won't stop drowning me. &amp;#x200B; I'm thinking to finally kill myself tonight, the nightmares won't stop, I still have nightmares to this date of my childhood, I still can't get out of the anxieties, my dad is getting lost, mom too, and I don't know how to fight anymore, as it seems everything is closing terribly inside me, I am not crying anymore, I just want it to end. &amp;#x200B; I am disappointed on myself because I was never strong enough to face myself, to face my darkness, and now it feels like I've lost everything, now I only feel like a piece of trash. &amp;#x200B; I want to post this here, cause I don't know how to say this anymore. &amp;#x200B; Consider this my suicide note, I don't know, I don't know what the fuck Am I doing now, but I'm a fucking piece of trash. &amp;#x200B; I'm sorry to my mom and dad for not being the best, for not being good enough, for not being a normal person. &amp;#x200B; I'm sorry to my sister for being weak, I'm sorry.. &amp;#x200B; i'm sorry to my girlfriend, for my mistakes, I truly deserve this, and probably even deserve worse more. &amp;#x200B; I'm sorry to myself... For not being strong enough. &amp;#x200B; Thanks everyone.."
204,vulnerability,depression,"Full scholarship to college is being 100% WASTED on me. I am broken and have no direction in life... but I have hope, and you should too!",1,b9dois,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/b9dois/full_scholarship_to_college_is_being_100_wasted/,2019-04-05 01:50:49,"*I want to preface this post by saying that I love you all, and I really hope you all find peace in this endlessly confusing world of ours. All we have is each other, and the only things worth paying attention to in life are the things you love doing, the people that love you, and the people you love as well. I want this post to help as many people as possible while simultaneously being a place for myself to vent as well.* Since middle school, I learned to set my emotions aside for a long period of time and intentionally make an effort to be as distant as possible and focus solely on school. For a while, it *did* seem to work. However, getting out of high school and going to college made me realize how easy it is to realize that life really is quite directionless and entirely up to you. I never noticed that I had no plan, no ambition, and no actual goals. That scared the shit out of me. I took a second to look back at everything I had done in my early years as a kid in middle school and a teen with seemingly better, more enjoyable years in high school, and I just... absolutely broke. My mind had never crashed so hard before. All of the emotions that I had kept hidden away so well for so long were suddenly released, and I couldn't handle it. This was only about a month ago, by the way, and I am a junior in college, so it took me a couple of years to find my emotions. Endless tears pour out of my eyes on an almost daily basis now, and I have had no choice but to reach out to my amazing, lovely friends and family that I didn't realize were so invaluable to my life until now. More about this towards the end of the post. Anyway, in regards to the title of the post, I was awarded a scholarship at the end of high school that very few people receive, which pays for every penny of my tuition, and the rest of the costs were quite minimal and taken care of directly by yours truly. Today, I haven't been to class a single time since the first time I went in January. The same goes for the previous fall and summer semesters of 2018. I'm pretty sure I'm going to fail college this semester, and I just really have to take a second to emphasize how much I *fucking* **DESPISE** sitting in a classroom for long periods of time learning about something that I give goose egg shits about, and going home to do more work related to that same garbage. I mean I've been doing this shit since elementary school and I don't wanna do it anymore! This shit fucking sucks! Luckily, I'm pretty sure I reached a turning point in my life that has been pretty significant to me. In a recent bout of depression, I desperately tried to do some soul searching to find out what is wrong with me. Of course, I was so desperate that I was just typing my feelings on the world famous Google search bar, and checking out what results come up. I got so lucky. I found a text post on Quora that was asking a question quite similar to my own, and the first response to that question gave me some insight in to myself that I really needed. I discovered that my lack of any ambition or goals doesn't actually make me worthless. In fact, it makes me free! The reply states: &gt; ""Nice. Congratulations. &gt; You are on the path of discovering your own self. Only when you get rid of your ambitions can your ego disappear. When you are fed up and bored of the outer world, then only you will want to look inside. And only then can you find out the the answer to the question: ***Who am I?***"" The reply later states: &gt; ""You are in a better situation because you are aware of the meaninglessness of life. You know that there in nothing outside. It bores you. &gt; The thing is that ***we don't want to know ourselves***. Because we have been told that we should be *something*. Someone great. Some important, someone powerful and talented. And we know that we aren't. That is why we don't want to be inactive."" I won't insert too much of the reply itself in bits and pieces, but if you're interested in reading the whole thing yourself, [here's the link](URL It was an absolutely inspiring and hopeful read for me. It made me recall a video on YouTube I have previously watched, titled [""The World is Not as Your See It""](URL which goes into much detail about how meaningless everything really is, but, in short, ends with saying that humanity gives its own life reason. Humanity gives *itself* reason to exist. Meaninglessness soon becomes something to admire for me. Something to look forward to. Last but not least, this may come out of nowhere, and may not seem relevant at first, but it totally is. I recently gave a first time listen to Taylor Swift's ""Speak Now"", as I am an avid explorer of music, and find it to easily be my most enjoyable hobby. The album often explores many themes of love and affection, and I thought it was remarkably gorgeous and almost magical. Truly perfect in my eyes. So many honest feelings pouring out, it almost feels intimate. I finally realized that I *must* be missing out on love. Having never been in a relationship, I thought to myself, *What does it feel like to be so happy in your life with someone who you love who also loves you back? It must be so amazing. So mesmerizing, so wonderful.* I want that so much for myself. Songs like ""Sparks Fly"", ""Last Kiss"", ""Ours"", and ""If This Was A Movie"" really give me some perspective. I wonder if anyone really cares about these songs being too ""girly"" or something like that. I finally realized the most important thing of all. I am so afraid of being by myself. I need my friends. I need my family. I need them to be there for me and I want to be there for them for anything they may need at any time. Some may think that it's a corny thing to say or that displaying your emotions so outwardly would result in too much backlash or it's too risky or whatever... I didn't care. I did what I had never done before. I told all my close friends that I consider my brothers and my family how much they mean to me and how much I need them. I told them exactly what I wanted to because you really *do* only live once. Many tears were shed, many hugs were exchanged, and many intimate moments were had between many people on a godless rock floating in endless space. I'll say what I said at the beginning of this post: **All we have is each other**! Please don't underestimate the power of love and friendship. Go out there and tell your friends and family how much you need them. Tell them how much you love them and how happy you are to have them in your lives. It was by far the best thing I have ever done in my entire life, and that's why I felt I had an obligation to share with people who I may never meet myself, on the internet. Mark my words: Emotional vulnerability is more beautiful than I think people give it credit for, and I will never regret opening myself up to the world like this. I know that many of the people reading this may consider doing this to not be the easiest thing in the world. You may be saying, ""But it's not that simple, /u/Fat-Robo-Crap!"" I understand that many people's lives may be much more complex and harder than others, but just think about the possibilities! Open love for yourself and everyone around you, all at the cost of a few words. What is there to lose? Don't be afraid of embarrassment. In 100 years or so, no one will remember you anyway, right? I have hope that I will prevail against the odds I set myself against. All I want is happiness. All I want is to help anyone who may need it to see the light. No, I don't have a plan for myself at the moment, and I am still kind of directionless in life, but I know what I want and now I want to get up and go get it! I want love and I want lots of it! I think I'll figure something out soon. Whatever you do, if you don't feel that there's anything to fight for, fight for love. Thanks for reading."

Ive relapsed on my cutting, Ive been wanting to get drunk even though I absolutely cant with my medication and my heart just feels like its breaking over and over again. I go to therapy every 3 weeks and my sessions are mostly good because for the most part I usually am good. But suddenly I just went downhill. My therapist hasnt seen me in this kinda state since I was in high school 3 years ago, but shes never seen me cut before either because I was 6 years clean before my relapse. Usually in my sessions I keep it light hearted with sarcasm cause thats my way of coping with some hard emotions. Now I want to really talk to her about whats going on but its so fucking hard for me to open up to someone even my therapist. I dont want to cry in front of someone or look vulnerable but thats gonna have to happen if I want to talk about this, but I dont know if Im willing to do that. "

Im generally a confusing person, so it takes a patient person to really understand what point Im trying to get across. (My apologies. ) Today I hung out with some friends and people I really admired, but couldnt help feel my social anxiety and felt that I was perhaps unwanted. I understand that this thought may come across not helpful and likely not true, but my self doubt always takes over. I never felt I could find someone I could come to, and I always wanted to express my emotions to someone I trusted. I have close friends but I know that I would burden them with my feelings. I cant help but think things like No one wants to hear about my sad thoughts. It disrupts and totally ruins the mood and it makes everyone uncomfortable! (Of course not always the case) I know an appropriate time to be vulnerable with people and I thought I found the perfect time to share my thoughts to my sister. I got dropped off her place because I wanted to see her. I hate to admit this, but Ive always looked up to her. She got me through hard times and looked out for me, however,today she ignored me. I know she is going through a hard time herself and I know that she has her own life now. I feel selfish but for the first time I emphasized with her less. She seems not to care what I think and wont even let be be there for her. I wanted to spend more time with her but she clearly did not. She didnt want to deal with my vulnerability and ran to her boyfriend. I hate myself. I hate myself for being selfish and that I felt hate for my sister. That one day I will lack empathy and only think about myself. If you got this far, youre a saint. Im not usually such a Debbie downer but any advice or feedback is welcomed. Stay strong everyone. "
207,vulnerability,depression,Getting better can sometimes be exhausting,1,apxhld,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/apxhld/getting_better_can_sometimes_be_exhausting/,2019-02-13 06:57:30,"Within the arena of 'people who dropped out of university because of very poor mental health' I'm currently doing relatively OK - I teach an instrument 4-6 times a week, volunteer for 8-12 hours a week and work on my hobbies. There's a graceful martyrdom within this community for struggling through an obvious illness. But as I inevitably take the step back into the real world - off benefits into a real job again - it all seems so tiring. Every position wants a fantastically optimistic leader with great people skills, time management and resilience to stress. Long, long hours at places I don't care about beyond monetarily, that will be far less forgiving with regards to being crippled by a couple of nights without sleep. And this...forever? Until you retire and are possibly way past your prime in terms of enjoying lots of activities. Now I'm not at death's door I could think about dating again - and all the time spent getting to know people and entrusting yet another vector of emotional vulnerability to a distinctly callous world. And I enjoy seeing friends and family, but these things take it out of me as well. Money management, civic engagement, constant exercise, planning holidays, looking after people you know who aren't well either. Where does the energy come from? "

I don't think those people understand that yes there are positive aspects of certain drugs in the process of managing or similarly coping with mental illness, but promoting it is dangerous for those who have little experience with coping mechanisms and are in a state of vulnerability and will more than likely turn to those methods before seeking help, because I can assure you, seeking help is incredibly difficult for most - me included. So please, don't comment on my posts or anyone else's for that matter promoting the use of drugs, wanting to give support is perfectly great and is actually a wonderful thing to do, but be cautious in the way you do so.

210,vulnerability,depression,"Posted a very long thing about feeling depressed after comedian Brody Stevens took his own life on my Facebook (I know, I know) and a family member did exactly what Ive always been afraid of and belittled these emotions.",2,au1bz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/au1bz4/posted_a_very_long_thing_about_feeling_depressed/,2019-02-24 10:04:57,"Like the title says. Maybe I'll leave what I wrote in a comment or after this, but basically I've always kept this aspect of my life away from everyone. I never talk about it because I was always worried people would make fun of me, worry too much about me, or invalidate these feelings I've had forever. On the post itself she tells me simply to go to therapy. Like I never tried that. Then posts something herself saying ""stop killing yourselves, these feelings are temporary. Death is permanent"". I rarely go on Facebook, I don't even really understand why I did it. Maybe I should as looking to talk with someone, or maybe I just needed to vent? I don't know. But this really upset me, and sort of confirmed a lot of my fears about talking about this with people who don't get it. Like yeah, ok. I'll just freaking do that. I'll get right on not feeling like crap constantly. ______________ Here is what I wrote. For clarification, me and my wife split a couple months back. We are amicable, I'm sort of getting over it, but anyway. It's long, so I'm sorry: I hate this. I hate being vurnerable, I hate letting people in. I have depression. It's something I've always had. I went to a couple therapy sessions a ways back, something that I did not want to do ever. I always sort of known. I didn't want it to be real and have it be a thing to deal with. But I wasn't in the right state of mind. Dark thoughts that I've learned to silence for years had bubbled over to the point where it felt like deafening screams. Although from the outside looking in I have a ""justifiable reason"" to be depressed currently, these aren't new feelings. It's something that's always been with me. I've never felt right. I cut school a lot in middle and high school and it wasn't to be with some girl or to hang out with friends. Most of the time I would lay in bed staring at nothing or sleep. I've never felt like I was good enough. There are moments, not days, fleeting moments when I feel super motivated and ready to tackle on the simplest thing like making myself breakfast and then every other time when I really just want to lay down. Anytime I'm doing stuff is me forcing myself to do it to function. Because I've always refused to give credence to these feelings. I never felt like I deserved to feel this way. My life hasn't had turmoil. I had a very normal life with a very standard story. I've had love from my parents and family. There was nothing in my life that determined I should feel miserable. So I just told myself ""no, what the fuck is wrong with you? Man up."". I didn't talk about it. I became a master of emotional deflection. I hid behind laughter. I am good at making people laugh. Its like a fake it till you believe it thing, I guess. If I keep laughing I trick myself into thinking I'm happy. Probably why I always admired comedians. If I wasn't so shy and scared, I would be doing standup. I don't want anyone to ask me how I'm doing or how I'm feeling. Introvert with depression, asking me how I'm doing will cause the opposite of what you want. People want to make other people feel the ""right"" way. That's why my answer to the ""how are you"" is always going to be ""Awesome"". I don't want to tell you how I really feel. I don't want to tell you that I woke up and laid in bed staring at the cieling for three hours. The truth is I feel horrible and sometimes I don't know why. Sometimes there is a very clear reason, but more often than not it's something inexplicable. It just feels like there is something there, like a void inside of you. You do what you can to fill it, to satiate some need that you don't understand. So you eat, and you drink, and you ""self care"" till it hurts, and you bite and pick at the little bits of skin at the sides of your fingers till they become wounds then you pick and bite at those til they become holes till your fingers throb with pain every single second but it let's you feel something real, and you push people away because sooner or later they will see past your facade and see the hurt that is there and see you for the nothing you are and not want to deal with you or your pathitic bullshit anymore. I know this whole post is counterproductive to that want, but I'm not doing this for attention. This isn't a cry for help. This is just me... I don't know. Maybe this recent suicide by a person I somewhat admire in a string of suicides by people I admire shook me a little. I don't know them personally, but I do. I see myself in them. I recognize the pain. Like I try to look to see if there is someone like me who is just dealing with things and is hanging around. I want to believe it gets better, that at some point the voices screing at you telling you you're worthless just shut the fuck up permanently one day. That one day I will wake up rested and ready for the day. I want to have a day where I'm not constantly fighting myself. I'm tired. I'm saying this because I am told I should in my online group. Mental illness is something that is usually just ignored. I should know, I've ignored it my entire life. And I don't want people to worry about self harm either. I have seen enough of this world to know this is it. We all only get one shot at this, and I'm in no rush to expediate my time here. I'm not going to lie though. Sometimes I go to sleep and hope I don't wake up. Layla is the best thing to have happened to me. There are few times when I can tell you I felt legitimate joy and I was sure it was an actual emotion and not just me telling myself enough times to where I believed it to be true. Layla brings me pure joy. I love being a father, I love all the all the good times and all the headaches. Me and Nyisha are going to be doing our damn best to be good coparents. I don't hate her. Like at all. I legit moved on, but that's not to say I'm not sad about it all. And people will assume this whole thing is because of her, or want to assume that this is the reason we split. Like I said before, our reasons are our own. This has nothing to do with her, this is something that's always been present in my life. I'm just feeling defeated by these feelings more and more recently. Maybe it's because of those events, it may be because I'm just getting older, I don't know. I don't really know how to end this post. In a perfect world this was just me screaming into an empty void and goes unnoticed so that I don't have to talk about anything.

It takes up my mind so much that I can't sleep...sometimes I find myself so stressed and pissed I'm energized, and other times I find myself unable to sleep in spite of feeling exhausted. I think sometimes my mind just wants to vent, so I try to release my feelings through writing...but when I see the paper or the screen my mind shuts down. It's like I know what I want to say but the words won't leave my head. Sometimes talking at night helps and I used to do that with my best friend. We used to talk about stuff on our mind since we have the same woes, but lately she's been working shifts so it's hard for us to have phone calls. We are still best friends and we still text, but it's not the same instant relief you get with a direct phone call. So I've tried reaching out to two other people I've met but it's a dead end. They're both nice people but our communication styles just don't match. One is just...really stoic and reserved. They're not very good at talking and they've even said so a few times, and I understand completely. The other person is obsessed with talking about themselves and doesn't really listen to what I say, so I've been avoiding trying to talk about ""heavy"" stuff because I don't feel comfortable/like I can trust them with my vulnerability. So I'm trying to find other outlets to help. I guess guided meditation might help, so I'll try to find a video or something tonight. I tried showering at night but it doesn't work for me, and I've been walking/jogging almost everyday now. I was thinking maybe painting or sketching might do the trick, but when I tried it I ended up feeling energized because I'd be too focused on what I'm doing. So that's out the window. What are some things that help you with insomnia or help you pass out?"

Acting here like you feel no shit, you don't care for anything or anyone. All that while you feel the loneliest in the world and just want to disappear, for good. To end this journey. Death is calling me. Or am I the one calling it? Doesn't really matter. I just want to exist no more. It's funny how when he sat in frot of me I felt nothing at all, numbness. I could totally talk with him as with any other person  with a mask of politeness, happines and being interested in what a person says. But that was it. I did not desire to talk to him. It was rather the opposite. Kinda didn't know if it's okay to look his way so I tried to look elsewhere. So it is not true that i felt nothing. I was a bit uncomfortable. But as he started the few second long conversation I acted, as I already wrote, as he is just some friend who i am polite to when we met after some time. I did however wondered how he looks at this given situation. I came to conclusion that quite similar as me. That I am just one of his friends that he talks to when they met. Not ex. Not as a girl he likes. Not as a girl he regrets of letting go. Not as the girl he is getting over. Just a person that happens to be there and is the opposite sex than himself. I was slightly high from the chilling in the afternoon and drunk form the beer I was drinking there so I do not know how surely I can say that I am over him. I mean, over him, that I do not crave to get back together with him. It will stil take quite some time to heal. But it is a progress. Even tho I wish he'd miss me. I don't know why... I guess cause I still feel so worthless and I hate myself. Once I change that I expect that I don't need approval from anyone else but me. That does not mean that I ain't gonna be happy if I do get it from others, that always feel nice. But I won't feel like shit when I couldn't get it. Funny how I started with writing about numbness but right now I feel ache heartache. Grief. Regret. Sadness. Loneliness. I wish to be loved. Specially by myself cause I think that would change my life profoundly. But here I am self sabotaging me again and again like a fool. Sometimes it look like i actually got my shit together but it doesn't last. Sooner or later I fall back into bad habits of mine. And I hate it. As I do myself. I miss him. Or at least an idea of him. Or good memories that won't stop messing with my head. It's funny how I know he done me wrong and even if I'd change in all possible ways it couldn't work yet I still think about him in this loving perspective and see this hidden (or fake???) tender and true side of him that I only have witnessed couple of precious time. I believe (or am naive?) that there is this part in him that just isn't ready to uncover as it could be easily destroyed by anyone wou'd saw it cause people like to use vulnerability. I can feel this part of him and know it wishes to be expressed but doesn't know how, is afraid to and not ready cause it's so much work. And I see it being suppressed buy ego and fear of unacceptance. And it makes me cry. Or I just see what I want see. It doesn't really matter as I am not to find out. I'm a messy mess."

Ive been trying to take steps to help myself, and have recently started going to therapy again. My next session isnt for a while and I could really use some support, preferably from friends and not hotlines. How do I ask for help without feeling like a burden to people I care about? I wouldnt ask if I hadnt tried fixing this all on my own, and feel like I have nowhere to go. Because of the shame I feel about my vulnerability, I dont want to not be self sufficient. At this point I know that I need to seek support and, admittedly, validation as well but I dont know where to start. I do trust my friends, and they know Im going through it right now, I just wish they would check up on me. With nowhere else to go, I feel stuck trying to figure out how to express my feelings because it isnt anyones responsibility to be there for me. I just want to be told that things are going to be okay, but it feels like too much to ask. "

I've cut and burned and hit myself so many times over the past 9 months or so. I can only force myself out of the house to get groceries, which inevitably ends up being nothing but rice and some vegetables which is all I ever eat. I frequently oversleep when I'm not kept awake by some small, insignificant thing I did or said years ago. Despite all this and even more, I'm still afraid to admit that there is something seriously fucked up in my head other than a pervasive sense of laziness and self-loath. Whenever I even begin to consider that I might be wrong, this nagging voice in the back of my head starts rattling on about how I'm a piece of shit for trying to blame this on anyone but myself, how talking to anyone about what I'm going through would be a waste of their time, how they probably don't even care enough to listen and just tolerate me because they're too nice to tell me to fuck off to my face. It's just too hard to buck this feeling that the only reason I'm in the position I am is because of the way I've taken every opportunity I've been offered and fucked it. For so many people, reaching out and asking for help is the hardest part of dealing with their woes, but I've always thought that has to do with the stigma that somehow still exists and with the difficult notion of projecting your vulnerability, not with this bullshit."

My ex girlfriend became very abusive when she realized she could use my vulnerability against me to get her way. It was to a point where I became her puppet. I was so afraid of losing her at that time that I was ready to do everything she wanted me to. All that because I knew if I let her go I would end up on my own. But at some point things got so ugly between us that I thought I would be better on my own because she was a real threat to my mental state. One day we had an argument about my situation and I decided to let her go. But now after a few years on my own, the lack of human contact/touch makes me feel like I have made a big mistake letting her go. She wasn't the best girlfriend for me but at least she wanted to stay in my life. I don't think I can ever find something even close to that again. I feel like I fucked up so bad."

I feel like I have tiers or more like emotional shells that I assign to people. Distant acquaintances are allowed past my first social wall. Friends can get closer to me and have access to more of my emotions and therefore vulnerability. My close family members like my parents and girlfriend are in the closest circle. I like to think that I tell them everything but I dont. I hate myself and I hate a lot about other peoples choices. Im so critical of behaviors and interests if someone likes a social activity that I believe to be shallow and superficial I push them out to a further level because I see them as ego driven and a megalomaniac. Ive been diagnosed with both anxiety and depression and there have been many hurdles Ive had to get through but the deepest struggle is finding a true companion. I feel like I have never found an individual in this world that sees things the way I do. My pessimism is almost a religion for me but its also the source of my depression. I believe that I can overcome by being a better person. Being kinder and more accepting person. Disciplining myself to worship a better me and therefore become a better self. Ive become very successful socially and I know what to say to make people happy but deep down Im bitter and angry at everyone. I see Instagram posts and have to isolate and rant about how everyone is fueled by vanity and social validation. I know I can be the product of my own issues but it hasnt been something I have been able to shake. I feel alone in the deepest layer of my emotional boundaries and at the core I feel like a good person. My depression initially came from an addiction to attention. I see others falling victim to vanity and self worship and I cant accept them into my life.

222,vulnerability,depression,Having distracting thoughts on negative experiences,1,ai9ofp,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ai9ofp/having_distracting_thoughts_on_negative/,2019-01-21 23:31:40,"This is a throwaway account, and I wrote something rambling. Was hesitant to post, because it is so long, even after editing. Not expecting any replies, just felt like venting. &amp;#x200B; I have dysthymia. I don't have major depression, but almost every day for many years, I feel useless or hopeless, and have barely any self-esteem. I have no special or rewarding job, future plans, or constructive activities, and I'm pretty isolated. Most of my free time is spent looking for passive stimulation to pass the time. One intrusive problem I have is, when bored or doing something routine, like washing dishes or watching the news, or even when I'm going to sleep, my mind will fixate on any of a number of negative experience from the past. It will replay the experience over and over, and each time it replays, the associated negative emotions get more and more exaggerated. I will think about what I should have done differently, what I might say to the people involved if I saw them now. It can be a while before I can get my mind to move on to other thoughts, and it might even sit in the back of my mind for the whole day. It's mentally distracting. Does this happen to anyone else? I talked to some family members and they say it doesn't happen to them. For them, if they think of a negative experience from a long time ago, it only lasts a moment and then they forget about it. &amp;#x200B; Most of these events deal with me failing to stand up for myself. The associated feelings are embarrassment, vulnerability, and cowardliness. I think a contributing factor to why the memories keep coming back is related to where I am in life. Since I have little to look forward to, when my mind starts to wander, maybe it fixates on the past. And most of my strong memories of the past are negative. It also doesn't help that new negative experiences and regrets continue to happen, as is part of life. Positive experiences should also be occurring as a counter, but I don't have many of them. I was a scared kid in those older experiences, thinking of running away from confrontation. And today still feel like I'm still that same kid. &amp;#x200B; I'll give an example, and you should probably stop reading here if you have other things to do. &amp;#x200B; Growing up, the slightly older neighborhood girls weren't very nice to me. They would babysit or watch over the much younger kids when all the neighborhood kids were playing in the shared yard. I was about 9, and over multiple days, the girls instructed a toddler to hit me. Later, the toddler kept doing it on his own. I ignored it because it didn't hurt and the toddler just threw a couple punches before running away. The one time I reacted, a couple weeks later, I grabbed his arms after he kept on going and going. He fell down after pulling away, started crying, and went home. The next day, I was riding my bike in front of his house. His dad came out, yelled out a sentence, threw my bike behind a bush, and went back inside. It happened so fast, so I was just standing there, and then it was all over. Afterwards, I didn't tell anyone, and didn't have the courage to knock on the door and tell the dad my side of the story. I also wondered if the girls told the parents a different story, since they were babysitting him and probably wouldn't want to get in trouble. &amp;#x200B; Looking at it from so many years later, the incident seems pretty insignificant, and shouldn't be making me feel so bad today. No one got physically hurt, the dad's intimidation only lasted like 15 seconds, and he didn't put his hands on me. The girls became nicer, or at least polite, when we got older. Other than me, I'm guessing everyone involved probably doesn't think about it anymore. But when the event repetitively plays in my mind for up to a whole day, the emotions get built up and just simmer. Cognitively, I know I should be able to reason away the thoughts and emotions, but it just sticks there. &amp;#x200B; The sadness from how mean the older girls were at the time. The fear of that dad during those 15 seconds, even though he never yelled at me again whenever I saw him. The embarrassment that I didn't verbally defend myself at the time, or wondering what if that whole family thought I was a bad kid this whole time. Feeling incompetent that I didn't have the intelligence or skills to tell the parents or his older brother (who was one of my playmates) what was going on before it got worse. I also wonder if the toddler may have developed behavioral problems, because he always looked so angry, and he continued to act out for years to come. So there's a degree of guilt, that maybe his behavior could have been corrected if I had said something. And then, at the age, the realization that the world and human beings don't have to be fair. Especially so, because the dad was a judge, and as a kid I was thinking either such a person could be unfair, or that maybe I was the one at fault. &amp;#x200B; So anyway, if a normal person were in my shoes, they would think ""that was unfortunate but not important now"" and move on, and go about their day. But not me, it sticks in the back of my mind for the whole day. And it doesn't have to be this one event. If this event never happened, it could be some other incident that gets stuck in my mind. &amp;#x200B; But it's not just problems of letting go of a minor past event. As an adult, I still feel like that scared kid with no self-confidence. For example, giving one of my dollar menu burgers to a panhandler outside a fast food joint, he starts loudly cursing about wanting more, and I don't say anything because I'm afraid of confrontation, and walk away. Or after apologizing for accidentally walking into an area that had just been mopped in a laundromat, and the employee continued to yell at me and said obvious lies about how the machine I was using was for women. I didn't say anything back because I felt like running away. &amp;#x200B; I think my train of thought is losing focus and I'm too tired to keep editing to shorten this post. Sorry it's so long."

That one is going to go far, just you see."" Meet the inside me: told my friends I'd spend Sunday studying but actually I spent all of Sunday crying under the bedsheets, chest freezes up with panic whenever someone compliments me because that means I have new expectations to live up to, didn't tell anyone yet that my mother died three weeks ago because I'm frightened of vulnerability, isn't all that smart but studies like my life depends on it because it *does*, because without a direction in life or something to seize onto, I might as well stop existing. If I give up now, I know I'm never going to pick up the pace ever again. I feel like I'm an actor whenever I'm out in the public eye, with friends especially. The person they know is so completely different from the person that I truly am, and it hurts to know that they would never like me in the same way if I revealed my inner emotions to them. These friends are people who disparage mental illness, saying that most of today's depressed are just yesterday's lazies, value a hardworking ethic and talent and general excellence, and here I, the epitome of their disgust, am masquerading as one of them. And these friends actually look up to me. Me! A secretly depressed, medicated, nihlistic bastard that regularly spends hours laying in bed staring up at the ceiling, instead of, you know... going outside or something. The prospect of university scares me so badly that sometimes I feel like I can't breathe, but I plunge blindly onwards to keep up this faade of false confidence, of being a productive individual, in the face of my friends and my poor dad. It's too late and I can't stop now. The sensation of a rollercoaster slowly ascending, only to go flying off the tracks as it falls fills my aching bones. I'm an impending trainwreck. A man on thin ice. All of this, driven by that wretched, false persona I've built up over the years...

Besides, what even is there to me if not for that persona? Nothing. In reality, I am nothing."

Wanted to get your thoughts on something. Over the past couple years, as emo has seen a new revival in music in the form of emo rappers like Lil Peep, XXXTentacion, Juice WRLD, Joji, and many (many) others, so has risen the popularity of the depression aesthetic. Whether it be [cute little hats with Depression and a rainbow on them,](URL [tongue-in-cheek sweatshirts that say I am ok](URL (sorry that links in German. dont know how to fix it.) or [HOPE IS GONE long sleeve shirts](URL the depression aesthetic seems to be very prominent. - Ive heard a lot of discussion about this on both sides of the coin, those against the fashion making the point that depression, in its grim reality, is *not* beautiful. Its dark, lonely, ugly, and scary - and many believe that turning it into an aesthetic leaves people who may not have struggled with it before with a watered down view of depression. They want people to see depression as a serious condition that deserves more attention and care, not an edgy gen-z fad. On the other hand, and this is where I mostly fall, many people see fashion as a form of self-expression not unlike music, painting, and cooking. (Im biased - I like cooking.) They view the aesthetic as a way of finding catharsis - it helps (in my case) curb the feeling of loneliness when you see someone else who seems like they may understand where youre at, or at the very least, it helps you connect with people who have similar tastes to yours. Hell, its more of a pastel-aesthetic, but I just wore my Teddy Fresh sweatshirt to the optometrist today, and my doctor was *super* cool and mentioned she had the same sweatshirt - turns out her and her husband are huge H3 fans, and we might all be going to catch a drink soon! I find that the depression aesthetic helps me find expression and catharsis. But this is just my opinion. I havent done nearly enough reading on it, and Im super curious on what you lot think. - What are your thoughts on the depression aesthetic? Are people who take on the style watering down the public image of depression, or are they making themselves feel better through that form of self expression? (Or both?) What of the people who *make* these clothes? Are they exploiting peoples sadness, mental health, and vulnerability to make money - or are they helping to spread and artform that they enjoy and help popularize a style? Cheers!"

I wish I could rip the flesh from my bones and live as a faceless skeleton, ripping the very essence of me out and throwing it away. I am such a sad excuse for a human, a shell. I dont feel like Im a part of me, my mind and my mouth are two different worlds constantly fighting for who I want to be. I cant believe the things I say and do. Im so completely stupid its funny. Its honestly bimbo dumb. I am an actual idiot who mentally cannot understand the most simple things in the whole entire world. My stupidity amazes me, the things I actually say AMAZE me that someone could actually be that dumb. I should shut my mouth forever. Everything I say is pointless and weird. This is pathetic. I have no absolute idea how I have a single friend. They all talk about me I know it. Like how awkward I am, do they not think I know that!!!! Do they not think that I think about every word and action I make for the next days upon days, analyzing everything I did??? I hate being me, I honestly cannot express that enough, I hate being this pea brained, body obsessed, weakling. It makes me so angry that I was giving this amazing life and I want nothing to do with it. How could I possibly think that? How much of a horrible person can I be to not want this gift that was given to me. But at the same time, I am meaningless, my whole like is meaningless, I will die and be forgotten and it will be like I never was even here. There is no point in doing anything!! No one is happy every one is sad about something, is that what I have to look forward to? A life of setting waiting to die. A life or days bleeding into the next, a life not worth living. I have no future, I dont even bother making plans for the future. I dont care what I do today, tomorrow, next week, next year. I dont care if I graduate, I dont care if I go to college, I dont care if I die. Wanting to die gets thrown out there way too much. Any minor inconveniences and a bunch 13-25 yr olds say they want to die. They want to die because they have homework due tomorrow or that they cant find the right outfit! It makes me so mad. Now anyone in that age range who says that automatically is brushed off as a joke. Not to be taken seriously. Ever other teenager/millennial is depressed, they throw it out there as a sympathy card. To get someone to care about you. The word is losing its power. Its turned from a serious mental illness to a fun quirk that makes boring people deep and interesting!!! I dont mean to sound like I am god of depression like Im better because its real. I really dont even like the word depression its so clich, but in my OPINION based on my own PERSONAL experience, I cant bring myself to physically be interested is anything. I cant focus and remember things. I dont cry, I just blank out for hours. I blank out just breathing and thinking 1 million miles a minute about everything at once, paranoia, bulimia, just wondering if I will ever amount to anything ever. And then I go home and climb over the mountains of clothes and trash and plates and cups that Im too lazy and exhausted to touch, and get in my bed, then watch tv and fall asleep and live the same day over. Sometimes I hang out with people which is my worst nightmare. Speaking out loud trying to communicate terrifies me. And then right after I say anything I want to curl up in a ball and jump out the window, so some times I just say nothing, and then Im boring, and then I panic about how boring I am, its a never ending cycle. I just want to sit in my room in the dark for the rest of my life. Im so paranoid that everyone is always trying to leave me. I have been left and ditched so many times, I try not to let anyone in anymore. They all leave, they all eventually realize how incredibly ugly and fat and stupid I am, then leave. It hurts, I never ever show how much it hurts. I hate vulnerability more than anything in the entire world. I hate my souls and mind being read by someone I know. Im scared they will leave me too. Im so tired of bulimia, so genuinely tired of living like this, just stop?? You say, I cant!! I try and try and Im just not strong enough, see pathetic right??? Okay I am finally done Im so sorry to anyone who read this and wasted the BIGGEST about do their time. "
229,vulnerability,depression,I guess I don't want to give up yet?,1,a6os7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/a6os7e/i_guess_i_dont_want_to_give_up_yet/,2018-12-16 23:51:36,"Don't know if anyone will actually read this, but it feels good to write it down regardless. Basically I'm having a hard time of it the past couple of months. I have had anxiety and depression to varying degrees since adolescence but probably never this bad. Several months ago my girlfriend of almost 2 years and I broke up. She cheated on me multiple times, which really decimated a lot of my self esteem. I already had issues trusting people, but this girl was someone that I had completely opened up to. All of the stupid details of our relationship don't really matter I guess, but suffice it to say that she was the one to advance our relationship generally...until she decided she had fallen out of love with me. Things are a little complicated by the fact that she was my first for everything, so I can really only associate a lot of experiences with her. Now, I have been trying to make a lot of positive changes since that time, but man it's just really hard sometimes not to be down on myself. I drink quite a bit and have been a daily weed smoker for a couple years now. I don't really have much of a life right now. I go to university (on break currently)--most of my hobbies are more solo-type. I am absolutely the sort of person that tends to live in their own head a lot of the time, but there's just a lot of unpleasant memories and thoughts I get that I just want to escape from lately. Some of things she told me over the course of our breakup really cut me deep--especially since I would do almost anything for her. Just her playing on some of my insecurities, or maybe just her very cavalier attitude while she could see that I was in shambles over how our relationship had played out. I have some good friends that have been incredibly supportive of me over this period of my life, but I also don't want to be a burden to them--especially after it has been a few months I feel like people think I should be moving on already. I do want to move on, but I don't have much experience or inclination to put myself out there. Being lied to sucks, many fold over when its from the person you are closest with. Sometimes I wonder if I ever want to put myself in that same position of vulnerability with another person again--of trusting them to be honest with me and not mess around behind my back. Typing this out just makes it sound like a chore. Anyway so yeah. I am pretty lonely these days because all my friends have gone home for the holidays, which I am delaying for various reasons. I also can't sleep for shit lately--probably got 4 hours a day for the past few days. I'm grappling lately with the idea that I'm just boring...and maybe unlikeable. I'm kind of a people pleaser a lot of the time, and my anxiety makes it really difficult for me to try new things sometimes. I went back to therapy after my breakup, and that's been moderately helpful. I have antidepressant meds I take as well, but they are not a silver bullet for my issues. The crux of my current state is just frustration I suppose. I desperately need the effort I put into things to translate into results; I am really just tired of waiting around doing nothing and feeling sad. I used to be a really creative person: writing and drawing all the time without this crushing self-awareness. If anyone actually read all this, props to you. &amp;#x200B;"

For years I have studied psychology in depth and even though I deny it, I perfectly line up with the description. Everyday I wake up I wonder why I do. Since the age of 18 I have felt dead inside. I cannot express any emotion. I just know that I feel like a fraud. Ive recognized that every one of my friends are supply and nothing more. I can cut them off without feeling a thing. My closest friend since 2nd grade, or at least I like to perceive it that way and I got into a fight and I finally cut him off because in my mind I cannot see others points of view. Im pathological, manipulative, in denial and am afraid of the world. I wake up everyday afraid of myself because I know that who I think I am, is not who I actual am Is there a point to me living? Dont say you need a diagnosis. I have been to many therapists and have been told Im narcissist. I have tried antidepressants, natural supplements, as well as working out and eating healthy. I cant escape that fact that people think Im burden and Ill never be who I want to be. Im just scared of my extreme vulnerability and the trauma of that is so heavy its not worth it. I can write a novel with the information about myself and life but Ill leave it there. Feel free to ask anything as this is my anon account and Im more than okay with discussing my issues"
233,vulnerability,depression,I need help- dealing with depression and wanting to run away,1,a9370j,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/a9370j/i_need_help_dealing_with_depression_and_wanting/,2018-12-24 19:12:39,"I need serious help. Im crying and hyperventilating as Im writing this and I have no idea what to do. I completely do not trust the people around me, and the small number of those whom I think will not babble about the crap Im going through do not understand, even for a single second. They dont understand that I cant help and choose the way I feel, that I dont have choice in my anger and sadness. I feel trapped and like the world is closing on me, and the only way for me to be free is to just end it all. But thats not the problem that I want to talk about. I suffer from severe depression, Ive been diagnosed by my doctor this year because Ive finally turned 18 and can have private sessions with my doctor without my overbearing mom making up bullcrap about my feelings. I knew that Ive had depression for 10 years now, but never had the chance to talk about it or get it treated. A little backstory about me: Im an 18 year old college student here in the US who immigrated here so that my parents can pursue a phd degree. Youd think that because they have phDs in the science area, theyd be more understanding and maybe even better parents. My family is bound strictly by religion and culture, and will always base off their decisions for my life off of cultural expectations. Ive lived more than half my life here in the US, and have went through numerous things such as the death of my best friend and grandparents, as well as frequent bullying and sexual assault when I first came here with no background of the English language. Ive never once told my parents about the crap Ive went through, and to this day I have not confided in them. The reason for this is because every time Ive attempted to actually confide in them, they always found a way to push it back to me and blame me and have me reflect on my own faults. Ive stopped trying to even hold a meaningful conversation with them. I rarely ever show my vulnerability and sadness in front of them due to this as well. Growing up, i barely spent time with them due to their studies and work. I dont have any sort of close bond with them and our relationship keeps on getting worse. I barely was allowed to go out and have a sense of independence, if i did go out they closely watched over me and had lots of rules and restrictions that made me hate going out. My mom blames me for every single thing that happens in her life. She constantly curses me and yells at me, never a word of encouragement coming out of her mouth. She yells at me because I sleep too much and am the worst daughter because Im failing in my studies, and am not like the perfect daughters from other families in my community. Last year my best friend, the only one I ever told about my suicidal tendencies passed away 5 minutes after we met up for lunch. I cried the first day, but the other days I would not let myself mull over any of my feelings. My parents think that Im some robot, a person incapable of feeling anything. They always tell me that Im using excuses, and dont really feel sadness and sympathy and Im only a selfish daughter. Ive never used any excuses against them, never told them I cant do anything because of her death, or any other reason. They make up their own explanations for my behaviors and never consult me or even attempt to understand. Ive always had suicidal thoughts and they increased the past year, to the point that I think about dying everyday, and always go to the kitchen and stare at the knife for minutes, before I pull myself together to sleep off all of my negative emotions. After going to the doctor this year, I was prescribed antidepressants. My mom somehow found out the moment i picked them up from the pharmacy, went through my entire room to find them and took them away. She laughed and started yelling to me about how i need to stop lying and being dramatic about how i dont have depression and have no right or reason to be depressed, that Im just begging for attention. I havent seen the medication since the day I first brought them, and so I wasnt even able to start getting treated. Ive lost my scholarship and my grades are just crumbling, and Im attempting to appeal back for it, because my parents do not want to waste their money on a failure of a daughter. I just had an argument with my mom, her yelling at me and cursing me and my future of happiness, her threatening me that she does not wish that I will have happiness in the future, that she wishes I will only face suffering from now on. For the past couple of years, all Ive heard from her were her prayers against me and my happiness( funny that I havent been properly happy for a long while, so she didnt even have to pray for it, it has been happening). My mom just threatened me and told me that by the end of next semester, shes going to destroy my future and send me back to my home country, so that she can have a tighter leash on me. All they ever want to do is control me, and theyve told me countless times that they will forever continue to control me and have a say in my life. What makes me so frustrated and angry is that, Ive never done anything against them. Ive been doing the best I can, I barely go out and even see my own friends, Ive never participated in any activities that could have people talking about me or my family. They continue to tell me that Im worthless, a failure and a horrible person. Im so frustrated that I cant even talk, theres so much sadness and anger that nothing I ever say will ever be able to represent it. My country is sexist and controlling, and is even facing a political struggle between different groups of people. If they send me off, I already know what my future will look like. A forced marriage, a forced career, and forced actions and even clothes. I want to live not because Im thinking of my  loved ones. I dont give two fucks about anybody, I dont care about anyone anymore, Ive stopped caring and wasting my energy and love towards loving and caring for others when I dont even love myself. I want to live for myself, the 8 year old girl whos still crying herself to sleep without anyone knowing. I want to give her a chance, but with my uncertain and controlled future, I feel like Im chained and I wont ever be able to get out. I have no savings, nothing to my name. I have no credit, was only allowed to work for 2 months before they told me that it was worthless and disrespectful to have their daughter working a part time job. No connections, no money, no support, and barely a will to live. Talking will not solve the problem I have with my parents, it will only further solidify their resolve to send me back overseas to be dealt with better and have more control over me. Im scared, alone, and I have no idea what I should do. The only way I can think of so that they dont send me back and force me into a life I am not willing to live, is for me to run away. I dont know what to do, what my plan should look like or anything. I dont even know what type of actions I should take, or even the questions to ask on here. So sorry for the long post, its the only and first time Ive ever been honest with myself and the things Ive went through. "
234,vulnerability,depression,I am not well.,1,a9h0gv,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/a9h0gv/i_am_not_well/,2018-12-26 05:22:28,"Something is not right with me, it never was, not in the first memory I have of my life was it ok, but it has been continuously getting worse for the past 6 years or so. I know that this feels too vague and hard to understand, and that is actually a big part of the problem; I can't communicate well to other people at all, I am exceptionally bad at self-expression, I can't make other people understand what it feels like and what I'm thinking. This makes me feel so alone, so isolated. I don't like being like this, I don't like living in this desert life where there is no one else. But I have always been like this, there has never been someone else I ever build a lasting bond with, I'm 28 years old now and I have never had close friends in my entire life, to say nothing of a special romantic someone. But it's not just that the problem, even if I had someone that deeply cared and understood me, I know deep inside that I still wouldn't be ok; there is something fundamentally wrong with me right at the base. I know that the word 'bullying' is often used lightly, but I don't know another word to describe all the severe abuse I went through in school. It was very severe and very continuous, I would get beaten and ridiculed by other students, they just looked at me and knew I was different and disturbed and that made me a target, because they knew I was weak. I was isolated, put aside from the rest, not approved by the group. Now I can't connect with other people, and I can't trust then. But there is more than that, I just can't think most of the time. I am stuck in cycles, harmful and negative thoughts that keep repeating themselves over and over in my head and that I cannot move away from no mater how much I want to. Sometimes I'm remembering bad things that happened to me in the past, sometimes I long, sometimes I'm envious of how happy other people are, sometimes I'm thinking of that one person I really wished for and that I will never see again, sometimes I think of everything that could have been if I didn't have these problems; most of these thoughts result in inescapable anger and irrationality, and even though I know that they are bad for me, I can't stop thinking about all of this. I'm a student, I have been in university for 8 years now, I can't graduate because I can't write my monograph. Every time I try to write I get overwhelmed by something bad that I can't explain, I don't know if it is anxiety or if it is something else; I just know that I can't get a word down. This gets coupled with how difficult it already is for me to communicate and express things, writing is just way too hard. And not being able to graduate is a huge problem. I have been employed on and off. The best job I ever had was as a teacher, I was actually relatively good at that, I really love teaching and I don't want to lose that; but to continue doing that I need to graduate; else I lose everything and won't get a job as a teacher ever again. And I can't graduate, I can't do it, mid-2019 will be my last chance to have the monograph ready for a defense and I just know that I won't be able to make it again. What I saw myself as when I entered university, it was so different, so much more positive, I had so many hopes. I thought things would get better. I thought I would eventually get a PhD. Now my colleagues who entered university on the same classes as me are already entering PhD programs, while on my side everything is falling apart. It's not just depression and it's not just the abuse and isolation and it's not just this fundamental irritability, it's so much more, it's too much; it's a whole life worth of problems that I can't even talk about. I have been seeking help as best as I can for the past year or so. I have consulted with two different psychiatrists, and I have been in therapy for the past two months, it's not helping, I feel worse. Please I beg whoever is reading this, don't think that I'm being dramatic or exaggerating. I feel agony and torment, this suffering is real; even if I can't explain it, even if I can't make anyone understand it, I still feel it. Something is wrong, I am not well. Talking is harmful, talking is making it worse, because I don't feel safe and because it opens up old wounds. Therapy is a bad place to be in, you are putting yourself in a position of vulnerability, you are telling your secrets and your intimacy at the risk of being judged and diminished and belittled. My emotions are a mess and it's more than what I can put order to and rationalize, even the smallest thing the therapist does that upsets me makes irrationally angry at him for long periods of time; and I get stuck into these cyclical thoughts. But it's a contradiction, because now I need to talk because I need someone to help me understand what is going on. Right now this is more than anything else what I want, to just understand this, to understand what is going on that is so wrong in me."
235,vulnerability,depression,The Moment I Realized,1,a9iwyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/a9iwyy/the_moment_i_realized/,2018-12-26 09:25:59,"**Trigger Warning** Sexual and physical abuse I've always struggled with depression. I'm not sure when it started but looking back, I can't seem to remember a time when I was alright. When I was a kid, maybe. I'm 25. I was 8 years old when the abuse started to happen. At first it was subtle. Snide remarks from my mother. I didn't know any better. By the time I was 12, it cycled into full on emotional abuse. On a daily basis I was called a whore, skank, bitch, and every name you could possibly think of. By the time I was 14, it turned into ""I should have aborted you when i got the chance."" ""You were a mistake."" ""Your grandfather was right, he said I should abort, but I chose not to. I regret that decision."" Still.. I didn't know any better. I thought this was normal.. because it was the norm for me. I was 12 years old when my brother was born. I think that was the year it got worse. My mom started drinking more and going out every night. It was never asked of me to babysit, it was just assumed. At 12 years old I was basically raising this boy. Feeding him most of his meals, changimg him, putting him to sleep. All of this well into the late hours of the night. Every night. And every night I'd wake up at 3 am to my mom and his dad barging into the house and screaming at each other. I would then get up and go grab my brother so he wouldn't wake up as well. I'd sit there in my room just holding him.. tears rolling down my face as I silently sobbed. This isn't a life I wanted. This isn't the life he deserved. Eventually I'd fall asleep and wake up at 6am, go to school, come home, and the process would repeat. Every night. I was 13 now. At some point I just started putting my brother into bed with me. But I'd still wake up. The arguing escalated into fist fighting. I started standing in the middle of them pulling and pushing them off of eachother. By 14 I was now getting involved and getting hit, too. I could no longer break up the fighting so I started yelling. Pleading at the top of my lungs for it to just stop. And it only got me pulled in. But.. I didn't know better. I was desperate. A few months before I turned 15 I got my lip pierced. Snake bites. Three days after that, I was washing dishes and my mom says to me ""Stop being so gucking lazy and wash the fucking dishes like I told you."" My response was ""Literally what the fuck. I'm clearly fucking washing them and you can see me doing them."" I dropped the Tupperware I was currently scrubbing and tried to walk away. My mom screams at me ""Don't fucking break my dishes you stupid little cunt!!!!!"" She proceeds to grab my shoulder from behind, pulling me to face her and punches me dead in the mouth. I was gushing blood for hours. I ended up falling asleep in the bathroom that night because it was the only door that had a lock. She had already taken the phone and beaten me with it so I had no way to get help. That was one of the worst nights. By 15, my brothers dad had stopped being the focal point. The focus shifted to me. Every day I was being yelled at and hit. I finally fought back. The moment my mother shoved my face down into a rolling chair.. and my body hit the ground as my face smashed against the seat. I picked up the closest thing. It was a vacuum cleaner. I threw it at her and ran. She chased me into the bathroom, and once again.. another night slept on the tile floor. Right before I turned 16, I met a boy from school. My mom let him come over whenever and she really liked him. One night she decides to have ""the talk"" knowing damn well I was so repulsed by the idea of sex. She gives him a condom and says, ""If you do anything, just at least use this."" A few days later, I turned 16. This was the day my boyfriend decided to come over and wake me up. This was the day he decided he was going to take my virginity.. my innocence. I said no a few times before he coerced and manipulated me into saying yes. Right before he penetrated me, I tried to push him off and said ""No, I really can't do this. I changed my mind."" But he doesn't stop. He doesn't stop. I continue trying to push and move free and he keeps going. This whole time I'm telling him no. When hes done he gets up and kisses me and acts like nothing even happened. I fell asleep almost immediately and he leaves. I wake up to a heartfelt note and his class ring. I wanted to throw up. I did throw up. It took me a few weeks to finally have the courage to leave him. So I did. I didn't tell anyone I my family until I was 19. To this day, my mother doesn't even know. By 17, my brothers dad had become a full blown alcoholic. He was out of his mind. I ended up becoming a target for him, too. This night was the absolute scariest. A fight had broken out and I'm not even sure what it was at this point. Because all I remember was being kicked in the stomach at full force and thrown back across the room. I'm hunched over trying to breathe while tears pour out of my eyes. I see him get up and walk to his bedroom. When he walks about out, he is holding a rifle. I lift my head slowly and look right into the barrel. ""Do it. Do it. DO IT!!!!"" I scream. ""I have nothing left to live for, and being dead is a far better way than this life. Please fucking do it."" He turned around and walked away. I'm not sure what happened after that.. and I'm not sure I want to. A little later in the year we ended up moving 14 miles away. I didn't want to transfer because I was graduating in 4 months. I was already failing classes because of what was going on at home. To make matters worse, my mom, thanks to her alcoholism, didn't want to take me to school everyday. I was missing a lot and failing even more. It was too much to keep up with so, eventually I asked her to sign me out of school and into independent studies. She couldn't even do that for me. I never graduated. I held a lot of resentment in my heart over this. As the days went on, the abuse continued. One night we got into a fight.. that's not unusual. But this night, I sat on the stairs and listened to her sobbing. Saying how much she loves me and is trying and how I don't appreciate any of it. I lost it. I yelled something to her about how she's a fucking horrible mother and abusive at best. I turned around to leave and the next thing I know, the back of my head is struck with a heavy object. I'm dizzy and everything is spinning. I look down and see Bose speaker laying at my feet. I'm not sure what just happened. My brothers dad grabs my brother and myself and takes us to the car. Our roommate came with us. We didn't know where we were going so we drove a few blocks and ended up back at the other side of our neighborhood. At this point my brothers dad looks back at me and says one thing. ""Oh fuck."" My eyes were crossing and dilated. I had a 2 inch bump on the back of my head. He asked to take me to the hospital and I said no. I couldn't have CPS take my brother. I couldn't leave him. I wouldn't. A month before I turned 18 we moved to another city. Much further than where I had grown up. I didn't know anyone.. i couldn't escape. My mom started doing cam girling shit to make money. I ended up being forced into it. I remember drinking so much I blacked out so I wouldn't be aware of what was happening. A whole bottle of vodka to myself. And not the small ones. The biggest svedka you can buy. Eventually it progressed and that wasn't enough for them. I had to do more, I had to go the extra mile. The forced me to have sex with my brothers dad on camera. I try not to think about it anymore. Because the truth is I'm still not okay from this. I still have to put on a facade and pretend nothing happened. But it did. It fucking did and I can't change it. So I'm going to try as best as i can to get this out. I need to. No one knows about this and I've held it for so so long. I need this weight to be lifted. Anyway.. the first night it happened, I tried to back out. But i couldn't. So it started.. the way he was touching me.. I wanted my skin to rip off in that moment. I wanted to leave my body. I remember biting my tongue to cope with it, just as I am doing now. The second my face turned away from the camera I just broke. The tears came and they came hard. It felt like my world was crashing. It felt so unreal but far far too real. I shoved my face in the pillow as he proceed to bend me over.. and I cant even finish writing that. I think you know. This happened 2 more times on camera. And I dont know why it didnt happen more but I have a feeling... At this point it was being used against me. As a tool. As survival.. as.. everything. If I didnt have sex with him I wouldnt get things I needed. I wouldnt eat. Anything, you name it. It got to the point where I was manipulated so much that he had me offering my body in order to get what I wanted, or needed, or whatever. Stockholme syndrome. No one else knew but him and I. He made us go into the shower when it was time.. and every time I cried uncontrollably. Until the point where I reached dissociation. I was no longer in my body.. I couldn't feel it, it wasn't real. He tried to ruin a relationship I had with someone over this. He almost did. But this boy understood and he was there for me.. but he didn't know the full extent and I couldn't tell him. I couldn't tell anyone. This only ended after I turned 19 and moved out on my own and back to my home town. But it lasted for a year and a half. Other events transpired after I left.. but it dwindled down a lot. I cut off my mom for a year and now barely speak to her. I actually lived with my brothers dad and his wife (he met her after I left) for awhile. I ended up blocking out most of the memories of what had been. Then I would remember his and pieces as they'd come. I was 21 now. I moved back to my hometown again and moved in with a boyfriend. 4 months later I was pregnant. He was a surprise. And a miracle. The nurse told me that based off my charts, I was extremely lucky to have gotten pregnant. I actually have a low risk of getting pregnant. That kind of blew my mind. Some shit happened and I ended up homeless and pregnant sleeping on different couches every night.. all while holding down a job. I'm not sure how I made it through honestly but I did. By the time he was born his dad and I had our own place and that was that. 3 years ago, my little Jude was born. And he forever changed my life. I was a lost and improbable cause before he was created.. but he gives me purpose. I'm still a little lost.. a lot of lost, but I know that no matter what I have one direction to go in. All it takes is a little turning around. I've always struggled with depression. I'm not sure when it started.. but I do believe the events in my life have played a tremendous roll in feeding it. I went through all of this alone. It was just me and my own mind. I never got help for this. I never talked to anyone. I went through a decade of abuse alone. I don't know how or why I'm still here. I could have ended up in drugs or with a drinking problem, but I didn't. I've never done a drug in my life. And I dont fucking know how I did it. I made it through.. But it still haunts me from time to time. There is an everflowing storm with my mind. Last night my boyfriend and I broke up. It really set me over the edge. I understand why he needs to leave.. I just wish he understood me. I don't believe he thinks he can be loved the way that I love him. I don't believe he thinks he deserves it. But I do. And he does. When he left.. it felt like I lost a huge part of me. Now all that's left is an endless black void and its sucking everything in. I lost my bestfriend. I lost my rock. I lost my soulmate. This pain that I am feeling right now is a pain that I have never experienced before. I never thought I could love someone so much, by choice, without having a choice. I don't have to love him but God dammit I do. But I feel for him and I wasn't trying. He is much different than anyone. Almost to a fault. I see the pain behind his eyes.. I see him pushing away. Because he is afraid. He's a lot like me. So much. So I know he isn't coming back. I just wish I had the vulnerability to tell him the words I wanted so desperately to say. He wouldn't want to hear them now. I'm not sure he'd even believe them. And that hurts the most. Things left unsaid.. Which is why I'm here. The moment I realized I need help was last night. The moment I realized that I needed to say something. I've been doing this alone for so long. I need help. Because this darkness is swallowing me whole. I took about 5 600mg ibuprofen pills last night. I didn't even hesitate. I was ready to go.. but my son isn't ready. So I threw them up.. as much as I was upset I was doing so, I threw them up. Because the only human being I love more than myself.. is that beautiful little boy. I need to be here for him. I need to get help."

I live with my parents, who were nice enough to let me back home after college to let me address my mental health. I currently do therapy sessions, have a psychiatrist, and have a part time job which I supplement with an Intensive outpatient therapy. To give a little backstory about how I got here, things have been building for some time, but started to get really bad at the beginning of this year. I've always been one to not accept defeat under any circumstances (stubborn resilience), and always look for a way any way possible to accomplish what I want. I did this with at the severe expense of my mental health, which in hindsight was a tremendously horrible idea. I was doing well in college and I had friends. There were still some issues here, as I was ignored a lot of the time and not really viewed as important by many. I didn't even view myself as that important, and when people did act like I was, I didn't know how to act (I would get anxious), and would eventually fall back to the pattern of ""I don't matter"". I didn't really open up my vulnerabilities to my friends or even my family for fear they would leave me or look at me as a lesser person. I also didn't want to sacrifice my pride, which I felt would be completely given up if I admit to depression or any mental health issues/vulnerabilities. This kind of sentiment stemmed from high school. I had a rough time making friends there, and was always in a constant social fear. This was expounded because I had a twin sister who was much more social then I was. I was better at school, but she was definitely better at socializing. This did leave me in a vulnerable state, as I never really did find a good social circle that viewed me as important. Either way, I put on a mask that everything was ok, and just ""toughed it out"". I made some friends in high school, but my sister kept ridiculing them as ""not cool"" as hers and as ""lame"". ""If you can't beat them, join them"" was the attitude I took, and stuck with her friends. The one's I made I just didn't feel very secure from and shortly left them (i guess all of this may suggest trust issues idk). Deep down though I was kind of hiding my true nature because I felt ashamed of it. This also sowed the seeds of an identity crisis that's still unresolved, but loads better than where I was here and college. This went on throughout high school without anyone noticing a thing. Then college happened, and I had friends, but a lot of them did feel a bit superficial, because I carried the same strategy I had in high school into college. I graduated this past May, but outside of that, 2018 has been a pretty bad year. I took and flunked my graduate school entrance exam. I knew the material, but it was too long, and I just couldn't focus on it for more than a few hours. I just didn't have any more energy because my mind would start to worry about self worth mostly but also depression anxiety and worthlessness. I was dealing with long standing depression since early parts of college and I knew my mental health was horrible, but I felt if I open up about it , it was like a void of vulnerability that I had kept hidden from everybody since high school. It was essentially bottling up my emotions and letting them explode, which is what happened. I felt I wasn't worth having my emotions expressed or speaking my mind. Having no future in sight really made it a lot worse. In terms of a personal life, I've never had one. I always wanted one, but I had probably some of the worst self esteem imaginable. I felt fat, ugly, worthless, and unwanted. I guess this was because I already felt really insecure about my career future, and the way I made friends kind of caused a great deal of self loathing (I took this to the max and I mean max). The only close friend I had was my sister, but she was pretty social on her own. She therefore didn't need me as much as I needed her, and any kind of unbalanced friendship/power dynamic like that isn't healthy for the one getting the short end of the stick, which was me. I did have a covert narcissistic attitude in college, as if I ""knew more"" than others. I prided myself that I'd gone through more pain then others and toughed it out, that other people may not be able to go through this type of pain. That I was strong for it. And that I was able to get through school, do well, and have nobody notice. But god damn I hated myself. I hated myself deeply. To admit to a weakness like mental health was the cherry on top. I had such a stigma personally of mental health. I viewed those that had it as lesser. And I had it. But nobody knew about it. Not until the end of college. My friends kind of treated me as unimportant (disregarded my birthday, made me pick them up from the airport and didn't offer gratitude). A lot of this others disregard for me I guess came for the lack of regard I was given in high school, and the lack of regard I had for myself, as I internalized this thought pretty early on. After failing my entrance exam, I had had enough. I wasn't getting the job I wanted, I felt miserable because I had bottled so much of my emotion up, I was emotionally very much at a tipping point for bottling up so much pain for such a long period of time. Finally towards the end of college I let it all out. And it came out like a tsunami. I started yelling at my friends, a lot of whom would take advantage of me (when I did speak my mind, they would disregard it because they had gotten used to it. Kind of like how a person who is constantly aggressive will be tolerated but someone who is usually quiet but wants to be a little aggressive won't be tolerated). I threatened my roommate of 4 years (pretty love/hate relationship here for the most part throughout all of college) and long story short I was voluntarily let in a psych ward. My pride was shattered (I felt it, and my therapist said he could literally see it in me), I felt betrayed by my roommate, and I just felt very alone and in pain. I also lost sight of who I was. I literally didn't know who I was anymore. The mask I kept socially was gone, my pride was gone, some of my friends were actually there to support me, but I don't know, I just felt defeated to be honest. The aftermath of this was another voluntary hospitalization and then another, though involuntary, for a suicide attempt (it wasn't that bad but it had been going on for so long, I just didn't see a way out. I hated myself during this time. My soul literally hurt. I didn't even know that there was such thing as a soul until this time. Now, therapy has been pretty mixed. I've gotten some good insight that my family dynamic did play a big role in it. I'm too hard on myself sometimes, and a perfectionist to a fault. I have some huge trust issues and feel I can't trust almost anybody. I'm still hurt and depressed, but now it's more for having to had gone through such horrible experiences like a psych ward, having been defeated earlier even though I put my all and then some, seeing my friends go off and do great things without having to have gone through such tremendously rough experiences as I have. That first hospitalization though (a silver lining in a pretty bad experience) was the first time I stood up for myself and felt I was worth standing up for myself. I did it in a pretty verbally violent way (not proud; threatened indirectly to hurt) I know this is a pretty long post (my first ever post actually) but I just wanted a place to express my feelings. I've opened up to some friends and my family, but it still hurts that I was defeated. I really need to find something to get my pride back again. For things I've gotten better at lately: higher self worth and self esteem, better support system, better sense of boundaries, expressing my feelings, connecting with people (though I still have an issue trusting, I'm much better at just being myself). I'm still extremely cynical, (more about pride, which everybody needs, just not excessive) and passively suicidal from time to time. I'm still also mentally healing from a lot of the events that took place. Things have finally started to settle for the most part, but idk I've been through a whole lot. If anyone has anything to say/comment please I encourage. Thanks! &amp;#x200B;"

I'll never be able to focus on anything or be interested in anything enough to successfully do it as a career. I'll never be able to focus enough to keep track of my progress at anything. I'll never be emotionally capable of appreciating what progress there is to be had. I'll never be able to be truly happy for another person. I'll never feel good enough. I'll never have a strong enough drive to do anything with my life other than to try to survive. I'll never have a good enough memory for all of the time that passes to feel significant. I'll never sound how I'd like to when I talk. I'll never get aroused at the times when I need it most. I'll never be able to set a goal and focus my lifestyle on achieving that goal, especially if achieving that goal entails withholding the only pleasures i'm able to experience from myself. It wouldn't even be worth it for the sake of the future. Because I'll never feel like anything matters. I'll never want anything from this Earth that isn't good food, sex, or weed. I'll never feel confident and relaxed enough with people to effectively build relationships with them. I'll never feel confident and competent enough to make it far in any workplace, and I'll never have the discipline, passion, and reverence for a job necessary to make more money either. I'm never going to wake up and be excited or even have the slightest emotional will besides perhaps guilt to push to take on the day. Everything I do is very slow and done sub-optimally because I cannot make myself happy. I cannot make myself care. I cannot make myself feel engaged. This is not an irrational disease. You would only say that if you didn't understand. Life is meaningless and it's never going to not feel that way. I have absolutely zero hope that I will ever think my way into feeling any different. I am not in control of my happiness. I don't even like to feel happiness. It feels wrong and I don't want to surrender to that kind of vulnerability. There is no alternative way of thinking about all of the things I claim will never happen. You may be filled with motivation at the very thought of turning these things around, but that would indicate you clearly don't understand how powerless I am. It doesn't matter if I tell myself I have the power. I don't. I don't have the will. And that's why none of this will ever get better. Eventually I will get tired of posting here or it will be impossible and then I will have to just write and write and write into my goddamn journal, to absolutely nobody. And eventually, I'll kill myself. There is no way around it. My depression is a stage 4 cancer and I only have so much time left to live. There's no way out. I can't cope with everything that life has to offer. I can't focus enough to maintain relationships with people. I can't remain mindful enough to stop myself from outwardly showing my mood to others in my face and in my mannerisms. And I feel guilty because people are just stupid fucking animals whose predictable brains make them feel bad when they see another person feeling bad. And now I feel like I'm doing people a disservice by being around them. I see the toxic effect of my parent's golden child failing at every aspect of human life and not bothering trying to hide it from them. But fuck acting. I fucking hate acting for others. But that's all talking to anyone else is. A giant fucking act. Or it is in my case, lest you have an endless amount of intrusive people asking if you're okay, which they can't help but do because of their stupid goddman monkey brain reaction to seeing another sad person. And I'll never live up to their ideal of what a happy person looks and sounds like, because the truth is I'll never be a truly relaxed, happy person around others, and I'll never feel comfortable showing happiness to them.

How their praise can turn to dust because I'd rather believe all these people lied to me than that I deserve it. How can you upkeep friendships or relationships when trying to carefully build up something, anything to stand on, self destructs itself every second day. When you can show vulnerability and interest in people one day and the next, you're avoiding them because you've convinced yourself they despise you. How can you convince yourself to work when everything you do serves to generate the same pitiful feelings as lying around in bed and self loathing for doing nothing would do. I've had depression where I'm felt absolutely nothing and mourned for feeling extreme emotions like these, but having my heart ache over how I'm doing this to myself now, how I'm the only thing stopping myself from being happy, proud of myself, how I know I could be every inch of the person I just KNOW I could be but I'm not, absolutely breaks me when its repeated over such a long time.

Whether it's navigating my highly stressful job, living in a place where traffic and the cost of living is outrageous, dealing with health issues of my own and a recent death in my family or just bad luck (car totaled by uninsured driver, personal items stolen and vandalized), the hits just seem to keep coming and coming. Over the past few months, my long-term boyfriend has been going through a lot of anger and depression. We've been arguing a lot, as he has his own issues and finds it difficult to handle those as well as mine. To make matters worse, we are in our late 20s/early 30s and there is pressure to move in together, settle down and start a family. It is clear that neither of us are in a place to even discuss the future but the peer pressure and comments from other people certainly do not help. We had a huge fight this weekend and he basically told me that we should consider breaking up. I fought tooth and nail against this because as difficult as the relationship has been, it's been one of the few consistent things in my life and I'm really terrified to think how I'd be able to handle everything else going on without my ""rock."" Despite his flaws, I care about him deeply. What we agreed to is not a breakup but something of a break--a time period to focus not on being boyfriend and girlfriend but on being comfortable with ourselves first. I told him that it was unfair of me to pressure him into a commitment. We have a close friend that gave into his girlfriend's demands for marriage and now they have a baby and are completely and utterly miserable with each other. Neither of us wants to ""bitch"" the other one into seeing the world their way. But at the same time, my boyfriend does not promise that things will work out. He tells me that if our relationship is going to survive, it needs to between two independent people with their own sense of self-worth, and not done because one person is desperate and the other is trying to avoid hurting them. We are still in communication and he has been very supportive. The anger and depression has lessened but he also seems a little removed, as if he is trying to see me as a friend instead of a lover right now. It's all a little scary but at the same time, the anger and depression was just as scary if not worse. As bad as things were recently, I just feel terrified. I find myself breaking down at work and crying in my car for relief. The thought of losing him is so hard to comprehend and yet I do not want to show too much vulnerability, as it will probably signal to him that I am needy, which will push him away further. It is just so difficult to pick yourself up sometimes. &amp;#x200B;"

""Is everything okay?"" Truth is I am exhausted. I have spent my time so far adhering to some (unrealistic) moral standard. I always thought living transparently would lead me to a more meaningful life. I felt like if I gave my all to everything and everyone around me, it would be reciprocated in some cosmic manner. Maybe I thought it was karma, maybe I was just optimistic about the possibilities. Regardless, I always had this voice in the back of my head telling me it was the right thing, ""sacrifice yourself, give yourself, and everything will fall into place"". I am 25 now, maybe I am going through a quarter life crisis, but I have grown to be numb and pessimistic. If it didn't make me feel crazy, I could almost find it funny. That I spent/d my time always romanticizing and looking for deeper meaning in the things around me, seeking connection, and it has left me feeling alienated and alone. The same music, words, ideas, and thoughts that once used to comfort me now leave me yearning for something I never had. The things I used to tell myself that would keep me going, keep me on this path, they don't resonate anymore. They are drowned out by the incessant reminders to myself that I am not good enough, that I failed, that I am wrong. The world doesn't work like a balancing scale. I stacked and stacked as much as I could on one side, bits and pieces of me, in hopes that there would be things that made their way to the other, to reach equilibrium. I never felt like I was owed anything, but I always believed. I don't quite know what I believed, something in me just thought it was the right way to live. But I'm not so sure the world works that way anymore, no matter how much I want it to. The scale will inevitably topple over and you'll be left with nothing but a mess to clean up. I have reached that point I think, and I am trying to figure out how to pick myself up. I am left questioning myself, who I am, and wondering if I can trust myself anymore. I know I am coming off dramatic. I've always hid my struggles from the people around me, until recently. I know who I am and how I am. It's not a relatable mindset for everyone. Bottling up all of me for so long I think has left me where I am today, writing this. Even in my darkest moment, I still feel like I shouldn't show it, I should hide my weakness. I should be ""strong"". Maybe it's how I was raised, maybe it's how this life has shaped me. You can't be a successful man unless you are emotionally strong, somehow that has become conflated with not showing any vulnerability at all. It's left me feeling disconnected with the world around me, void of all the things I promised to myself. It's hard to share these feelings, especially if you yourself don't understand them or how to formulate your emotions into words. When you trust someone enough to share, you usually get a bullet point list of all the reasons you should be happy. You hear all the platitudes about life that you can't relate to. Or you simply get the ""get over it"" or ""move on"". It leaves you feeling like you don't understand what it is to be happy. Like everyone around you has figured it out to some degree, you have just been left behind. I don't blame those people, they aren't wrong, and they have good intentions. They aren't responsible for my demons, I am. No one's life is perfect, but not everyone can relate, it would be unfair to expect them to. So I seclude myself because I don't want to be the weak one, I don't want the people I care about to feel like they have to take care of me. I am not their burden. I once used to know exactly where I wanted to be, what I wanted from this life, or at least I thought I did. I don't know anymore, I don't understand myself anymore. I am floundering in my own head trying to figure out a new direction, or if I can continue in this one. I just don't know. I don't even feel I have a conclusion to this message. It's an aimless attempt to feel something, a representation of where I am in this moment. I want to still believe, I just don't know if I can afford it anymore."

I was foolishly scrolling through my friends list on facebook to see if I can maybe vent a little because I was feeling so much; I physically could not take it. In the end I went here... because I'm tired of always being the weak person in the group who vents a lot. I hate vulnerability, because people take advantage of it. I'm already tired about so many things thats happening in my life, theres just no stopping of having more drama. I was having the best week last, last week, and now Im back to being a piece of shit. But everytime I tell this to some of my trusted friends, i feel more weak, because i havent had a comeback for any of it. Its like im being nailed to the ground where i belong. Its where i belong. Im tired. I am exhausted of thinking. Im problematic everyday, and im so so full right now. So full like its time to explode, but cant. Not in this proximity. Because if i did, what would happen to my family? What happens to my dad, who god knows what hes been dealing with lately. I dont know how to function properly anymore."

You give them all of you, your vulnerability, passions, fears, love, and they rip your heart out, tear it apart, and act as if what you had meant nothing to them. Why, should I open myself up like that to anyone again, if the only person who I trusted and showed me they were there for me, for them to then treat me lower than a dog, why ever be vulnerable again? Fuck love."

I exercised every day, made a ton of friends, and got laid more than I ever have in my life during those years (also went to a party school in a cheap area, so it probably helped). Fast forward after finishing, I worked as a paralegal for a large Law firm moving back home to my city area and realized if I wanted grad school or law school I needed to go right away. I was diagnosed adhd and used adderall to fight my way through the work and was prescribed antidepressants as well like lexapro effexor and wellbutrin. I was dating an absolute dime during Law school when I was on lexapro and adderall and spent my entire last year screwing her instead of going to class and prepping for the bar exam because lexapro impacted my sense of reality without realizing it at least I think. she had no career but a part time job so she moved with me to Washington for my summer job during law school and I took care of her etc. once i wasnt proposing right away and finances got a little tight during bat prep, she cheated on me and left me instantly after 4 years. I had a mental breakdown and havent passed the bar exam since. saw different psychs and docs and was taken off lexapro and put on effexor xr with rexulti wellbutrin for major depression and anxiety along with adderall for adhd and xanax for severe panic attacks and anxiety that left me unable to function. I'm waiting on results from Julys exam right now but not sure I passed again because I recently stopped seeing a psych and my new primary doctor thought I was on too many meds, so when I had my appendix removed recently for rupturing I quit effexor xr and rexulti antidepressants cold Turkey and fought withdrawals while recovering from surgery in the hospital. While I was medicated prior to this I would bang the occasional 7 or 8 but not one woman took me seriously and I started realizing maybe meds have destroyed me more than I realize. Once I got out of the hospital 4 weeks ago I took a quality woman out that has a career and confided in her about my messy past with ex gf coming off meds and how things were now going to come together. She also came out of a 5 year relationship in which she was engaged to a guy that never worked and recently became a cop so she also felt like she supported him like I supported my ex gf. Past 4 weeks recovering and only being on wellbutrin xl xanax and adderall xr, I felt more emotions and authentic, getting closer to this girl all weekend hanging out past 4 weeks and going on interviews. i moved back home until I'm on my feet but I have privacy being I come from a single parent home and my mother is always working but I cant move until I repair my life. she understood and I told her to run but she said she wasnt going anywhere. after our 5th date she came over and we were pretty hammered off wine but she blew me and we screwed although it wasnt my best performance (im either better on more meds or need to regain better natural stamina coming back to myself). we both got off and laughed about it and then she invited me to go meet her sisters their boyfriends and to be a guest at her company sports event. every one of them from her company to her sister to her sisters boyfriends said great things about me and topd her family I was a great guy. she was feeling me but out of no where said we couldn't be serious until I started working again despite her knowing it's only been 4 weeks since quitting major meds I was on for past 2 years. I deleted a pic of me and her on my Instagram and she snapped cried little bit and said that was immature but she was stating the truth and I told her I'll be on my feet soon but if were not serious I'm not advertising her anymore on social media. she wanted me to upload the pic again so i did and we went home very happy with each other. I even picked her up from a bus stop when she got on wrong bus and bought her a gift when she asked for it immediately thinking maybe it was better to be more romantic as I'm in my later 20s and last relationship I was an emotionless monster on lexapro with my dime ex. last week, she calls me Thursday when i find out i wasnt getting some part time bank job although interviewed for bigger position on Friday and tells me i have no sense of direction, discredits any past accomplishments like working in the WH second summer of law school or working for large law firm as a summer associate my first law school summer so I told her I thought she understood I was waking up out of a medicated coma and I'll have a new job here soon as I'm repairing my life, she continued ripping me so I lost it and took a shot at her back because she claimed she was a doctor (shes a physical therapist and my brother and father who I dont speak to are medical doctors) and i told her she wasnt she was a physical therapist she told me I was a doctor too I said no I'm a lawyer got doctoral degree in law but that's not a doctor so relax. I was insulted she seemed to have been surprised I fought back but we calmed down and agreed to take a step back before meeting families. she told me she still wanted to hang out and see me and talk just no family meetings yet till I'm working which I agreed with. going into interview Friday she was wishing me luck asking me how it went and I told her it went very well but then silence the entire weekend last week. I reached out that Sunday and told her maybe we should have made plans and invited her to my family event Sunday if she still wanted to come and she just said enjoy your day with the family so I asked for clarity being things seemed off, she said we arent on same page etc. I told her I was in process of getting it together and thought she understood that but she said she wasnt ready to move forward so I wished her luck and said I wish I didnt confide in her so much. my friends and family were surprised as the past 4 weeks since I got out of hospital and quit those two big antidepressants me and her were inseparable but this came out of no where and I'm assuming it was the fight. Despite family and friends telling me that I'm doing better now and lost weight since coming off two antidepressants, I think my vulnerability and emotions are either hurting me or I'm still healing from what I went through past two years. waiting to land a job and after being put down like that, its only making me question myself more if I should go back or keep fighting forward. If you're going to be negative or tear into me for acting like a beta, try putting yourself in my shoes coming from a broken home, getting my law degree and MBA despite the disaster with meds and having no guidance or anyone around to help you out. I sincerely appreciate the input ahead of time and not sure what direction is the right one anymore. "

I find that theres little point in opening myself up and lately its been hurting the people around me. The other day I walked away from someone I cared about and they expressed to me that it hurt to treat them like a stranger not worth saying goodbye to. For whatever reason I couldnt face the emotional vulnerability that came with saying goodbye to them. Is there anything I can do to actively work on this? I find it so emotionally exhausting to exert energy into people but I miss being alive and being in love. I want my heart back, and I want to make the people in my life feel loved again. I dont know if fear is the real root holding me back or what. Im extremely anxious as a person and dealing with a pretty severe disorder, lots of shame embedded within myself. :( "

My soul trembles in the suffocation of vulnerability. Im not figuring out who I am, Im deciding which part of myself to surface. I spent an eternity learning to suppress the entity of who I am. Fabricated with authenticity and fulfillment made to plaster the face I show the world. My mind is a forest with trees rooted deep in insecurities. The soil seems inhabitable but the roots thrive amidst the barren emptiness. You can cut the tree down but the stumps will always linger. This is the first time Im posting my writing ANYWHERE. the though scares me to my bones. I think its important for me to show someone, somewhere, what I feel even if its just anon on reddit.

It doesnt make you special or deep. Theyre not even really depressed. Im not trying to invalidate someones feelings but its not depression (most of the time). I hate saying stuff like that because then it seems like Im holding myself of some pedestal because Im actually depressed. Which is just cringy in itself. I just feel too much and nothing at all. That doesnt make sense. I cover myself up so much, millions of layers and I just wish someone, anyone, would hear my cry for help. Im bulimic and it sucks so much. I want to get help but I dont want to tell anyone. Im just in so much pain. Im crippled with loneliness. I think about it everyday most of the day. I just want someone to love and love me back. Im just too ugly and fat. Literally, I have the roundest head and biggest forehead. All my fat is on my stomach, its disgusting I am genuinely disgusting and I cant even control myself anymore. Im losing myself and I binge and throw up constantly and its disgusting but I cant help it anymore. I dont know what to do, nothing I do matter, I dont know who I am. That is my biggest thing, I have no idea who I am. I hate being in social situations. Im so stupid and unfunny and awkward. And just sit there and dont say anything because I cannot think and I cannot talk. I just sink into myself and fade away. Then I dont leave my house for weeks other than school or work. Work has helped me so much lately, really taken my mind off myself. I met some really cool people and I might be comfortable with them, not sure yet, they really seem to care about me but they probably just invite me to be nice, not because they actually like me. I would never be friends with me. I look awful all the time and Im just so weird and weird is the best way to describe it, not like cute weird just weird like the things a say and do and wear are not cute. I just wish I was someone else. Someone pretty, that sounds so basic and stupid like wow of course a girl wants to be pretty, but like pretty girls get everything, they get love and attention and people care about what they say and they are funny no matter what and when they are awkward its cute and quirky. What a stupid girl thing to say. I sound like an air head. I just want to be loved. Its all I want actually. I would not give a care in the word if I had someone to love, or I would like to think that. But that day will never come and I will be fat and ugly and grow old alone and die alone, I probably will never lose my virginity. All my friend will marry and I will not. But I hate vulnerability, I hate that there is someone out there who knows how I feel, I like too seem unemotional. Even the hint of emotions gives me so much fear. I dont know I am so stupid and I should just put this in a diary bcs none of your really care at all, I really dont even care at this point."
253,vulnerability,depression,How do I stop hating myself?,1,9ucjps,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9ucjps/how_do_i_stop_hating_myself/,2018-11-05 21:51:05,"Ill try and keep this short but I tend to ramble. Let me know if im just not making sense. So Ive dealt with depression for many years. Ive had points in my life where I have handled it well and almost believed I wasnt depressed anymore. And then lately for the past several years Ive been barely able to survive. Thats what at least the last year of my life has felt like and maybe longer. Just a little over a year ago my ex broke up with me. We were engaged and had been living together for 2 years at that point. We dated on and off for years before. I really think that that break up has torn me to shreds. Not saying I blame him. I basically pushed him to it because I kept asking him why he would stay with me. I thought/think I am a horrible person. Im stupid and useless and feel like I have nothing to add to society. Ive lost him and two other beat friends this past year and all of that has caused me to not want to trust anyone. I dont believe im worth having friends. Not deep friends anyway. I cry myself to sleep most nights and when I cant sleep at night I watch Netflix until im tired enough to just pass out. But I just really hate everything about myself. I hate how I look. I hate how I treat people. I hate how much I hate everything. I used to have a really strong faith or maybe not if it hasnt gotten me through this. But I question everything about my faith constantly now. I dont feel like im good enough for anyone. When I see pictures of myself im disgusted by how much bigger I am than everyone. Not just being fat but that I am literally a giant compared to people i know. I dont think I am pretty or even could be if I tried. And I hate when people say you shouldnt say that about yourself but it is what I think so there. Things that used to help me were finding things that I actually likes about myself and at that time I would be able to come up with stuff. Like I was a good friend, or a good Christian or that I was confident i was following God but I dont know anymore. I question everyday. I try and find something im good at. I feel like all im good at now is staying out of the way. I feel like all I know how to do well is make sure im not bothering anyone. I feel so incredibly guilty if I do something wrong. I cant handle any kind of criticism and so when I get it im telling myself how stupid I am and how could I make that mistake. Its especially hard when im at work when I do something wrong. The other day I was on the verge of tears all the while telling myself that I should have known better. Why would I keep making the same mistake. Why didnt I even think to ask a question? Its so frustrating that my brain doesnt work the way its supposed to. It doesnt even work the way that it used to. I used to be able to help and train people at work but now I can barely maintain a job. I can barely get myself up out of bed. What the fuck happened to me? Where did the real me go? I feel like im just surviving and my family who means well tells me it will get better and this wont last forever but I just dont know that thats true for me. I got involved at a church and I did what I could but I literally felt like I was drowning and tried to voice my own concerns but it was like no one could help me. I actually went there with enough vulnerability to ask for help and I felt like I was just too much again. I just dont know how to stop hating myself. I just feel like I cant do anything right. I dont have any money saved up. I just moved back in with my mom who barely has enough money for herself and shes trying to take care of me and I just feel like an ungrateful little brat living here. I dont have insurance and I dont have the capacity to understand Medicare or Medicaid whatever it is that im supposed to get. I have so many things wrong with my car but I cant afford to fix them. Since moving back home I dont have a job and I dont have the motivation to get one. Im supposed to go back to see a counselor and get on medication but its all so overwhelming. I just cant handle any of it. And none of doing any of that will make my life any better. It all just feels like a bunch of chores that I have to do and a bunch of stuff that I cant afford. Even if my family is willing to help pay for it I feel immensely guilty that I cant do anything for myself and im convinced that I will never make enough money to ever pay them back and I will have to carry that guilt with me everyday knowing that someone else had to take care of adult me and will always have to take care of adult me. I genuinely feel like I will always be stuck here with never enough money to be able to afford to just live. So this is why I hate myself. I feel like I dont deserve to be alive. So many nights I just wish I was never born. I go to sleep wishing that I wont wake up and that I can die peacefully in my sleep. Thats the only time I feel peace anymore. Every waking moment is just me trying to distract myself from how miserable I am or I just sit there wallowing in it crying in bed like I am right now. I think about wanting to die but honestly I do care just enough about my family that I think the burden of killing myself would be more of a burden than me continuing to live. Cause right now the burden is mine but if I kill myself the burden is theirs. I mean I still feel like I am a burden to them now just maybe not as much as if I killed myself. I hate that I even have these thoughts but it doesnt matter what I do if I try to stop them or ignore them they still come. I just feel so helpless. "

The belief and common misconception is that if you are to give someone ammunition they will use it against you without care for the hurt they are causing to you. They simply do not give two shits about you - my parents are very good examples of this. Depression is an illness that may be likened to an open wound that a malicious individual whom knows what buttons to push or knows your back ground can stick their fingers into this open wound and start pulling about causing distress and harm. The common conception and belief that someone with depression can just simply snap out of it and start living their life is simply untrue - most people are hung up on something or the other - some issue resonates and replays over and over.
255,vulnerability,depression,"In your opinion, is it justified to stop being friends with someone who is friends with your worst enemy for the sake of self respect?",1,9hxk11,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9hxk11/in_your_opinion_is_it_justified_to_stop_being/,2018-09-22 16:11:19,"A little over a year ago, I had a pretty decent friend group. It's difficult to express how amazing it feels to build a solid group of close friends; it's like some instinctive tribal desire within me is being satisfied. I'm probably not unique in that respect. Anyway, I saw this friend group fall apart when one friend, who I'll call Mike, betrayed my trust and played on my insecurities to humiliate and embarrass me. I'll spare you all the details, but the initial stages of this betrayal reinvigorated the depression I thought I had tamed, putting me into an emotionally vulnerable state which Mike openly and intentionally manipulated and exacerbated to bring me down further. Another friend in my group, who I'll call Liz, was present during the entirety of the ordeal. Being good friends with both Mike and I, she knew everything that was going on. She was there when Mike would say terrible and humiliating things about me and she was there for me when I was in my depressive state. She told me she fully believed that Mike was in the wrong and that she was on my side. She admitted that Mike preyed on me and went after me when I was vulnerable, essentially expressing that she viewed him as somewhat of a sadist. However, she never expressed her sentiment to Mike. She did not once tell him that what he was doing was wrong and that he needed to stop. She listened to him and she listened to me, and to my face, she told me she was on my side; but for all I know, she could have been saying the same to Mike. Our friend group collapsed mostly because of this situation. I remain friends with everyone except Mike, but we will never be as close with one another as we once were. And to be honest, I'm okay with that. The shield that I bear in my day-to-day life to protect my inner vulnerability and insecurity had been taken away from me and torn to pieces, exposing me to all my peers. It's been very hard to recover from the ordeal. My self esteem has crashed, my social anxiety has returned, I've gained a ton of weight, and I am much less trusting of others than I had been before. If I were to remain close with my former group, it would be even harder to move on. The only friend from that group who I remain close with is Liz, but she also retains her close relationship with Mike. I would never expect her to abandon Mike for me (even though the rest of our former friend group gradually cut off ties with him). However, her close relationship with him makes me question whether I should remain friends with her. Liz has a great personality; she's fun, funny, kind, and respectful. She's one of the few close friends I have left. However, a large part of me feels that, by remaining friends with the friend of my worst enemy, I am disrespecting myself immensely. I will never know the full nature of her interactions with Mike when the whole ordeal was taking place, nor do I have any interest in revisiting that situation to find out. I want to move on completely, but it's hard to when I am still indirectly attached to Mike via Liz. I'm sharing this post for two reasons: one being that I find writing about this kind of stuff to be therapeutic, and the other being that I am asking for some advice. From what I've written above, do you guys think I would be justified if I were to gradually cut off ties with Liz? Do you agree with me that by remaining friends with Liz, I am disrespecting myself? Or am I just thinking too hard about something that doesn't matter? I'm interested in hearing what you would do if you were in my position. Thanks for reading. "
256,vulnerability,depression,Another way out,0,9j4ica,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9j4ica/another_way_out/,2018-09-27 03:17:38,"I dont know any of you and I cant imagine some of your circumstances and the immense difficulties you deal with. I dealt with a pretty heavy load of depression for a decade if not longer. Meds, therapy, dropping out, solipsism, hopelessness. These were the things that plagued me. Even now, I have glimpses of these troubling concepts and it burdens me and brings me to a dark place. I was in the midst of a perennial bout of suicidal ideation and I became intimately aware of how vapid my life had become. This was my starting point. From here did my rebirth begin. I'd like to think it was from the cumulative effect of that summer, when I impetuously steered myself away from all I knew, disengaging from home/family/habits, and embarked upon a 3 month backpacking trip through south america, that things changed. It was completely crazy, as everyone told me, yet all I knew was things had to change. I had to change. My habits were ossified, my mode of thought was etched into my psyche. I felt sincerely manacled to the ritual of my own discontent. Things has to change. I was lucky to be off meds again, for these were only barriers to true personal freedom (for some, meds are obviously encouraged). In the heat of agonizing existential despair, I booked an ayahuasca retreat. It was the single most difficult experience of my life. I was alone in the jungles of peru, awaiting the most powerful and ruthless drug known to man to grasp hold of me and rip me to shreds. I wrote in my journal right before the ceremony a brief note, in case i died that night to express the significance and validity of what I was doing. Generally people look upon these things with dismay. They dont understand. You know that something is wrong in your life. What exactly that is is perhaps imperceivable. But you are not mistaken. All of you in this community are not wrong to assert your discontent. It is completely justified and fair. I went into this experience with the vulnerability of my own existence. I knew I could die (although it is rare, but my heart problems/blood pressure were of consternation). I put my life and my sanity, all I really knew on the line to force a wedge between me and my history/who I was. I am now back in school, back to my normal life and am feeling better than I have in a decade. It is unbelievable to me how different the world seems to me now, how much less resistance there is in the world. I am even grateful now for my own life, even the current hardships I still face. In short, I urge those of you at the precipice to reconsider your options. I know I was lucky to have the physical/financial/and overall opportunity to do something like this. Many do not. But there are always options. You are all valiant pioneers and fighters. I view suicidal ideation as an emblem of heroism. Obviously it is a deeply disturbing element of life, yet I find these individuals attuned to something quite profound. They are searching. Most people are not searching. But this community is searching. They realize their life and life in general can be aesthetic and purposeful, and they lack these qualities now. My bit of advice, however ill-qualified I am to give it, is to be cavalier. Be reckless. At the precipice of your despair when all structure and meaning is purportedly lost, thrust yourself into the freedom that life's existential void provides us. Within the absurd, 'far-out' choices we make, we at least give ourselves one more chance for true aesthetic living. Let me know what you think! Thanks!"
257,vulnerability,depression,Fuck the US Healthcare System,61,9jisys,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9jisys/fuck_the_us_healthcare_system/,2018-09-28 11:41:40,"TW: suicide, violation The past month has been rough from a mental health standpoint. Suicidal thoughts have been plaguing me as well as thoughts of self harm. Despite having had a truly awful experience with shrinks the last time I went (I have been unmedicated on Big Pharma for a decade now), I tried to do the responsible thing and go see a shrink to get some medications, specifically for depression and anxiety. To interrupt myself for a moment, I want to state that when I say I think I need help, it is a Big Deal. Due to my upbringing, it has been hammered into my head that volunteering vulnerability means certain punishment. I do not often speak of this issue, not because it doesn't need to be spoken about but because showing anyone any measure of vulnerability has been proven to be dangerous. Expressing weakness terrifies me. So yesterday I call the Georgia crisis line. I am directed to the local free clinic, as I do not have health insurance. They only handle intake on Thursdays (and Monday/Tuesday, but those days had already passed, sooooo...). I do not have health insurance, so this was my option. So I waited until today. This morning, I went for intake. 8am to 10:40am. I requested a doctor's appointment as intake doesn't offer medication. 1:30pm I come back. The shrink is interested- fixated - on the suicidal thoughts. I have no immediate plan, I am here at the clinic to get help so I don't get to that point. She doesn't care. She signs a 1013 despite my very explicitly stating I am absolutely unwilling to accept inpatient care. A 1013 means you have no choice about the inpatient. I am told if I attempt to leave the premise, police will come arrest me and take me in handcuffs to the hospital. I am to wait for the cop. I am trapped, and I am alone. The first thing the cop does upon arrival is confiscate my phone. I now have NO WAY to contact ANYONE. I had managed to get a few texts and phone calls out before he arrived, and thank fuck for that. I am trying desperately to not flip my shit because I am trapped and having to fight off a panic attack. The officer is more interested in communicating his absolute authority over me than listening, repeating phrases like ""lose the attitude"" in reference to my clipped speech while I attempted to obtain information and my horror that he was CONFISCATING MY ONLY MEANS OF COMMUNICATION, ""you aren't in trouble, it's not like you are in handcuffs"", and ""just be a good girl and cooperative and this will go smoothly"". He also stood too fucking close. I am escorted to the hospital in the back of a police car, complete with bars on the windows. If I do not offer my compliance, it will be forced. Blood is drawn. If I do not agree and comply, it will be forced. I am required to strip naked, pack away all of my clothing, and step into a hospital gown. If I do not comply, compliance will be forced. Not going to lie, I sobbed like a broken child on the hospital bed. They took my fucking underwear and my bra. And my hoodie. I am still unable to touch my purse, I am still denied access to communication with ANYONE except the nurses. Except that (thank fuck) my nurse was human and chose to show compassion, I would have been required to remove my still healing piercings, causing unnecessary physical pain, as well. She agreed to allow me to keep them in. This was an exception. I am watched over by male security guards. I am told I have to wait until the doctors can get to me. I cannot access my phone, make use of another phone, or communicate with anyone who is not a nurse, doctor, or security guard. I am asked many questions multiple times. A crushed up health supplement pill I had completely forgotten about in the bottom of my purse brought another cop to my room to inquire what illegal substances I was associated with. I was required to pee in a bathroom with the door open. Finally. Finally, at 8pm, I am allowed to go home. Husband and friend were waiting for me. I am home now. And safe. Ish. All I wanted was some help to help prevent things from getting worse. This is what I received. If I want medication, I will need to go back to the same location with the self same cu...shrink that put the 1013 on me, because she couldn't shut the fuck up and actually listen to me for 60 seconds. I am not okay. I am not in any danger to myself, or others. I am triggered. I do feel violated. Scared, terrified, and you know what, what's even fucking worse? It took me THREE WEEKS to work up the courage to go see the damn shrink in the first place. And instead, with only a short break between, I got this. Mental healthcare in America is fucked. And for me? It isn't fucking worth it. Not today. Maybe not again, ever. I just wanted a little help to get evened back out. "

I feel alone, like there is no-one outthere, i try in a humble way to forget. To forget and move on, but it just seems so impossible, even with a drink in my hand, i just cant reach the required conclusion, the conclusion i need to move on. All i can think of is you, how beuatiful u are, how much i want to be with you. How much i just cant let you go. With this drink i try to move on, i try to distract myself from the gaping hole there is in my heart, its gaping and crying for attention, surely i cant live on like this. So far this beloved solitude, has also resulted in being my worst enemy, with solitude comes vulnerability, and i would have never thought i would be this vulnerable, but here i am with a gaping heart. Empty and without relice to carry on, without motivation to keep on beating, its when i sometimes hope i dont wake up, that i realize what kinda position im in, no matter what i type, no matter which emotions i overcome, it will never change from the core the human i am. I am someone to be stepped on, i am worthless, i dont deserve anyone, in reality i should just dissapear, i have wasted my life, everything has become a distraction, in the simple hope to forget who i am, to forget the hatred, the uncontrollable hatred that keeps on growing, its unstoppable, its an incredible powerful hatred, because its focused inwards, towards myself, its that kind of hatred u just cant move on from. I doubt 5% will understand what i mean, but those who does will have known true suffering and true pain. Because that is what im feeling right now, i have lost all motivation, i dont even know i keep on living, i try to find hope and helpfulness in every song and every moment, but it just reminds me of who i am, a totally nobody.

I may seem friendly and I usually am, on a superficial level at least, but I realise I have never been vulnerable or intimate with anyone, not even my parents. Never formed a close relarionship in my life. I'm a very distant person and I've covered myself with layers and layers of emotional barriers. I don't think it's been very good for my mental health... as should be evident from the fact I'm posting here. Worst part is I don't even know why I'm so fucked up. My parents weren't abusive and they gave me everything I needed and I'm sure they loved me. But I don't know why I could never really form a connection with them. I think there's something deeply wrong about myself. So wrong I'm not even sure I'll be able to change. I'll just carry on reading and watching romantic shows and crying to fill the emptiness, lose my virginity to a prostitute someday and probably end up killing myself some day.

That's what I rehearse to myself when I lay awake, staring at the ceiling at 1 in the morning. I'm not sure why I do this; Am I rehearsing for when I get the courage to explain my depression to someone, or am I trying to find a hope that some other night won't be hard, one night I won't be in the same cycle; Laying in bed, watching Bojack Horseman on Netflix, and feeling hopeless. Some nights it's hard not to think about it. Not to wonder if my sleeplessness at 2 in the morning, wondering if I'll be up just watching the red night sky, the street quiet and sleeping as it should, wondering if I'll see it more often as an adult. Not to think about my new room, the window that leads to the roof. The thought that if I really wanted to, I could just leave. I probably won't, I have too much comfort and vulnerability here, but the thought of leaving behind the bullshit of my past, sometimes that's comforting, but then I remember her. ""Her"" is my best friend. She came into my life when my depression had gotten bad to the point of hurting myself. She saw it one day, and she wanted to help me stop. And thanks to her, I can say that I am a year and 4 months clean as of tomorrow (the day I post this). It took her 11 months, but I stopped for her. She's too important to me. But as much as I love her, as much as I say she's like a sister to me, some nights I can't shake the thoughts. Some nights, I imagine the same scenario; her coming to the hospital after I tried to take my life. In this scenario, I always end up surviving the attempt, and she always ends up coming to visit me after it happened. I sometimes fear that she wouldn't come to visit, but then I just have to tell myself that she does love me. She describes me as one of her best friends. She loves me as a brother. The thoughts suck, they really do. But I hope I can get past it."

My first post got a couple of views and I honestly dont know why people even looked at them. Anyway, today has started off good considering I dont usually have good days. Sometimes I have random break downs and I dont know how to deal with them. Do any of you have random break downs? A moment of vulnerability where everything is closing in, every moment of hurt and lies just flashes and you completely break down. Ive had a couple of those in my lifetime. People in this world have no idea that the stuff they say can hurt other people. They can call you names and then joke about it. Its even worst if your friends are those people. Ive gotten so good at hiding how I feel that no one realizes it. Can someone tell me how to open up to people? Or how to tell them that Im not ok? How do I do that? Theres so much to a persons smile. Behind those eyes are things others cant comprehend. They think were happy and contented, we should be, but instead were depressed, we feel like no one understands us, like everyone hates us. I know exactly how that feels. Its just another day in my life where people make me feel worthless and stupid, it may not be the best now but I want to say that no one understands you better than yourself, you have to express yourself and be brave and say what you want to say. It may not work at first but keep shouting until someone hears you. Dont give up. I should go now, I know people will ignore this because frankly it isnt that important. Bye Love, Anonymity "

Essentially my whole life, I have felt like a total ghost. Some would find that to be a relief, but its inflicted with intense overwhelming humiliation and overbearing vulnerability. It's not normal to go out into public and talk to a stranger having to hold you tears back violently. To feel so painstakingly transparent. The familiar feeling of being turned down by everyone- that your pain is unwanted weakness- such paranoia and utter loneliness. Who is this lost child that thinks she is so so broken in a world full of mirroring shadows? It feels like a joke I play on myself to keep me down, and to see the light in that would be even worse because maybe it wasn't so bad. But I don't feel alone because everyone sees through me. I can't integrate my own story without the thought of another. It's like my story doesn't matter, I""m just a ghost talking to people through glass walls and they see but they really don't want to. I remember reading a story of a man who did ayahuasca within a circle of other people. He said he put his headphones in and pulled down his hood. In that moment I realized even more deeply, that I wouldn't feel I had the right to do that. I wouldn't have the ability to shut myself off, even if I tried, I would feel shaken, invaded, and disposable. Really, what is this? Are we all stuck in child mode? We just didn't grow up. I am 25 but when I look into everyone's eyes, I am baffled that they have a mask, or a wall, or even their own belief system that they hold confidently-that they speak fluidly. I am absolutely struck by those things. I see people stuck in one loop or another for years, and instantly I take their fate as my own. It feels so arrogant, so grandiose. Theres so much beauty in being a ghost if I just surrendered. Theres so much honor in being small, in being the passerby. In fact it was where I once felt peace, but the tables have seemed to turn and theres no where to hide.

How can you calm down when you have an anxiety attack? What are the top things you can do to prevent an anxiety attack? Can someone answer those two questions please because I need answers. When I break down I try to breathe in and out, I think of the good people in my life and the reason why Im still living.

Oh and one important point during in this period of a year and a half I thought myself how to hack/code as I had a natural interest in computers and had very little else to do and for that period my laptop was my one and only friend.  Anyway fast forward a few years, I become best friends with a girl, we talk all day everyday and love each other deeply, or at least I thought we did, I fell for her but she didn't feel the same although we would still ""hookup"", this so called ""relationship"" lasted 3 years in which she would leave me for someone else then return after a while and I would welcome her back with open arms as if nothing had happened then in the end I watched her leave me for someone else the final time, I knew what was happening the whole time, I just felt it, but loved her so deeply that I would force-feed myself her lies.  The last time she left devastated me, back to not leaving the bed, withdrawing from all my friends, back to my best friend being my laptop, back to being completely and utterly alone, this time it effected me much more deeply then when I was 12 although the period of never leaving the bed lasted a shorter time, I became very socially withdrawn not having a interest in new people, distrusting everyone and cutting ties with the few people that did try to support me even though I never asked them to and stopped attending school and began to smoke weed constantly, although this did not effect my grades and I still passed with flying colors (Must have been in the top 3% of my school) I also did cut myself for a breif period of time which I still have scars from to this day.  I eventually managed to escape this depression by focusing heavily on becoming a successful software developer which was easy because I had learned much over my early teenage years allowing me to ""slack off"" during college and dedicate my time to something more productive then passing my exams (Starting a software company), all my time was dedicated to finding clients, increasing my knowledge and networking with people in the industry, I would rarely leave my computer but I was happy and it payed off, now I am (not to toot my own horn) the most ""successful"" out of anyone I know, I have my own business with a few well paying clients and have the best future prospects so I should be happy right? Wrong.  A few years pass I finish college with 27% attendance but still pass. I'm truly happy for a while not wanting for anything but then the hunger hits, I'm no longer satisfied with my life and cannot ""speed things up"" as I was already pushing myself to my limits in terms of productivity and neglecting the other aspects of my life, I become extremely lonely and depressed, the computer I once called my ""best friend"" that kept me alive all these years now feels like my prison guard chaining me to my desk. You know the typical ""Fight Club"" depression, ""Everything just a copy of a copy of a copy"", ""The worker bee's can leave whenever they wish, it's the Queen that's trapped"" but this time the depression is manageable, I can convince myself that things will improve if I continue to work diligently and plan for the future.  Then something unexpected happens... The girl from school contacts me... It's now been three years since we last spoke.  And what did I do? Well I'm sure you can guess... I welcomed her back with open arms again...  Turns out she now had a child and had left the guy that she left me for many years ago a few months before contacting me and did I get the fuck out of there immediately? Or get her back for what she did? Or tell her I refuse to be used again?  OF COURSE I DIDN'T  We begin talking everyday again, I try my best to comfort her (She was still upset about having to leave him as he was allegedly abusive), we go out a few times, everything seems to be perfect, I got my first and only love back (She wasn't my only girl ever but she was the only one I loved)  The ""Fight Club"" style depression I outlined earlier subsides and I'm now truly happy and content with my life again.  Then she starts to push me away again and as I've been through this with her many times I notice immediately and try to raise my concerns with her. She claims shes just a little depressed still and that she needs time which makes me feel terrible for telling her that I felt neglected.  I step my game up and focus 100% of my energy on making her happy, the kind of thing were its like ""Wanna do something today?"" Me: ""I'm outside in 5""  But nothing improves she continues to push me away and begins to say that I'm being to needy eventually she cuts contact with me again claiming that she just can't support other people at the moment.  I'm obviously devastated by this, after a few weeks of messaging trying to get her to talk to me she reveals that shes back with her EX again, whom she insisted she would not get back with.  This devastates me even more as it's now clear to me that I got used, I beg her to talk to me so I can get some closure that I was denied the last time she left but she never answers.  And I'm not gonna act like I didn't keep chasing her for a while, I went abit cray cray nothing bad just messaging and calling alot.  So now here I am eating one meal a day (Barely), not leaving the bed, unable to sleep, I've greatly reduced my work hours as after a while of being MIA my clients became disgruntled although they seem to understand that I simply need a break from everything.  My friends witness my worst nervous breakdown ever and the ones who I'm not to close with take this piss but my close circle of friends attempt to support me more than I ever expected, I didn't think they cared about me this much.  But showing my vulnerability to them brings back the thoughts of worthlessness and being judged so I close myself of to them again after a few days of accepting their help, claiming I'm over it and that I was just being overly emotional.  I have never consider suicide more seriously then this before, It's not that I don't believe that I can change things or that I will eventually feel better but that I just do not want to feel this way anymore and don't want to go through it again.  I even planned my way out, I was thinking I'd max out both my cards (A total of 10,000 might as well enjoy myself before I go) and then jumping from a building or bridge or something. (I don't trust myself to carry it out using any slower methods or methods that require me to do something I need a foolproof way out so that's what I settled on)  The family I do have resents me and I don't want to tell my friends this for fear of what they think of me regardless of how irrational that fear is. I've been through therapy when I was younger and it doesn't work for me unfortunately and I've been self medicating which does work however that will not fix my life, simply cover it up so I do not think going to the doctors for medication is a option either.  I don't know what I want or why I'm posting this, I know I'm not alone as I am a big fan of music which helps keep me here by just knowing that someone else out there feels my pain I guess I just want someone to hear my story and see what they think.  Even though I know deep down I'm not, I feel worthless and I'm in pain and I want my suffering to end."

Then something unexpected happens... The girl from school contacts me... It's now been three years since we last spoke.  And what did I do? Well I'm sure you can guess... I welcomed her back with open arms again...  Turns out she now had a child and had left the guy that she left me for many years ago a few months before contacting me and did I get the fuck out of there immediately? Or get her back for what she did? Or tell her I refuse to be used again?  OF COURSE I DIDN'T  We begin talking everyday again, I try my best to comfort her (She was still upset about having to leave him as he was allegedly abusive), we go out a few times, everything seems to be perfect, I got my first and only love back (She wasn't my only girl ever but she was the only one I loved)  The ""Fight Club"" style depression I outlined earlier subsides and I'm now truly happy and content with my life again.  Then she starts to push me away again and as I've been through this with her many times I notice immediately and try to raise my concerns with her. She claims shes just a little depressed still and that she needs time which makes me feel terrible for telling her that I felt neglected.  I step my game up and focus 100% of my energy on making her happy, the kind of thing were its like ""Wanna do something today?"" Me: ""I'm outside in 5""  But nothing improves she continues to push me away and begins to say that I'm being to needy eventually she cuts contact with me again claiming that she just can't support other people at the moment.  I'm obviously devastated by this, after a few weeks of messaging trying to get her to talk to me she reveals that shes back with her EX again, whom she insisted she would not get back with.  This devastates me even more as it's now clear to me that I got used, I beg her to talk to me so I can get some closure that I was denied the last time she left but she never answers.  And I'm not gonna act like I didn't keep chasing her for a while, I went abit cray cray nothing bad just messaging and calling alot.  So now here I am eating one meal a day (Barely), not leaving the bed, unable to sleep, I've greatly reduced my work hours as after a while of being MIA my clients became disgruntled although they seem to understand that I simply need a break from everything.  My friends witness my worst nervous breakdown ever and the ones who I'm not to close with take this piss but my close circle of friends attempt to support me more than I ever expected, I didn't think they cared about me this much.  But showing my vulnerability to them brings back the thoughts of worthlessness and being judged so I close myself of to them again after a few days of accepting their help, claiming I'm over it and that I was just being overly emotional.  I have never consider suicide more seriously then this before, It's not that I don't believe that I can change things or that I will eventually feel better but that I just do not want to feel this way anymore and don't want to go through it again.  I even planned my way out, I was thinking I'd max out both my cards (A total of 10,000 might as well enjoy myself before I go) and then jumping from a building or bridge or something. (I don't trust myself to carry it out using any slower methods or methods that require me to do something I need a foolproof way out so that's what I settled on)  The family I do have resents me and I don't want to tell my friends this for fear of what they think of me regardless of how irrational that fear is. I've been through therapy when I was younger and it doesn't work for me unfortunately and I've been self medicating which does work however that will not fix my life, simply cover it up so I do not think going to the doctors for medication is a option either.  I don't know what I want or why I'm posting this, I know I'm not alone as I am a big fan of music which helps keep me here by just knowing that someone else out there feels my pain I guess I just want someone to hear my story and see what they think.  Even though I know deep down I'm not, I feel worthless and I'm in pain and I want my suffering to end, I also suffer greatly from social anxiety which makes it hard for me to meet new people or express myself without feeling judged so instead of the usual stuff people do after being deeply hurt here I am on Reddit."

I'm sick of how egotistic and insecure people can be to the point I can stand spending time with some friends and family at the moment. I don't have the energy to participate in this economy of insecurity where people jab at others and be defensive instead of just being fucking honest. I'm so fed up with mental illness, I feel like it keeps me down so much and people love to prey on vulnerability to make themselves feel better; people can't admit they are normal and not 'special' so we can get along and not judge each other for being human. I don't get it, it's so upsetting to me when we can't just have some empathy for each other instead of seeing it as an opportunity to be lauded over. I feel like I'm slipping back into the dark deep pit and some of the people I trusted are helping push me there. "

When depression hit, I realized I had time, and I needed a method to release my emotions and feelings. I turned to writing in a journal. I put my heart into journalling everyday for about six months releasing my emotions and negative thoughts into it. It helped my depression tremendously. As I started to recover, I built momentum from writing so much that I told myself that I should start a blog to help others and myself who are/were depressed. By starting a blog, I had something to do during my depression which now turned into a passion. I became more confident as what I write is honest and I am not putting a fake self *cough cough* like all the people on Instagram and Facebook. It helped me in discovering who I was as a person and what I wanted in my life. It made me feel more real and allowed me to show vulnerability which was never possible previously.

Negative outcomes of maladaptive SNS use in young individuals The positive aspects of online social networking notwithstanding, the rewarding nature of this social monitoring may be leading to the emergence of compulsive checking behaviors and excessive engagement in social media, and therefore, to negative psychological consequences. Research has provided clear evidence that overuse or maladaptive use of ICT can have negative effects on the well-being and psychological functioning of children, adolescents, and young adults ([Brooks, 2015](URL [Fox and Moreland, 2015](URL [Kross et al., 2013](URL [Rosen et al., 2013](URL [Sampasa-Kanyinga and Lewis, 2015](URL With respect to SNS, maladaptive use has been identified as a potential mental health problem ([Kuss &amp; Griffiths, 2011](URL Parents usually worry about their adolescent children being hooked on Facebook and spending too much time on SNS and with their smartphones, thus having less involvement with their real-life environment and with school issues. There are several studies showing an association of time spent on SNS and lower grade point averages ([Kirschner &amp; Karpinski, 2010](URL less connection to peers ([Barker, 2009](URL lower self-esteem ([Kalpidou, Costin, &amp; Morris, 2011](URL and higher depression ([Lin et al., 2016](URL [Pantic et al., 2012](URL However, the overall time spent on SNS does not seem to be the exclusive factor in maladaptive SNS use ([Muench, Hayes, Kuerbis, &amp; Shao, 2015](URL Likewise, high social media engagement itself is not considered to be problematic ([Turel &amp; Serenko, 2012](URL Rather, specific individual vulnerability factors determine the possible negative psychological effects of SNS engagement, such as younger age ([Bachnio, Przepirka, &amp; Pantic, 2015](URL distortion of the online profile ([Oberst et al., 2016](URL and existing mental health problems, chiefly depression ([Gmez-Guadix, Orue, Smith &amp; Calvete, 2013](URL [Bhagat (2015)](URL emphasizes that the use of SNS is associated with psychosocial difficulties, such as low self-esteem, but also with mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, and loneliness. The author concludes that Facebook seems to be very attractive for lonely individuals and especially those with psychopathological symptoms. This is in line with other studies that explore the close relationship between SNS use and depression ([Bachnio et al., 2015](URL [De Cock et al., 2014](URL [Hong et al., 2014](URL [Koc and Gulyagci, 2013](URL [Moreno et al. (2011)](URL show that college students with depressive symptoms are more active on Facebook and are more willing to discuss their problems publicly. The findings suggest that individuals get positive feedback online and receive support from their friends online, which could result in a more public self-presentation. The use of SNS also seems to be related to poor [social adaptation](URL such as social anxiety ([Bodroa and Jovanovi, 2016](URL [Ryan and Xenos, 2011](URL The results emphasize the relevance of SNS for individuals who try to cope with real life social problems and to gratify social needs online. However, the direction of this association is often unclear, because existing research on this topic is mostly cross-sectional. It may be that individuals with anxiety and depression tend to use more SNS, or it may also be that those who use social media intensively develop increased depression ([Lin et al., 2016](URL [Gmez-Guadix (2014)](URL a longitudinal study of increasing problematic Internet use by adolescents with previous depressive symptoms. His results suggest that previous psychological distress is a risk factor for engagement in problematic online social interactions. An additional finding is that this effect is reciprocal; the use of online social interactions to alleviate distress also contributes to an increase in depression. A recent systematic review ([Anderson, Steen, &amp; Stavropoulos, 2016](URL highlights that the most tested relationship is the link between mood and anxiety disorders and excessive Internet use. The proposed explanation for this link is that young people seek relationships online to compensate for difficulties in face-to-face relationships by using the Internet as an emotion-regulation strategy. More specifically, a systematic review of quantitative studies revealed that the relationship between online social networking and depressive symptoms is highly complex, and the impact of online social networking on wellbeing can be both positive and negative ([Baker &amp; Algorta, 2016](URL These authors suggest that the heterogeneous outcomes of these studies are due to underlying mediating and moderating factors. As found in a longitudinal study on problematic Internet use with a Spanish-speaking sample ([Gmez-Guadix, Calvete, Orue, &amp; Las Hayas, 2015](URL deficient self-regulation, consisting of diminished self-control over cognitions and behaviors related to the Internet, seems to play a key role in the maintenance of problematic Internet use, by increasing the preference of users for online interactions over time. This is consistent with the results reported by [Wegmann, Stodt, and Brand (2015)](URL demonstrating that the link between depression and social anxiety, on one hand, and pathological use of SNS, on the other, is mediated by cognitive factors such as the individual's expectations of SNS use. When psychopathological symptoms exist, individuals may expect that the Internet or SNS will help them escape from negative feelings, experience pleasure, and receive positive feelings. These expectations could enhance the risk of a problematic or addictive use. This study also indicates that the relationship between individual characteristics and problematic use is mediated by specific cognitions, a finding that fits into a theoretical approach of development and maintenance of a specific Internet-use disorder in the I-PACE model (I-PACE stands for Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution) by [Brand, Young, Laier, Wlfling, and Potenza (2016)](URL and the previous version by [Brand, Laier, and Young (2014)](URL To summarize, we can identify important risk factors that play a role in the development of problematic use of SNS. However, these risk factors themselves do not necessarily determine the negative [psychological outcomes](URL rather, intervening and mediating variables, such as the fear of missing out construct, could explain this relationship between mental health problems and problematic SNS or smartphone use. ### 1.2. The fear of missing out construct Fear of missing out (FOMO) is described as () a pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent () and () a desire to stay continually connected with what others are doing ([Przybylski, Murayama, DeHaan, &amp; Gladwell, 2013](URL p. 1841). Although FOMO is not necessarily a phenomenon exclusive to social media users, individuals with high FOMO might feel compelled to check their social media more often in order to keep up to date on their friends' plans and activities. To date, FOMO has produced more interest in the media than in scientific publications. Although there is still very little literature available on this relatively new construct and its theoretical underpinnings, some scholarly publications showed FOMO to be a mediator variable between personal characteristics and social media engagement. It has been proposed that FOMO could serve as a mediator linking deficits in psychological needs to social media engagement, and FOMO also turned out to be a mediator between different indicators of well-being (need satisfaction, general mood and life satisfaction) and social media engagement ([Przybylski et al., 2013](URL FOMO also mediated the direct relationship between motivational factors and social media engagement in the classroom ([Alt, 2015](URL In a recent study, FOMO has been shown to be a predictor of smartphone addiction ([Chotpitayasunondh &amp; Douglas, 2016](URL We can conclude that individuals with a low degree of basic need satisfaction (for instance, of connectedness with others) could be more tempted to engage with social media, because SNS, especially when accessed via mobile devices, serve as an easy means of staying in touch with others and participating in their lives ([Casale &amp; Fioravanti, 2015](URL FOMO would explain the tendency for people with chronic deficits in psychological need satisfaction to constantly seek out updates and possibilities to engage with social media, even when this takes place in potentially inappropriate or dangerous situations, e.g. while driving ([Przybylski et al., 2013](URL attending a lesson ([Alt, 2015](URL [Turkle, 2011](URL or being in a face-to-face conversation ([Chotpitayasunondh &amp; Douglas, 2016](URL Adolescents with psychopathological problems (especially anxiety and depression) could also develop higher FOMO because of their perceived social deficits. Being connected with and being accepted by one's peers is of utmost importance in adolescence ([Desjarlais &amp; Willoughby, 2010](URL so SNS are especially attractive for these younger individuals, in order to provide them greater levels of social involvement. By using SNS, these adolescents may be able to satisfy their need to belong, but they also have a higher risk of suffering from anxiety when they have the feeling that they do not belong and that they are missing out on important shared experiences. ### 1.3. The present study Most studies on negative consequences of technology use investigate these factors in the general population or in young adults, and few studies analyze these mechanisms in individuals below college age (see, [Anderson et al., 2016,](URL for a review), despite the fact that they are considered to be the most vulnerable group ([Kuss, Griffiths, &amp; Binder, 2013](URL Indeed, problematic Internet use in adolescents has become a serious public health problem in some countries, especially in Asia, and studies are being conducted to analyze the multiple factors influencing these maladaptive behaviors, for instance the adolescents' intrapersonal attributes ([Li, Newman, Li, &amp; Zhang, 2016](URL Except of Asia, there are hardly any studies on this topic using culturally specific adolescent populations, for instance in South America. To fill this gap, our study focuses on the adolescent population in South American countries. Additionally, we analyze the link between psychopathological aspects and negative consequences of smartphone use. Smartphones and other handheld devices with permanent Internet access have revolutionised the way online social interaction is performed; the opportunities to be online have become infinite and represent probably the most recent revolutionary change in the field of ICT. This is because these technologies allow users to access the Internet and Internet applications and communicate with others via social networking whenever and wherever they want. Therefore, behaviors related to the Internet or Internet-based applications, and to the mobile phone can no longer be considered separately, as they represent a single technology that is displayed together ([Renau, Gil, Oberst, &amp; Carbonell, 2015](URL In the earlier models discussed above ([Alt, 2015](URL [Przybylski et al., 2013](URL FOMO is considered a mediator between personal characteristics or psychological needs and SNS engagement. In our study, we propose a model in which we analyze the relationship between psychopathological symptoms (anxiety and depression) and negative outcomes of mobile device use (smartphone, tablet). We hypothesize that this relationship is mediated by further cognitions such as FOMO. We also consider that the relationship between FOMO and negative outcomes is mediated by the intensity of social network use (see [Fig. 1](URL"

On one side of the family, i felt unaccepted simply for who i was (i grew up in a religious family), but on the other side i felt too accepted and shouldn't deserve any of their attention. i thought i was holding on well enough, but this weekend broke that illusion of emptiness, my mind screaming of dying and arguing with itself. It probably didn't help that i was listening to religious songs from my childhood, even though i haven't quite recovered from the deconversion process. i never thought i had anxiety. i thought anxiety was essentially a fear of strangers.

To my dad, stepdad, and sister I am negative, defensive, grumpy kid who got messed up in the head. I always seem too much like my mom for them. To my mom, I'm her ""miracle child"" that doesn't feel like a miracle, but rather a mistake. I mean, why did God give me Aspergers? Or have me need to have Speech Therapy when I was younger? And to her, now that I am living away from her, I seem different. Not the same son that was always so supportive of her. My mom has chronic pain. Chronic migraines. Anxiety. Depression. Memory problems. She can barely get out of bed. She has no job and lives in a tiny spare bedroom with my grandparents. I tried to be supportive and helpful when my Dad divorced her, but the pain became more important to her than her own kids. She gets defensive whenever someone pushes back on her excuses of these issues as a reason to not do things, like see her kids. For TWO YEARS I put her health before my own. Since then I've focused on me and she has gone waaaay down. I might be selfish and rude, but the reason I don't talk to her anymore is because I can't handle her problems. I tried doing that and it was too much for me. I rarely talk to her because I don't want that negativity in my life. And because of that, I seem too much like my dad. I feel like I am the weird socially awkward kid at work and classes. I struggle to make friends. I am HORRIBLE at staying in touch. Its hard being a friend for me. Easy to disconnect and retreat to family and my mind. But my family is feeling isolating and alien to me now. I can't rely solely on my mind. I mentioned earlier that I am defensive. I am. I am because the idea of vulnerability is terrifying. It hurts when you are vulnerable with family and something they say hurts, even if it was not intentional. I am insecure. About my weight. My looks. I am so anxious that I look at Tinder and Grindr but I never do anything. Dates. Sex. Anything. Never happens. I am afraid. I feel trapped. And yes I am gay and I am afraid to come out to my Mom and my extended family on both sides. But I never can say anything about it. I feel like no one REALLY likes me. I feel like no one REALLY understands me. I want people to see the good in me, not only the bad. I feel that's all they see. The bad. And now I feel I am being pushed away from my own family. Or am I pushing then away and why? I want to fall in love. I don't know what love feels like. I wish I had a love story. I wish my real life could start. A life where I am 100% out and have a bf/hubby, maybe a pet, maybe a kid, where I live in LA not worrying about money, where I am not afraid to socialize and have lots of friends, when I am successful in a fulfilling career. That seems impossible for me. I feel like my life just happens around me and I am a spectator. I am not living. I don't know how to live. No one taught me. And yet, even if I may want to be dead so the pain ends, I know I will NEVER try to kill myself. Im too afraid of death and my very strong likelihood of going to Hell. I want to BE more and be SEEN as more. I want to FEEL more (of good stuff not bad). I want to not be alone. I want to be happy. If only I didn't exist. Maybe life would be better. "
276,vulnerability,depression,Wrote a thing about my experience with depression,1,90k8zq,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/90k8zq/wrote_a_thing_about_my_experience_with_depression/,2018-07-21 08:04:34,"I decided last week to try and write at least 1,000 words per day. I started faltering and earlier this week a friend suggested that if I'm having trouble writing, maybe write about my depression, so I did that. This seems like a good place to post it. I'm not sure what it is I hope to get from sharing this, but hopefully something positive can come from it. Maybe it'll at least make someone feel less alone. Depression comes in quite a few different forms, but this much seems to be true of all versions of it. When a person is suffering from a depressive episode, they feel, for one or a few various reasons, that they are hopeless to do accomplish anything constructive. I often experience a sense of futility for all of my efforts. If Im going to end up right back here, then whats the point? Everything Ive worked for so far has left me feeling just as lost, lonely, and stressed out as ever, so what good has putting effort into anything done for me? My current therapists official clinical diagnosis of my symptoms is dysthymic disorder, which is a form a persistent or chronic depression. It describes long term exhibition of symptoms such as low self esteem, a loss of interest in things or activities that the sufferer has enjoyed in the past, feelings of hopelessness and gloom, and pessimism. I would also describe it as a form of psychological paralysis. People are aware of the concept of writers block, in which a writer cant think of anything and feel powerless to put words to paper. A depressive episode for people like me might be described as a humans block. The feeling is that it requires an incredible amount of willpower and effort to do literally anything, even if that anything is apparently nothing at all. Sometimes when Im depressed, I turn on a tv and try to make a selection of something to watch from a number of streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, etc. I however sometimes only get as far as turning on the television and sit idly, staring at the options of streaming video apps, because the reality of the situation is that watching something isnt what I want to do. For me, and I imagine for many people, my depression manifests as loneliness and a longing for romantic and sexual connection. I tend to feel the most at ease when Im intimate with someone. When Im wanted by someone who I want. When I let my ego control me consciousness, the absence of intimacy feels like death, panic, and anxiety manifested as all of its physical symptoms. Its like drowning, only it never seems to end. You complain about being lonely, but theres someone whos crazy about you. Youre only alone because youre choosing to be. Its your fault. You are ungrateful for what you have. You should be happy. There are so many people who have far less than you. I feel guilt when there is someone whos attracted to me and thats not enough for me. I withdraw from that person, because it makes me feel worse knowing that I cannot meet their level of enthusiasm and that they arent enough for me. Theres always someone ready to tell me that the negative feelings that Im experiencing are a product of my own doing. My mother, for all her love for me and desire to help me, does this most consistently. Im sure her intent is to argue that things are not as bleak as I perceive them to be. The result is that I am ashamed for feeling the way that I do and angry with myself for not doing more to change my life and my perceptions. Sometimes people attempt to convince me that I am more sexually active than most of the people in their lives. Circumstantial evidence always seems to suggest that theyre lying to me, but even if theyre telling the truth, its not effective consolation because it doesnt make sense that so many people are living such involuntarily lonely and involuntarily sexless lives. Intimacy is a persistent and profound human need. Sexual desire is the most powerful motivator known to humans. With these being the case and with society having illuminated and rejected the shackles of sexually oppressive religious rule, how is it that it seems so heavily guarded. How is it that people choose so frequently to be with no one rather than indulge in some kind of intimate exploration with one another? And what is it that tricks us into believing that indulging in the physical aspect of sex alone will make us feel better at all? Masturbation feels good, but it isnt the same as experiencing an enthusiastic mutual expression of acceptance and vulnerability with another human being. Masturbation has none of that, so to present it as an alternative is comically absurd, and yet porngraphy thrives as an industry because so many of us are reaching for some way to soothe the persistent suffering that most of us experience, apparently, for excessive periods of time. That frustration, however, is accompanied by a torrent of messages from both commercial and social media that when a person is a person of strength and value, they have sex whenever they please. As if there is a constant supply of people who are eager to engage sexually with anyone who demonstrates high self esteem and confidence. That, then exacerbates the sense that again this is all my fault and if only I stopped being incompetent at being basically human, I would have everything that I desire. After that comes all of the secondary degrees of self resentment, as I begin to indulge my ego in the narrative that I must take measures to make myself attractive by societys standards in order to become sexually attractive or worthy of experiencing sex with desirable partners. This includes acquiring an abundance of financial income, being in excellent physical shape, being well known and respected for my accomplishments, being excessively intelligent, being very funny, having good fashion sense, being confident at least most of the time, not taking shit from anyone, knowing what I want, and lastly, being of an age range that seems to have the most widespread appeal to the demographics that include the kinds of partners I desire. To fail at any of these items feels like it must be a shameful and well guarded secret, as the narrative is that only the complete package, a person who exhibits all of these qualities, is to be unworthy of quality love, intimacy, and sex. To lack any of these characteristics makes a person an insufferable loser who is not worthy of anyones time or consideration. Being good in bed, being kind, and having noble intentions seem to be qualities that people like in others, but not that they value. After all, these three characteristics should be reasonably easy for anyone to achieve. All they require is that a person desires to be considerate and compassionate. What they do not result in is any level of success in an economy driven culture. They do not require any competitiveness. They do not require any particular skills, practice, or discipline. They do not make a person unique or unmistakable. The desire to be a good person will only result in getting a short lived smile out of someone who will quickly forget about your efforts once someone more interesting comes along. It will make a person a pleasant coworker, but will not lead them to be leaders or commerce and industry. Being a good person, in todays world, does not seem to matter. There is always an army of people willing to take advantage of kindness for their own benefit, who will then attract others by the means of material success. I try to tell myself that this isnt true, but its how it feels, and when we have someone like Donald Trump as the elected leader of the most powerful nation in the world and while his blatant disdain for compassion or integrity do nothing to affect his popularity among his supporters, which is apparently almost half of this countrys population, then how am I - how is anyone - supposed to believe that its worthwhile to be a decent human being? But regardless, I dont want to be unhappy, so I take measures that I hope will lead to a happier life. I invest time and energy into efforts in hopes that I will improve myself and my status. I go to the gym. I attempt to learn a language. I begin writing every day. I draw every day. And invariably i falter and do all but give up on these efforts. Depression strikes. Im discouraged. My plans and actions for self improvement slow to a halt for an indefinite break. I become disgusted with myself for being unable to maintain momentum and make a difference. I want to make a difference to the world and yet I seem wholly impotent to make a difference just within myself. I wallow in self resentment. I develop well thought out arguments against every supportive and optimistic perspective or idea that the people who care about me try to present to me. They distance themselves from me because Im so unpleasant. Such a pessimist. So selfishly sad. So pathetic. Such a loser. Destined to fail. They never say those last several phrases. The ones who are still around tell me to have some faith in myself, just as they have faith in me. The ones Im not so close to tell me that I drive people away by always being so negative and no one wants negative people in their lives. Last week, on July 10th, I decided to begin writing 1000 words each day, as reccomended by this article, r/URL by Srinivas Rao. A friend had sent it to me. I felt motivated and hopeful, but a depressive episode loomed right around the corner and now on July 20th, I only have 5 days of this exercise under my belt and Day 4 currently sits incomplete at only 351 words. This endeavor, which shouldnt be all that difficult, becomes another exhibit, proving to me how inadequate I am. My depressive episodes typically last about 2-3 days. Theres often an overall sense of weakness and discontentment, but during those particularly dark episodes, I feel completely paralyzed, inconsolable, and sometimes experience suicidal ideations. This isnt the same as actually wanting to die. Its just thinking about the concept. Sometimes this includes particularly disturbing, yet sometimes informative suicide fantasies. Theyre informative, because they can provide clues as to what is triggering my negative moods and feelings. They also make me feel guilty, however, because most of them revolve around a desire to cause anguish to people who care about me and the reason for this is because I want to know that someone cares whether I live or die. I cannot punish someone who doesnt care about me. Im impotent to affect change to the people and things that I genuinely hate. It feels as if the only power I have to to cause suffering to the people who mean the most to me. I cannot say with any confidence what it is that can pull me out of these episode except time. Its almost as if it requires a certain set of muscles to be this unhappy and when those muscles are exhausted, I start to feel better. When I can, I do things that seem to have helped in the past. I go to the gym. I spend time with friends. I eat a good meal that includes leafy green vegetables. I do creative work such as drawing or writing and end up with a piece that Im proud of and gives me hope that I do have the ability to do something to induce a positive change. Doing any of those things requires me to have been lifted out of the depths. Its only when Im already on the climb back up that I have the strength and will to do any of these things. That means that I didnt really cause the change in my mood at all. I just got lucky again. It makes me wonder if sometime, maybe the next time, I wont be."
277,vulnerability,depression,Thoughts on my experience,2,90kbp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/90kbp1/thoughts_on_my_experience/,2018-07-21 08:14:51,"I've been trying to write everyday and a friend suggested I write about my depression. Thought this might be a good place to share. Depression comes in quite a few different forms, but this much seems to be true of all versions of it. When a person is suffering from a depressive episode, they feel, for one or a few various reasons, that they are hopeless to do accomplish anything constructive. I often experience a sense of futility for all of my efforts. If Im going to end up right back here, then whats the point? Everything Ive worked for so far has left me feeling just as lost, lonely, and stressed out as ever, so what good has putting effort into anything done for me? My current therapists official clinical diagnosis of my symptoms is dysthymic disorder, which is a form a persistent or chronic depression. It describes long term exhibition of symptoms such as low self esteem, a loss of interest in things or activities that the sufferer has enjoyed in the past, feelings of hopelessness and gloom, and pessimism. I would also describe it as a form of psychological paralysis. People are aware of the concept of writers block, in which a writer cant think of anything and feel powerless to put words to paper. A depressive episode for people like me might be described as a humans block. The feeling is that it requires an incredible amount of willpower and effort to do literally anything, even if that anything is apparently nothing at all. Sometimes when Im depressed, I turn on a tv and try to make a selection of something to watch from a number of streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, etc. I however sometimes only get as far as turning on the television and sit idly, staring at the options of streaming video apps, because the reality of the situation is that watching something isnt what I want to do. For me, and I imagine for many people, my depression manifests as loneliness and a longing for romantic and sexual connection. I tend to feel the most at ease when Im intimate with someone. When Im wanted by someone who I want. When I let my ego control me consciousness, the absence of intimacy feels like death, panic, and anxiety manifested as all of its physical symptoms. Its like drowning, only it never seems to end. You complain about being lonely, but theres someone whos crazy about you. Youre only alone because youre choosing to be. Its your fault. You are ungrateful for what you have. You should be happy. There are so many people who have far less than you. I feel guilt when there is someone whos attracted to me and thats not enough for me. I withdraw from that person, because it makes me feel worse knowing that I cannot meet their level of enthusiasm and that they arent enough for me. Theres always someone ready to tell me that the negative feelings that Im experiencing are a product of my own doing. My mother, for all her love for me and desire to help me, does this most consistently. Im sure her intent is to argue that things are not as bleak as I perceive them to be. The result is that I am ashamed for feeling the way that I do and angry with myself for not doing more to change my life and my perceptions. Sometimes people attempt to convince me that I am more sexually active than most of the people in their lives. Circumstantial evidence always seems to suggest that theyre lying to me, but even if theyre telling the truth, its not effective consolation because it doesnt make sense that so many people are living such involuntarily lonely and involuntarily sexless lives. Intimacy is a persistent and profound human need. Sexual desire is the most powerful motivator known to humans. With these being the case and with society having illuminated and rejected the shackles of sexually oppressive religious rule, how is it that it seems so heavily guarded.

279,vulnerability,depression,I pretty much grew up with low self esteem,6,93gm2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/93gm2b/i_pretty_much_grew_up_with_low_self_esteem/,2018-08-01 03:39:46,"It's crazy to think when you reflect back on the course of your life from early childhood how you can identify exactly how your self esteem got so low. The seeds were sown at such an early age; all of the seemingly significant social snubs and failures, the being mocked for showing emotional vulnerability, the romantic rejection, being called wierd, etc. It all started so early. You wonder how you could ever be expected to have confidence. Unfortunately, that's all the world wants from you. And none of it ever changes, because I never changed. I just kept it all inside literally throughout my entire life because I never had the wisdom or courage to seek help. Instead, I developed a false sense of self esteem to revitalize my dying ego, always crashing back down when reality reared it's ugly head back into my life. You start to wonder about your existence, and how you could ever be proud of that journey. You wonder how you could ever gain the courage to accept it and talk about it openly, which sucks, because you know if you aren't open about it then you'll always be worried about keeping it hidden or repressing it from your mind, which isn't possible. There's so much to be humbled by that it's daunting to even consider thinking about yourself and how your life has gone in a positive way. You become scared to hope, because in order for that hope to work you have to accept the past fully, simultaneously learning from it and letting it go. Not even understanding how to effectively process emotions. It's really hard to accept all of it. From the outside looking in, one can clearly see vast glimmer of hope in the mire: the path to salvation. All I have to do is stop running and dive in. There's so much I have to let go to even begin the journey. I don't think I have the will. I choose once again to ignore the voice of reason because the righteous path is too difficult to follow. I wish I was never in this position in the first place. A lot if good that wishing does me though /s. It feels like I have to choose to start living for the first time or continue to be dead. The way things are now, it doesn't matter if I live or die, because I'm not actually alive anyways. To accept myself is too humble a position to be in. It's easier to stay dead than to acknowledge the neurosis and work on killing it."

They responded with a long, well-intentioned email that basically just said that struggles are a part of life and to keep my chin up. Here are a few of the gems:  What doesn't kill you makes you stronger  Struggling is good for you because it toughens you up  Think of the good times  Count on our prayers  Chins up These are people I've never been too close too but in a moment of weakness and vulnerability I told them about my struggles so I didn't have to feel so alone. I know they mean well so I don't want to respond with something mean (which actually was my first instinct) but I don't want to pass this by. I think they need to be educated about the difference between depression and being sad. If you were me, how would you respond to this email?"

I'm letting some people down in my life, because I can't keep up anymore, and they're really perplexed. I feel terribly guilty and kind of insane. I relate to so much of what is posted here and I've realized I'm not alone. I feel more courage, knowing that I'm not making this up anymore. I've always pushed myself really hard, afraid of failure -- but that doesn't work anymore. I'm broken now.

Because of that, I've had hard times with keeping relationships, it's either they leave or I leave, but the latter is what I usually do. It's a fucking dilemma. Years later, it became anxiety.

I smile and nod and say what they want to hear. Even with my close friends who I do open up to, I never feel that satisfaction. Maybe this is because the friends I open up to are all online.

285,vulnerability,depression,Anyone else get angry when a friend gives advice on how to deal with depression?,1,8r022x,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8r022x/anyone_else_get_angry_when_a_friend_gives_advice/,2018-06-14 17:55:19,"TLDR: Friend tells me how he was depressed before and gave suggestions (that I've tried) on how to fix it A little backstory I've(25M) been depressed for as long as I remember. It started when I was in middle school and persisted to this day. It's a daily struggle and I have episodes of crippling depression once a week. One day my friends and I were drinking together and an event happened that caused my friends to learn about my thoughts and my suicidal tendencies. I love my friends and for how supportive they are. But at the moment I got pretty angry at them when I shouldn't have. I understand they were trying to help in the best way they can but it came off very, for lack of a better word, condescending. The advice they gave such as meditation, how they used to be sad because of this situation and that situation, how they eventually got over it, almost made it seem like they thought I never put any thought into this. We who are depressed are not absolutely helpless. We are not stupid. We've all tried to remedy our situation. Some more than others but the truth of the matter is we have done our research. We don't need someone to come during our weakest moments and ask ""Have you tried...?"" Or ""I used to be depressed..."" Or even ""I can't imagine what you're going through..."" Very much r/wowthanksimcured material. Again I understand that's the best some people can help because when we open up and put ourselves in a position of vulnerability it makes it awkward. To anyone out there researching on how to help a friend who is depressed(this is what I think might be best YMMV). Reach out to them let them know you're there for them. Just hang out and provide your friendship. Don't change how you interact with them otherwise it may come off as pity and make them feel like they're a burden on you. We're not looking for advice nor are we looking to hear success stories. All we're looking for is to know we're loved and that we are not going through this alone."

I know the steps I need to take to get my life in order but I am so afraid of people knowing I am vulnerable that I hide it even when I dont want to. I cannot get the courage out of me to ask for help and its actually ridiculous that I cant even send an email to my doctor telling her whats wrong let alone get on the phone. Im under pressure in my family and if you dont have the finances or a loving family that talks things out then getting help is immediately the hardest thing. I want help and Im willing to accept it, the problem is my resources to get it are limited and I have no means of getting to it. Thats all besides the fact that I mask my vulnerability and fear of looking weak with pride and saying I dont need anyone or anything. Its all lies. Im a liar. I dont need people to help me thats a lie. I dont care what people think about me thats a lie. Why cant I just shake it and let it go and stop being a coward and actually try to get it.

For as long as i can remember , I've always bundled up my feeling , i can count on one hand the number of times i've opened up to someone and that someone being my mother , never felt courageous enough to show vulnerability in front of other people or the least bit of weakness , this earned me the reputation of being totally uncaring about everything (I care , i care so much ) when it's just me dissociation because i feel way too much and i can only handle so much , ""how are you so calm and relaxed about everything ? , if i were in your shoes i would have broke down "" . at first i liked hearing that , made me feel like i was strong and collected , that i would take on anything , until the satire wasn't working anymore . I started to realize that it was something i developed as a child , i just blocked out everything because everything felt too overwhelming . As an adult , it was like being dead inside , i knew i was supposed to feel bad for what was happening , but i just couldn't cry or express any kind of feeling , it wasn't cool anymore , because i knew i was losing touch with reality at some point and it would all come back crashing at once someday . It started staking up over the years and i'm feeling the impending snapping of the worn out thread , for those past two years i've been fluctuating between being absolutely unfeeling and then having the strongest urge to end it all because honestly nothing is going right no matter how hard i try or how much i fake a positive attitude, my self esteem also taking a hit is not helping at all . I've never fell in love , just the thought of someone seeing all of me is terrifying . I cut off friends for no reason , i can go months with absolute no interations from ignoring phonecalls to social media withdrawl and then make a comeback after my ""phase"" is gone and act like everything is just fine (Nobody seem to notice that something is not quite right here) i can't get close to people it's just impossible , nobody knows who i'm and they're content with the image i present myself with to them : Easy going , goes with the flow , relaxed and absolutely uncomplicated , you just get what you see . People are satisfied with that version of me they don't really want to dig inside . Two weeks ago , i screwed a test , i usually don't care about that (for real this time) , but it was ""la goutte de trop"" . everything was fine after that at first , i joked with some friends about how much i messed up and laughed about it , until i got home and laid on the floor while thinking about how much of a waste of air and space i was , as i was thinking about doing the irreversible , i decided to call my mother as a last resort , she kept asking what was wrong "" was it because of the test"" ""you usually don't cry about things like that"" ""it's because you don't go out and are always isolating yourself"" she wouldn't understand but that's because i couldn't tell her how useless i felt , how often i thought about ending it all for the past two years , how i knew that no matter how much i tried i couldn't be like my sisters , how i knew i was the invalid one , how everything was excused for me because i was invalid and i had a rough childhood and it's okay i was messed up because i was good at pretending i wasn't , how i knew i was better off dead . I couldn't tell her that , because i can't think of anything worse than making my mother sad , she already has so much on her mind and she's all i have . So i ended up the call by saying i would feel better in while and that i would do better next time . Today was the exact same experience only with no failed test , i just feel so worn out and tired and i can do nothing about it and i can only just wait for it to pass and then dread when it's going to happen again . Do i want people to notice ? , and if they do , would i be able to tell them my story ? I'm not really looking for sympathy or advice or anything like that , i know people are going to say you should open up , you shouldn't bottle thing up , i know all of that . I just thought that i had to get this out of my head and if i couldn't talk about it that i could write out and maybe i would feel better . It's just life is so hard and some of us are just to weak and cowardly to face it upfront . Let's all hope for a better tomorrow . "
291,vulnerability,depression,My Story,2,8k0mnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8k0mnf/my_story/,2018-05-17 12:19:04,"My grandfather was singularly the greatest person that Ive ever known. And if he wasnt in my life, Im not sure Id believe that true selflessness existed. We lived on the same private road for the majority of my childhood and wed see each other maybe four or five times per week. He was known as Papa to his grandchildren  fitting, because he was a second father to me. Papas smile rivaled that of Santa Claus  his laugh too. And he boasted a white beard and growing belly to match. A man of simple needs, he drove the same Ford Ranger until it aged to more than two decades old. Many of the shirts youd see him wearing would be gifts from local businesses  as he would say, the price is right, and he was happy to offer the free advertising for those he knew. Materialism was foreign to him. His only desire was to care for others: his family, friends, and even complete strangers. He taught me how to replace a car tire  not simply replace a wheel after a flat tire, but actually replace the tire on a rim. He taught me how to change oil and air filters. He encouraged me to golf, which was something he picked up as a hobby, and wanted me to enjoy it with him. When I rode the school bus, he would pick me up from the bus stop nearly every day, sparing me what would have only been a 10\-minute walk. I can hardly remember a time when he wouldnt offer to cook food, egg sandwiches aplenty. He attended every sports game that he could, not only for me, but for all seven of his grandchildren. A devout Catholic, he served as a Eucharistic Minister, often bringing me to Church with him before golf during the summers. He volunteered each year at the Church bazaar, as well as volunteering weekly at a local soup kitchen. He also was my mentor for Confirmation and the picture of us on that day  the most genuine smile across his face  is etched into my memory. Multiple heart attacks stripped him of much physical strength, the working capacity of his heart near a quarter of a healthy person. Yet he refused to let that limit his life  in fact, all of the recollections above occurred after his heart issues began. Complaints were rarely, if ever, uttered from his mouth. He was never wealthy and he faced health issues that I wouldnt wish upon anyone, yet he still wouldnt complain  not after any of his heart attacks and not when he was later diagnosed with melanoma. That melanoma advanced quickly  he went from fully functional to bed ridden within days  and the cancer ultimately ended his life in 2008 at just 66 years of age. I had visited him the night before, laying next to him in his bed. The greatest person that Ive ever known had passed away. I was given his wedding band, which I always keep close, either wearing it on my right\-hand right finger or my key chain. The summer winded down and my sophomore year of college approached. The weekend before the semester began, my family had friends over our house for a barbecue. I wasnt in much a mood to socialize and felt the need to visit the cemetery by myself. Tears streamed down my face as I drove and I continued to cry at his grave  this was the first time I visited his grave since the funeral and I havent been back ever since. My mother sensed that I was struggling and asked me if I wanted to stay home from college. I declined, feeling the need to escape my hometown and allow college life to occupy my mind. While I dont regret that decision, the year proved to be difficult. I managed to hold things together academically, even raising my GPA, but I wasnt emotionally stable. Id be laughing, drinking, and smoking marijuana with my friends on one night. And on the next night, Id be locked in my room, sobbing uncontrollably. Those swings continued for at least the next two years, although the valleys became somewhat less frequent over time. Not once did I share my troubles with anyone  I feared vulnerability and believed that I was strong enough to heal by myself. Then came the close of my junior year. After completing all of my final exams, I had packed up and was ready to head back home. With one last night together, my roommates and I chose to smoke once more before we all departed for the summer. We were pulled over by a campus officer that night. This resulted in my suspension from the university. Throughout college, marijuana became a growing part of my life. I smoked to bond with friends. I smoked to improve my sleep. I smoked to cope with my depression. When I smoked, I didnt focus on my troubles  I felt free and enjoyed the moment. But regardless of its benefit, I understood marijuana was illegal and so I accepted the consequences. My first night home, I laid on the couch, completely absent of energy. I didnt speak much with my parents and they thought I was either exhausted or sick. I could only think about how my life was a failure. The depression no longer had any resistance. I developed social anxiety and felt uncomfortable going out in public, even skipping my sisters birthday dinner that she had with friends. That summer, my family dog of 14 years passed away. I wasnt home at the time and my mother called to not only express the news, but ask me  since I had always been close with our dog  if I had wanted her cremated since a decision had to be made quickly. I opted for cremation and did not see our dog after she had passed until the ashes  which we can only assume were hers  were returned weeks later. Guided by my mother, I was able to immediately enroll in another four\-year university without missing any time. But after about one month, my anxiety became unmanageable and I chose to leave. I worked for my fathers company over that year, taking a few online classes, while trying to cope with my issues. There were dark times though. One of those times occurred when I discovered that my truck had a flat tire while I was driving down our driveway, which happens to be a hill. Despite knowing how dangerous it was to jack up and slide under a vehicle while its on a slope, I chose to move forward and change the tire right there. It was my way of tempting fate. Thankfully, nothing bad transpired  I changed the tire and went on my way. Perhaps the most vivid illustration of my troubles took place after I woke up in the middle of a night, writhing with pain in my lower back. The pain wouldnt allow me to sleep, so I sat on the living room couch for hours until the morning. Soon after my mother woke up, I explained the pain to her, vomiting shortly thereafter. Concerned that my kidneys were failing  an event not uncommon in our family history  she drove me to the hospital and was already thinking about finding a kidney donor. All the while, at 20 years of age, I was laying in the hospital bed completely at peace with whatever may happen, even death. If I were to die, itd be of natural causes, nothing that I could have defended against. Others would pity me. All of my pain  not the physical, but the mental  would vanish. Ultimately, they discovered that a kidney stone was to blame for the pain. I was released from the hospital later that day and life moved on. Not long after, I rescued a three\-week old puppy and the responsibility proved to be a much needed distraction. Now with another living creature to care for, I could no longer think only about myself. After the year had passed, I returned to my first university and completed my Bachelors degree. Theres not a simple way to tie up my fight with depression. There wasnt any clear moment of victory. In fact, the remnants still loom at my side. But my dog and personal successes  I've been thankful to enjoy fast advancement down a career path I enjoy  chipped it away over time. And despite my family never knowing the depth of my struggles, their presence offered reassurance throughout. Im in a good place now, able to live freely and enjoy life, but depression greatly inhibited me for years and its menace will never be lost on me. As private person, sharing this story was terrifying  so much so that I chose to remain anonymous for now  but I chose to move forward for two reasons: closure for myself and in hopes that it may help someone else. Not only is depression all too common itself, those who are suffering all too commonly keep it to themselves. If youre suffering from depression, please know that you are not alone. Please know that no matter how grim your life may seem, youre able to overcome."

It's unbelievable. I find I can't even let myself get close to people (relationships, friendships) because if I do I run the risk of feeling completely betrayed and worthless in the event that the other person doesn't reciprocate the trust and affection I extend to them (which is something I already find hard to do just by my nature). It's a physical feeling in my gut that I get and it's the worst feeling I know. I've given myself a very hard exterior in the hopes that this will act as a shield to this vulnerability, but it just doesn't really work. It just makes me feel like an imposter, and makes it impossible for me to be honest with myself and others about my predicament. All I really want is for people to be nice to me and act like they care, but it just seems like an impossible demand to make. What can I do to stop this from hindering my life so much? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance."

The last several months have been brutal in my world, yet also punctuated and defined by immense joy and beauty. I have so much to be joyful for, and at times, I am. I am also feeling more devastated and traumatized than ever \- and I'm no stranger to trauma. These past several months have seen the premature birth of our twins, hope against hope that they might be ok. Months spent in the NICU, all the while working my job as hard as I can while pretending that I'm not crying my eyes out every time I go to the bathroom. My partner and I have had some of the most exceptional moments together, and have also been awful to each other. Typical stress and externalized emotion from being in a veritable war zone for months on end. These past few months I've come to believe that despite what my partner says, my partner would be happier if I weren't here. Explanations and latent apologies aside, I am often related to as if I am the source of all that is wrong in the world. At times I hear so many good things from my partner: that I'm doing a great job, a wonderful father, that they don't hate every ounce of my being. I also hear attacks and vicious hatred. I start to have panic attacks as it gets closer to the time to go home every day. I fear the weekends. I know if I try hard enough, eventually they will come around and apologize and feel bad for how they treated me. I don't have the energy to seek resolution any more. I'm afraid of how living in this environment is shaping my mindset, already traumatized and exhausted \(e.g. it's totally normal to be sleep deprived with infant twins\), and to be faced with a presentation that all but screams, ""you're worthless, and wasting valuable resources."". I know my partner has a tendency to become hostile when I show vulnerability, especially when they are just as stressed and traumatized as I am. Despite knowing this, I can't help but reach out to them for love, caring, and support when I am at my weakest. I am an idiot. I did it again tonight. I cried in front of them, asked for a hug, and thought I was safe. Within an hour or two, they're at my throat. I can't help but think I deserve this. Thanks for listening."

Not one asked if I was okay or in need of support. The only reply I got back said something along the lines of how its bedtime and thats it. I wish people were more understanding of how utterly soul crushing and alienating depression can truly be. Sometimes I feel like my friends think Im over exaggerating when it comes to talking about it. Especially since the community we grew up in doesnt take too kindly to mental illness, and Ive been told my whole life by my family that my depression is nothing compared to their problems. So Ive gotten used to keeping my emotions hidden. All I want is for someone to actually be able to relate to me. "

Having a tough time getting through life. I know that there are many people who have had it much worse than I, and Im not looking to make a contest of whose had it worse. I just need to tell anyone, even strangers, how Im feeling. I broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years about 2 years ago. We both grew complacent in our relationship and were both unhappy with each other. I made the decision to end it because we were constantly fighting over everything. I wasnt happy and I knew I wasnt able to make her happy either. This was my longest and most meaningful relationship and I do still love and care for her, but I understand that I am just not the person that she needs. She moved out about two weeks after the breakup and moved in with my best friend. Just over a year ago I lost my father to liver cancer. He was 64 years old, and certainly not the ideal father at times, was definitely the man I looked up to the most. Who taught me so much. Who constantly told me how proud he was of me, even for the smallest of achievements. He also encouraged me to do my best, and told me to be proud of everything that I do, even if its not perfect. He loved me so much, and its been so very difficult not having him around. We discovered he had cancer about three months prior to his passing, and found out it was terminal. They recommended some treatments and said theres a possibility, but not a very high one. My dad has always been a very strong man. Never showing any physical weakness ever, and very, very rarely, showed some emotional vulnerability, but was never ashamed to show it. He loved and I mean fucking LOVED fixing old cars. Most of my time with him, is cranking wrenches and tools over old cars. After his diagnosis, all he wanted to do with his time was to have me come over and fix up a 69 Camaro with him. I would come over two or three times a week after work and wed work on the car. Two months after the diagnosis, his body wasnt processing foods or water, combined with chemo, it did a toll on him and he went to the hospital. At this time he was mostly sleeping all day, and it took so much out of him to get out of bed, dressed, and into the garage. While in the garage, he would fall asleep every 5-10 minutes, because he just was so physically weak. This was so hard for me, because my entire life Ive always seen him be such a pillar of strength. It was almost inconceivable. Before his diagnosis he was just fine, but his battle with cancer just progressed so quickly it was difficult to watch. I feel so guilty about some of the times I didnt go spend time with him and I regret it so much. I literally hate myself for not spending every waking moment with him after his diagnosis. About two weeks before he passed, my half sister from out of state came to visit because one of our cousins was getting married. My half sister and my dad (would have been stepfather, but my parents never wed) were also not on good terms. I had invited her and my step brother over, to visit him and to resolve anything they needed. He was pretty stubborn about it the whole time, but I hope that they got any closure they needed. Three days before he died, he went to the hospital again via ambulance. We were told this is pretty much it. He couldnt talk anymore. I left work and stayed with him until the evening, where he was sleeping/on meds the entire time. My mom and him had been on and off for 20 years, but at this time they were off and on bad terms. The week before he had gone to the hospital this time, my mom had flown out to California. Her sister was undergoing heart surgery and she had flown out to help my cousin with post op care. I called her and told her she needed to come back because it will be soon. It was about midnight, and I woke him to tell him I was going home, but he managed out a No! I just broke down right there. I stayed the night there with him. That was the last word anyone would ever hear from him. The next morning, I decided to start hospice. He was drifting in and out of consciousness but I knew things were getting close, and remembered him telling me long ago that he doesnt want to rot in a hospital bed. So we brought him home and started hospice. He seemed comfortable and at ease knowing he was back home. His two older sisters and my cousin and I were together with him. He afternoon before he passed, I called his best friend to visit and say goodbye. Another man whom I respect and is very strong. He tried to talk with him, and reminisced about their youth. That late evening his breathing slowed and it was his time. I layed next to him hugging him and told him how much I loved him and knew how much he loved me. He drifted peacefully off. So fast forward a year and Im having a hard time coping with this still. My work performance is suffering and Im eventually let go from my job of 4 years. Additionally this past week, my best friend told me that him and my ex were dating. Im not terribly surprised by this news, as I had seen it coming a mile away. My best friend becomes very reclusive when he is in a relationship and he had become that way a bit ago. They were always together and everyone in my ring of friends continued to question if they were dating, to which they denied it. But as this past year went on, I found myself being ostracized whether intentional or not by a few rings of friends. So my ex and I have a conversation about it and she tells me that they had been dating for a year and a half and started dating three months after we had broken up. Her reasoning is she was scared what people would think of her by dating my best friend. She mentioned she also attempted suicide about three weeks ago. Now I dont hate her or my friend, but I am incredibly disappointed, frustrated and feel disrespected and betrayed by both of them. I slap on a smile and tell her I need time to process this, but Im not sure if Im willing to forgive this betrayal by two of the closest people in my life. And then theres regular loneliness. I feel so alone all the time. I lost my job, I lost my father, and I lost two best friends. When Im invited to parties and events, Ill slap on a brave face. Ill laugh the night away. Ill try to make others laugh, and have fun. But no matter what I do, I feel so fucking alone. Despite the love Ive received in the past, I dont feel any of it from anyone. Selfishly, Im just hoping someone will want to be genuinely interested in spending time with me outside of just parties and events. Thanks for letting me vent and for listening to my problems. Im not suicidal at all and dont believe it to ever be an answer. "

Parents always have that ""oh great, it's this shit again"" look when i come home from school, tired and depressed out of my mind. Teachers have complained that i appear too sad at times. And to all that i have to say: I'm sorry. I'm sorry that i don't appear that i'm not having the time of my life 24/7. I'm sorry that i bring your mood down. I'm sorry that i can't control it. I'm genuinely sorry. But it tires me out. This ""happy"" mask ovewhelms me so much. It's like a wall that holds back a great rush of water. People don't want to see the furious water stream flowing. They want to see the stable, secure wall. And even if a small crack appears, they get upset. Upset at the loss of security. I despise to go all angsty ""fuck society"" teen on this, but society does not like depressed people at all. It's true that many provide their best contributions to help depressed people, but in the end, it's survival of the fittest. It's natural that you'll pick the enthusiastic, extroverted worker over the anxious, introverted one. Even if you show a tint of vulnerability and/or weakness to the outside world, you get immediately chewed out. And that sucks. That sucks so much. It's so depressing to see so many people being shamed, ridiculed and denied of things like jobs, relationships, etc, just because of this one condition. And it's not like it's external. It's not like a broken leg where people immediately recognise your issue and suddenly start treating you in the nicest way possible. No, it's in the brain. And that's the worst, because unless you call your therapist (that you have spent at least months talking to and they finally reach to the conclusion to diagnose you as depressed. Also, some people aren't allowed/ can't even afford one.) and have them confirm to the opposing person that in fact, yes, you are depressed, they won't believe you and call you a faker. Well, that's my depressing ramble of the day, just wanted to vent for a bit."

Been reading through a lot of posts to see feelings and thoughts that are all too familiar. Sadly, I hate to think anyone feels the way I do but it looks like the writing is on the wall here. I don't like to talk about how I feel to anyone because I feel it's a vulnerability. I have mentioned it to close friends before but it has come back to haunt me. People think I'm using it as an alibi or excuse to screw up and that couldn't be further from truth. I've been dealing with depression my whole life and I recently turned 40 yrs old. Lately, it's had a complete strangle on my life. I've been having issues sleeping for several weeks now and my world around me is crumbling once again. It's a frustrating thing to try to piece shit back together when you just don't have the mentality to do it. A lot of people have turned away from me in the last 5 years and it makes me want to ball up and cry though I just don't have the tears. Got that feeling that my describing characteristic is letting people down. I feel what a lot of people here have said that there is no one to talk to. I get to a point where it feels like my stomach is turned inside out and I grab my phone...but there's nobody to call. It hurts! It hurts to see people living normal lives around me bc I just can't do it. I'm glad to see friends and family around me not have to go through what I do but at the same time it makes me so jealous. Nice to find a place just to put it in writing. I'm not expecting anyone here to give me any answers as I know I can't offer support myself. All I can offer is an ear and a wish of good luck to anyone that feels like shit, It can get better but I don't know how. If I figure it out I will surely share. Good luck people!"

Ive been suffering from depression &amp; anxiety since 2014 which was the time I pulled myself out of a heavy drug addiction to crack cocaine (when I was with the wrong crowd). I maintained a job, fairly good relationships with family and friends and no body knew about it. When I went cold turkey - I didnt go to any support groups, no friends or family to confide in as well - because I lack trust due to my vulnerability and my sense of abandonment towards people in my life. I suffered HEAVY withdrawal, lost confidence (due to a break up with an older man) and lost 8kgs all together. It took me one hour of thinking before I could muster the courage to go to the supermarket - thats how bad my self esteem, anxiety and depression was. Everyday I told myself and visualised myself that I would be in a much better position, I would be healthier, I would be stronger, I would be prouder of myself and I would feel happy again. Everything Ive visualised has happened. I got a new position as marketing manager and earned more money, I gained weight and toned up, Im stronger, more flexible, gym 5-6times a week and a high achiever at work. But in December I tried to suicide by taking over 100 mixed prescription drugs and was admitted to hospital. Ive lost motivation for work, Ive lost motivation for life and my depression is back and I can feel it creeping up. I dont feel good about myself, I always think Im unattractive, I feel low on vibration and energy.. After trying to make myself by doing all I can to help my well being, sometimes I feel its all for nothing because I end up feeling this way anyway. When will this suffering end? Ive been with depression for 4 years now. Doesnt seem like its ever going away. Rant over - feels a lot better to get that out. Thanks for listening.. "

Today I experienced apathy and during the course of the day found a way to subside it. Whenever I get like that I guess Ive figured out that Im probably hurt and need to cry. Crying really is cathartic. I used to have these thoughts that were so cynical, like doubting peoples intentions and see, how superficial they really are. Im starting to understand about my mistrust, and also not engage in the thoughts and like just wait it out and distract myself. I had some of those thoughts today and I can feel some of the chaos they cause, like slicing myself up on the inside. And I dont want to do the damage. I understood recently I basically dont value my life. And well since that was the case why not get what I can? Like if my life is worthless what really should I fear? Fucking it up? Ive had so much fear. Crippling, honestly. Perfectionism, too. But recently I feel i can do more. Ive been so embarrassed about where I am in life. Behind. But some of that is dying away, I hope. I want whats most important to me. Connection. Trust. And also all of my damn emotions. Normalcy. Even to be normal would be enough. Ive had a long struggle with procrastination. Still do. But its much less painful and I am doing things. Also I am beginning to make an effort to not avoid minor but significant tasks like doing the dishes. Like I always have a mental block like resistance, but I am willing to deal with my issues. I give myself a break. I used to want to attempt every hard thing just to prove Im a hard worker. Now I do the possible thing that still feels good. I give myself less to do as well. I like choosing my battles. Today someone gave me shit and I was tempted to say fuck you instead of feeling guilty and responsible. Progress. Im still awkward at social gatherings but I prefer my present vulnerability to my armor of cynicism. At least Im connecting with people again. Ive been depressed and also isolated and I want to be friends with people and do things again. I still experience loss of energy and appetite. But I can get it back.

Panic. Isolation. If mental illness were a physical entity, I would have beat the everloving shit out of it, over and over. The numbness and pain it has caused me in life would make me unleash total wrath on it. Depression has robbed me of everyday joy and made me a walking apathetic zombie. It's hard to feel happy while anxiety jumbles my racing thoughts into a never\-ending stream of constant regrets and worries. Sometimes disassociating even for single second, from reality, kind of chills me out but running away doesn't solve anything. Most days are meh, as usual, but 'great' days are rare. It's hard, constantly battling these shadowing beasts while simultaneously plastering a facade in real life. One single negative thought suddenly warps into a downward spiral of darkness. It's lonely, and yet the deafening silence painfully stabs through an empty soul. Man, days like these are miserable. It sucks. I can't think clearly. Am I just being overly pessimistic? Why yes, of course. Snapping out of such mentality is hard. It's possible, but really, it's 10x easier to say than do. Have I tried to feel better? Yes, and it's working. Maybe our brains are all wonky, but self\-care shouldn't be neglected. If anything, it's helped me understand myself a bit better, but I won't lie, suicidal thoughts pop up now and then. No one should be afraid to admit their feelings due to stigma. Or maybe you're scared to reach out of angst that you might be bothersome or intentionally distance yourself to avoid being seen as 'weak' but putting yourself in a place vulnerability, such as this, should not feel like this. No, it shouldn't be like this. I understand everyone has reasons or distinct situations so I cannot speak for every single person but never be afraid to seek help for your struggles. For all of you reading, I hope you are okay. Just know that you're not alone. Stay strong. "

I bounce back and will be great for awhile and then when I fall back down I've been sinking lower and lower. I thought more seriously today about harming myself than I ever have. I thought about what I had at home that I could cut myself with. As I took my long drive home I sobbed and punched myself in my legs repeatedly. I just felt like there was no other way to express the amount of hatred I have for myself. I want to get better and I've tried little ways to improve my life- going to the movies after work, trying a new exercise, getting back into makeup. Things help marginally but not much. I take medication for ADHD and depression. I just have limited motivation to stick things out. When I'm well, self care is easy, but when things are bad I barely want to shower and just do what I can to mask the fact that I'm not clean and don't even have the motivation to take my clothes to the laundromat.

Every close friend feels distant, and the world in general seems to be moving along, while leaving me behind. I'd given up on the idea of suicide, or so I thought; the idea of falling back into that pit seems imminent, and makes me anxious. Every time I think I'm making progress, I get pushed back down, and every time I get pushed down, I make little effort to pick myself up again. Even though I bitch and moan about being alone, it's entirely my fault. It's my mistakes that pushed people away. It's my poor decisions; my desire to run away from anything that's emotionally toiling. Still, I bitch and I moan about being alienated. I don't feel like I belong, and I can't seem to remember a time when I did. Rather than my emotions receding, there's a growing emptiness, where I disconnect from me, and from the world, and watch things happen in third person. This way, I'm sure to be indestructible. Nothing can touch me. There's no vulnerability, and it's comforting. But even this comfort is temporary, because my friend - emptiness, brought along his pal: anxiety. Anxiety keeps asking questions. Is this who I am? Is this what I will always be? Is this all there is to life? If this is normal, how do people go about their daily lives? Does everyone ignore this overwhelming sense of forced humility? If this is life, I've no reason to live. Because this fucking sucks. Everyone leaves, and none of them seem to care, but it's not their fault, because I'd have probably done the same if I were them. It feels awkward writing this, because I've never used so many 'I's before. I never spoke about me, except with my therapist. I'd always offer to listen to a friend, over talking to them, but nobody bothered to reciprocate. Which is alright, as I don't expect anyone to do it. Every step of progress is based on doubt, and I'm afraid to look down to see if my progress really is progress, or if I'm climbing imaginary stairs. I don't know if I moved on from the girl I love(d); I don't know if I think I can get better at writing music; I don't know if I don't want to kill myself. I'm afraid to know. Nothing feels real. "

To be as brief as possible because I feel guilty taking up any space, I'm very depressed. I've had bad episodes before.

I don't feel like I deserve it. I tried to talk to my girlfriend about these things and I love her, but I'm so codependent that our relationship consists of me always running to her rescue.

They didn't know the posts were mine, and they basically spent the entire thirty minutes I was in class with them trashing things I've said and what they thought of me as a person. Their criticisms were almost cartoonish, things like, ""he's not one of us,"" ""that's so gross,"" and ""that's so cringy."" Looking back over the things I've said, I don't even think they're bad. I thought demonstrated a range of depth by talking comfortably about modern rap music, jazz and classical music, I thought I made jokes in the right places, and I thought I demonstrated vulnerability well. Their criticisms mostly were about me being vulnerable, (I mentioned that something made me feel insecure), which I really don't think is fair since there's a lot of subtle power in vulnerability. That, and I off-handedly referenced the LGBT community. That got barfing emoji reactions. Which makes me feel dreadful, since I belong to the LGBT community, and since people are nice to me in person, it's scary to think this is what people really feel. One of the boys even gave my cheery hello later. He might not even know I'm queer. I'm not sure, since I'm pretty out about it. But he seems to respect me because I beat him in chess and he's the president of chess club so he respects that sort of thing. I don't have a lot of friends at all. And the friends I do have are nice people but they don't share all of my interests. I like playing video games and these kids *the kids* who play video games. So I wish I could be close to them, but I can't because they seem to hate me for things I am or things I'm not willing to change. ...It's shitty. "

I've struggled with depression since I was in middle school, but when looking back on the entirety of my life it seems that I've always had anger management problems. I remember in 1st grade my teacher yelled at me because I was the biggest troublemaker in the class, despite me being the smartest. She literally said this to me. My family life was kind of fucked so I guess that is where it all stems from. Anyways, I really want to come out of this resilient but it seems that I'm currently at my lowest point and it's nothing how I would imagine ""rock bottom"" being. I went from being a fairly social person to having no one. I cry every single damn day. I do not know how to be a person anymore. I don't know how to have fun. It's like I pushed all my friends away, but I'm not really sure how. They all just stopped associating with me, probably because I suck to be around but that just makes my depression worse. No one wants to be my friend or hang out with my anymore, and that really did something to my overall confidence and trust in people. It's gotten to the point where I assume everyone hates me and I'm sure some people do. I'm bullied for my vulnerability and it becomes a never ending cycle of pain and anguish. I've realized that people like to prey on me because I'm an easy target and they don't understand why I am the way I am. To them I probably seem distant and cold intentionally, but I really just forgot how to socialize with people it's been so long. I feel worthless, as if I don't contribute a damn thing. I'm simply a blob taking up space. I can't even really talk to anymore anymore because I don't have anything valuable to say. It's like there's absolutely nothing going on up in my brain. I can't formulate thoughts or articulate myself how I want to... I feel that the best times of my life have already come and passed. I used to go out to music festivals with my friends, parties, even simply ""hanging out"" and doing lame fun things, but now I have no one to do those things with. I feel no purpose either, I feel like it an extremely long shot for me to achieve the things I truly want, and on top of that I have multiple people telling me how much of a long shot it is. I sincerely contemplate killing myself multiple days out of the week, but I'm too much of a pussy to do so. I sincerely feel that this is just how my life will be, as I've always felt some extent of this and I just don't see me getting better, only maybe learning how to deal with it everyday but I don't want to anymore. I'm so tired of faking conversations, faking smiles, faking that I'm ok when inside I feel a physical heaviness on my chest, in my throat, that pushes me on the brink of crying. I look around and see everyone around me (in college) living their best lives, doing things with friends, going out, LAUGHING and I feel like all of that has been taken from me, as if I've lost my right to do so. I've lost all energy in trying to maintain a positive, but fake, self image that I'm doing good and that in itself has only made things worse. My roommates think I'm an absolute drag to be around because I'm always sad, constantly crying everyday. I just really don't have the energy to do life anymore, I want out.. If this is how life is, I would rather just be dead. I do not see the beauty in the world anymore and it devastates me because it makes being hopeful seem impossible. Everything sucks and I don't think that this was how life was intended. Maybe I was a mistake. I'm tried many antidepressants and am currently taking wellbutrin, and have tried TMS therapy as well. I guess I'm just really fucked up in the head and no psychiatrist can fix me. I feel like it would literally take a miracle for me to be excited about my life again. For those of you who have been in similar depressive states, how in the world did you come out victorious? Is that even possible for people like me? What can I do to improve the fact that I'm just going through the motions? I want a life worth living, hell I even would just like to genuinely laugh and I don't think that's too much to ask for, but why can't I do so? "

Before today I havent felt a drop of depression in about two weeks. Id say thats the longest stretch since I can remember being depressed starting in 5th grade. It seems like my anxiety particularly is worse when I dont sleep enough and I havent slept more than 5 hours the last few nights. Woke up feeling totally exhausted and unmotivated to do any of the things I planned for today. Ended up going back to bed two separate time for an hour and then 3 more. Finally made it out of the house around 3pm. Not really feeling sad just sort of dull, irritable, and unmotivated, and a slight sense of fear and doom. Im thankful I havent experienced this in several weeks, and hoping it will remind me why my health is #1 right now. I had two weird nightmares about being trapped and out of control which is extremely unusual because I rarely remember dreams at all and for the ones Ive had they havent been so emotionally charged in many years. Get to see my brother for dinner tonight who I havent seen in 3 months, seeing him is important to me. Anxiety says my depressed state will rob me of my ability to be present and feel joy. Hoping to derive some joy from seeing him. Thanks for listening."

Perfectionism to most might seem like it's a good thing, but I would trade it for anything. Everyday, even the simplest of tasks and encounters become incredibly demanding because of it. Everything has to be perfect. My brain's idea of dealing with perfectionism is 'if it ain't perfect, don't do it'. This has made me procrastinate tremendously and I end up resorting to short quick dopamine rushes in the form of watching YouTube, browsing reddit or watching porn for several hours.The past 2 years of my life have been like this and my grades are taking a toll. I went to a psychologist around 6 months ago because I have an additional problem of picking and biting the skin around my finger even though they bleed (this along with my complusive thoughts are the ocd parts of my problems). I've been doing this for years and had gotten a lot worse the past 2 years. My fingers are discoloured and I have lot of open wounds. My mom took me to the psychologist to address this. I went for a few sessions and then quit going as I felt inferior, vulnerable and weak (Perfectionism again). Further I had some important tests to write and going to the psychologists felt like a waste of time. Fast forward to today, here I sit typing this. I feel like a sore loser with my confidence battered. I have no motivation to do anything. All I do is masturbate to increasingly disturbing and humiliating porn and watch YouTube. I'm from an Asian and I want to become a doctor(surprisingly it was my choice and no I wasn't forced by my parents). I have important exams to write the coming month and I need to start preparing. But the perfectionism gets in the way and I simply can't study. At every single moment for no rational reason I have to assert my superiority and it's consuming me.

I'm the youngest child that acts as head because the eldest has got her own stuff to sort out and the Middle is babied. I'm 22 this year and have been severely depressed for 2 years. I've been Suicidal. I still cannot admit out loud, or in writing how many times I've thought about it. I hide behind a bubbley, Happy, helpful, cheerful, sarcastic, persona. Deep down everything I do is staged. There is no feeling anymore I say I love you to my family, I mean it. When I am in pain, because of my chronic illness, i mean it. Those are the only things I genuinely feel. When I laugh. When I Say aww. When I'm forced to sit and talk about how my day was, how the food taste, when someone messages ""we should totally meet up"", when I do the chores, when I cook, when I go to bed etc... I'm faking. I can't feel. And I actually can't feel my body or face. It's numb. That's probably the meds. Maybe it's all the meds fault but my doctors all just treat me like I'm crazy. I'd honestly rather not see the doctors anymore. I don't want to do anything anymore. I just want to be normal again . this what is normal? I was once told by a psychic priest (Ikr) that I would kill myself or try to. It's been 4ish years since then and I think about what he said and if he was legit or not.  Still, it brings a smile to my face because I was so sooooo blown away! He told me I had the gift of singing and that someday soon my chronic pain would dissappear (still waiting ) and that I'd graduate uni when I was ready with a PhD in whatever I wanted. Nice story but I still wonder if he just wanted me to be happy you know."

I am momentary, and that makes me momentous. --- Vulnerability is not a sickness, it is the cure. Most of the people we will encounter that attempt to help us will try to eliminate the one thing that keeps the flame alive: being vulnerable. This may not be true for you. But know that if you are feeling vulnerable, there is a giant hole in your heart to be filled with what may be the most authentic thing that can possibly affirm your existence. It may be *nothing*, but *nothing* leaves room for something; in contrast, when the hole is fullwhen there is *no nothing*there is no room for anything more. And in that moment, you have ceased to grow. There is no need to keep fighting. You *already are*. So long as your heart continues to beat, until the very last moment, you are still fighting. Never forget that. Fight with patience. Fight with perspective. Virtues are illusions, and doubt is your most powerful asset. Wield it recklessly and it will show you what can be broken, and when that is broken you will know how sharp your blade is. Wield it carefully and you will break things anyway; you will also know how sharp your blade is then. But never let go of it, because with its sharpness it may sometimes hurt you but in the end, it will always protect you, until the very end. I am not one for adages and quick, memetic one-liners. Those, in my experience, do not help. So instead i want to remind you of what you already know: life is a paradox, and we exist only to watch one another so we can know that we ourselves are there. Let the illusions be illusions: theyre not any less significant, and the suffering in them is the beautiful reminder of the conflict that brought about our lives. I love you, and you are in my heart. Write it all down. On a note in your phone, in your notebook, wherever. Whatever youre thinking and feeling. Be that person outside yourself reminding you of yourself. &lt;#"

I had issues with her when I was younger, when my depression was really bad. I used to imagine horrible things happening to her and I wanted her dead. At my worst, I strangled her without intending to cause any harm, it was because I was provoked. Back then, she talked about crashing the car to kill us both, she told me I was evil and that I would burn if I entered a church. But that wasn't her and that wasn't me. It was a long time ago when things were bad. We've moved on a lot since then. I love her and would be devastated if anything happened to her. I've never felt this way about anyone else I'v ever met. I've never loved or hated anyone as much. I'm disgusted by her a lot of the time. It's everything about her...It revolts me. I don't like touching her clothes, I can't watch her eat or sleep. She seems dirty to me, even when she's clean. What's wrong with me? Is it something simple like I see myself in her and because I hate myself I hate parts of her too? "
323,vulnerability,depression,Finding Strength in Vulnerability,2,7uq1gy,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7uq1gy/finding_strength_in_vulnerability/,2018-02-02 19:47:09,"I originally wrote this as a post on my blog (amiablepotential.com), but I thought I'd post it here after I found this page. Through all the years that I've dealt with depression, I have too often let my pride stand in the way of getting help, but I also let it stand in the way of being empathetic with others. I hope this helps anyone struggling with the same things. When I find a song that I really like, I tend to put it on repeat. All day long. Ill listen to it in the car on the way to work and school. I put my headphones in and listen to it while walking from my car to my classes. Ive got it on while Im in the shower, while I do the dishesyou get the picture. (I do try to keep the volume low so my roommates dont hate me. So far, so good-as far I know.) Luckily, this only lasts a few days to a week, until I have to avoid the song for a while before putting it back into normal rotation. As I mentioned in last Saturdays post, the song of last week was Naked by James Arthur. For the first day or two, I listened superficially. The song has a melancholy but lovely melody and passionate vocals that compelled me to listen again and again. Then, one night I was tossing about, praying for sleep to grace me with its presence, and I turned it on hoping his soothing voice would lull me to sleep. Well, lets just say that it didnt help with the sleeping, but it did force me to listen more closely to the lyrics. These words hit me in particular: Im not gonna wait until youre done pretending you dont need anyone I used to be the person pretending that I didnt need anyone. Whether it stemmed from depression, anxiety, or general shyness and insecurity, I dont know, but for most of my life I kept people at a distance. I only let them see the shiny exterior (which one can only project for so long). I was so determined to prove I was fine on my own that I missed out on opportunities to get to know some great people. That all changed in college when I made friends with people who didnt take no for an answer. They just were my friends. January of 2016, when my mental health took a nose dive, I put up my usual barricades and tried to retreat into myself. I dont think that I will ever be able to fully express my gratitude for my friends at that time. I remember a particular day when my roommate refused to let me brood over my anxious and depressed state and coaxed me into talking about what was going on. At that point, I didnt understand that I was mentally ill. I figured that if I just plugged along, doing my best to take care of my physical health and trying to be happy, my problems would resolve themselves. I definitely didnt need any other human besides myself to fix my troubles. I was always more than happy to listen when others needed someone to talk to, but I didnt need anything from anyone. From that day on, I gradually began (with extensive help from my roommate) to see the value in sharing my feelings and experiences. At first, it was all for me. Keeping things bottled up only made me feel worse, so I learned to share with friends and family. Letting other people in on my mental state allowed my loved ones to direct me towards professional help and to provide the encouragement and emotional support that I needed on a day-to-day (lets be honest: minute-to-minute) basis. Over the next two years, I continued this dialogue. As my health improved, sharing went from emotionally vomiting to constructive conversations. I discovered that a number of people in my circle of friends had dealt with/still deal with similar struggles. The more I talked to others, the more I realized that I was not alone in my pain. Sometimes, I needed to listen, and other times I needed to talk. The more I talked, and the more I listened, the more I realized how pointless it was for me to keep people at a football fields length. I needed them, and they needed me. Pretending that I didnt need anyone only isolated me and allowed depression to fill my brain with its lies. I couldnt live off of keeping the depression at bay; I needed to fill my mind with truth, empathy, love, kindness, understanding. Getting half of you just aint enough We think that putting up walls shows our strength, but if we are strong we dont need the walls. It takes strength to be vulnerable, to shed our facades. Pretending that my life was perfect didnt make it so. Rather, it prevented me from being authentic with others. We don't need to tell every person who says hello about all our struggles, but we do have to let go of the need to appear perfectly put together. We all need at least one person in our lives who will listen to us and still love us even when we are a mess, even when we feel that we are worthless and useless. Otherwise, we are only playacting, only being half of who we are. I see a great example of this when I watch certain selfish dancers. By selfish, I mean they dance for themselves, sometimes because theyre so focused on being perfect that they forget to perform and sometimes because theyre cocky. My favorite dancers to watch are the ones that give their everything. In the moment, theyre sharing a piece of their soul with their audience. Im not gonna try til you decide youre ready to swallow all your pride. While I was in the process of finding a strength in vulnerability, I met a person who had more walls up than I did. I make no claims of being perfect in the situation, but at a certain point I could no longer deal with the fortress preventing me from seeing the real person. I couldnt wait around for someone who tried to overtly push me away yet subtly keep me around. My own personal progression required me to move on. Cant you see that Im naked Here on this blog, I am attempting to continue this journey of finding strength in vulnerability. In sharing my experiences, I find that I am able to make sense of and learn from them. I hope you find something valuable in them as well. Thank you for letting me share with you."

The things I want in life are pretty standard, but seem impossible to me and the times I have tried to achieve them, I give up soon because I can't stand emotional pain. These days it's mostly numbness. I just wish there was someone I could love and be loved by. To not be scared to love or be vulnerable. I'm too afraid to be open around people. I'm a square and give off a weird aura most likely. It'd be so nice to smile with someone and not feel like I'm expecting pain to occur in my moment of vulnerability. I'm what is known as coddled trash. 28, a decade in my room. Now i'm just hopeless. The thought of connecting with people just makes me feel so cynical. I have a hard time trusting that my presence isn't a nuisance. I get attached far too quickly to anyone who shows any amount of interest thought they won't know it since I like to hide how I feel. I just end up staring at chat windows, or checking them every half hour just to see if they've written and somehow I've not been notified. That is, when I'm trying to form new connections. But they never last of course. I'm so bland and dead inside. I have nothing to contribute but what is left of me to someone else. I feel better when I can give what emotional support I have to someone as I live through them vicariously. It makes my life feel purposeful and not like it was the waste that it feels like. I don't like cry. When I do, it's just too much to feel. I wish I had one of those people who write on here to say that they're so worried about their friend/boyfriend/sibling. It'd be so nice to be cared about so much. There's nothing to respond with, because I won't change. Just wanted to write this for whatever stupid reason. If you got to here.. thank you. "

If I feel a happy loving feeling when doing things with my family, I can't stop thinking about how harm or even death could occur to them. I believe it's because when I'm depressed, I have nothing to lose and also that if there was a sick god (Many times I feel like things happen to me on purpose), he would go easy on me because he's already caused me pain.

A lost person engulfing myself in negative self-analysis. This black void keeps shooting me with these emotional bullets. It should have been gone by now, should it? This voice, it talks to me a lot every day, and it has grown to become my frenemy. I knew part of me was that voice the whole time that was and is constantly draining my energy. There are times I am hopeful to reach the top of this moutain of life, in other words, the summit. But sometimes this self-loathe has become me, and I have become it. Hopes and dreams remain dreams. Anxiety and depression became a team. Anxiety and depression make an iconic duo. They score 10 while I score zero. Constantly looking for a cure for emptiness. They call me emo but I am rather emotionless. Maybe not emotionless, but rather negatively expressive. Negative to myself that even though I look calm, this weight inside keeps pulling me down and it is agressive. I am in a shifting spiritual equinox. Most of the time everything becomes uneven and this negativity knocks. Sometimes I overcome it, sometimes I feel like a coward. But there are times the light wins but sometimes in darkness it is being overpowered. My thoughts are dark, cynical empty sycophants. Asking me over and over what is my significance. Then again, I know I can never make this hole disappear but I can shrink it. I can shrink it by being productive and doing something new because then again, there are no limits. Yes I do want to live but sometimes I just lose the will. In reality we wear masks despite we look like we're just keeping it real. But yes, I do know life is irrefutable and the presence of hope is uplifting. The yin and yang of life reminds me I'm okay and it sounds rather fitting. I am not gonna give in without taking some action. As I overcome my self-enemy, hopefully it will bring some chain reaction. That I am making progress. That I am not helpless. In my mind I am struggling but on the outside I keep it subtle. With all these questions in life I do my best to reply with a rebuttal. Regardless of this pressure, I realize in life there is something profound. The mind is a house that keeps settling but there are times it is sound. As humans like a book or a project we undergo numerous drafts. We become lost and discover bright but also dark places in our personal maps. We could be rushing ourselves like a school project and become stressed and convoluted. Comparing ourselves to different people, struggling to find where we are better suited. Here I am finding myself through writing, joining other people, and devotion. In an attempt to hopefully bring back myself and to set my spirit in motion. I do not want to go to college for an unfulfilling plan to work in an office cubicle. I do not want to settle for lesser things I don't enjoy and not leave behind something beautiful. For the time being my mind is sane. I know that there are times when my personal demons become mundane. Then again, I realized that it felt great to reach out instead of sinking on my own in storms I can't control. I discovered I do not have to have everything just to feel whole. To continue and let the past rest in peace To change this routine, and reinvent its recipes To live as a human instead of a living dead type of machine To figure out life and appreciate everything, and everyone, and what they mean As I fight my impulses and thoughts, I can only hope. Even when I feel like I just wasted money on a never-to-be-used rope, That if I change my mind, and put down the noose and the knife. There's one important thing I didn't waste as long as I'm still breathing: life. Fortunately I haven't yet reached life's uncertain conclusion. Hopefully I'll discover something in me a more defining, deeper resolution. To have no reason to live in self-loathe, overthinking, anxiety and denial. And to just find myself, and to just make an impact to make my days on Earth worthwhile. Note: This is still a work in progress. For me it could use some edits and some additions/removing. I've been writing these since May. Some days I write a few lines and verses and they mostly vary because my mood changes per day/time. I never get to write because of school but I also lost my energy for writing since last 2016 and all I could write are mainly negative thoughts. A LOT of them. It took 60 pages when I pasted them in MS word. Not all of them are negative though. Some lines were about about finding hope and meaning. Some are dark and talk about ending it that I had to filter some out, but I still keep them. Throughout this year I must say I have changed a lot as a person. A lot of things have happened. I'm grateful for the people who helped me at my worst, and influenced me to become a better person, even though they have no idea. It's been a series of being lost, numbness, existential crisis, bad decisions, feeling worthless, depression and anxiety but also happiness, development, vulnerability, optimism and hope. Concealing it for God knows how long hurts, I confessed it to a good friend of mine and received a counseling session in August. I opened up myself, though recently I've been isolating myself and been feeling numb at the times I was supposed to reach out and talk to the school counselor and my friend. And since I'm numb I can't force anything to come out otherwise it would seem forced. Some days and nights I would just cry and tear up and hide it. Still depressed but I've grown as a person. This ain't a success story yet 'cause I'm not done yet with life, nor this is a ""failure"" story, hopefully it won't be. I want to hold on to that will. If you're still reading this, thank you for reading and your time. Let me know what you think if you want. Wishing everyone a merry christmas and a good day/night."

However, when we were teenagers we grew apart. My cousin is autistic but he always wanted to live independently. Anyway, he left his parents house and started working around the country (United States). Unfortunately, he ended up living with a woman who had some sort of personality disorder. She was attracted to the fact that he was autistic and liked this vulnerability. When he eventually said that he wished to leave and move on, she tied him up and kept him as a prisoner basically. She would leave him long periods of the day (tied up so he couldn't escape) while she was out at work or shopping and then she used to come back and sexually assault him basically (he is essentially asexual so he didn't even know what was happening to him). This would have continued for god knows how long until a neighbour found out what was happening and alerted the police. She is now in prison and out of his life. However, he has been essentially sectioned for a while (because of the mental state he was in) and he is very upset by this as he has always resented his autism 'holding me back' and he wants to leave and start travelling across the United States again. This has lead to him becoming suicidal (which of course is not going to make the doctors want to release him). I hate seeing him as a shadow of his former self but everytime I visit he asks me if I can help release him? The problem is that he wants a lifestyle of travel and doing labour here and there. he is very hardworking that is no problem. However, his autism makes him vulnerable and he refuses to see this? Anyone been in a similar situation?"

This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations, including other people.[18]:109 Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by believing in a just world, blaming victims for their suffering, and making defensive attributions, which explain our behavior in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality.[18]:111 Researchers have found that mildly depressed individuals often lack this bias and actually have more realistic perceptions of reality (as measured by the opinions of others).[20] Lol, sorry, i should have explained what this shit means. Realistic perception means you can understand both personal deffects and also situation ones, it just means you don't excuse yourself for your mistakes or wrong doings, but you also will not excuse anyone. You have higher moral standards. You see things for what they are. Happy people will fuck up today, rationalize their bullshit away in one sentence and completely forget about it.

This is my first post on reddit even though I've used it for quite a long time and I haven't even made a single comment, either. The reason for that is because I've got severe cyber anxiety (scientifically discovered yet or not). Despite having many ideas and experiences to share online, the fear of being attacked, mocked, insulted or looked down prevents me every time. Like many of people here, I've also got social anxiety and depression, accompanied with a naturally boring personality, which make it nearly impossible for me to make friends and maintain relationship. In my secondary and high school, I used to have a number of close friends who valued me, wished me a happy birthday every year and even gave me small birthday presents but not anymore since I went to college and suffered from depression for the first time. I didn't contact them anymore so they probably thought I lost interest in them and let me go too, while it was just my depression which kept me from maintaining relationship in my life. Throughout these years, I've only got groupwork mates, fake friends (been bullied and stabbed in the back by them) and some regular acquaintances, all of whom don't care to be my close friends inspite of my kindness and will to be friends with them. Yesterday was my birthday and I planned to turn the internet off that day because I didn't want to stare at the truth that no one would care about me, no one would wish me a happy birthday although they all got notification of it on SNS. Today, I turned on the internet trying to trick myself that today was just another regular day, no birthday ever happened in order to hurt less but it was in vain. Like previous years, no notifications of any birthday wishes from anyone, even one college friend who treats me quite well (but he probably doesn't consider me a worthy friend, which I've felt so far). I'm not the type to show my misfortune and vulnerability to anyone beside my parents because I'm really scared to be laughed at or attacked, it took me much of my courage to share it here for I couldn't keep it in my chest any longer. I didn't intend to make it this long at first. I have longed for someone's empathy even if it comes from a stranger on the internet because I need to feel that I'm still connected with the world, to feel that someone still considers me a human being with the need of being cared for, not an unworthy person for anyone to give a sht like I've been. Although I have wanted to take my life and nearly attempted to do it many times, I couldn't do it because I've still got my parents who love me. Maybe in the future after they've left me, I might do it but not now, so I need a reason to keep going."

I should lead this off with the fact that nobody and i mean NOBODY knows about this, not even my closest friends or family, for reasons im sure many of you are familiar with as well as some other reasons, but that's not the point of this post.So I have scheduled my first appointment with a mental health specialist, and though it is hard to admit I'm really just terrified of going. I don't know what I will say, what will happen afterwards, and for someone who has told nobody in their life about it I can imagine it will be incredibly difficult to talk about. Honestly one of my worst fears is being prescribed some sort of therapy, as talking about feelings or emotions has always been awful for me and I can't imagine going to a meeting where that is all I do. All I know is it is finally time for me to get rid of this before I do something bad, because it has got to the point where these thoughts cloud my mind every day, all day. So, I'm wondering if there is anyone who can tell what to expect from this appointment, what I should come prepared with, what will most likely happen, that kind of thing. Maybe therapy is what I'm going to need in the end, I don't know. Because currently whenever I have any feelings associated even slightly with weakness or vulnerability, I simply mask them, nobody can ever see it. I just don't know what to do anymore. "

I don't want to eat healthy. After spending a whole day at a job that drains me and stresses me out, I want to go home, lie on the couch wallowing in my own sadness, eat pizza until the carb coma kicks in, take a nap until 10pm, wake up to play some video games, and then go to bed. I also am incapable of telling good things to myself. I've been told to ""celebrate your accomplishments"" but I do not have any. I do not feel worth anyone's time or effort.

Things are still happening. I feel like I get more and more behind everyday. I compare myself to everyone around me. I want to be anyone but myself. I perform improv comedy which is an incredibly supportive and friendly setting, and I can't watch other people succeed because I feel worse about myself. I don't want to be like this. I am introspective enough to know that this is all wrong and that I shouldn't be thinking and feeling these things. But it's as if the real me is bound and gagged and screaming for help but some sadness and misery monster has taken over and is torturing me. Because I am always comparing myself to others, I am not comfortable showing my vulnerability to others. I have spoken to two people about all of this, my boyfriend and one of our mutual friends who has also struggled with this type of stuff before. I feel like I can't lean on them anymore. They tell me that I am not bothering them but to me, it's just a matter of time. Everyone reaches their limit on how much they can take hearing about something. Eventually, they will lose their patience. I'm not willing to push the limits on that. I don't want to lose them (the real me rips the tape from their mouth long enough to scream ""what's the point of having a support system if you aren't going to utilize it""). My boyfriend is funny, talented, smart, mature, sweet, compassionate, gentle, and just amazing. He doesn't deserve this. He doesn't need a project. He shouldn't have to hear about this all of the time. He deserves to be with someone who is happy, healthy, taking care of themselves, successful, and who puts the same amount of help and support to the other person in the relationship. It's hard to be supportive when I feel like this 24/7. He isn't doing anything to make me feel like this either. I know it's me (the real me knows it's me). I used to look at my relationships as something that I was happy about and thankful for. Now I look at all of my relationships and feel guilty. I feel like I have trapped them. I am not offering anything to anyone that is enough. I am not putting anything into the world that would compensate for all of the negativity and sadness that I am. Even through all of this, I know that the simple fact that I feel this way is enough to drive people away. I can't take it anymore. I'm tired of feeling guilty about myself. I'm tired of feeling like a do nothing burden. While I have not considered hurting myself, I do want to run away or just cut ties with everyone and everything and stay by myself forever. I started out typing this as motivated to talk to people, but I don't even want to do that anymore. If you have read all of this, I'm sorry. I'm not worth your time."

You see my friend/co-worker is transferring to another branch because she got promoted. Yay for her. Then, there was this guy from work who I come to liked so much. The same guy who lead me on and then when I started liking back he said he is not ready for relationship. Anyways, that is another story. Tomorrow is his last day in our branch. He just came to help. So after work, I receive an email from my counselour asking about when our next sched is gonna be with a suggestion of watching a video from youtube. And so I spent the next minutes watching ""Bren Brown"". Let me tell you, I got a revelation. That is to feel something (in my case, deep sadness) is better than nothing. This reminds me of those times when I feel nothing and it's horrible. I used to play games and read manga just to feel something. I guess I come a long way from not talking to anybody for days. If you have the time watch ""the power of vulnerability"" in youtube. It is interesting! Now I am not that sad anymore."

But I hate myself for not having a larger penis. It makes me angry, and bitter. If I decided to watch porn, and I am not entirely focused on it, I'll notice the difference in girth alone, and feel crushed. I mean, I have a girlfriend, who has never had any complaints about our sex life. But I still can't stop worrying about it. She doesn't know I spend a few nights a week, trying to figure out what I can do to increase in size. I know this is petty, and I should stop letting my pride get in the way of my life, but I simply don't know how to not care. My girlfriend and I have considered having threesomes before as we are both bisexual. And at first the thought sounds exciting, but I always worry about the chance that someone better than me will give her an experience I can't. I supposed this is another reason couples stay monogamous. I'm sorry if this wasn't the right place to post this, I just wanted to vent somewhere. If it helps I also constantly battle existential dread, and anxiety. Actually, why don't I just talk about that too. I'm mostly nocturnal, so I stay awake throughout the whole night, often falling asleep at 9am, and waking up at 5. Unless I have work, then i wake up an hour before work. I attend an online college, and have a lot of hopes, and aspirations. But every night. No matter what, I start to panic about my life. I don't have friends anymore. They're all off to real colleges. It more often than not feels like I'm going nowhere in life. And I'm somehow brought to the fact that I will one day die. Each night this eats away at me. Because it feels like my life will be like this forever, until it ends. And I end up questioning why I've even lived this long. I question why I haven't killed myself yet if I know it'll be like this forever. I know the answer, I'm horribly afraid to die. It makes no sense how I can focus on it so much, if it's something I am afraid of. I don't get it. I don't understand at all. I often end up crying in the middle of the night. Or getting angry at myself, and punch myself in the head. Or just outright spazzing. I mean i physically writhe, and jerk about. Like i'm having a seizure or something. Whenever my girlfriend sees this, she freaks out. She too suffers from anxiety. And whenever she sees me in this state, she can't take it. I've withdrawn from telling her when I feel like this because she isn't mentally able to deal with very often. I don't trust my parents to see me in that state of vulnerability. My girlfriend is the only I've allowed to see me bawl my eyes out in the past 4 years. Others have seen me tear up if it couldn't be helped. I want so much in life. But it feels like none of it is possible. I often feel like I'm just trying to senselessly preoccupy time by hoping for things that are not possible. I also have a horrible vaping addiction, and no matter how much I try to quit I never completely stop. I get to low nicotine level, and spike right back up to the highest I can. I hate it. It's been destroying my mouth, and I've been trying to convince myself otherwise. Whenever I smoke, I have anxiety attacks about my teeth falling out. I don't have health insurance. So I can't go to a dentist. I'm almost certain I have gum disease. Wow. I am an absolute mess. "

I dont ever wish to sound self-righteous about your feelings or my progress. This is why Im here today. Of all the rainbows I try to place on a cloudy day I recently was told my attitude is self-righteous and not a good look?!??! This came from a community of Portland Lyft/Uber drivers. I was only trying to ease everyones minds about the new changes. But aside from this with all the growth Ive come across I find myself still lost after all the high. Im grasping to keep it but the fucking world is a shitty place and thats all I receive from it. While I see people finding success and acknowledgements Im just me with not much recognition for the things I accomplish. This is why I quit school why I drive for a living now why I dont feel like opening to anything anymore. You give the world your vulnerability and most of the world shits on you like you werent worth it in the first place.

I later learned she was cheating on me. Even asking her when breaking up with me I asked, ""is it because of xyz?"". ""No"", she replied. I was lied to and manipulated to the end. Midterms after that breakup, needless to say, sucked. Engineering courses don't f*ck around. Mormon family tried manipulating me after my breakup, in my vulnerability to go back to church. Please no. My dog is dying. Pretty well is dead. He doesn't even bark anymore. Just sleeps all day. He's probably as miserable as me right now. I fell in love again. How did I let myself do this? She woke up one day and told me she wasn't over her ex. We decided to be friends while she gets over her feelings for him. Wait, jk, she needs space for a year. Goodbye I guess. RIP Heart again. Ah another semester. Even harder classes this semester? Oh 3 more semesters after this with some of the hardest engineering courses ahead? You're kidding. I hate this. I'm not happy. According to my Mormon family its cause I don't go to church. I hate religion. I can't even drink because I've been brainwashed for YEARS of my life that shit is going to send you to hell. Even after years of not being Mormon it still messes with my head. I just want to be normal. Ah lets not even talk about the bank account. This has been 2017. Please help."

I'm not good looking; not the tallest guy and I lack in the confidence department.. heck I've never had a girlfriend lol. I currently have no one to vent to, and feel as if I'd be too embarrassed to talk to someone about this. I think that I'm afraid of exposing my vulnerability.

URL It states 14 symptoms of people who suffer from depression. I have all of them to varying degrees. I was sexually abused by 2 extended family members and neighbor teens when I was a child and I know I struggle with self-worth and people pleasing. My husband left me and we divorced and he remarried shortly after and I am still suffering from the pain of that almost 2 years later. I do not miss him or the pain he inflicted - as he seems to exhibit characteristics of Narcissistic Personality Disorder - but I do miss having a partnership and the good parts of the marriage. As to the symptoms stated in the article, I am spontaneous, I often jump into new things without thinking about a plan and then I usually drop out after being so excited about it and even enjoying it. I just cannot seem to get myself there many times. I have a messy house and car that I clean sporadically and while beating myself up because I so want it to be clean but I cannot keep it that way. I often am totally unmotivated to do much. I have to pump myself up or I have to undividedly focus on something to get it done - otherwise time just slips away and I get nothing done. I can only hang out with people a certain amount of time and then I have to retreat and recharge. It exhausts me sometimes. I overthink. I overthink. I overthink everything. How I came across, people's responses, body language, tone, how I could have done or communicated something more effectively. I try not to care about what people think but I do, too much. I desire friends but cannot seem to find anyone I truly trust, probably because I overthink everything. I seek honestly, openness, vulnerability, accountability, but very few people seek these things - honestly and truly. They say they do but do not follow through. I do not believe I am worthy of love - that I have too much that put people off but I do want close relationships. I seek deeper conversations but people often enjoy superficial chitchat - which I despise. I want help and will seek a free or low cost affordable option but even that seems like so much to do. I have never considered suicide but I do often seclude myself in my home for a day or two when I need to take a break from things. I also will do brainless things like binge watch shows or play games on my phone just to numb myself and take my mind off of overthinking. Does anyone else feel any combination of what I am exhibiting. Does this sound like depression or could it be something else? I am not seeking professional insight here, just some personal like experiences. I often feel so alone in how I feel as if I'm the only weirdo that thinks the way I do. "

I immediately backed out from my sole purpose of coming to school. I skipped my class and talked to the counselor. She was a nice person and easy to talk with. Compared to my psychiatrist, I had all the time to talk to her. She dug deeper to my experiences on what really caused my depression. I found out that my vulnerability and personality made a great toll to my disorder. Because of it I had a hard time building strong relationship with other people. The people in my surroundings were indeed willing to help and support mein any way, however, I was the one who kept pushing them away/kept myself distant from them. The fault was with me not them. My disorder has been a part of me since childhood that I was not aware of. It's gonna take some time for me to really change 'cause my negative coping mechanisms has been a habit for a really long time. But, it's good that I now know what are the causes and effects of my disorder."

Its like when you watch one of those movies/shows with one of the characters getting themselves into common situations (I.E having to talk infront of people, making friends, going for a relationship), and it always manages to fall apart for them through some ridiculous coincidence or mistake. Every aspect of my life boils down to cruel unluckiness. Its as if someone is watching over me and picks the most ridiculous drawn out scenario to ruin something good going for me. Relationships arent as simple as ""I dont find you attractive so I have no interest"" or vice-versa, its always drawn out pandering that always leads *me* to nowhere. It doesnt matter what I do to prevent it, it just boils down to whoever is looking over me to be nice for one day. Getting my first job, I was mistakenly called by employers twice, because my name was similar to someone they wanted to hire ON TWO DIFFERENT OCCASIONS. I had to lie to an employer to get my job/ Two women I actually managed to ""attract"" (used very loosely) each had a long 1 month or longer escapade that just resulted in me looking like a fucking idiot. First one already was in a relationship but decided not to tell me until halfway through our ""thing"", and the second led me on to believe I was making some sort of progress but ultimately i was just used as a fucking lapdog, from which i found out from one of my best friends after he told me that she came onto him the night before that led to sex/ My entire education itself is just a fucking giant wall of mediocrity. Im neither good nor bad. Im floating a 3.1 GPA which looks as if it will fall off a cliff soon with how schooling is going. But by far the worst part? I overthink every aspect of my life. I try my absolute hardest to avoid failures and am always hit by a blind sider. Something so ridiculous I couldnt even factor something like that if I wanted too. It doesnt matter how much I prepare, life doesnt give a single shit. Friendships are essentially me being paranoid of fake emotions to allow me to show some sort of vulnerability. It feels as if every person has an agenda and they are going to use me as a means to reach that agenda. Im just a pawn for more successful people, despite my attempts to become one of the controlling. Next time a friend tells you a funny story about something to happened to someone, that person is probably me. At this point, I will either end up in a ditch somewhere going through a drug induced psychosis or dead by some dumbass means. They both sound better than this setup to make me look like a jackass yet again. "

Sub-Reddit? Whatever it's called, I found it and I've already commented a couple of times, but I've yet to create my own post so I thought I should share a little too. I'm 33 years old and I've been dealing with clinical depression (diagnosed) for around two decades. As I'm sure many of you are intimately aware, depression tends to wax and wane. For me right now, it's waxing. I'm not going to go into any specific details as to possible factors, I'm just going to say that for a good few months I've been feeling sad, lonely, and lost. As though I'm just drifting along without any purpose or connection to the world, with a hollow, empty feeling inside. Any way you look at it, it's not a great way to feel. Moving on though, I have a couple of friends who also struggle with depression, and they often come to me for guidance due to my experience with it, and one of the things I've done is steer them towards the idea of therapy with a licensed, practicing psychologist, because as helpful as I might be to them, I'm not a professional. And on that note, I thought I'd share that I've decided to follow my own advice, and after looking through the listings of a bunch of in-network psychologists, I made an appointment to meet with one next week. I don't know how well it will go, whether or not I'll feel comfortable enough to open up to them. Frankly, it's hard for me to open up regardless of how comfortable I am. Sure I can share surface stuff, but the really deep stuff, my ""emotional core"" if you will, I don't know the last time I cracked that shell (if I ever have). I wonder if a part of me is afraid to expose it, perhaps for fear of how I'll be seen, or maybe just fear of that level of vulnerability, I'm not sure. But I'm going to try anyway, because I know that right now I'm very unhappy, and nobody should have to go through life feeling this way. The help is out there, and I'm going to try and get it. But listen, this isn't a ego stroking post, it's my hope that by posting what I'm going through, and the fact that as daunting as it is, I'm going to try to get the help I need, I can inspire some of you who are in similar situations to also take those first steps towards seeking help. Depression is a horrible illness, but it's a treatable one, we just have to find the strength and courage to seek out help. Anyway, thanks for reading."

I have lived what feels like a miserable existence because I do not like being put on the spot, I doubt myself in times were I can prove myself, I convince myself that I do not need anyone in order to not be a burden. I know I am taking loved ones' unconditional love for granted because I do not want to get hurt and feel vulnerable. I also live by poor standards because I do not love myself enough to care, but those poor standards end up hurting those around you, especially those you love. Little by little I gained insight on what could help me get through life, and here are what I learned and analyzed in hopes it can help understand myself and where depression comes from. NOTE: I am not selling anything, these are just summed up areas I looked into and just hope others can gain insight, to look into for themselves, to expand on their curiosity, and have any questions. * **Power of Attraction** Do something and you create a pathway to learning and furthering yourself. By putting out your grievances and pain out where others can see/hear it, you literally plant the seed and it can do nothing but grow. If you seek help, not only do you gain advice and wisdom, but you gain brothers and sisters who also share your pain and understanding to lock their arms with you to believe in your success. * **Power of Now.** Being *PRESENT* means your mind is not pre-occupied by thoughts of the PAST(Reliving unpleasant experiences), FUTURE(Worrying about what hasn't happened or never will happen), or somewhere else that isn't where your are in the PRESENT(thinking about someone else, another country, what others might think of you) because these are completely irrelevant to your existence and happiness. LITERALLY IRRELEVANT because they block you from celebrating who you are, where you are, who you're with, spotting new experiences in front of you waiting to further your mind and body. You are NOT your thoughts. You are a being that feels: * **Thoughts** - Lie by justifying why you feel a certain way.(unintentional self-sabotage) * **Emotions** - Relative truth to what you are feeling at that moment in time. (Become aware of what you are feeling) * **Psychology** In order to gain confidence in what you want to get off your chest, to free your mind of thoughts concerning with the past, presents, and future, is ALL PSYCHOLOGICAL. 3-Steps: * 1. Self-Aware - Biting nails when put on the spot or fear of speaking up for yourself. * 2. Self-Understanding - You bite your nails because you faced scrutiny before when put on the spot. You don't speak up because you were once beaten for doing so in the past. * 3. Self-Love - Caring for yourself enough to tell a loved one WHY you bite your nails and are afraid to speak up. This ends up lifting the weight off your shoulders because you told someone and that vulnerability you stayed strong through to express your insecurities has made you feel better. Result? You've planted the seed to improve yourself, any troubled pasts become a memories that will fade with your drive for solutions and furthering yourself. Your eyes are open for solutions and clearer in knowing what the next step is to fixing those insecurities because they cannot hold you back anymore. whether that next step is seeking professional help(Psychologists do not give medication, just listen, talk, and help you become happy with your current life) or taking public speaking courses and self defense classes without anything to cloud your judgment of what you deserve. I apologize for it being so long, but these are what I learned and what I want all those who suffer at anytime during their lives to gain some wisdom. You are a human being, you are beautiful, you can create anything you want, and you deserve to live your life."

I just want to lay down. I have been completely consumed by panic attacks and the agonizing feeling that my existence is an utter waste. Though well-rehearsed in the methods to manage this self defeating monologue (years of therapy/treatment prior), none of it brings me even the slightest peace now. It feels almost immature because there was so much growth between the last time (all those years ago) and now. I am in a long-term relationship and my life is very different, yet it sucked me right in like I had never really escaped. I want to keep damaging myself to feel something different than this plague sucking the life out through my chest. When I did it, there was instant relief. It feels even better than it did before. But now, of course, there is that all-too-familiar shame and vulnerability that just makes me want to do it again. I absolutely hate myself for it. A friend (who knows I am depressed but not that I self-harmed) tells me I should tell my partner. It is good advice. I have no reason to think he wouldn't want to do anything in the world to help me, but I am irrationally afraid. He has his own demons. What if he is hurt for what I have done? Why make him suffer for this? Love is about sharing all joys and burdens, but these irrational, nagging questions devour me. I just want to be reassured that while I fall through hell, his hand will still reach for me, even though I feel utterly unworthy for even the stretch of an arm. I have almost no desire to dig myself out, but I don't want to be left behind. The pain is so intense, I just want to scream all the time. I feel utterly trapped. Whenever I gain the courage to tell my partner, I inevitably lose the nerve to bring it up. The seriousness of my problem devolves as I think I get closer to admitting to it. I love him so much. I don't want to share this pain with him. Admittedly, all that aside; I don't want to be stopped. I want to suffer alone, like I did before. And, so... here I am. "

Sometimes I see eyes that burn, eyes that challenge you, eyes that seek confrontation, because when they argue they feel alive. Eyes that have someone to blame, because blaming someone, anyone, anyTHING, is how they make sense of the world. Desperate people need the world to make sense, and someone to blame gives you quick and easy answers. Even if it's not true or fair or right, it's easy to swallow. Sometimes I wonder if I'll become that person. I see tired eyes, lifeless eyes, hollow smiles, hopelessness...the signs that someone has given up. I want to give them hope, but I have nothing to offer that doesn't sound like a platitude. I wonder if I'll be that person too.

Internet, cell phone? Might as well. Can't afford a vacation. Look at a pretty picture of a mountain I'll never visit. There's beauty in the world. Make cookies. Simple pleasures. Another hour down. Too many of hours just surviving. Treading water. Another smoke. Go to work, this fancy job that I got when I thought life would be different. Happy, smiling faces, with perfect white teeth, surrounded by $30 lipstick. Nice cars, Hawaiian vacations. Socially appropriate humor. I don't belong here. I don't look like that. My life is not like that. My humor is not like that. I can't relate to anyone. I am an other. The one that doesn't fit. I'll never fit here. 10 years ago maybe, but not now. There's no point in expensive lipstick if you can't afford dental work. Another smoke. With a jacket and febreze so no one says anything. Exhale slowly. Why am I here? I'm the first one to go if anyone gets cut. The one that doesn't belong. Then, what, homeless? Can't have that. Mouths to feed. I'll be ""the nice one"" then. Earn my keep, be helpful. Smile, keep smiling. Be helpful. Be liked. The electricity still needs paid, it's on disconnect remember? Try harder. Why did I go back to school? With all the unforeseen life events and bills acquired, I almost wish I hadn't made the effort. Even people that work at the grocery store get to go to Florida. Even people on food stamps have nicer cars than I do. Wasted time, wasted effort on ""Things will be better someday."" Dreams are a luxury. Grit teeth, smile. Try harder. Everything on the line. Always on the line. What's this week's crisis? Make a plan. Make 5, because there will still be something unexpected. Another smoke. Another shot. Mindless distraction, to take a break from the thoughts. Kill the burn, because tomorrow is the same. Every day is the same. ""This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time."" I've learned that hope will gut you if it's misplaced. Hope feels like anger as it dies, fades into frustration, fades into a quiet burning in your soul, fades into nothing. But one ray of hope stays, for me, like a crack of light though a door, shining into the depths of my being. This little voice that whispers, ""Things will get better."" And I've wished it away. Because there is nothing coming to save me. No luck, no prayers, no wishing well, no knight in shining armor, no fairy godmother. Nothing is coming. Even my own hard work didn't save me. Without hope, I might have acceptance. This is really all there is. That's it. Another smoke, another shot. This time I think of my life, and wonder maybe there's some things that happen in life that people just don't get over. You break inside, but your outside has to get up every day, smile pretty, and pay bills. And you get worn down on the outside too. Tired in your soul. Because when fleeting moments of happiness arrive, it flings that door open wide, illuminating everything inside you. It's a harsh light, you're forced to look everything you've shoved in dark corners, every part that you don't want to see. And wait for it to be over, because being happy is like begging for something awful to happen. It always is, it always does. Another cigarette. Another shot. Another smile. Another search for understanding. Because some people love. Some people are happy. Sometimes life is beautiful. Not everyone has this life. And most of the time, knowing that is enough. -- Note: I'm not suicidal or anything scary like that. I just wanted to share my thoughts somewhere, and this seemed like an okay place. "

I can almost handle the depression(barely), but the anxiety is what's really making my life hard. School just started so my teacher made everyone stand in a circle and play the game where you say your name then everyone has to remember it and go around in the circle and say that names already mentioned. Well, I was at the very end so I had to remember and say 30+ names while everyone was staring at me. It was bad. My voice was noticeably shaking like I was going to cry, my knees felt like they were gonna buckle and I started to feel like I had a fever. That's just part of it too. I stress and ave anxiety attacks over due dates because I have to retake my SAT, write my college apps, and finish my drivers ed. It honestly doesn't seem like much but my brain plays tricks on itself and I end crying from frustration and stress. I often catch myself ready to give up and seriously drop out of school even though its my senior year, it all feels super pointless. I don't exactly have the best home life, my father left and my mom is a control freak so I'm on edge about almost everything. If I tell my doctor these problems there's a 95% chance I'll start crying and have a breakdown because just talking about my problems makes me super emotional. Will she tell my mother? One thing I hate is the feeling of vulnerability, and my mother will definitely keep hounding me and wanting to know more details because she's nosey like that. Not only that but she'll blab my business to her sisters. I don't need my already jugdy family thinking I'm some crazy person."

I called my school's mental health counseling office today. they were useless. they said they couldn't get me any help because my problem was more long term because apparently when I saw them a year ago the doctor decided that was the best course of action because they can only offer 3 to 4 appointments a year even though i distinctly remember them offering 7 to 8 a semester in the past. so i go research local low-cost sliding scale options. the closest i can find that is affordable is a community counseling center at a christian university and honestly i don't know if i want to go through with it but i have no other option because i'm poor and i moved to a new city and my old therapist is far away from me distance wise but i'm worried that at this counseling center they'll tell me that i just need to believe in God that's why i don't talk about my problems i don't tell my mom, because she (like my old therapist) uses my moments of emotional vulnerability to try and convert me to christianity which i think is really really scummy i don't want to tell my friends because i'm worried they'll worry i've been vagueposting about being depressed and wanting to kill myself on facebook all day but people haven't picked up on it. oh, but when i make posts that are funny everybody notices. i'm behind in everything because of the way i feel. i'm behind in school. graduate school project proposals are due in a few weeks. i'm so behind. i have a class to teach, and i'm just now doing my lesson plans for tomorrow. (it's just past midnight). I want to fucking check myself into a hospital but i can't because it would get me fired from all my jobs probably and also it's hella expensive like at least a few thousand. i can't kill myself because i have these fucking obligations in life to do i fucking don't like it and I called the suicide hotline today and they were useless it's just a fucking script that they say and i don't blame them because a lot of people call but still, still, it's frustrating. i want to live until i'm 90 and maybe on the porch sitting down and happy holding somebody's wrinkled hand in mine but to be honest the very act of living doesn't seem feasible at all because of this emptiness."

350,vulnerability,depression,What should I do now? Seeking help from strangers.,1,6ymxs9,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6ymxs9/what_should_i_do_now_seeking_help_from_strangers/,2017-09-07 22:39:00,"Hey. So writing this to a bunch of strangers online is honestly something that's unfamiliar to me but I feel like it's the only way for me to actually go about this thing. First off, I'm 18 years old. I know that I'm young and that I still have a whole world full of possibilities ahead of me, but that doesn't really stop me from feeling how I do - ultimately empty, numb - alone. I'll begin with a little rundown of what's been going on. Last year I graduated from High School, I had good grades (straight As, graduated with one of the highest scores in the cohort) so I decided to study Law and Political Science - what I had been wanting to do for 3 years. When I got there I realised how far removed from my perception of it it actually was - I hated it. The people were terrible, the content was barely interesting and everything just didn't feel right. So I stopped going to university altogether. I made no friends there. It was hard, I'm a very social person and often surround myself with people at all times of the day. That's changed a lot too - now I barely hang out with anyone from High School because I realised how terrible they are as people. They don't get me. But I'm afraid I'll never make friends again. Anyway, I stuck out Law/PoliSci for a semester and decided to pursue my genuine passion - drama. So I did. Now I do a degree in Drama/English Literature and Education. Gonna become a teacher - educate the youth. But honestly, I feel like I've let myself and my family down? It's hard to explain but my siblings are all really smart people and have all done amazing things but the fact I couldn't even do that makes me feel terrible. There's that saying ""those who can't do - teach."" And I can tell you know, I'm a perfect example of not being able to ""do"". I started taking medication for how I felt, but even then, I don't think it's working. I go the gym 6 days a week - that worked at first, but now I still feel numb. The gym is just a distraction at this point. Right now I'm sitting in bed, in the dark, writing this to a bunch of strangers online - people who I've never met - purely because I want to know. What should I do? I can't talk to my family about it. Vulnerability isn't a thing here. I'll try to talk to them and they spin it on to themselves and talk about their problems. I feel like a burden to everybody. Especially my ""friends"", if that's what they even are? I find it difficult to believe people genuinely like me for me, because, honestly - I don't even know who I am. I've felt this way since last year, but it's only grown stronger. I have a job - but I hate it. I find it hard to realise that I feel this way. I've had so many opportunities granted to me in my 18 years, so many privileges - but I still have this feeling of dissatisfaction. And, to tell you the truth, it makes me feel selfish. I see a Psychologist weekly too, but it's still hard. So, please, just tell me. What should I do? "

Please help.,1,6odm3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6odm3d/im_contemplating_please_help/,2017-07-20 13:13:29,"About four months ago I broke up with my ex girlfriend. I loved her so much (still do) but it was a toxic relationship, and I had to make a decision. We were still in touch afterward, which killed me inside. When we last spoke on the phone, I broke down. I've never been that weak before. She was almost condescending to me. She didn't talk to me out of care, but out of pity, which only made me feel worse when I realized it. The next day, I sent her a text tearing her to shreds about all of the things she did to me. I blocked her and haven't contacted her since, even though I desperately want to. The guilt is eating me up inside. Whether she realized it or not, she was manipulative sometimes. But most of the time she was sweet. The sweetest thing that ever happened to me. We talked about marriage and children. We talked about a future together. And I cut it off. It was gone in an instant. Now it's probably fucked up beyond the point of repair. And it's all because of me. My parents used to love her, and now after I broke up with her, they hate her. They want nothing to do with her. If I went back to her, not only will I have to choose between her and my family, but I'll basically hand her power over me on a silver platter. I never opened up to a woman before her. I never showed vulnerability. I've always buried my emotions. At 24 years old, she was my first and last serious relationship. I used to party in college and hook up with sorority girls, but it was all meaningless. She meant something to me. She still does. I can't talk to anyone about this. Not my friends, not my family. They don't know me as an emotional person. They don't know me as a scared person. They all think I'm a borderline psychopath. But the truth is, I've been thinking about killing myself for a month now. I used to love going to the shooting range. Now I feel like if I go, I'll turn the gun on myself if she crosses my mind. I haven't attempted it yet, but I've been thinking about it for a lot longer than I should. I'm scared. I took all of the online advice. I started going out with my friends more, spoiling myself a little bit, reading and watching movies, working out, meeting and hooking up with other women. But none of them are her. None of this shit helps. The thought of her is like a tumor that I just can't get out of my head. I feel like I murdered someone I love. They say it's just a cocktail of dopamine, oxytocin, and other chemicals in your brain and it'll wear off, but it hasn't. It's only gotten worse. I've been addicted to cocaine before, and even the withdrawal after going cold turkey was more manageable than this. They say it's just a halo effect, and I should focus on her flaws and I'll realize why it's better that we went our separate ways. And I do. And even with her flaws, I still love her. They say I'll meet someone more physically attractive and whatnot. And I have. And they still don't measure up to my baby. I realize how insignificant my problem is to the world, but I still can't get over it. It's a sad day when the only people I have left to turn to for help are strangers on the internet. I used to look down on people who committed suicide because I didn't understand depression. Now I sympathize because I'm the one contemplating it. I don't know if there's really anything left for you guys to say that will get me out of this depressive state which will eventually lead to me killing myself. But please help me."

I set the locations on the weather app in my phone to log Antarctica and Alaska; because she always thought it was cool to compare the weather. She kept a log of how many days we talked. I remembered every detail; the night we first met she was dressed in black, under the dull street light she smiled. And for a moment I believed in god. She sang, she sang, and her voice reduced me to tears. She was happy. How she set my cold heart ablaze. An alien feeling, my new addiction. Everyday, I made it my priority to let her know that she was loved and supported. I found my muse. To simplify the ramblings of a once intact heart, we're no longer together. We're no longer together and the scent of her perfume has disappeared from my sheets, her warmth, absent from my half empty bed. And without her, I go through withdrawal. I trace the light leaks on my wall, I sweat and shiver; I watch my silhouette become more skeletal. Every sonnet is a prelude to the eulogy of a love once had. This is mine. "
354,vulnerability,depression,This is how I perceive my depression,1,6qnq1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6qnq1x/this_is_how_i_perceive_my_depression/,2017-07-31 21:11:19,"Here I am, all alone at a bar. The counter of the bar is weird, there's only one stool and only i can sit there. It's also placed in the middle of the bar. Around me are plenty of tables, all full with different groups of people. First table is full with the religious men and women. They preach that belief in God is what brings peace. I do believe them but I can never achieve that peace. They say that all men are created and treated equally, if you live a good life, you will get a good life. Though they preach and spread messages of love, they themselves are a bit unsatisfied. They wear the nicest clothes, the have the friendliest smiles and all their intentions are nice. The thing they lack is their own vulnerability to what others see of them. Some may say they are crazy and nuts fro believing in a higher power, some like me can only agree. Despite all that, they live their lives peacefully and work hard to have a great life. I envy these people. A table in the back is full of youngsters just coming back from partying at a club. Some of them are drunk, some are still buzzed and some are showing signs of exhaustion. A guy says that he had the best time ever at the club. Another one mentions that he got lucky and was going to hook up with some chick he met there. A smaller nerdy dude sat quiet and trembling, but with excitement thinking, ""Wow! This is such an awesome night! I experienced all the good and bad shit I did not experience before. I really want to do this again!"" A woman stood out and claimed that it was very fun meeting new people and just having some senseless fun. I look over there and my heart gets filled up with envy and jealousy. A table that catches my eye is a table where all the patrons are drinking expensive champagne and 300 year old scotch. A man raises his glass for a toast, toasting to his success on making a deal with some big shot company, and gaining a lot of money for his work. Another dude's there just drinking up saying how he enjoyed his life so far, no regrets or anything by giving himself the pleasure of spoiling himself and spending money on things he want. Unknowingly, all of them appear differently yet they all have their cars parked outside, valet style. They know it's getting late so they pull out and tell their drivers to get the car ready to go home. I envy these people. One table that made a lot of noise was a table full of women. These women were beautiful, sexy, awesome personality, wonderful charms and the likes. Surprisingly all of them were according to my tastes. I overheard them saying the last guy they were with wasn't rich enough, he couldn't afford to go out for dinner at a fancy restaurant once a week. Another claims that her ex was unreliable, the guy didn't have his own car and had to borrow his parents' car to go on dates. This beautiful brunette said that her ex was always too busy with work, as if his life depended on it. She was upset that he did not want to video call her at 4 am in the morning, claiming he was tired after being at work for 13 hours straight. The most noticable one was saying how she dumped her ex because he was never stylish or fashionable. He always wore his same old clothes and only had a pair of shoes. He wasn't even handsome in the first place and he wasn't someone with a ""hunky"" body. She only dated that dude because she wanted to see how it would be like for the guy to have a huge fight with his friends and eventually getting isolated and cut out by his friends from school. I hate these people. A table on my right was full of a group of friends. They were all talking about their one friend who none of them liked. A few reasons were that he wasn't up to date on the present trends, he was too religious, he wasn't religious enough, he stole his friends ex girlfriend, he was smart but only because he had ulterior motives, he never wants to hang out at hip and trendy places, he always has to g home early to take care of his mom, he doesn't pend enough on all of us, he only likes talking to us about his problems, he cough a lot, he doesn't style his hair, he rides a cheap and used scooter wherever he goes. I despise these people. Ironically, the table closest to me is a family. The dad is always running off to the toilet or wherever, only being at the table to sip his drink before going off somewhere else then coming back. One of his sons is there doing some work, while talking with his mother and his wife, but never talking to the father. The daughter is busy taking care of her kids and always goes around asking for money and help. The mother is looking at them all, and treating each of them differently based on who she likes more and who is more important for her personal gain. Her daughter is important as she stays under the same roof together. Her son who is talking to her and her daughter in law are important as they give her some allowance and are currently back from living abroad. Her ex husband apparently is still important, as he still pays the house bills and alimony despite him never being there and always busy finding some extra income to pay off his bank loan. And then, the youngest son was never looked at by the mother and was neglected. The youngest son, unable to further his dreams, always needed to help support the family financially, never appreciated, always ridiculed for having a weird disease, does not have any close friends to open up to, literally shaking like a mouse because he lacks confidence, quiet yet always doing his best to keep a smile, for the sake of the family. But despite all that, we know. We all know he's crying, deep down inside. He is lonely. Unloved. Not thought of. Misunderstood. The youngest son looked at me and said how he wished that he could have whatever everyone else had. He looked at me and told me, ""I'll never grow up to be like you old man. You're just a vision of what I am in the future if I don't change now. I'll do my best, I'll take on the whole world and fight. And when I have finally won, I'll break down and cry. I'll cry out all the tears I've held on to for so long. I'll cry out to my beautiful and understanding wife, while I'm in my Aston Martin, reaching the front gates of my house. I'll cry and kiss her and tell her thank you, for sticking with me through thick and thin."" One can dream eh.."
355,vulnerability,depression,How do you tell?,2,6qtpvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6qtpvk/how_do_you_tell/,2017-08-01 13:43:24,"I'm 24 years old. For about 12 or 13 years now I've just had this constant hollow feeling. Not 'sadness', at least most of the time anyway. Just a lack of concern. I don't do anything, days just kind of pass by. I don't have a job, and I don't really care to get one for any other reason than it's one way less to be held accountable to others if I have my own source of income. I don't have very many friends but that's okay to me. I've never been one for letting people in as they say, and I wouldn't really say it's due to any sort of perceived vulnerability as far as I can tell, its just I really don't feel there's much to me once you get to know me but that's fine by me. Maybe I'm scared that if I open the door people will find an empty room and then I become less interesting. Who knows? I don't have strong bonds with anyone and I'm not sure if living life is supposed to feel like you're viewing it through a window but that's how it is to me. I'm not a very outwardly emotional person either. Especially when it comes to things that mess people up usually. My childhood best friend died and I had to put in a real shift to try and convey to the people around me that I was upset about it. I mean of course I was sad he was gone and that he wouldn't get to see where life took him and sad for his family who've always been very kind to me, but at the same time it was tough. There were no tears, I had nothing to say about it really. No comforting or poignant words. It was just something that happened. His death, his entire life, they were all just things that happened. Around 4 months later I had an accident and drove my car into a stone wall and spent 2 days in a coma. Upon waking and finding out that I had caused no damage to any people or property besides some superficial damage to a very well built wall, my body and the complete destruction of my car I just felt relief. I wasn't really concerned about my near death experience or anything like that. It was just like sleeping. I kind of miss it. But talking about it later on to people I noticed they were startled at how nonchalant I would be about the whole thing. My family was all nervous while I was out and they were thrilled I was awake again but it wasn't major to me. People ask me, was it life changing? It wasn't. It's just something that happened. It's how I am about everything. I don't want anything out of life really. I'm not interested in having a big, elaborately furnished house. I don't really think that owning a prestigious brand of car would help anything. I don't want to travel the world. I don't really mind not being outwardly adored by my family and a horde of friends and I have no real major interest in impressing potential romantic partners. It's all a load of shit. I saw a mental health professional, I can't remember which variety he was, if he was a psychiatrist or a psychologist or whatever but both of those kind of sound right. To him I'm not depressed or anything. My GP said the same thing. It's a matter of relating to the people around me and the world in general. Which takes me to the crux of the matter, how do you tell if you're depressed? I ask here because depression sounds most like how I am from what I've read thus far. Sometimes I just go to bed and stay there for 4 or 5 days. In that time I'm not crying or anything. I'm just there, I stare into space and sleep a lot. It's just something that happens. I'm passive to almost everything both good and bad. I don't pursue any hobbies, I don't even play the PlayStation or anything anymore and you don't even need to really do anything to do that. But I still don't. So, if you've read this far thank you. It would be interesting to me to see what you think if I am depressed or not. I doubt I'll actually do anything with it but I think someone saying 'that's messed up' or 'me too' would be kinda comforting in a strange selfish way. Thank you for reading. "

I can't take the continuous pouring out of myself for people who just don't care. I'm tired of finding love only to have it trashed. For the past 4 months I have been dating this girl [27f]. Things were amazing!! We did things, we had fun shared passions, we were just good together. Unfortunately all of this happened at a rough moment for me. You see the day after our first date I was burying my father then a month after that my uncle (fathers brothter) in which time she came in support. She even asked. I was taken back by this... wow she actually cares. Then a month after this I was laid off from my job along with 25 others, once again she was there. Supportive that same day she was online looking for jobs for me. She even sent me one for a firm in there city where she was to be moving to for her masters. Oh did I mention this. A month after we started dating she drops the whole "" I'm leaving for college at the end of the summer"". This sucked I knew I liked her but was now faced with having to date someone hours away, but I swore to myself I would not let that affect US. We had something or so I thought, so she made it seem. So now here I was in this now 2 month relationship. No job, girlfriend leaving for school in 2 months and my closest family has just passed away. While going through all of this I still had her. I still had my baby, who at this point was being absolutely amazing. Cheering me on showing me care and just being great. I never asked for money or anything like this. She was just there. We decided it was a good idea for me to move to her new city. So I found a job and made the move all within 3 weeks. I was ready. Ready to kick ass and share this with my baby. Little did I know she was on here (Reddit) talking about how after 3-4 months she try's to find anything wrong with the guy so she can leave them. I say this because this is right around the time I began to notice a change in her. I saw she started treating me a little less respectfully. As if I were a child. I read her post and, well let's just say it hurt. Soon after I got up here we had an argument about something stupid I did. She had made plans that weekend so we did not see each other and her fathers bday party was the next day so I went over later that night after drinking with a friend to drop off the gift buuuuuu tnhey were in my duffle bag at my buddy's place where I was staying that night. (I had drive back in town). To shorten this up I questioned why her car was not there when she had told me she was asleep. Smh I mentioned this the next day and that was the straw the broke the back. I CANT DO THIS. That's all she wrote. I went over there and we split up. I just need space she said... but I was an idiot over the next month missing her, not understanding what happened why did she say all these other things but still be able to just throw it all away? Even over the past month she would show signs of missing me and wanting to talk to me. Saying sweet things but then some other days saying other things..... I recently just got so hurt after reading her stupid Reddit that I had to remove her completely. FB Snapchat Instagram. Anywhere I could. I then just began to be even more hurt. I send her a barrage of msgs. Angry ones, but now all I can think about is how much saying all of that hurt me so badly on top of how much she hurt me. I thought it would make me feel better but it didn't. I don't want to hurt anyone anymore I don't want to show vulnerability anymore. BUT I DINT WANT TO BE COLD. I LOVE LIFE AND BEING A NICE GENUINE PERSON. BUT PEOPLE JUST HURT YOU WHEN YOU OPEN UP. AT LEAST FOR ME THEY DO. "
357,vulnerability,depression,"The concept and idea about ""deep talk""",2,6u0oez,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6u0oez/the_concept_and_idea_about_deep_talk/,2017-08-16 18:25:45,"I feel like a deep hell. I feel so very disconnected on life and the people around me. My own family does not care about how or why I think. They do not take the effort or time to listen to my thoughts. I'm even fully willing to explain each of my thoughts out if they ask questions. They just don't care. Maybe they don't understand. I'm hurting a lot and no one cares, but me. I try to explain things from a rational view, but my thoughts get tossed aside like expired broccoli. I feel like in acting and never myself. I can't be myself because there is always fear of some consequence around the corner. I feel that I'm being controlled in that way. Dominated. It seems like the value of life is compared to others values. One person's subjective view about someone else tries to turn their view on other people as objective. As if one person feels this way, it's discouraged that you can feel the same or have your own feelings compared as if they are not your own. People don't want to talk about uncomfortable talk. One popular trend called being politically correct in which you do things in the way 'You should"" it makes people seem very robotic. This struggle of having absurdness seems to me not worth it on the intellectual level. People do not like to think deep as people that do think deep get labeled to ditter them from ""thinking deep"" Such as ""cringy "" ""edgy"" and using the word in itself ""too deep"" These are all methods of cancellation of thinking deeper. Having deep conversations bring up vulnerability and truth. Why is thinking deep such a topic of taboo? Reality hits hard for people I believe because there are no outside forces to stop what we consider ""bad"" ""suffering"" ""unfortunate "" Reality is in fact completely ok with this existing. That thought alone should be reasonable in why that would cause anxiety or fear, it's reasonable. I believe there is no free will. Free will to me means ""control"" I do not believe anything is special in the sense of being ""unique"" from the universe's eye ""objective"" The only way free will would exist to me is if there was another dimension of being. An example would be a video game player controlling a video game character. With the character being in one dimension and the player being in another. I do not believe this. Biology states living organisms are made of many smaller components to make what we label as one thing. ""Human"" ""cat"" it's a bunch of smaller things that don't identify with ""I"" as many parts make an organism. What influenced that organism is through the environment. Struggling is intense and really fucking sucks."
358,vulnerability,depression,The problem with recovery,3,6iiii3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6iiii3/the_problem_with_recovery/,2017-06-21 11:18:14,"My depression has gotten better. I'm not sure if better or manageable are the right word, but I have seen an improvement in my life over the past year. The problem is that I'm now 27 years old. I have had little to no improvement in my depression that I've had since I was around 11. I had treatments, therapists and medications that did more harm than good. I have used poor coping mechanisms like dissociating and over eating. Last year I lost 30 lbs and I continue to reach my goal weight. But the problem is that I have had depression for so long that it's like Rip Van Winkle trying to reenter the world. I have barely dated for my age, I had to learn how to do things like apply makeup and go on dates. And dealing with the shame of learning things so late in life doesn't make anything an easier, especially since women are supposed to be (born?) experts at self presentation, social cues and dealing with the opposite sex. The inexperience from being closed off for so long makes wanting to return to my unhealthy habits more appealing than contending with the constant vulnerability, pain, shame and anxiety of being found out. I feel like anxiety is almost supplanting the depression that I've struggled with in the first place. Everything beyond 'recovering' basic functioning feels artificial to me. Like because I had such severe depression for most of my life, I can never know what my personality would have been, mental faculties, social life, etc. I still struggle to be open socially knowing that even if my relationships deepen, I will eventually have to account for the ""dead space"" that makes up when I graduated from college until now. I deal with the social anxiety and shame being around my peers who are so at ease in the world that I spent most of my life trying to avoid. It makes the redescent seem easier and sometimes more alluring than continuing to struggle to improve. I have had a hard time dating and trying to seem normal enough to be intimate - I'm aware that being a virgin is cute only up to a certain point, and I feel like for the first time in my life I don't feel tremendous shame attempting to see myself as a sexual person. But dealing with the ""timelines"" makes things difficult and makes me feel like I will always have less romantic options, because on top of those who don't want me because of my age or physical preferences, I would have to also filter out those who don't want to deal with how weird my past is. It makes hiding my past more awkward because I have to contend with people assuming I have something dubious to hide, and in a way I do. I don't know where to go socially or if I even deserve to make any romantic attempts at all. Trying to reenter normal life is much harder for someone like me than the people who have depressive episodes, because there was never a 'me' before depression. All the resources on the Internet RE: reentry are for people who knew who they were in the first place and knew something is wrong. A few days ago someone told me about a documentary featuring a formerly blind person whose sight is restored via modern surgery, and how they actually wished they could return to blindness because the sudden onslaught of being sighted, coupled with the sudden requirement to learn depth perception as an adult (versus when the sighted learn it in early childhood and infancy) was incredibly overwhelming. Nothing could do a better job of describing my ""recovery""? from depression, or make me more doubtful. Recovery has meant that I regained a piece of my life back. But the life that I regained I'm not sure what to do with, or even what I'm allowed seeing as my past is so undesirable. I don't know what to do with myself or even what is reasonable and what is laughable to hope for or strive for as a woman my age with so little under her belt and so little to offer, and I don't know what to do.

And as irrational as it is, I cannot help but feel this despair... I am worthy of nothing but ridicule for these feelings... I am scared to be alone.. I am scared that one day my efforts to avoid that fate may inadvertently be the very reason I end up alone...

360,vulnerability,depression,(Long) The story/background behind my crippling loneliness if you're at all interested...,1,6kklq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6kklq8/long_the_storybackground_behind_my_crippling/,2017-07-01 12:43:31,"I'm not usually one to open up about my feelings, which is why I have come anonymously to Reddit. Thus, I apologize for the length and please do not feel compelled to read on. I simply feel overwhelmed and need some sort of social outlet. I also know many others are in much worse situations, but I'm hoping these discussions are good for all of us. Here goes. Last Summer was the happiest time I have ever experienced in my life. I was staying in my college town just taking a few easy classes and spending time with an awesome friend group. We took weekend trips to the beach or other cities, hung out on a daily basis, and had the kind of genuine interactions only a special friendship can provide. However, what made me the happiest was the fact that I started dating one such friend from that group. Words cannot describe how much I cared about her. While I don't believe in love at first sight, I do believe in love at the first real interaction. I would have to write a whole other post describing how wonderful this girl is. I slowly became her close friend and then made the difficult step into a relationship. It wasn't easy, but I put in the care and effort and succeeded. I knew she did not feel as strongly as I did, but I treated her incredibly well, and we made each other extremely happy. The Summer was filled with blissful nights and exciting days, and we absolutely loathed being apart. I remember the moment I felt my love for her was real and lasting, after a wonderful date, and her helping me move and clean, despite it taking most the night. I held her in my arms after we were done, and remember looking down and feeling the most pure love and admiration I have ever experienced. I was my best version of myself with her, and I encouraged her as best I could as well. As the Summer came to an end, our schedules became busy and conflicting, which led to less time together. We would try to make time, though, and the relationship continued very happily. One night, she asked me the infamous question of where I thought the relationship was going. I said I wasn't sure, even though marriage was honestly on my mind. She began to express concern with the timing of our relationship, as she was younger and still had a few years left until she would graduate. I am an aspiring law student, and she did not want to ""hold me back"" from my plans. I, on the other hand, believed that things would work out. As John Lennon once sang, ""life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans."" The conversation ended with this divide, and I began to worry greatly. A week later she broke up with me. What followed was a very difficult time in my life. It really is true that one cannot know true happiness without understanding suffering. I could not stop thinking about her, and I missed her so much it physically hurt. I had friends who helped me through it, but it took a serious toll on me due to my vulnerability and serious dedication to the relationship. However, life went on despite the pain, and to condense my story a little, I was able to graduate college, travel to Asia, and receive a good job before I decide on law school. Staying busy helped, and as time went on, I mostly was past the pain, despite it being ever present in some sense. Recently, however, a very simple reminder of her came up on a ""1 year ago today"" Facebook notification. I would see pictures of her before or remember some memory, but they never affected me like this for some reason. I have been having dreams about her, constantly thinking about the past through visceral flashbacks, and feeling extremely empty and lonely. The loneliness seems to communicate negative things to me, such as that I will never be as happy as I was with her and that she was the only chance I had to find someone to spend my life with. The worst part about this kind of loneliness is it is ever-present in the recesses of my mind. The moment I finish some task or work or come back from a social event, it returns to my mind. So I do my best to stay busy and occupy my thoughts, but the loneliness waits for an idle moment, like a parasite waiting for a host, and then consumes my being, leaving me empty inside. I do not know how to combat something which is both internal and yet seemingly uncontrollable. My hope for future happiness is dwindling, and instead of living in the present, I relive the once happy, now painful memories of last Summer. As I said in the beginning, I apologize for the length. For those of you who did read all my thoughts and my story, I would be grateful to hear what you think, if you have experienced something similar, and if so, how I can move forward with this pain. Thank you in advance. "

No one in my real life will know.,29,6e39k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6e39k3/thank_you_for_reading_this_no_one_in_my_real_life/,2017-05-30 08:12:34,"**EDIT:** I will respond shortly to the comments below, I am very grateful for everyone's output on here. The whole ""I've always depended on the kindness of strangers"" quote from A Street Car Named Desire is very real and relevant here. God (or whatever you believe in!) bless you all and good fortune. I needed this. You don't realize the difference you can make for a person. **Your kindness to me has motivated me to spend more time on /r/depression and help others out with their problems too** First of all, thank you for reading this, as you will be amongst the only people to know how I truly feel. Not even the closest people in my life will know the information I am about to write. I just hope someone who reads this has felt or is knowing of it enough to tell me Ill make it. I am 30. I still live my [family member]. I married someone that I love but dont lust for. I dont have a career (I do cheap freelance work.) **My wife. I dont always find her attractive like my previous exes.** I dont have the lust or passion where I could throw her on my bed and be filled with desire. I married out of convenience because I wanted to make sure she could stay here. I do love her, and we do have sex sometimes, but I miss fucking. I miss that wild animalistic attraction like before. I figure when I get a well paying job we can get that plastic surgery that she wants. I am stupid to have made the decision, or perhaps, Id be complaining regardless of whatever decision I made. I do miss going out there, swiping on Tinder, and having friends with benefits. I do miss the glorification and feeling of lust and casual sex. I do miss that whole dirty defiling and degenerate world. Or do I miss it because now I can never have it anymore? I am dedicated. If I divorce, she goes back to her home country, she feels depressed and worthless forever, and I miss out on a lifetime of love. It will effect my family too. She has the biggest heart and the most love Ive ever felt from somebody, but my carnality, my lust, my passion.. that shallow world, its not as strong as before. **I am trying to practice no fap**, and its been very (ha) hard. I occasionally browse /b/ and other sites, and theres a ton of eye candy that makes me want to live through it vicariously. I see something like Blacked, and want to be those guys. Porn warps the mind, but its not far from reality that people are horny fucks that are into that sort of thing. Its shallow, it feels great for the time being, you can cycle through new people, but then eventually you want love and something stable - or so I think. **I am socially inept**. I feel most conversations with my current group of friends remain at a shallow level. What movie did you see? I am waiting for my friend to buy me clothes at [expensive store] because of their new release Were going traveling next year. Its really all the same bullshit. No one reveals anything that might show their vulnerability or deep thinking. Everyone has the attention span of a fly and I cannot relate to the celebration of materialism and superficial topics. I am told by my family that people generally love talking about themselves and are too scared to admit deep things. Its lead me to believe people are a bunch of wimps hiding behind conceited bullshit. At any point, in that group of friends, if I mess up or make one of them angry, if I warrant a grudge, it will result in my isolation. In other words, if one gets upset at me or I do something stupid, the chances are that that person will express their discontent for me, and that group will invite me out less when theyre involved. Basically, you affect one and you affect them all. The same privilege doesnt go for me. Its my problem if I have problem with one of them. Social dynamics and politics are bullshit, but theyre very real. I find the safest way to keep friends is to say nothing and open your ears up the whole time. People are full of themselves and are not as considerate or share the same heart as you, no matter how much they talk about themselves being progressive or caring about other people. This is bullshit. **I dont have a career**. I am still applying to jobs. I get rejection letters all the time and I find that the method to success in this world is determined by who you know (usually your social/family circle), how much money you were born into, and your genes. Dont think that the exceptions make the majority - they dont. Virtually everyone will tell you they came from humble beginnings or it was hard, when really, it wasnt. Theyll exaggerate small incidents and ignore their family makes well over six figures or that they were born into a stable family. No ones really real anymore. Maybe this is the side effect of a social media world. I dont know. I feel like were all trying to be who we think we are on here, not who we are. Who we are is not what the hiring managers, popular and beautiful people, or influential benefactors want. The more I think about my unhappy life and how things are, the more I just dont want to think about it. If you read all this, thank you. I am well aware I am probably full of shit myself. I dont know. I just want to jump on YouTube, masturbate, or fall asleep without knowing my bullshit life. "
362,vulnerability,depression,"Has anyone else been diagnosed with early-onset major depression? Also, a forum about hereditary illness.",8,66tkqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/66tkqi/has_anyone_else_been_diagnosed_with_earlyonset/,2017-04-22 12:07:20,"I unfortunately developed very serious major depression at an early age. I was diagnosed in the second grade, at age 8, when I spent almost 5 weeks in the hospital. I remember it being a very clear shift. I missed quite a chunk of school the previous year; my mom allowed it -- on the pretense that I was taking ""mental health days."" I later found out she had also started experiencing depression at around the same age -- So as did my older sister, at the age of 12, and my brother, at the age of 10. Which offered rationale as to why she allowed me to miss so much school -- something I later came to terms with in therapy, while trying to figure out why she let that happen. Clinical depression it it's severest form is supposedly actually pretty rare in childhood, and is thought to be mediated by a combination of genetic vulnerability and environmental stressors [re: diathesis-stress model of mental illness]. That would explain the pattern in family history. In my later teen years, I was re-diagnosed with bipolar disorder after experiencing mania, which to date, I don't have a known family history of, which makes it all the more complicated trying to figure myself out. My sister remains major depressive; my brother later developed obsessive compulsive disorder combined with thought disorder, and he remains on social security disability today. That being said -- has anyone else experienced a mental illness early in childhood? Do you also have a clear family history? I feel like these brain illnesses, albeit already not *too* common in the regular population, are so isolating -- yet even more isolating, when it happens in childhood. I just need to know I am not alone. It's hard to discuss how this affects your whole development, your whole identity, your whole being. It is a life long illness, one that requires a strong social support system of friends, and most importantly, family -- which is what makes mental illness all the more insidious. How does your family support you, when they cannot support themselves? And vice versa? It is easy to identify and speak with those who experience depression (and other affective episodes or disorders), but it so lonely trying to articulate what it was like growing through episodes, and trying to make sense of your biology, and family, and whatever happened in your life to trigger a disorder that causes so much pain. Your thoughts are welcomed, and appreciated. Much love."

Started two night ago I guess, but finished last night. He's deployed. He's been deployed for about three and a half months. Halfway done! We were so excited. His birthday was a month ago and we celebrated with a care package and a mini chat ""date""...not really much else you can do when separated by 8000 miles. The gifts I sent in the package were meaningful, and he said they were the best gifts he's ever gotten. He even said again that two nights ago. I had just put in the mail his latest care package Tuesday afternoon. A whole bunch of ""open when"" letters for him to have during the tough times but when he can't call. Open when you're bored with a 6 page letter/funny story written completely in code and the key was hidden in pieces throughout all the other envelopes. (He's a giant nerd, well we both are...one of our first conversations was all about codes after he discovered that my text vibrations were set to Morse code. ""Oh so you're a SUPER nerd,"" he said to me with a wink.) Open when you're stressed with mini crochet doll for him to chuck at the wall and an encouraging poem from his favorite book. Open when you miss your dog with a mini realistic painting I did of her for his desk. Open when you need to laugh with three different funny stories I hadn't told him yet written book style...with pictures to boot. Open when you're homesick with an encouraging letter about how strong he is and how much faith I have in him. Open when you miss me with a love letter reminiscing some of our best moments before he left and how excited I was to have him home...looking forward to getting back to everyday life with him...a life that has felt nothing short of magical since he's been in it. You know, shit like that. I sent him a picture when I mailed it. Sealed with a kiss and on it's way! He got to message me Tuesday night. He was excited for the package. He's been down...much more down than my usual sunny man...for a few months now, the deployment has really been wearing on him. He's overworked, sleep deprived, unfathomably stressed...and his main love language is touch. Which is the one fucking thing I absolutely can't give him right now even though I swear to god I would do anything at all to be able to. He's mentioned feeling distant from everyone, numb, emotionally detached, too exhausted to even make conversation...all of which is terrible and heartbreaking to watch him go through but honestly totally normal for the deployed. As in, 100% of the people I've talked to who have done this before have mentioned feeling the exact same things. It's the only way to cope with everything. Anyway, he hasn't been himself for a couple months now, but he's been super assuring that it's not me, it's nothing personal, it's nothing against our relationship...he's just having a hard time. Totally understand babe, I'm here for you, I'm okay I promise. I just want to be there for you. So while he was excited about the package coming, the only time I really get to see flashes of my chipper man anymore are when he receives them. THEN it's like Christmas morning. THEN he chatters on for ages about how happy something as simple as blue wrapping paper inside the box and a little pop up ""happy birthday!"" banner made him. THEN he's over the moon about little surprises and inside jokes that I've tucked in throughout the box...he says it's like a treasure hunt. ""I know you could come up with a thousand different ways to entertain me, so I'm always super curious to see what it will be this time."" It pushed me to make every packaged meaningful, and try to make each one better than the last. That's why this one was a surprise...after touch on his love language hierarchy is words of affirmation, which is exactly what the ten letters were chock full of. ""I know I can't be with you day to day like I would be if you were home, so these letters are here so I can be there for you even when you are too stressed or unable to call."" He knew nothing about what was coming, I had been keeping him in complete suspense, and holy fuck I couldn't wait for his reaction. I was certain it was the best package yet. We were flirting after he got the picture. Little sexual innuendos, plans for when he got home...normal distraction chat. Anything except the negative reality he's in day to day. He's in the Middle East with strict sex laws so I'm not allowed to mail him anything sexual (though thank god for video chat and messenger to get around that) but he loves books over technology and was saying that he wished I could send him the boudoir book I made. For some reason the word ""boudoir"" made him think of book of all different bedrooms...so that's what he wanted, that was the silly next plan, ""a book of you in various stages of undress in various bedrooms. Perfect."" But then, in a literal second, everything changed. Suddenly he was apologizing. ""I can't see a future."" ""I haven't been able to progress emotionally with you."" ""You've been unimaginably supportive of me and done everything for me (I've been taking care of the house/bills while he's been gone and it recently flooded; I took care of it but he felt bad, which is what he's referencing) and I haven't done shit for you...I feel like such an asshole."" What?? No, no no no no no. This is a goddamn deployment, we knew it would be hard. I knew you wouldn't be ""emotionally progressing,"" you're dealing with fucking war stuffs or whatthefuckever every single day. You haven't had a single day off in over two months. You're not an asshole, I don't expect you to be able to ""do anything"" for me right now, I promise. You focus on the job you have to do over there and on coming home safe, and let me focus on doing my job of taking care of you/the house and on supporting you the best way you need me to. When you get home and I got back to work full time THEN you can ""make up for it"" and be taking care of me. Okay? Relationships are a give and take; this isn't new, and it's seriously not a bother for me. I've actually really liked feeling like I can take some worries off his plate and send him a little relief in a box or a well-angled photo. I'm a giver; I love taking care of my love. It didn't matter. He was so distraught. ""You didn't miss any signs...I meant everything I said earlier. I've been so stressed that I've pulled away from everyone, not just you. It wasn't personal. I didn't even make the decision until today."" ""You're ideal for me...I don't know why I haven't been able to take the next step emotionally."" (BECAUSE YOURE LIVING IN THE BOX IN THE DESERT ISOLATED FROM EVERYONE YOU LOVE AND HAD TO AMPUTATE PRETTY MUCH ALL EMOTIONS AND FEELINGS IN ORDER TO SURVIVE, MAYBE?!?) ""Please, please promise me that you won't view this as you being inadequate. I swear it has nothing to do with that. You're incredible...you have all these qualities (lists them) that I've been looking for."" And when I argued that, how the hell could he say that and then say that he wanted to break up, I'm not trying to fight but clearly something's wrong....he said ""I AM trying to fight with you though because there has never been a moment where I've felt like you're not good enough for me. I had quite a few times when I felt the opposite."" ""I hate this, I never wanted to hurt you, I don't know, I'm so so sorry..."" This can't be happening right? It can't be. He hasn't even gotten the latest box yet! This isn't real life. I just send him pieces of my heart, more vulnerability and openness than I had ever put into words before, just hours before. I had just spent the week before cleaning the flooded garage...saving his woodworking projects, restacking the wood pile onto a pallet, washing gross floodwater dishes, repacking every. single. cardboard box, drying sentimental books page by page with a hairdryer, building a little makeshift dam on the inside of the garage door to hopefully keep more water out with the next rain.... I've been head over heels in love with this man practically since the moment I met him, and I would have sworn he felt the same. Our beginning was a whirlwind and right out of a rom com: we both shared that we felt like we had already known each other and been best friends for years, we were so comfortable around each other right off the bat. Hell, our third date was doing laundry. Not a euphemism, literally sitting on the bed folding underwear. Though our sex life was rockin too. Everything was perfect, and guys, I don't say that lightly. Same values, same moral/political/ethical/religious/blahblahblah view, same desires for life, same work ethic, intelligence level, interests...I felt like I had found the piece of me that I didn't even realize was missing when I met him. I felt whole for the first time, even though I would have sworn I was whole before. Friends and family have even approached me about this and made comments out of the blue...I'm the happiest I've ever been in my entire life, and it shows. So no, no way is this breakup thing real. He's just having a hard time. I'll write a more thoughtful and well put together response once the shock wears off and I put my head on straight. I got advice from other people who've done this on both sides, I wrote and rewrote and rewrote again. I love you, we're a team, let's get through this together. You're not a burden on me and this isn't a contest of who can do more. You're feelings of being emotionally detached are perfectly normal and most likely have everything to do with the deployment and nothing to do with us. You shouldn't make any big life decisions right now. You're almost done baby. You've got this, and I've got you. Cmon. ""I am confident in my decision. I'm sorry."" And just like that, none of it matter. My fun, loud, cheery man who could talk the most southern of gossiper's ladies ear off was reduced to one, melancholy, terse sentence. A man who normally goes out of his way to overexplain because he wants to make sure the communication is clear. A man who, when I was worried about getting in the way of him preparing for this deployment, took my face in his hands and said, ""look at me. You're not a burden. I swear to you."" before giving me a kiss on the forehead....an unbelievably sweet and calming gesture that I can't even extend to him right now. I feel like he's a different person. I've never felt pain like this before. I feel like every piece of me is being slowly crushed...I can't breathe, I can't move, I can't sleep, I can't even cry: it's just streams of tears falling from my eyes now.

I don't want to have to get my things from the house. I don't want to miss his homecoming. I don't want to go back to work without him there to celebrate with me. I could see my whole life with him in a way I never could before. Now I see no future. I may as well lay down and rot. "
364,vulnerability,depression,Antidepressants making you insensitive?,1,61n1vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/61n1vt/antidepressants_making_you_insensitive/,2017-03-27 05:25:19,"I started on a low dose of the antidepressant Citalopram about 10 weeks ago. And even though there are positive changes, I'm feeling some guilt and shame over taking the medication, and the idea that I may be more self absorbed and less sensitive to other people, or less able to connect on an emotional level. It's concerning that the meds can take away from this. I'm worried I'll end up without any friends. Some things that I've noticed are that I'm less likely to feel or understand intuitively what another person is going through. I care more about happy, positive easy interactions than truly letting my guard down and being open and honest. There isn't a ""place"" of emotional openness and vulnerability I can return to, where there's an innate sense of wisdom and peace. I don't feel like my emotions matter, and it's more difficult to know I'm even having them. It is making me a bit...paranoid maybe. I feel like my close friend is pulling away, and I wonder if I said or did something that was insensitive toward her. I feel like certain other people have also pulled away, or seemed more annoyed by this insensitivity. It feels like I'm robotic and worry this lack of affect may be sending a message to my loved ones: I don't understand how you feel and don't care. I can't relate to what you're going through and my face shows how little anything affects me on a deep level anymore. Everything seems shallow. I think part of it could be that the meds take away from all aspects of personal emotion and experience. Or that we need some negative emotions and vulnerability to feel the gamut of human experience. We take the negative with the positive, and you can just have it all be good. But some of the positive things seem very good. Like being able to do errands that I couldn't before, due to anxiety, or not ruminating as much. Instead of feeling everything so deeply, it's easier to switch to more logical and rational thinking. But I think this is a turn off to my girl friends, who I don't want to lose. It concerns me that it might eliminate some stuff they liked about me, like being considerate, caring, a good listener, patient. It's like I'm a shell...but a productive, happier, more energetic one. But I feel like some people HATE this, and find me shallow, uncaring and rude. Maybe antidepressants cant be viewed as a ""cure all"". I can't repress and ignore the negative, or stop working on the true culprit behind my depression, which is a critical internal voice."

I'm constantly surrounded by people, I have great friends, more than my fair amount of partners. I generally get what I want from whoever I want whenever I want it because I am young and attractive. I have everything. But no one listens to me. Not really. I am horribly depressed and tired and every time I open up to someone about it or let anyone know why, they listen for awhile then take advantage of my vulnerability because I have no self-esteem and won't reject them in that moment because I need someone to be there. I don't see a future in which I am anything but someone's fucktoy. When I no longer serve my purpose or it's not cute anymore, I get dropped. In real life and online it's always the same. I don't know why I come here anymore and there's nothing that will make this better. I don't understand why no one has ever loved me or why I am so alone when all these people are with me. I am tired of doing this cycle over and over again. I want this part to be over. I miss my family and they're gone forever. I miss all the people I moved 500 miles away from that I'll never see again and who don't answer me when I message them. I even miss my abusive asshole brother who I lost to mental illness. I miss everything that was and find no happiness in the new life that I've built since because everything in it is as fragile and disposable as the past was and I don't know what to do anymore."
366,vulnerability,depression,I've suffered from Anxiety and Depression for more than 15 years. This is my Mantra.,8,6499mb,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6499mb/ive_suffered_from_anxiety_and_depression_for_more/,2017-04-09 06:41:58,"I began thinking deeply one day, deciding I was either going to live unhappy and jaded for the rest of my life, or one day, I would get better. But to get better, I thought, I would need a purpose, and a reason to be happy. Religion has served this purpose throughout much of humanities history. Unfortunately for me, I'm a non-believer, so faith has no function in my life. I decided I didn't need a religion or a faith to live the life I envisioned, I just needed discipline. So I created a Mantra. Something I will read every morning when I wake up, and every day before I go to bed, like a prayer of sorts. Eventually I will remember it without having to read it. The idea is that if I can condition these thoughts to be re-occurring, some fruitfulness will inevitably come out of them. And the minuscule changes in my attitude toward life should in theory have lasting long term effects. So here is my Mantra. &gt;Be happy. Have a good day above all else. Dont go to bed angry. Dont let other people go to bed angry. Treat everyone else as if it were yourself living another life. Use common sense, logic and reason to guide your actions; not conformity, superstition or faith. Drink lots of water. Dont drink very much alcohol. Avoid smoke. Consume cannabis, not cigarettes. Pay attention to how it makes you feel. Pay attention to how you feel all the time. Dont be vulnerable but instead, be open to vulnerability, embrace it. If necessary, set goals, make change. Live the life you want to live. Have morals. Have a community. Have a purpose, and youll die happy."

I am NOT looking for a medication that simply allows me to produce watery tears, what i need has more to do with full emotional vulnerability. I have been very out of touch with my emotions for nearly a decade now. And after what i perceive to be a bunch of personal shortcomings/failures in recent years I dssperately need emotional release. I have been to the therapist many times in the past, also psychiatrist and i can never seen to get to that magical place where I am emotionally vulnerable. I have been on several antidepressants such as sertraline and bupropion and another that i cannot remember at the moment. I've also been on anti-anxiety medication like clonazepam. These medications have either not had much effect on me or made me slightly more desensitized, more numb. If anyone knows of a pill or medication that can help to bring out my true emotions and accomplish what i need, please advise. "

I am looking loneliness straight in the eye, and it leaves me feeling so empty. I have PTSD, depression is just a symptom of the bigger picture, but it's showing it's nasty face lately. I can't help but feel worthless. I got a D on a test that I thought I did really well on. This didn't help my self-worth, either. In fact, I feel like it's not even worth continuing.

It wad mediocre, nothing interesting in the least bit, but I never would have anticipated the kind of breakdown that I just had. I don't know what it was that really set my mood off into a spiral but I suspect it was because I hit a moment, while all alone in my house, in which I realized that there was *nothing* that seemed interesting/worthy enough to occupy my time with. I couldn't think of one thing I wanted to do, not one thing that seemed inviting enough to do something and I was left with this emptiness that left me in tears. I ended up writing because I felt like I needed to distract myself, and I wanted to share this excerpt from my journal entry. Why? Because maybe someone else knows what I'm talking about, maybe someone else feels the same way. *I cried a little tonight and have listened to quite a few sad songs but I cant tell if I feel good or not, better or worse. I feel like shit. I feel a small pang of awgh that I didnt kill myself when I was in that mindset.I kind of have those same thoughts as I did when I was in that really bad place. The thoughts of, everything would be so much easier if you were dead, give up, people would move on, life goes on so dont worry about what others will think about this, do this for yourself, kill yourself because you can. Shit like that, I have those feelings bouncing around in my head right now and I want to just talk to someone about them, to vent and what not but..I shouldnt. Its all the same shit that they have already heard before, the same sad bullshit and I know that its tiring. My friends have lives of their own and their focus probably isnt centered on tearing themselves down and completely destroying their own lives and psyches, like mine is. Maybe that isnt the focus of my life in the grand scheme of things but it is the focus of my life now. Im kind of my own bully and I am a powerful bully, a manipulative force and I am.yeah, in an abusive relationship with myself. Its like.thats real. I am in an abusive relationship with myself, with my own mind. Its like the best of the best, the most fucked up dynamic ever. You want to trust yourself but you are so destructive, you cause so much pain yet feel so oppressed by it too, that very same pain. You constantly have to walk on eggshells, always on guard from yourself because you never know what could trigger them and you dont ever feel comfortable. You want to love yourself but you also are the source of so much conflict and destruction, nothing can ever be easy and everything is a fucking show and you start to resent yourself because WHY CANT YOU JUST GO TO THE POST OFFICE WITHOUT NEEDING A PEP RALLY? You feel like nothing you ever do is enough, no amount of sucking up, bending over backwards or sweet talk could ever be enough to satisfy this bully and its just defeating. Hang your head in defeat? You arent satisfied. Attempt to better your situation, your bully isnt satisfied and it always comes full circle. You question yourself and your thoughts, the origin of every thought is always blurred. You have to consult with this demon in your head, you almost have to get permission to do anything. Want to tackle that to-do list?? Consult with this selfish asshole in your mind, theyll probably say no and thatll be the end of it. Youll go along with it because you are in such a mental fog, so out of it, that you dont even have the energy to entertain rationality, responsibility or the prospects of self-growth. Want to open up to a friend about your struggles? Nope, the best-friend-in-your-head will convince you that everything you say sounds fucking ridiculous, that every slight pause or lost thought on their part is some silent plea for a way out of the conversation and, more so, out of the crazy catastrophe that is your life. Okay, so you no longer have goals or friends but do you really need those?? You have a friend in your illness; someone who will always protect you from EVERYTHING, even the things that most likely wont end up harming you. Youre safe from sadness, from loneliness, rejection, fear and uncertainty inside of this tall, ivory tower but youre also safe from real connections, vulnerability, passion.genuine happiness. But thats okay because youre still safe from the fears of rejection that the outside world has to offer you. Your illness is all that you need, or at least it convinces you that its all that you need. It makes you doubt your relationships, your place and value in this world, your morals and standards. You dont make the effort to reach out to your friends for two years and now somehow, theyve failed a test of friendship and, oh, that just confirms that nobody {else} is there for you and everyone hates you and maybe you should just kill yourself because why not? Follow me, (your mental illness), into death and we can be together 4ever. How romantic...no, how fucking sad.* *How fucked up is it that thats the nature of my relationship with myself? Who do I blame though? Myself? Nature? Nurture? Nobody? Its hard to not want to blame yourself for the way things are now. Every bone in my body, every ligament and nerve in this vessel that is me, wants me to know that this is mine, that I somehow deserve this tragedy and this pain, that I have to accept responsibility for this heartache and martyr myself to it.* edit: formatting"
371,vulnerability,depression,I've relapsed hard and I'm ashamed,6,5ujzm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5ujzm6/ive_relapsed_hard_and_im_ashamed/,2017-02-17 14:34:51,"(This is a long one. Writing this for my own therapeutic means. Haven't posted here before, so sorry if I'm in the wrong place.) So I used to have bad depression and anxiety in high school. Not to the point of suicidal thoughts, but enough to convince myself that I was better off staying in my room than risking having people find out how worthless I am. I was on all different kinds of medication throughout my school life and they made me so numb that I felt like a supporting character in the story of my life. However, after high school, I decided I didn't need the meds anymore and I felt the spotlight return to me. I decided to pursue my dreams of becoming an actor and I enrolled in a drama college. Now, acting is obviously a craft that requires immense vulnerability, so to be practicing vulnerability with a group of people for two years means you're bound to make a deep connection with someone eventually (Yes, this post is about falling in love). About three months before we graduated, I started dating this girl in the same course. Let's just call her Jane so it's not too personal. I feel that Jane was underappreciated; she was funny, pretty, smart, the usual, but she also had ambition. Very early on in our relationship, she told me she got accepted into a very prestigious acting academy overseas. She would have to leave next year, 2018. We both agreed that we'd spend as much time with each other as we could in the year to come. Unfortunately, she had to work as much as she could to save money to go overseas, and I was lucky enough to already be getting work as an actor. Couple that with an hour and a half journey between us and we had a bit of a problem on our hands. At this point, I'd like to tell you about another person I connected with at drama college. Let's call him Brian. A guy that exudes confidence and good vibes. A good friend that was so loving and supportive of me, that made me believe in myself. He used to tell me he thought of me as a brother; the feeling was mutual. While I was at college, I wrote a short play, and it was Brian who told me how great it was and that I should enter it into a short play festival and that he wanted to direct it. So I entered it, and we found out days before graduation that it was accepted into the festival, and would be performed in the first week of February with Brian directing. I was the happiest I had been for a long time. So it comes to the day my play premieres. I haven't seen Jane for over two weeks because of work. But today I get to see her for lunch... and she breaks up with me. She says we hardly see each other, and ""we"" don't feel the same about each other anymore, and she has to keep working, and she doesn't want to keep me around and make me feel like an afterthought. She says more, but I'm too busy trying to put all the pieces together. She says she still loves me and that just confuses me even more. I ask her if this is really what she wants. She nods. I say I understand, but I don't know if I do. I give her a hug and say ""we can still be friends"" like a fucking idiot, and we talk like friends for the rest of the time. I feel surprisingly fine. Two days later, I finally have a night off to see my play. And she's there. And I'm not fine. She tries talking to me like we were never together. She's really trying to make things okay. I can't bring myself to look at her. The only time I forgot she was there was when I got to see my play performed. either side of the performance, I felt lost. I felt depression and anxiety creeping back on me. I see my friends and her after the performance, say thanks, bye, and go home. The next day involved excruciating paranoia and melancholy. See, I forgot to mention Brian and Jane are pretty close. They performed in a play at college, where they played lovers, and they've been close ever since. I kept thinking maybe she left me for him. But I had nothing to go off of and I knew it may have been an overreaction. I slowly got out of those bad feelings, but a few nights later, I saw Brian. I was happy to see him. I wanted to talk to him about what he'd been up to, about the play, about anything. It had been so long. But he didn't talk to me. We said Hi and We need to catch up, but that was it. Another night, I heard he was going to be in my area, so I sent him a text to see if he wanted to hang out. H told me he suddenly got called into work. Maybe just bad timing and coincidence, but this didn't help my paranoia. A week has passed and I've started feeling better. I sent Jane a text apologising for being cold at the play. She sends one back apologising for trying too hard to seem like everything was okay. We say we missed each other much more than we expected to, but we're both getting to a better state of mind now. I feel like I'm on the edge of surviving this break-up. Then, last night, I saw a photo. It's Brian, Jane, and two other girls we also went to college with and who I used to be friends with. There's nothing to suggest Brian and Jane are together... But that's what my brain tells me. I start replaying everything she said to me when we broke up, analysing it, questioning its truth. I imagine them together. I think about these two people who meant so much to me, the first person I fell in love with, and the person who made me feel worthwhile, and how they've abandoned me. I think about how that's all bullshit and I must be going crazy. I fear I'll never stop thinking about this, even if I know it's not worth thinking about. I think about killing myself. And I think about this all at the same time. I end up having three separate panic attacks. Today, I feel all the old high school feelings festering inside me. I sent a message to Jane asking if we could talk. She said yes. We're meeting on Monday. I don't know what I want to know. I don't know what I want to say. As much as I want to get this all off my chest, I know Jane may be dealing with things of her own. And what if my paranoia is actually truth? What if it isn't? What can I possibly get out of telling her all these things? I'm afraid I'm looking for a reason to die. But I don't want to go back on the medication because I want to know I'm strong enough to not let this take me over. If I take the meds, I've failed myself. But it's so hard. I feel so trapped. And even though I can see my life laid out before me, where I can go, what I can do next... I don't want it, and I hate that I don't want it. I've been through hardships before, but not like this. This is something else."

373,vulnerability,depression,Self-Harm Scenario Fantasizing..,1,5k2qtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5k2qtw/selfharm_scenario_fantasizing/,2016-12-24 22:55:22,"I feel awkward admitting to this, but figured this was a reasonable place to share. Sometimes before falling asleep, I sometimes fantasize scenarios where I've been critically injured, (most often by a nameless/faceless perpetrator), and I like to fantasize other people's reaction to my near-death scenarios. In these imaginings I'm either successfully escaping my attackers/captors, escaping toward the safety of others who help save me and tend to my injuries. Or, I've attempted to escape the attacker but failed, the attacker is caught in the act, and injuries are then attended to. Or, I'm attacked off-guard, etc. Imagined injuries usually involve things like stab wounds, beaten, bound, semi-conscious, etc. I never die in these imaginings, but rather am at the brink of death, and saved by either acquaintances or people I'm physically attracted to. I never imagine my closest friends or family members in these scenarios, is it makes it instantly upsetting and off-putting. The attacker usually does not sexually abuse, but tortures. I tend to not focus on the attacker, but rather the damages they've already inflicted, and on who is helping me, how they're tending to me, how they're helping me escape to safety, etc. When I've tried analyzing why I fantasize this way, while on one hand I find it strangely arousing, on another hand it's like my brain's way of wanting to feel genuinely cared about by others, and saved from my emotional pain and loneliness. It may help to note that I was molested in my youth by my older brother. It did not lead to intercourse, but was traumatic enough to cause PTSD, memory loss, feeling socially stunted, a huge drop in self-confidence, and general trust issues with men. My fantasizing could stem partly from that (which I don't like thinking about), but may just be weird kinky fantasizing on its own. I have chronic depression and anxiety, and am pretty isolated at this present phase in my life. (Currently I only socialize with coworkers and family). I crave intimacy and love, but am not in a good financial position to venture out with much ease at the moment, and won't be for some time due to hefty medical bills.. I could never commit suicide because of how much emotional pain I believe it would cause my immediate family. If not for them, there are times I'm lonely enough it would be a stronger possibility. There was at one time I stopped this fantasizing altogether, when I did not have friends or coworkers I was regularly socializing with at all. That's when this fantasizing was too depressing, cause it felt like if I was injured, no one was there to care. In reality, I DO NOT care for any of this fantasizing to ever become real whatsoever. In fact, not only would I likely be irreparably traumatized, I'd feel very embarrassed at such open vulnerability of people seeing me at my worst. But also, I feel like people wouldn't know how to react normally around me anymore, but would either uncomfortably tip-toe around my trauma or avoid me altogether. Thinking in those terms, it got me realizing I should want to be liked for me, and for hopefully having a more likable personality, and I shouldn't get gratification from self-harm fantasizing. But all the same, I find myself falling back on it from time to time as a strange sort of comfort. Does anyone else ever do similar? Or am I just really weird, even troubled? In person I'm kinda shy, dorky, polite, very thoughtful of others, insecure, etc. Just want to be liked and noticed. :/"

I really thought this would help with my depression, but so far I feel like shit. I've been depressed since March of 2014, I'm not sure what triggered it but it slowly crept up in a few months into 2014. On March 19th, my computer was caught by malicious software and I don't know why but it sent me over the edge - I couldn't function, I stared into space and I felt so dead inside. I spent months meticulously removing myself from everything from the internet, keeping core programs and user accounts fro some things, but over those years I cried and my family got sick of me quickly. For context, before my trigger, I had friends that I had met online and became good friends with. We spent days chatting and telling jokes, and I didn't care what anyone else thought of me. I was quick to retort if someone angered me...but now I just feel so empty inside. And I just left them. I removed all trace of myself from our chats, I upset them and I upset myself. I spent months processing what was happening to me. In fact, I spent my birthday removing my old skype account and removing people from it. Since then, I've over compensated for what my brain considered 'a failure in social ability' and now I try so damn hard to try and fit in. My anxiety sky rocketed - if I think something rude or harmful about someone? I have to literally walk backwards and tell myself that this wasn't going to happen and that I needed to shut the fuck up. And then I kept walking on. I used to love videogames too. I recently purchased Battlefield 1 (50% off, hoo boy) and I was always fascinated by war, and they dids a good job. But I'm always examining things..for example, I feel like very business is out to get your money (which in fairness, they are) but I feel like it is malicious attempt to undermine me. I always look at things and people and go 'Oh! I wonder what their next attempt to screw me over will be?' I have one friend at the moment. All my other friends bailed on me as soon as we went our separate educational ways - I went to college, they didn't. And they talked about me behind my back, even those who did attend college with me did this, and I was so fed up with these to faced spiteful shitlords that I called friends. But now nothing makes me happy - I shrugged at Overwatch (its cool, and something I try to play, but I just feel like I'm not good enough, and that this games is meaningless in real life.) And I just can't play games. I haven't got the attention for it - I can spend 20 minutes watching a youtube video before I have to move on. I have the Skyrim Special Edition on PC, and I really want to play it, but I feel so alone when I do try. I can't immerse myself, I feel way to aware of the real world, and that I should be doing something productive with myself rather than waste my time on a 'videogame', but then I hate everything outside. I hate businessmen, I hate self entitled people, I hate false people, and I don't know what to do! I like buying stuff. And this is nearly self destructive as I find myself broke all the time, and I buy stuff I don't necessarily need, but randomly crave. I really want to save for a movie authentic Stormtrooper helmet from EFX though. (They are very cool.) Sometimes I think to myself 'ignorance is bliss' and I want to be someone who doesn't have to be so aware, and I know it sounds super snotty, but I feel like sometimes I'm too smart to be happy; I'm shitty at Mathematics, but I did well in English literature and I like to tinker with electronics. But sometimes I think about things that I don't believe most people my age (16 by the way) will do anytime soon - I like thinking about philosophers and I've been meaning to reads Sun Zhu's 'Art of War' but I know I won't actually do it. Sometimes I feel like the things I do (act smart, own a bible because it looks cool, act grumpy and mysterious) is because I want to impress. I want people to feel sympathy for me because I'm a 'broken figure' with a 'dark past' and a hidden vulnerability that I am all to careless to talk about. I've never had a girlfriend. I've been close and I've been close to people, but I don't think I could stick it out - opening myself up to another person, show how weak and vile I really am. This affects me in my daily life too - I have a thing for Daisy Ridley (as do 99.9998% of men on planet earth) and I'm sat there like 'man, how cool would it be if me and Daisy were a thing! Y'know, long walks on the beach!) and stuff like that. I know its a tad creepy but I'm 16 and my hormones are wack out of shape. I've had suicidual thoughts, but not really enough to make me want to go further. I overdosed on sertraline once, (however, I wouldn't call 200mg of meds as opposed to one 50mg anm 'overdose'.) But everyone was so angry at me. I was once kicked out of my house in May (29th) 2016. I took a sleeping bag and a warm jumper and ran to the church near my house, and I stood on a wall and watched people walk by. I phoned a friend (who recently bailed on me) and he invited me to stay for the night. (No one has ever done this for me, and maybe never will again, and I tried so hard to make this friendship work but ultimately failed.) I also argue with my family so much that sometimes I feel like a sociopath has taken over my body - a snarling beast of a man whose intent is to exert power and rule this small house. And I snarl and laugh at the people I live with. And I don't hate it. I feel justified sometimes, and I've been called a 'sociopath and psychopath + countless more by own mother.. But I don't blame her, we are very alike and I would do the same. My siblings have told me to kill myself multiple times between them and called me a 'monster'. For exercise context, everyone says 'aww yeah, do some exercise, you'll feel better.' (Yes I know about endorphins) and for more context, I am a certified 1st degree Black Belt Taekwondo Martial Artist from April of 2015. (Nearly 2 years now, jeez...) I used to love running, but now I'm a little more porky. My dad has never lived with us. He left just after I was born, but I see him sometimes. He bought me my first motorbike in 2016. It was consequently stolen. And I wasn't angry. I felt nothing. In my family, my great uncle (lets call him Uncle Bob) killed himself. it's not something I should talk about, but when its something I consider on the daily, I don't think an old memory is a large price to pay (yes I'm an asshat.) I know this is pretentious of me, but I've felt like jumping out of my window so many times. Thats it. Done. Game over. I also have a problem with meaning, or should I say I have a problem with believing in one - I'm a self called nihilist, and can't help but believe the world was created as a freak accident, and we are just a byproduct, that there is no God, that we all die and are forgotten. It is pretty cliche, but I identify quite easily with Rick from Rick and Morty and Greg House from House M.D. (Everyone says they do too, I know.) Also, I really want a cane. For walking. At 16. My mum says it would be embarrassing, but my legs are usually terrible and a cane wouldn't be merely cosmetic for me, I think it would help (Should I get one? :/) I just feel like shit all the time. And suicide wouldn't be difficult for me to do, it's just I don't really want to. I'm in limbo. Help me please."

I'm a gifted writer, poet and architect I'm very emotional, very caring but all these are my passive qualities. I am known to be friendly, funny , a little crazy maybe . some people consider me close friends. I still put a wall around my actual feelings and gulp it. I am too scared to talk about how lonely it is . People call me very distant too. In college , i was Often shunned and this lead me to the biggest phase of depression i know. Maybe i am still in ut. I had a few friends and i opened up to them. But it only made my place weaker. Eventually, i put a full stop it. And did the only thing i could, drift away. I stopped bringing my heart or emotion to friendship. People are attached to me but i never let myself do the same. Previous experiences have scarred me forever.. i end up doing favours or things for other people. But i don't even have the courage to ask to the same people. I keep the worst expectations in any relationship. Overthinking through things. I've never even been in a serious relationship. I'm 23, i dont think i ever will.

377,vulnerability,depression,What are your strategies to fight against it?,6,5f4nby,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5f4nby/what_are_your_strategies_to_fight_against_it/,2016-11-27 20:55:15,"I stumbled upon this sub and thought there should be more practical advices. So I will leave my strategies here, I am sure they are of help for someone: - getting up rather early and regularly on weekdays &gt; This ensures that I have a routine in life. Doesn't work for me every days but still. - Allowing a bit more sleep on weekends &gt; Everyone needs rest :) - Writing 3 things down I have done well that day on every evening at 6 pm &gt; Doing this long enough will shift your focus on things you did well. Also if you have a really bad day you can check what you already did great in the last weeks! - Accepting depression as a disorder &gt; This helps me to reduce these massive self accusations - Seeing a therapist! &gt; IMHO a very important part. We figured out some major childhood fuckups that likely enabled my vulnerability towards depression in the first place. It tooks 20 sessions to get to this point though so please be patient :) - Meditate daily at a certain time &gt; For me it's usually after I wrote down my 3 notes for 15 minutes. Focussing fully on your breath can be weird at the beginning but it helps massively on the long run. I can focus much better when getting into that ""meditation mindset"". - Don't be hard to yourself if you fail at something &gt; You are not a machine but a human, humans learn through failure. If you wanna move forward in life, increase the rate of your failures/attempts. - Do one thing at a time. - Disable notifications when doing work (e.g. phone, mail client, facebook). &gt; Distractions and focus exclude each other ;) - Say no to people that want something when you are busy. &gt; If you tend to say yes to everyone tell them you have to think about it and you will call them back or something. Nobody will blame you for doing that - that's totally normal and adult behaviour. Relationships grow when they have borders and resistances but not from yaysaying all the time. - Test things the depression is trying to tell you. &gt; Will the waiter really slap and shout at you when you ask for a napkin? Will your coworker really say you're an idiot when you ask something? Spoiler alert: IMHO usually people like it when they're needed so mostly they will like to help you. Still depression forces us to ignore common sense and go full emotional rampage often enough. I know that part is hard but it's totally worth it! **Feel free to add your strategies to this thread :)**"
378,vulnerability,depression,Perhaps Life is my Hell,1,5gqiix,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5gqiix/perhaps_life_is_my_hell/,2016-12-06 14:12:27,"This will be a long post. This is my first post ever on reddit, and I created this throwaway account to do it. I initially wrote out my post but then got nervous that someone might be able to see my email and accidentally clicked away from the page, removing everything I wrote. I am 20 years old and a male, and this post will be detailing how I ended up where I am now, if anyone bothers to read it. I don't know how the circumstances I went through all happened to me, but they did. Let me go back to the beginning, where the cracks in my psyche first started. I was just getting out of highschool, I was a very gifted student with nice grades, even though I was lazy. I scored a 27 on my ACT after not studying for it at all, and things were looking up in the world. I was hanging out with my best friends and we were just having a get together to celebrate being done with highschool. The girl I was infatuated with and that I felt a real spark with was there along with my best friend at the time. We were all having a good time and I thought I could see myself being with this girl for a long time. I was truly happy, my life had never looked better at this point. That is, until my best friend ended up hooking up with this girl. In the same room I was in. I was a little high and had been drifting off for a while when I started to hear suction noises. I gathered my senses a little and saw them going at it. I was completely stunned and I cut my ties with these people on the spot. The next day I was contacted by my ""best friend"" and he bragged about what he had done. The cracks in my mental state were there. I didn't cry. I didn't get angry. I knew I was going to another state for college and I thought to myself that new opportunities would arise and this was just a new beginning, a way for me to be rid of everyone I knew and meet new people. But it didn't matter what I said it was. I was damaged, however slightly, at this point. So school began and I did alright, but there was a massive disconnect I had. I couldn't face people, for whatever reason. Anyone I talked to that got close to being my friend I instantly started being cold to. It was at this point that I began my addiction to escapism. I started playing an online game, a place where I could really get away from the troubles of real life. I also met a girl as well. Things finally seemed to be looking up. I had all of my social and friend needs taken care of, as well as a girl that I thought I was happy with. But I was wrong, again. Because of my vulnerability to women specifically after being cheated on, I was extremely susceptible to what this girl did. I luckily made a friend online that was well versed with relationships, otherwise I don't think things would have gone well. As time went on and I spent more and more time invested with this girl, my grades began to slip and all that mattered to me was making her happy. She was possessive and controlling and got mad if I would talk to anyone but her, and since I was very inexperienced with women, I just figured this was how it was supposed to be and I went along with it. I ended up having no real life friends at all, and I failed both semesters of school that year. She was controlling to the point where finally one of my online friends got through to me, after seeing that I was acting so off, and I ended up breaking up with this girl. Being with her, I had felt awful because anything I did (that I can look back now on and say it was just normal) would make her upset. Basically all I could do was talk and be with her. So I ended things, and she did some very awful things (I won't go into detail here), and blamed them on me. I felt disgusting and I didn't know what I could do. I ended up coming home and decided I would go to school at home where I could have my family there to help me. I cut all ties with that girl. Now begins my second year of college, and I was at home now where I could talk with my family. Things seemed better, though my family was very strict when it came to schooling. At this point, I was completely against any females I met, and still couldn't trust any guys that I met either, so I became completely dependent on playing this online game for all of my interactions. This is where I met a girl that shattered the psyche I had that was very damaged at this point. She was beautiful and nice, and I talked to her everyday. This was an online relationship, so communicating was the basis of everything. She was unassuming and the best thing that ever happened to me - so I thought. We were in different timezones so I would have to stay up a little later if I wanted to keep talking to her. Because my social interactions basically revolved around this game, I started neglecting my schooling. I would stay up very late talking with her and then sleep in until as late as 4 pm some days, so that I could maximize my time with her. I gave everything I could to her, though I was very shy, so I did it in my own way. She made me feel like there was hope in the world and that life was worth living. We talked all the time about how we would meet up and the world would be perfect. Since everything we did together was based on having solid communication, I truly felt like she was the one. It wasn't a relationship based on physical attraction or about giving expensive gifts to one another, it was a relationship based on our ability to be together. I was addicted to her, and emotionally dependent on her. This continued for some time, me neglecting my school and giving time to her while we enjoyed our interactions. She was completely in control but it didn't matter, and I didn't notice or care. But then things started to change. She would tell me that she was going off to hang out with a guy friend for a bit, or that she was meeting someone just as friends. It hurt me deeply because I knew that there was nothing I could do, and since I distrusted other men completely, I was afraid that they would do what happened to me back when I was fresh out of highschool. For the first time in what seemed like a long while, I was scared again. I tried even harder to win her affection over like I got it at the beginning of our relationship, but she started drifting away. She wouldn't want to talk to me, or she would just ignore me even. I was getting scared at this point and I didn't know what to do. She ended up neglecting me and spending so much time with other guys that I couldn't take it. Images flashed of what I had seen between my two best friends that summer, and I was in a constant state of despair, needing reassurance from her that she wasn't cheating on me all the time. She started playing with me, knowing how vulnerable I was until I ended up cutting ties with her. She was the first girl I ever knew that I felt I was truly in love with. And she was the first girl to ever shatter my heart and my emotional being in such a way. Yes, it broke my heart more than I could ever admit to anyone who knows who I am when I ended things. So that was that, I had completely lost faith in guys or girls. I lost my faith in humanity after that relationship ended. I started seeing the world as an awful place. I didn't understand how such things could happen to me, someone who had my whole life ahead of me. I went from being outgoing and smart to failing two years of college, in addition to currently failing my ongoing semester. And my addiction to escapism. I so desperately wish to get away from the real life that I will do all that I can to bury myself in my room or in a video game, where I won't have to face reality. But I'm getting ahead of myself. After I broke up with this girl that I met online, my life seemed like I had no purpose. I would, and still do, think about killing myself all the time - though I would never bring myself to do it. I care too much about my family to do it. I would drive home without my seatbelt on sometimes, fantasizing about a care hitting me and ending my existence. When I work I close the shop, so when I leave it is dark out. I used this to my advantage, driving without my glasses on many nights, hoping that maybe some accident would happen and I would be gone. There have been multiple times where I am working and I just break down right there. A grown, 20 year old, brought nearly to tears for seemingly no reason (I have never told anyone I know personally what I have gone through). I would drive off to a secluded area that isn't lighted and cry for long periods of time, asking how this could happen to me while thinking about what had happened to me over the past 3 years. I was, and am, broken completely. My mental state is completely shattered. So here I am. I'd say that I am ""living"" life, but that would be saying too much. I am merely existing, the shell of a once happy individual with a bright future. I often think what death would be like, as well as wondering if perhaps life is my hell. Thinking that things couldn't be this bad if I was actually alive. I fantasize about dying constantly, though I would not kill myself. I can't make friends. I can't become personal with people. These skills have been completely eroded by what has happened to me. I think about telling my parents, but I know they wouldn't understand. They are strict. They would think that I am crazy - and maybe I am. Anyways, thank you to anyone who read it all. I have never done something like this in the past, and I'm not sure if this will even get read. I just needed an outlet, since I have no friends and no one that I have ever told what has happened. I have considered trying to find a psychologist for the past few months, but I haven't been able to bring myself to do it, namely because I feel that I would inevitably have to say something to my parents. I'm just scared to bring all of this to light, but it controls me. Like I said, I am the husk of a person that once had a bright future. I'm really not even sure what to expect as replies to this, but I just felt the need to get this out there, like I said."
379,vulnerability,depression,My Boyfriend (26M) with Existential Depression and Body Dysmorphic Disorder is at a dead end for treatment options,14,5iig44,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5iig44/my_boyfriend_26m_with_existential_depression_and/,2016-12-16 03:30:07,"Hello, So, this is really the first time I've decided to post on reddit. I've perused it frequently over the past year, but my situation has changed and so I thought posting might be helpful as I can use others as a sounding board, ask for advice, and hear other people's experiences. I am 25F and a caretaker of my boyfriend who suffers from mental illness. I personally was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was in my teens, but it got really bad four and a half years ago when my father died. However, I was fortunate to have gone through grief therapy, which gave me the coping skills and to be put on medication that I react well to for the most part. I'm very good at managing and thriving. My boyfriend is a different matter. He has been diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder and major depressive disorder, specifically existential depression. He has been severely depressed with a very low self-esteem since he was eleven or twelve years old. A lot of his problem sprung from sexual and physical abuse trauma when he was younger. When he was about seven or eight he suffered sadistic sexual abuse at the hands of his paternal uncle who died a few years later from a heart attack. Then starting around the time he was nine he started suffering emotional abuse from his father and physical abuse from his older brother, both of which were unintentional. His father would yell at him and his siblings for absolutely nothing. It was how he dealt with stress, anger, fear and I suppose just plain old unhappiness. It made my boyfriend feel like he could do nothing right. His brother, who was much bigger and stronger than my boyfriend at that age, would beat up on him. At first his parents tried to stop it, but when it just continued they just swept it aside and shrugged it off as brothers being brothers. It made my boyfriend feel weak, vulnerable, and worthless. It was around this time that the body image issues began to form. He started therapy and as a result medication at the age of sixteen, and during that time he noticed his skin starting to flare up with a rash. It was diagnosed as eczema caused by his allergies to mammals, and it was flaring up because he lived at home with a cat. So on top of his itchy, red skin he met with no results from the anti-depressant medication, so he took the doctor's suggestion and tried another. This medication hopping went on until he was about nineteen, when he decided to come off the medication and accept that his depression was medication resistant. This created a whole slew of new problems for him, though. As he came off the medication he began to experience problems with his sexual performance. He wasn't lasting more than five minutes, and as if that wasn't bad in and of itself for his body image and self-esteem, his partner at the time wasn't understanding about his problem. In fact, she was cruel. The woman he was with after her was cruel too. They would say things like, ""That was terrible,"" ""You're disgusting,"" ""Sex with you isn't good enough."" Their voices would, unfortunately; become the very loud voices in his head from then on out. He finally was able to regain his sexual function after two years of different therapies and medications, but it left him with an anxiety about sex and sexual prowess that crippled him. If he wasn't in a relationship he would feel the need to have sex in order to prove to himself that his function hadn't relapsed again.When he was in a relationship he constantly worried that his function would relapse and the person he was with would be cruel to him like the others before. He did not feel comfortable with that type of intimacy, but needed to pursue it so that he could be sure that he still functioned in the way he was comfortable with. He also started to try multiple therapies for his depression and blooming BDD. A shortlist of therapies he tried are: hypno-therapy, sex therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy, and neural feedback therapy. It then became apparent that talk therapy was not going to help him. He started to look into ECT, but decided against it. About two years ago, though; he decided that he was going to finally do something about not liking his body. He decided to start working out - weight lifting in particular. He saw an improvement in his body image and started to feel better about the skin he lived in. He was getting noticed while walking across his college's campus, people would come up to him and comment on how he looked, and even his friends would compliment his form. However, it all came crashing down when he injured both of his shoulders while boxing. He followed doctor's orders and waited for them to heal over the course of several months then he was given the go ahead to start weight lifting again, but his shoulders would still pain him when he even lifted a weight for a short amount of reps. This kick started an seemingly endless slew of doctor's visits and different treatments meanwhile all the muscle he gained started to diminish and with it any progress he made on gaining a better self-esteem. This is where I enter his life. Let me tell you what this tragically broken but incredible man means to me. First, his worries about his looks are unfounded. When I first saw him I immediately thought he looked a lot like Ryan Reynolds. I sometimes find my own depression and self-esteem issues rearing their ugly heads in regard to how I think he looks. When we first started dating I thought he was severely out of my league, but as time went on he showed me that I was beautiful and made me feel worthy of him. Secondly, the sex is great. Thirdly, he is the first man since my father died that I felt like I could trust not to leave me, and this relationship is the first since then where I didn't worry constantly that I would never hear from the other person again. Lastly, he is so smart, so incredibly intelligent with a rapid wit and beautiful sense of humor. I sometimes feel like his intelligence gets him in trouble, though I'll come back to that later. I love him so much and as such watching him go through this kills me. He's told me that I'm the first person in his life that he felt actually ""gets it"" because I've have my share of depression and anxieties too. I know what its like to feel the way he feels and I would not wish that on anyone. We broke up after about five months of dating, but got back together a couple days later because we found out we were better together than we were apart. After this he said that I was the first woman he ever felt like he needed to be with after breaking up. There is no doubt in mind that I am special to him and that he loves me as much as I love him even though his mental illness can get in the way of that. After we started dating he began to get a pain in his hands and feet. It was not brought on my anything it just started out of the blue one day. Again he played revolving doors with an endless string of doctors. At first they thought it might be Celiac Disease because his mom and aunt both have it, but the test was negative. He even went on a gluten free diet for three months and the pain still didn't dissipate. Then they thought he had Lyme and put him on a months worth of antibiotic, which he took but the pain didn't get better. In fact, it transformed. Now he was feeling tingliness and that white noise feeling you get when your foot's asleep. So, he went to a rheumatologist. His rheumatology panel came back negative so he was referred to a neurologist who gave him an EEG. It was normal so no MS, no Parkinson's, and nothing that could potentially decrease his quality of life. So then the neurologist referred him to an internist, who because his past test results had been lost among the shuffle from doctor to doctor decided to run a whole slew of blood test including a Celiac test again, and again, they all came back negative. The internist told my boyfriend that he may just have a pain disorder that no one could pinpoint. He said the most he could do was prescribe a mild pain killer for the discomfort. My boyfriend's anxiety had already been raked over the coals and now he was told they would never be able to define it. That was like a death sentence for him. Meanwhile, as this was going on, I encouraged my boyfriend to see different orthopedist for a second opinion on his shoulders as the doctors he had seen before had go through cortizone injections, physical therapy, and acupuncture with no result. As soon as my boyfriend step foot in that orthopedist's office he knew exactly what needed to done. My boyfriend needed a posterior capsule release in both shoulders, but just as precaution they wanted to do one shoulder first just to be sure. So he had the surgery but the next day he had an isolated syncopated episode in the doctor's office during his post-operative visit. He was rushed to the ER and was found that there was nothing wrong with him, so he was released. So, he is now in recovery. His prognosis looks good and the doctor is very happy with where he is headed. I told my boyfriend at his last visit with this doctor that maybe he should bring up the hands and feet pain. I mean the only doctor we had yet to see about the problem was an orthopedist and he was already in his office so it wouldn't hurt. He asked the orthopedist about the pain and the orthopedist looked at his medical chart. He told my boyfriend that since he tested negative for diabetes he was fairly certain that what he was experiencing was just overactive nerves. So he put him on neurontin. It seemed that things were starting to look up and they were, but in my boyfriend's mind it wasn't enough to overshadow the worry and continual sadness. Then we found out that with the neurontin there is a possibility of sexual side-effects such as low libido, ED and problems reaching orgasm. Now my boyfriend is constantly worried that he will again experience what he had experienced before. I did a bunch of research on this drug and found out that if he was going to have sexual side-effects he would have them immediately after starting the drug. He's been on it for two weeks now and nothing, but I know he will continue to ask me if I think the medicine is affecting is sexual performance and because I love him if it does start to do so I will tell him, but I will help him get off the drug and on something else. Just recently he and I discussed the differences between depression as a chemical imbalance vs. depression because of intelligence. He told me that he doesn't think his is caused by a chemical imbalance but because he thinks too much about this world, what it all means, if anything has meaning. So, I started to do some research and came upon existential depression, which has four givens: physical, social, psychological and spiritual, and is treated through existential therapy. So, I looked up some existential therapist in our area and presented them to my boyfriend. He thanked me for my hard work, but told me that he didn't think another talk therapy was going to help him. That he was almost certain of it. He said he needs something other than talk therapy or medications, and I'm at a loss as to where to find any answers. My boyfriend has been severely depressed for fourteen years. He's tried everything. He looks in the mirror and can't stand himself. He thinks he is disgusting, that his chicken is too small, that his face is old and haggard and that his skin is sallow. He think he's, what he calls, ""skinny-fat,"" though he's 6 foot 3 inches and 175 pounds. He thinks he has a ""dad bod."" He doesn't find meaning in anything in life. He is not religious in anyway and can't believe in any higher power because to him, logically, one can't exist. The only thing he wants to do is travel, but he's too anxious to work. He has told me that he doesn't think it gets better, but he's so scared of death that chickening himself is not an option. His patience is running thin, and I don't want to see him like this. I worry that because of his depression and anxiety we might never be able to move in together, get married, or have kids if we want. He wants to make himself so that he's invulnerable; so that no one anyone can say or do can hurt him. I tell him that vulnerability is what makes us human; is what's connects us to each other, but that just makes him more sad. Some days he doesn't even want to leave his apartment for fear of people seeing him and how ""disgusting"" he looks. I ask for your stories, advice, recommendations of any therapy or help. I've come to the forum because I need an outlet and to see if there might be any help here. I hope you all will feel encouraged by my story to share your own, as well as your thoughts. Thanks for reading."
380,vulnerability,depression,It feels like life has been irreversibly 'twisted' for me.,2,5imzhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5imzhk/it_feels_like_life_has_been_irreversibly_twisted/,2016-12-16 18:15:13,"I use twisted because ruined is too strong a word for what I mean. I don't know why, but I feel like I was exposed to the ugly truth of life (as we all must eventually face) so early and so consistently, that I just feel a sort of jaded weariness towards it. I know the key to move past is to change my way of thinking. To find meaning in the suffering vis a vis Viktor Frankl or Martin Heidegger, but it's like I've seen too much. I know that there are people who are well meaning and want the best for themselves, and I know there are also people who could do horrible, horrible things to me or those close to me. After having members of my own family be deceitful and cruel, it's hard to trust anyone. I will admit that I am afraid of intimacy and vulnerability. I hit all of Dr. Brene Brown's prerequisites for being afraid of sharing myself. I feel like I have to be physically, financially, and academically perfect to be worth anything. And anything short of being top of the line means I will be thrown out like refuse. Any vulnerability is unattractive and weak. Steel within and without. The way to a better view of the world is in my hands. No one can or should solve it for me. But I feel like I can't see straight. I don't know where the path to finding trust and happiness is, or even if I can attain it at this point. Am I just fooling myself? Should I just accept this is the way life is, and harden myself against it?"

At one point I went pretty much bonkers and was completely absorbed in my own self delusion. I've come out of that part of it, but I am incredibly depressed and lonely. I've struggled off and on with bulimia, I've lost the majority of my friends due to one of the traumatic events that occurred, and I really do nothing outside of work. Around the time this began happening, my mom's life began improving greatly. She is my only family member (and only friend atm), and I'd always gone to her for help, so I continued to do that. She almost always agreed with me, let me talk at length, and was there when I needed. Then it stopped. I remember the day I told her I was suicidal-- she just looked up from her phone, then looked back down. When I admitted that I was bulimic-- nothing. Today she admitted that she only supported me to keep me from getting upset. This weekend was bad for me. We had a family outing to do some wedding shopping for my mom. I got tipsy at lunch, said sometime too personal/""weird"", cried, and completely humiliated myself. 3 days later (today) my mom and I got in the nastiest fight over text. She took it personally and thinks I am was trying to ruin her day. She asserted that she has a wonderful life and I am not going to ruin it for her, that she walks on eggshells around me and thinks I need to be committed to an in-patient mental health facility. She called me psychotic, self absorbed, and disrespectful. This stemmed from me telling her that I don't want to visit her this week because I am still upset and embarrassed. She thinks I am jealous of her fianc and and that I cannot ""control her"". Now I truly do feel psychotic. I have asked her for help numerous times and do not know why she waited 3 years to aggressively confront me with the suggestion of hospitalization. I keep thinking of all the horribly delusional, crazy things I've said and done in her midst, and I am so full of shame, remorse, and anxiety. Though my delusions have ended, I am still incredibly depressed and sick. She simply calls it ""angry"" and ""nuts"", and told me that *her* psychologist told her not to let me hold her back. I don't know what that means, but at a moment of vulnerability, it makes me feel like a piece of garbage. My mother is not acting like a mother at all. She has me questioning my own validity and I am truly as hurt and alone as I have felt in a very long time. "

He told me he was my best friend. I was just a mouse to him. He was the cat. At least that is how he saw me. I'm more of a small dog...like those puffy mini pomeranians. Yes I cry a lot and whimper, but I am still friendly. The truth? Sometimes the meek try to hide behind the ""tough"" because no matter what they do, they will never be on equal footing in this world. Since the fallout I have been trained to use weapons and be more vigilant. I was taught to stand up to bullies. And yes I was an angry bitch because I was fed up. Fed up of having my kindness taken advantage of. Did I deserve what happened? No. I'm just another of hundreds of thousands of people that will pass through this guy's life. Never to be seen again. No one that matters or is significant. He only cares about sex. Can't connect to people. Can't love people. Just another predatory abuser. Nothing more. I was not allowed to seek group support. He doesn't want me talking to anyone. Sock puppeted and trolled a recovery forum for abuse survivors for over 2 years and actually thinks any of his former victims want to see his face. Anyone who gets too close to him is destroyed or run off by HIM through his rage attacks. A person can be a ""nerd"", a ""loner"", and an ""evil compassionate liberal"" at the same time. I have been raised to simultaneously adopt both feminist ideals against cultural tradition. I have tried and failed to ride the line between those 2 dogmas. Society demands us to box ourselves into these categories that only serve to divide us. And they make us feel even lonelier and even more divisive or subject to group think than ever before. We tell ourselves we will not repeat the mistakes of our parents, but if we spend too much time around them, we don't know any different way of operating. We justify it by saying they did it to us so we do it to others. At least that is what psychopathic narcissists tell themselves. Guy with mommy issues superimposing those issues onto any random woman he can glom onto for attention. It's sick. This man was let down by the people who should have cared about him the most. Not me. Not random women. He was let down by his parents or primary caregivers. Instead of trying to help him adapt to his strengths and learn to control his impulses in a beneficial way for himself, they severely beat him, abused him, and ran him into the ground. They destroyed him. Where once he was a little boy full of curiosity and smiles (he shared a photo with me), now as a grown man he is dead inside. He only feels shallow proto emotions. No amount of doing silly or cutesy things with him was enough for him. Doing demeaning sexual acts wasn't enough for him. Singing him songs wasn't enough. Buying him real gifts wasn't enough. Staying up late with him when I was in another time zone wasn't enough. I had to put my own real life, mental and physical health and everyone and everything in it at risk for this person. To no avail. He still thinks I'm a crazy or ugly cunt who was out to get him when nothing of the sort happened. He's delusional and doesn't truly see other people as people. I have since the fallout, learned to do every silly thing or cute thing I did with him by myself. I have bad memories and bad dreams of him and frankly I don't care to see his face. I'm one of those ""evil"" hippie liberals no one on Reddit likes. But I'm also a nerd too. I like to play video games, and watch Sci-Fi shows like Star Trek TNG. But I also like to make flower hats with a glue gun and bake cookies like a little old lady. So where do I fit in? I don't know. Maybe I never will. In the last 2 years I have felt that I let down this guy. He is an antisocial loner with serious problems and I think he made assumptions about me that weren't true. Among them, the belief that someone who likes to talk has lots of friends. Because of my health issues, it is hard for me to make friends. I frequently have to miss events and tell people I am ""sick"". Besides previous trauma, I have problematic organs and hormone problems that make my depression worse. It is so easy to see someone and think their life is so much better because of XYZ. We see this with ethnicity, gender a lot. Man vs woman, white vs black. He/she is so handsome or pretty or good at XYZ. I do not appreciate being made into a target for someone who is looking to take out his issues on random women. I made mistakes that hurt people in my real life and I have to make amends. I owe this predator NOTHING. I tried to tell this guy that I had serious medical problems to no avail. Once he got what he wanted from me, he discarded and found other women to feed off of. He abused animals as a child and his victims is over 10 women...all of whom he cheated on or triangulated simultaneously. Enabled by his other ""friends"". I told his friends to look after him in my absence when prolonged exposure to his toxicity wreaked havoc on my mental and physical health thinking he needed to talk to someone, not realizing he needs to see a psychologist and take medication for his own wellbeing. I will never understand fully this person because we are so fundamentally far apart mentally and emotionally that we speak a different language. I wish I never met him. He has no guilt or remorse and frequently tries to see himself as the victim despite evidence to the contrary. Because he hates me so much, I absorbed his hatred and became angry at him in turn. But that took a toll on me as a human being in a way he may never understand. I have had multiple people say he is some sort of monster while others say he is still a human being. Regardless he is not capable of love. Obsession is not love. Lust is not love. Possession is not love. Rage is not love. Envy is not love. Jealousy is not love. Greed is not love. Real mature love is based on vulnerability, trust, selflessness, reciprocity or give and take, sacrifice, perseverance, compassion, empathy, affection, tenderness. Abuse is not love. Power and control are not love. Sex is separate from love. The memory of him is now linked to being sexually humiliated and subsequently ostracized by the bigger group due to his ridiculous smear campaign to cover his own ass that only exposed himself further. This was someone I defended against being bullied who just exploited and used me like some random sex object with no regard for my health. I am done. His fate is in his own hands. Predators and abusers do not make good partners or fathers. I will not be making anymore bad choices about the people I interact with anymore. End of story. Goodbye."

I'm having a really tough day and I just want to write some of the things I'm thinking down and get it out. So, to provide some context, I've been depressed for the better part of 5-6 years now. I've graduated high school (barely), been in college (as I am now), dated multiple people (never for long), and all kinds of other shit. I'm even currently a cast member on a live show every week, watched by hundreds and even thousands of people. I've never let anyone know about my depression, except for my mother, and even then only enough to make small excuses for things. Afterwards I pretend I'm fine, the same way I always do when I'm around people. To the point, I can't just constantly have this facade up and never slip, we all know that depression isn't that easy. So when I do slip up and something bad happens, I lie and fabricate a reason it happened. I've lied and lied and lied for so long, that now that I have had physical medical problems for the past year, I still feel like I'm lying when I explain that they're the reason I missed class, was gone a while, or whatever. It's legitimately hard to tell whether I'm missing class because of the physical pain I'm in, or if I'd really be able to fight through it if I wasn't so depressed. I'm constantly dreaming of a time where I don't have responsibilities and nothing is expected of me, so I question whether or not it's even okay for me to be struggling like I am now. I can't tell if being limited by this pain is another story I've told myself and the world to justify my real problems, or if it's really okay to relax for a while. This year in general has been awful for me, a year ago I got my depression to a manageable point all on my own and started living my life successfully, but all it took was one vulnerability that I didn't know about getting exposed, and everything came crashing down. I opened up my heart and grew as a person for a short, blissful moment, but before I realized it, that opening was exposed as a weakness and I began to crumble as my heart was run through. Since then I haven't been able to stop the bleeding, and my body's literally continued to collapse. I don't know how to reconstruct the foundation I had when everything was going well. I was content with who I was then, but now I can't help but think the grass is greener elsewhere. Every time I'm left alone to think, I lament what I've lost and what I don't have, despite what I still have remaining. Anyway, I'm sorry I was vague and stupidly attempted to be poetic at times, I'm just a dramatic person. Regardless, if you did read this, thank you very much. I don't know why it makes me feel good to know that someone did read what I wrote, but it always does. I love hearing what you think even more, so if you do have any thoughts I'd love to hear them. Until next time."
384,vulnerability,depression,"As a Man, Do You Feel What I Feel?",1,5auqw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5auqw5/as_a_man_do_you_feel_what_i_feel/,2016-11-03 15:16:45,"I'm writing this here, because I have no where else to. I have no close male friends to confide in. My best friend is a girl, and while she's amazing, I don't think this is something she can understand, try as she might. I think what I'm trying to express here is something that only another lonely, isolated, and frustrated young man like myself could understand, although I could be wrong. I was going to post this to r/AskMen and not r/depression, because I don't think this has to have anything to do with a mental illness, even though it certainly has the ability to. But, they have a policy about long, negative rants, so here I am. And who knows? I'm doubtful, but maybe I am depressed. I am a 22 year-old college student. I plan on attending grad school and getting my masters in Neuroscience, so long as things go as planned. First, a little about me. I'm a boxer. I like video games. I'm a total film nerd. I ride a motorcycle. I'm in the army reserves. I grew up christian and became an atheist around the age of 16-17 (Thank you, Christopher Hitchens. May you rest in peace you magnificent bastard). I exercise often. I have a diverse ""friend"" group thanks to growing up in 4H. I have two loving parents. I use to get picked on growing up and then used the emotional torment as motivation to turn my life around. Although I can't help but come off as conceited while saying it, but I am handsome. I don't really have trouble with girls. I have food, clothing, and shelter. I've been very lucky in life. And yet I am angry, sad, confused, and above all, empty. I'm not entirely sure how to phrase the question I wanted to ask you. In my misery I've been thinking a lot about my sense of masculinity and societal expectations of men and our place in the world and how it affects us emotionally and fucked up it all is. I've been thinking about Taxi Driver, Death of a Salesman, and Fight Club (Like I said, I'm a movie guy). While re-watching YouTube clips of the version of Death of a Salesman with Dustin Hoffman and John Malkovich, I somehow came to the conclusion that the only think that links us all together, the commonality that represents our only real ""brotherhood"" is that of Failure. We all know that feeling, don't we? In fact, I bet you can see it in another man's eyes, and he in yours. Failures as sons, as lovers, as friends, as athletes, as intellectuals, as role models, as fathers, as MEN. Through this failure, we become abandoned and unloved. Forgotten. Like Travis Bickle and Willy Loman. But that's not what breaks us, is it? What breaks us is that feeling as we decay inside our decaying apartment, alone and forgotten, and we stare out the window at that vibrant world that we would do anything to be able to truly reach out and touch and feel it's warmth, and we realize, in a moment of heart-wrenching clarity, that was our thoughts slowly poison our souls and rust away, the world moves on without us, uncaring. It doesn't need us. The real tragedy is that for the rest of the world there is no tragedy. But then we push that deep down because we've gotta get up for work and go to class and pay our bills and put on a smile and try to convince others to love and respect us and try to convince ourselves to do the same on our own behalf and ACT LIKE A MAN. And you can't tell anyone. Oh, but don't the sensitive-minded people always telling us it's okay to be ourselves? Isn't it those nuanced, understanding feminist women that tell us that keeping in our emotions is harmful (For the record, I consider myself a feminist)? And that we should voice our feelings? They do love to say that. And you know what? The first few times you try to, you really do feel better for a bit. But then you take notice. After you spill your fucking guts to those around you, you notice the stares. They say nice comforting things like ""Oh, I understand, I feel your pain."" But they don't. Not really. You can see it in their faces. They don't understand and they don't seem like they ever could. And they look at you different now, not that they know the TRUTH. That illusions you used to work so hard to maintain and to grow. That James Bond, Don Draper fever dream you had stored up in your head. Vanished. The only trace is the confusion of the one's you had fooled. Because you can't have both. You can't be honest and emotional and vulnerable and also have power and be respected and loved. And you wanna be the alpha-male. And if nature has taught us anything about social dynamics, when the alpha-male shows even a *hint* of weakness, he's fucked. And don't you know? Vulnerability is a huge turn-off for women. And what other opinion really matters to us more than theirs? And the kicker is you can't really live without either side. I know I can't. I've tried. And now not only do you feel more alone than ever but now you can't even go back to that fantasy! To your illusions! All that's left is that broken interior you finally exposed to the world. Other men don't care because they've got their own, individual pain to think of, and can't lower the illusion they've built just to alleviate your of your complete isolation. Women certainly don't care, because they've got their own problems. To everyone else, your problems aren't fucking real. You aren't real. You don't exist. And then since they don't and can't know your pain, they forget. And then this cycle rinses and repeats over and over until one day you turn 50 and shove the barrel of a gun in your mouth just like the statistics say (but honestly, I'd never, ever, ever resort to suicide. I love myself far too much) and you give the world one last opportunity to remember you. But it never does, does it? I'll try to wrap it up here. I am a young man, and I hurt. I ache in the most peculiar way. I don't want to cry or scream. I feel cold, miserable, isolated, and I feel failure. I just want, more than anything, to feel whole, and at peace, and understood, and loved for it. That, to me, is true love. When you fully understand a person, and love them for it, and they understand you fully, and love you for it. I posted this rambling bit of insanity here, not because I'm after pity (although, perhaps sub-consciously, I am), but because I'm looking for someone, anyone who knows what I'm talking about. I know there's got to be a few of you out there, especially on the internet. I want to feel a little less alone. So, I pose this question to you, my fellow man. As a man, do you understand? Do you feel this profound emptiness, this miserable confusion, that I do? Also, women, if I'm wrong, and you in fact know exactly what I'm talking about, feel free to share as well. I don't couldn't care less what sex you are so long as you truly understand. I let my heart bleed dry in in this post. Please, I implore you to do the same. For the sake of us all. -Signed, The Man Who Dreamt of Being James Bond "

During my first semester, I witnessed despicable classmates hide study guides in the library stacks during finals week, outright reject modest peer requests for copies of study outlines; and deceive absent classmates about the subject matter discussed by professors during exam study halls. These were just a few examples of atrocities of human nature I witnessed. Very quickly, it became clear that the motto each man for himself was ingrained in the law school culture. Essentially, I was one out of about 100 recruits enlisted to train as a law student mercenary. The mission: focus solely upon surviving law school, no matter the cost. As semesters came and went, it became obvious that many of my classmates mental and physical health were deteriorating. On countless occasions, I witnessed students break down in tears after exams, and later observed many peers miserably hiding in between the law library stacks. For fear of stigma and shame, many classmates chose to cope with their anxiety and depression in their respective ways. Meanwhile, some sinister overachievers quietly reveled in their misery. Displays of integrity and decency were almost non-existent. Understandably, some students mailed it in, and dropped out altogether. Without question, a majority of students leaned on substances to cope with academic stress and anxiety. For instance, some carried flasks of whiskey in their backpacks while others would pop loads of Adderall to fuel all night study sessions. Our weekly Friday Happy Hour slowly morphed into Happy Hours. Quite frankly, drinking, drugging, and addiction were very much a part of law student culture. As for myself, my approach was simple: keep my head down, trust a select few, nurture genuine relationships with faculty and administration; and never distract myself with law school politics. It seemed that simple right? In spite of my mother battling a terminal neurological disorder, I remained focused on the prize. In 2010, I graduated with strong academic credentials right before my mother passed away and reveled in her being proud of her son. Entering The Real Life Practice Of Law Admittedly, I was naive to think that once I entered the real world of law practice, the fierce competition would quiet down a bit. First, I began as solo practitioner, and worked concurrently as judicial clerk for a senior probate judge. Itching to gain courtroom experience, I joined a close friend at a South Florida firm representing institutional lenders in foreclosure actions. If I had a dime for every complaint I heard from staff and attorneys, Id be a very rich man. With the exception of the sole shareholder, there wasnt a happy employee in the office. Further, it was obvious to me that many were abusing alcohol and other substances while on the clock, and few took pride in their work. Management neither demonstrated a modicum of interest to boost employee morale nor even attempted to address employee wellness. After a year, it became clearly apparent that continuing to represent banks in residential foreclosure actions would eventually lead to career suicide. More importantly, my legal mind was atrophying. So, I leveraged my local connections and joined Big Law where I concentrated my experience in a professional liability defense group. At the time, I felt like I had reached the pinnacle of my career. For starters, I had a beautiful office with an ocean view, a great salary, great benefits, and I was working on newsworthy cases. To quote Rod Tidwell from Jerry MacGuire, I had reached the qualm. Sadly, it only took a few short weeks to realize that this was merely a figment of my imagination. Deciding Whether My Big Law Colleague Remained An Ally Or An Enemy Unfortunately, starting out in Big Law was as terrifying as landing on the chaotic Normandy Beach in 1943, and being clueless as to where your fellow soldiers loyalties existed - with the allies or the axis. Trying to distinguish which of your colleagues was an enemy or a friend was next to impossible. Since my performance was primarily measured by the amount of monthly billable hours, I anxiously practiced in fear of my superiors and wary of the motives of fellow attorneys. As for my beautiful office with an ocean view, I rarely took my eyes off of my computer screen, so I barely had an opportunity to admire the blue horizon. As the weeks went on, it became clear to me that I was an insignificant associate droning away at a Big Law firm fighting battles on multiple fronts. On one front, I was battling to meet my monthly billable hour quota. Keep in mind, the firm shareholders spared no mercy when it came to reminding me that my job security solely depended on meeting my monthly billable hour quota. On a second front, I had to aggressively jockey for access to mentorship and opportunities to professionally grow. Otherwise, my professional progression would end up permanently stunted. I also had a very difficult time establishing a solid rapport with fellow colleagues outside of my practice group based primarily upon the fact that intrafirm competition successfully suppressed trust-building conversations and camaraderie. Overall, the office morale was exceedingly low. I commonly observed poor body language in my fellow colleagues, and often heard of them quietly thinking aloud of their exit strategy. The partners generally appeared miserable, and the stench of scotch emanated from their orifices at all times of the day. Granted, the firm boasted some brilliant legal minds with high IQs, but their emotional intelligence was well below average. It became very clear to me that this was not a place to for me, a millennial lawyer, to thrive. Coping With the Immense Stress and Pressure Quite frankly, I numbed my depression and anxiety with alcohol. During the weekdays, I would come home and cook dinner while polishing a bottle of wine. Every Friday afternoon, it was routine for me to greet my wife (then fianc) with a handle of Jack Daniels (instead of flowers) and make sure it was polished come Sunday. No exceptions. Additionally, I began smoking cigarettes while driving to work, prior to attending court, and in some cases before and after client meetings. I stopped exercising (because I had no time), and my diet primarily consisted of Chinese takeout and pizza. To make matters worse, I saw how helpless my wife felt as she witnessed me transform into a depressed attorney that medicated himself with vices of all sorts. It nearly destroyed me and broke my heart. Without question, I was killing myself slowly, but surely. Ironically, I ignored the all-too familiar warning signs. After all, I lost several close friends in the legal industry because they failed to address their depression, anxiety, and addiction issues. All things considered, why would I neglect my mental and physical wellness? Simple, lawyers like myself, are taught never to show weakness or vulnerability, as their jobs partially depend on maintaining this impenetrable faade of resilience. I was frightened of the scenario that word would get out that I was seeking professional help, and my career would come to an abrupt end. My Moment of Clarity and Finding Purpose After slaving away for about seven months in Big Law and seeing how my mental and physical health deteriorated to concerning levels, my family and wife demanded I resign. The very next day, I tendered my resignation and decided to focus on rehabilitating myself. This was the hardest and best decision Ive ever had to make. Looking back, it was a life-saving decision. Candidly, I spent the next year or so saddled with confusion, self-doubt, anger, and regret. Rather than wallow in a state of depression, I chose sobriety as my vehicle to regain my clarity and confidence. During this long period of introspection, my creative juices began to flow once again and I finally discovered my purpose. "

(all of the trigger warnings. this is dark. takes about 10min.) im writing this with hesitation because i really dont want the sidelong glances of oh shes actually lost it. -- ive seen a bit of that already, probably unavoidable. but i do know that it was a valuable experience and that theres enough stigma surrounding mental distress and neurovariant perspectives so it seems worthwhile to offer my thoughts. after 3 cigarettes and a long conversation we arrived at the emergency room. no matter how urgent the circumstances -- you have to go to the emergency room to gain admittance to a mental hospital these days. id packed for 5 overnights but the security at the entrance was too thorough and we dropped the bag off back at the truck and smoked one more cigarette. now were waiting. the moment you realize its real is when the nurse says: heres whats going to happen: were going to take you to a room. were going to take all of your possessions. youll remove all of your clothing. and youll have a tether attached to your ankle to prevent you from escaping. oh were starting already. my friend stayed with me until about midnight, and i made blanket forts and drank ice water while my roommates screamed endlessly and the hospital staffs sorted out the business angle of it all. with a $6,000 deductible youll find that it takes a bit of fenagling. its seems like a very fucked up thing to throw the anticipated hospital bill in a suicidal persons face when theyre quite literally on the way to the psych ward, but hey. after 24 hours itching at the ankle tether i was securely strapped to a Stryker MX-Pro ambulance stretcher and brought outside. it was profoundly nice being allowed to smell that air again. when you tell them youre a suicide risk they legally remove all of your decision making capabilities. phrases like allowed to be outside become normal. the ability to choose which hospital i ended up at was a privilege afforded by my friends presence during intake. lifeline. i asked the ambulance drivers if we were allowed to smoke in the vehicle and they laughed and started taking my vitals. the ride from Detroit to Ferndale was around 20 minutes so we chatted for a bit before they took a sharp turn. we were parked behind what looked like a supermarket -- they kept me strapped in the 7-point harness but wheeled me out and lit me the best cigarette of my life while i basically repeated i appreciate you so fucking much. intake was magical -- maybe it was the contrast from the dark confinement of the ER or maybe it was the fresh air and a cigarette but i was basically feeling fine in this moment. the staff at the ER was cold, busy, clinical. the EMS and intake staff at the hospital were some of the warmest and most welcoming people ive ever met. Im fairly awful with names but i remember every person i had a conversation with in there. Kingswood. Scenic Kingswood. Gerry was the first to acquaint me to what would be happening. Ms. Dianne took my life story for the 4th of 11 times that week. Do you have thoughts of hurting other people. no Do you have thoughts of hurting yourself. thats complicated Do you have a *plan* to hurt yourself. of course she performed a body check and we talked about my tattoos and how shes from the South and thinks people up here are mean. I started taking notes on every inconsequential thing because my memory had been suffering in general and the lack of sleep was preventing me from separating the days. I was given a private room due to my gender and they gave me blue pants, a yellow shirt, and hospital underwear i genuinely like the cut of. thats unusual for me. one of the things i was constantly taking note of was how basically every feature of the environment is engineered to prevent opportunities for harm. tilted doors with rubber sides. flexible PVC tube pens. plastic beds, nubbin faucets, and an unnecessarily deep toilet bowl. via a hundred trial and errors or one long fucked-up brainstorming session -- theyd thought of everything. which perfectly-counter-productively had me consistently thinking of every possible way that i could pull it off given the environment at hand. i like a challenge. came up with a few. they took my cane away so i couldnt kill anybody with it and sat me in a snazzy wheelchair which exacerbated my joint issues and awarded me unwanted special treatment as well as the ability to sneak containers of grapes back from the lunch room. that second night, i did intake interviews til about 10:30p, made a phone call, indulged in a sleeping pill, and finally passed out to the rhythmic squeaking of the ceiling vent. still here? im feeling ok when i wake up and i havent really thought about suicide since the ER. thats odd. about a week prior i was performing a standup comedy set. it consisted of a line of sad stories that come off as funny when you deliver them right. since early May, my joints have degraded to a constant 5+ pain level and caused severely reduced mobility. its pushed my lifelong depression over the edge and highlighted the notion that theres only one painfully obvious way out. in the weeks leading up id flipped out on several close friends and become concerningly impulsive. on the flipside its kicked off the notion that i need to do the best with my remaining mobility while im here. theres a lot more laughing in the hospital than you might expect. your time is scheduled to the gills and they feed you every 4 hours. but then sometimes they wake you up at 4:30am to take blood samples. tense and subject. theres a lot of screaming and a fair amount of fights. i feel strange commenting on how the more socially acclimated of us tend to talk shit about the less. whats cool is that we know that all of us are crazy, most are suicidal, and a fair amount are thrown off by the hallucinations. mine are stress-induced. i make a lot of friends. i decide that hell is other people, but so is heaven. hi my name is kai. im a current sex worker and former escort and thats apparently what comes to mind when introducing myself. i spend most of my time degrading myself in my head and my actions. is the first thing i say in a group session. you can tell the staff is all trying to be exceedingly nice, if a little tired. i could see it being the opposite. i keep telling myself that i should be freaking out more intensely in order to get the most out of my experience. i keep feeling that being around people is cheating because my tendencies are more acute when im alone. i remind myself that i dont need to fit in and i dont need to be mental billy badass. my body hurts a lot and im reminded that despite the hospital being a current necessity its not going to save me. about half the residents have been in the psych ward before. some countless times. theres a girl fervently staring at me during intake they say only lasted on the outside for a day. she tore the molding from her window frame and used a splintered piece of it to fuck herself with. suddenly i feel bad for only desperately wanting to die. i think about how a lot of my life decisions start as dares to myself. wouldnt it be crazy if i moved to chicago? became transgender? started stripping? went to the psychiatric hospital? i think they end up fitting with me because thats kinda who i am. its like theres a lizard brain nestled softly within this contrived, egotistical, over-thinker and i think its trying to keep me alive. if the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results -- is the definition of sanity only doing new things? i kindly remind myself that most new things arent quite so expensive. i have trouble getting to sleep that night but theyre all-too-willing to feed me sleep aides. fall asleep thinking about trying to fit in. the music during breakfast is gangsters paradise. my badassery is highlighted by the fact that ive helped arrange a table of the cool kids who are all cracking the fuck up while everyone else looks sad. consider that one of my defense mechanisms is acting normal and happy. wonder if relating with people is the secret to actual happiness, wonder whether thats universal, wonder if me feeling ok makes other people feel worse. one of the notes from my first morning says im wondering why i feel the need to fit in with crazy people. wonder whether i should act more mopey. im having that thing where i cant remember whether im in Detroit or Chicago. it doesnt feel like either. then i see a squirrel. things you shouldnt ask people at the hospital: how are you? on the third day one of my friends visits. as soon as they leave i have a freakout meltdown. the patient information folders had an incorrect phone number listed and my friend tells me everybody has been trying to get in touch with me for days. i set a new record for blood pressure, scream at a nurse, request an Atavan, and spend the rest of the night worrying whether theyre going to keep me longer as a result. on the fourth day, an old woman in my group therapy says the word douchebag. i have somewhat of an epiphany, spend 8 hours on an art project, and write 7 pages with my little flexy suicide pen. i remember to consider what buddha might say, for the first time in years -- and immediately reach a fleeting clarity. buddha was asked what the secret to happiness was. chop wood. carry water. feed people. modernized: work. keep going. help out. i dont think the answers lay within me. i dont think that any amount of thinking about my situation will make things better. if part of me wants to kill myself, fine. fuck that part of me. i decide that the most inspiring thing that has happened in my recent life is the compassion ive been shown by the hospital staff. i realize that its not a problem that i only feel okay when im being with people because that simply means that my life is meant to be with people. the only fight i actually get into at the hospital is not trying to step on anyones toes, but simply trying to make a new intake feel more comfortable by telling off one of the less sociable patients. caring about others is *not* a distraction from myself, it is myself. i feel steeped in the vulnerability and the realness of 27 crazy people together largely lost in our own issues and yet still available to want to help pick each other up. the staff of the hospital was amazing but the patients were fucking incredible. even the angry old one-armed man in the wheelchair who screams at everybody just really likes fireball candies and doesnt know how to ask for help. the girl who gets all manic and runs around yelling and fucking with people until they threaten to break her face still gets sad when she realizes that people dont like her. love heals so much. eye contact. open ear. understanding. im in a hospital with 26 other people who if i had previously saw them on the street i would be at the least dismissive and probably disgusted. and here they feel like some of my best friends. and theres another probably 26 people keeping us prisoner here. holding my cane behind the front desk. but they get up every day and deal with some seriously crazy shit because it seems, largely, strangely, like they just want to help -- in their own way. whether thats thru a stern hand, a meticulous following of rules and order, a relentlessly bright demeanor, or an offer of some nail polish and a trip to the library -- or whether thats thru a misguided attempt at educating basic life skills that largely comes off as condescension, i get it. i get the intention. the bright, chipper, former gangbanger mother of 3 who wants to ignore her violently vivid hallucinations. shes one of my new best friends. the meth heads from Taylor trying to temporarily escape the grief in their lives. the 18 year old who wants to die only just enough to get away from his parents. or the homeless trans guy who cant find a space that will respect him. the former heroin addict whos sincerely clean but suffering while trying to navigate our health care system. the veteran orderly who doesnt let a little bitterness keep him from asking if youre ok and maybe giving you a break when you freak the fuck out. we dont know whats best for other people but the best we can do is give them the space and opportunity to try and figure that out for themselves. life is hella frustrating but the only thing you can do after frowning is smile. theres literally no other alternative. for years ive been taking the time when im alone to try and figure out why i want to kill myself so badly. or figure out why i cant stop thinking about it anyway. i kept perceiving being at peace with time alone as the goal -- and time with others as the distraction. id crave peace, and automatically assumed that socializing at some level freaks me out, or is at least draining. ive recently begun realizing that the times that i specifically want to be left alone are the times that i should be interacting with people -- for so long id assumed that my time would be better spent focusing on myself. my last week before the hospital was fucking terrifying. i was scrambling at any chance to see people just to keep my mind off the rope, going so far as to go hang out with the street harassers at the corner friday night. when i arrived home to the anxiety of being alone, in excruciating physical pain, with a blaring alarm screaming KILLYOURSELF, i wrapped my hands around my throat and squeezed until everything went black. i dont know why it took a bunch of mentally ill strangers to remind me that i am not my*self, ever. i am all of you and all of them and any time i think im spending time alone is not with my thoughts, its with you. automatically. to want to hurt yall with my death is horrifying. which is something i knew before but never really felt. i thought that since i was the one suffering through this body that i deserved to be the one who had the final say. that seems selfish now."
389,vulnerability,depression,1 step forward 2 steps back,2,4zn0a3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4zn0a3/1_step_forward_2_steps_back/,2016-08-26 15:21:26,"This will be my first time posting but I want to share my experience with depression. For about 2 years I've been struggling with clinical depression. Where it came from, I'm not completely sure. I'm sure someone smarter than me could help me figure it out, but to me I think it was inevitable because of the way I was raised to feel and ironically raised not to share feelings. Growing up I was the black sheep of the family but I never noticed or payed attention to it much. I was a young happy energetic kid all throughout my childhood. Around middle school, definitely high school I was very self aware and though way too much of what others thought of me, however I claimed nothing what's so ever. I wouldn't say what I wanted to say and I wouldn't do what I wanted to actually do. Keep in mind all of these issues weren't issues at all because of how busy life was at that time. Thinking back I see how this definitely affected my depression, if not helped trigger it. Senior year of high school I found what I had though at the time, the love of my life. A beautiful, smart, bright girl. Definitely far out of my league, but I was optimistic. For a year we dated happily, so so happily. It was the best I had ever felt. Things turned for the worst when I disrespect her and myself by cheating on her. To this day I regret doing so, she was perfect and I took her for granted. I confessed and it was done, so I had thought. Shortly after we got back together on her terms. All we could ever be was fine after that, never perfect again. Boy did we try to keep it like it was before, but it was a huge endeavor. We became an incredibly unhealthy relationship but the both of us were broken at this point and thought the cure would be each other. Sadly, it was the opposite. I threw away everything we had built emotionally. She pushed in my face my wrong doings and I held it over my head to the point of hating myself. The official break up was horrific. I plummeted in life, I wouldn't leave my room for weeks and worked very little. I isolated myself from everyone and hated being around family and friends. I smoked way more pot that I was used to, and while I thought it was helping, that too was crippling me. Another year passes by and I decide to get help. I went to see a therapist for depression and anxiety. It helps, it honestly helps so much. I remember my therapist asking me if something tragic where to happen to me, would I be okay with dying. That's when I realized I didn't care for my life because the answer was yes, I would be completely fine dying. I bursted out in tears in front of him, and to me that was horrifying, I would have never shown that vulnerability with anyone and despised doing so. Weeks go by and I start to see a change in me. I'm more productive, more social, just overall better than before. I was so excited to think that I could see like this everyday again, instead of feeling like a vacant body. Then the depression came back, like a fucking truck. Out of the blue, I didn't have ambition or motivation to do anything, again. I talked to my therapist and he informed me about anti depressants, but I refused to take any prescriptions. I thought and still think I can manage my symptoms rather than them manage me. It is such a struggle, every day, every single day. Even when it's a great day, I'm scared for the upcoming sun rise. I've improved so much from where I was before but I still hate the feeling of having to put in effort to be happy, especially when at one point in my life it was normal to just feel good about every day. Today I skipped class, stayed in my room all day, played guitar, and watched movies. I was so good all week until now. I'm trying to not be affected by the grasp of my depression and moving on to make tomorrow a better day. That is one of the hardest parts about my depression, feeling on top of the world some days then drastically feeling like someone just took everything of me. It's a hard battle, that's all I have to say. One step forward, two steps back. It sounds like I'm going backwards, but that small step forward is what's keeping me from giving up. Thank you for reading if you've made it this far. "

I truly have no want to live anymore, its been a couple months since we split up but she still tells me she loves me, but without her in my life, I am falling apart. I cut almost everyday and I don't know how to stop, I truly have no want to live without her. All I do is become isolated in my books and work, I take care of special needs individuals, and I can no longer take care of others when I can hardly take care of myself, I feel dead and to be honest don't plan on being here too much longer. I am a trainwreck and I am exhausted by all of this, I finally opened up to someone and gave my heart out in all its vulnerability, and I can't handle all of these emotions, I don't care anymore I am tired of this world, everything hurts and I don't know why this had to be the way my life turned out. I am a good person I never meant to be such a mess and now life is over. She was everything and now I just don't think I can do anything anymore. I have to, in fact I want to kill myself. I've tried twice and, to be honest, third times a charm. I miss her so much, I miss us so much, I miss being happy. "

Are you kidding me? How can you do this to me? Every time, every damn time. You saboteur. I decidedly allow vulnerability a chance to redeem my state of mind, but of course it is insignificant to you. You laugh all the time, dont you? You enjoy this. You enjoy this fucking treachery. You enjoy this despair. I cant even appreciate things anymore because of you. I cant even expect that something good will happen to me either. It is consistent negativity now. Do you hear me? Are you listening? It is consistent negativity and shame. All the fucking time. That is what you want for me? This is the life you envisioned for me? Fucking misanthropy, now. Trapped in the swirling of my own negative projections. It is near comedic. How fulfilled with shame this despair has rendered me. It took me to the edge of what is acceptable and worth staying alive for. It shoved the brink down my throat, satiating my irreverence for life and for sacred things. I really cant believe my social inabilities and errs. I am so awed by my present state of inadequacy, and it shows in my presence with others. What a fool I was, thinking I could actually achieve. How dumb to think I could make dad proud of me. I have no idea how this can turn around. "

Do not think I have forgotten you. Its been so long. Life can get hectic, we all get busy. However, not a single day goes by without me thinking about you. How can I forget about someone who has played such a pivotal part in my life? Youve always been there for me and I want you to know I do not take you for granted. Depression, you have taught me so many life skills. Where would I be now without you? Until we were first introduced I thought I was supposed to acknowledge my feelings. I thought I was supposed express my emotions to my family and other loved ones. Depression, you showed me how to bottle my feelings. You taught me how to hide them so I wasnt such a bothersome 10 year old. Before you, I thought my friends and family loved me and enjoyed spending time with me. Looking back, it is embarrassing to think how oblivious I was. Depression, you showed me how to isolate and cease being a bother to my loved ones. Without you I may have made honest connections with people. Thankfully you were there to show me how portray myself as the person I thought they wanted me to be. Remember when we decided to go back to school? Oh man, without you I may have never signed up for my entrance exam, completed my applications, and enrolled in graduate school. You were there to let me know I hadnt yet accomplished anything in life. Depression, you have never been one to let me feel that false sense of contentment. Without you I may have turned into one of those people we laugh at. You know the ones that pretend to be happy and content with where they are in life, the ones who never pushed themselves to their bottom. Going back to school was difficult. There were times during my first semester I thought about dropping out. Thank you for showing me how to stick with it. When our usual drugs stopped doing their job, you were there with recommendations. The alcohol helped me socialize and maintain my ideal persona around my friends. The opiates and benzos helped me stay isolated and quiet when I thought I wanted to start opening up. Man, that vulnerability could have given away my true self. People might have seen how pathetic I really was. The plan you wrote and pushed me to follow sufficed for years. I was able to get through school without honesty, vulnerability, and other things people thing are necessary to create meaningful relationships. I followed your advice and convinced people I was one of them; one of the happy and content people we knew were miserable. Graduation came and went. I watched my friends celebrate while I questioned why they insisted on pretending they didnt hate their lives. You and I moved my mom into a nursing home just a short time later. Once again, I do not know how I would have made it through without you. I wanted to ask for help, but you showed me how to do it all on my own. The drugs helped. The isolation helped me keep people away. Then you let me down for the first time. You told me I could wipe my slate clean that night if I tried to use the rest of my supply. I did what you told me, but I still woke up the next day. I woke up to the emotions you had taught me to hide and ignore. You were gone and I was left to deal. We left me when I needed you the most. I let a friend talk me into asking for help, something you never would have let me do. I missed you so much. I cried for three months straight, begging you to come back. Depression you never came back and I had to give into what people were telling me to do. I had to start being honest. I had to start being vulnerable. I had to start loving and caring for my friends without asking for things in return. I started to laugh. I cried less and less. I learned about gratitude and contentment. I let people convince me they loved and cared for me. They told me I deserved to be loved. That was three years ago. I still see you now and then. Please do not take offense that I rarely stop to catch up. Life has gotten busier. I fell in love with a beautiful woman. She has shown me happiness and contentment that I never knew existed. Depression, I learned that not everyone is faking it. I got married a month ago. We had over one hundred people at our wedding. Each one loves us in a different way. My wife and I love waking up every morning. We wake up with smiles and not tears. We are open books with each other and I love her faults. Depression, she loves mine even more. It took me longer than I thought, but I have forgiven you. Im grateful for what you taught me in life. Without you, the beauty and love I see and feel everyday may have been taken for granted. I love you, Depression. I always will, but I had to learn to live without you. Sincerely, Tom "
393,vulnerability,depression,My experience,2,53ruwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/53ruwt/my_experience/,2016-09-21 16:19:57," Sorry if this gets super long - just venting my thoughts because I don't have a good way to let it out otherwise. I have let depression rob me of my joy, satisfaction, pride, energy, hobbies, and identity. I was unaware or in denial for so long that things spiraled out of control, and I have no idea how to get my life back. I just want something, anything, to look forward to and to remind me of what it feels like to be happy. I want the energy to get out of bed every day, and the motivation to do so. I want to stop feeling worthless and remember what it feels like to be proud of myself and my accomplishments. And most of all, I just want to be comforted and understood. I am so tired of feeling alone. I know you are trying to help, so I don't make snarky remarks when you tell me to exercise or ask if I'm taking my meds. But I am an adult- I know these things, and I don't need your to-do lists or pointed questions the minute you walk in the door, which only make me feel useless when I don't accomplish everything you wanted that day. Some days simply getting out of bed can mean an internal argument spanning hours for me - I need you to try to understand that, and tell me that's okay, you know I'm trying and things will get better. I want to feel heard. Talking about my emotions is difficult enough for me as it is, but particularly when those emotions make me feel vulnerable, weak, or irrational. It often feels like we're either speaking completely different languages, or you're just not listening to me. I don't enjoy repeating myself or feeling like I've told you something important about myself once in a moment of vulnerability which you later act like never happened. It frustrates me and makes me less prone to discuss meaningful things with you. And your anxiety overall has made me less willing to point out all of these issues, because you get worried and guilt yourself about them, which compounds my own anxiety and guilt. It has gotten to the point that I've become so practiced at submerging my negative emotions that it's ultimately easier and less painful for me to pretend nothing's wrong than to try to discuss it with you and deal with all the anxiety and guilt that doing so entails. I shouldn't have to console you for pain that I'm feeling, but that's usually how the situation goes. I don't want to live like this. I want to get better, and I want you to be able to support me through it. I don't want to feel like I'm burdening you with this, but I don't know how much longer I can bear this by myself. "

I'm a little disappointed that we had to run across one another in such a place as this. It's nothing personal, but I'd like to protect the majority of my privacy. I'm a 29 year old man. I've found that I don't have depression nearly as bad as some of you do, but when it comes to my sexuality, I know that depression seeks that vulnerability and it viciously attacks it. I was a little fatty when I was a kid. To some extent, I'm still a fatty, but I go to the gym regularly if I'm well enough to do so. When I take what information I've had time to amass, I draw the depressing conclusion that I'm unwanted. My bouts with depression have made me a harsh and cold man. I have to keep that attitude going because I don't want to inflict my depression on an unsuspecting person. I'm not going to get into NSFW territory. I'll just say that I've never had a chance to express my sexuality and it seems that nobody is willing to do me that favor. If your suggestion is ""hire a hooker"", I kindly ask you to not comment.

I'm so sick of feeling this way. It's so hard to reach out when you feel like you can't. People are great with words, apologies, encouragements. What happened to sincerity or thoughtfulness?

I always try to be selfless, but I feel like I'm being selfish right now. I'm being vague, because the details don't matter. I am surrounded by many loved ones, but I am not able to communicate how I feel, or what I need, or even show it much. What's wrong with me? What do I do? I can't talk to my parents; they won't understand or even attempt to. My younger siblings look up to me, I can't let them know about this and worry them. My boyfriend is a great guy whom I love dearly, but we still lack that closeness, and he's not very good at understanding me. I have a close friend who I can talk to about most things, but I can't seem to talk about my situation to her or anyone else. I know this is my own problem, and I feel like I have to do everything on my own. I try to be there for anyone who needs me, but it's so hard for me to reach out. I vaguely remember just not too long ago, when I used to feel so safe and not anxious. I don't want to push everyone away. I just can't tell what is real. I don't feel worthy. Or significant. Especially after working at place that belittled me, after a few failed relationships, after losing someone I thought I could share my entire life and all my vulnerability with, and now, not knowing what to do with my life... I feel like a failure. And that no one gives a fuck. People will suggest therapy/counseling/doctor, but that's not possible when you can't afford it. I have many hobbies at home to turn to. I just don't feel like I'm doing much with my life anymore. I used to work for a crisis hotline, and I'm trying to understand myself. I know it will get better. I know in the end, it will all be okay. I am determined to do everything in my power to get there. I know I have many things to be happy about and will try harder focus on that. Everyone says I'm tough, and strong, and don't need help. Why do I feel like I have to prove this? Am I *suppose* to do this on my own? What's wrong with me. I'm just so, so tired. So, so stressed. --- **Edit:** I was going to deleted this post. But, as I was browsing reddit, I realized something. I ended up in r/SuicideWatch and started reading...(just happened to stumble upon it) But after reading a couple posts and commenting, it became a soft reminder of what helps me get through my day: the people in this world. That, is my ultimate motivation of my life. I decided not to delete this post, and when I have moments like this again, I will see this, and it will help me realize again."

It was like a dam of emotion in my brain burst and it was all I could do not to break down like a little kid in his office. And that was just a 5 minute conversation about my poor academic performance. The advisor was very supportive and strongly suggested going to the free counseling offered at my uni. But as much as I know I can't dig myself out of this pit by myself, I still can't bring myself to get the help I need. Just the thought of the emotional vulnerability I would experience in a counseling session makes me want to retreat into my room forever. Theres an element of social anxiety as well. Stupid thoughts like ""what if the counselor finds me boring?"" And ""what if he/she doesn't like me?"". I don't know if I can handle a relationship of any sort right now. Easier for me to sink back into my sedated, barely conscious, day to day existance. "

In the first few months of therapy, I made big gains, and my life in general improved. Ever since then, it's plateaued. I have certain touch related PTSD issues that make dating virtually impossible, and no amount of talk makes any inroads. I have trouble opening up to my therapist because I can only really be emotional when there's mutual vulnerability, I tense up too much around her and other therapists. I'd see someone else, but she's the only one I can see at my school and I can't afford 'real' therapy and I honestly doubt it can help me any more. I'm much less depressed, I only think about suicide a couple times a week and then generally in a more casual sense. The PTSD hasn't gotten much better, but I can deal with it better and don't feel quite as numb, and I feel much more confident. I don't get anything out of therapy anymore, all the endless worksheets and inability to be emotional make me stressed, but completely abandoning it seems like a drastic move and I'm not sure if I'm sort of dooming myself by doing it. I want to do group therapy, but the campus sexual assault survivors group isn't always open to guys. "

I have two bettas. I bought them in a time of vulnerability, and on impulse. I have a tendency to spend money I don't really have. And I'm feeling a lot of guilt from that too. Fish tanks are pretty expensive. Not to mention all the stuff to go with it. And I didn't treat them correctly for the first few weeks I had them. I put them in a small 1 gallon, as they sell for cheap, and then I put them in bubbles in the wall. Granted, it was out of ignorance. When I learned they needed more and filters and space and all that, I shelled out some money for a nice ten gallon that I divided. But I just feel so anxious and guilty and ashamed looking at them lately. They just sit there all day. I feel like I still can't take care of them. Maybe I should put one in the other tank we have? I just feel this overwhelming emotion with all this. I mean, I'm so anxious and worked up right now about it I can't sleep. And I can't do anything 'til morning. I'm too scared to deal with it on my own. One of them has fin rot, and I only just noticed. So there's some more guilt. I want to treat it on my own, but I'm scared I'll mess it up. I'm pretty clumsy. There have been a few close calls. I'm just getting more and more agitated. I can't get it off my mind. I'm shaking a bit. Aside from that, I'm feeling a lot of guilt and remorse about the path I've chosen. I'm a recent graduate of high school, and I've been out for months because I graduated in January. At first, I looked for a job because that's what you do when you have a breakdown about college pressures. And I was really close to applying too. But then I hit a brick wall with all this depression shit. My parents didn't want me job searching because of the added stress. And it was ok for a bit. But now I'm thinking that laying around all day is just amplifying it all. It just becomes all the more apparent that I'm useless and a failure. I don't know where to go from here. I'm still so inexperienced. I think I have a lot more to learn about responsibilty. Should I take a class here and there? Try college? Settle for a job? I don't even know what I want to do with my life. But I have to do something, or I'm going to waste away into nothingness. Hello sleepless night."

Living with my narcissistic mother is possibly the main source of my mental illness, and thinking about it is making me sick. I literally have no way out right now. My entire family is estranged, my friends are too, and every other option that I can think of is so fucking expensive. I am trapped in a position of vulnerability and it is driving me insane. I don't really know what I want right now, being it independence, dependence on a nurturing, compassionate person, etc. I crave both every day. And it is killing me that I'm inching closer and closer to adulthood without having a somewhat stable childhood. I'm tired of 'pretending' to be in control of my life by looking at colleges/career options. I know doing both is a generally good idea, but thinking about it drives me closer to the edge. I'm tired of trying to enjoy my adolescence too. I am a walking, breathing, cynical ball of angst currently, and not in a token way! "

401,vulnerability,depression,Should I seek professional help?,1,4nky34,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4nky34/should_i_seek_professional_help/,2016-06-11 20:39:51,"(I dislike reading people's life stories, but I turned into one of those guys with this post.) Hi. Should I seek professional help, or keep trucking/seek my own solutions i.e. is the latter just as healthy? I'm 22 and male, and probably had depressive/anxious tendencies since I was 14. I'm very introspective and score somewhat highly on the Asperger's AQ test and practically hit all the Schizoid Personality Disorder characteristics. I think for the past few years I almost haven't existed, and more recently I even had an episode where I questioned whether or not I existed. I feel dead inside and my emotional range is very restricted. I have no friends. The flip side is I'm very ambitious and so want what is best. But even my co-workers got me to see someone (a ""spiritual healer"" type, not a qualified psychologist) because I'm apparently not very receptive and I guess socially vacant. I just feel spacey 24/7 and occasionally I get what I'd call depression. This consists of feeling pretty down, a disconnect from the world (which occurs often now), an inability to feel pleasure. I sometimes feel like even a blank expression on my face takes too much effort to maintain, which is obviously difficult to relate to if you've never felt that. I have a superiority complex in that I think I can achieve great things, but a somewhat paradoxical inferiority complex, in that I feel I'm not good enough to succeed and that I should just kill myself. I would never kill myself I'm certain, but self harm is not completely off the cards, yet the thing stopping me from doing that is that I don't want to leave any physical scarring or anything. I actually look like I take care of myself on the outside, despite frequent binge eating and long cardio sessions. Yeah, I guess I'm all over the place. But since maybe 18 years old I feel like a dead person in a live body, or some kind of surrogate. Sometimes I look at my gym card with my name on it, and try to connect with that person; I feel like a character in a movie or something; I exist but I'm not really present. I haven't suffered childhood trauma beyond being a sensitive kid and my dad having occasional outbursts (he was a pretty volatile parent, and I still do not connect with him at all, but I'm not blaming my differences on that). What else? I masturbate but at the same time feel borderline asexual. I'm aromantic. Any girl that is interested in me I turn down. I hate vulnerability I think. Yesterday I asked myself (a) whether I exist, and (b) whether existing is even worth it. I think (b) is yes, but only if you can enjoy the existing. The old example of 'you don't not eat a doughnut just because eventually it will end, you enjoy it while it lasts' applies to life, but only if you enjoy life. So what if you don't? Also yesterday I made a $1,000 bet for the hell of it, lost the bet, and didn't feel anything. The fact that I didn't feel anything disturbed me more than the financial loss. I cared that I didn't care. I think that's what set things off yesterday. Back to self harm: I grabbed a knife and just looked at it, from the kitchen drawer (my housemate is gone for a week or so), but for the reasons stated above I did not come close to hurting myself as I care about my appearance. Sometimes I feel like crying and sometimes it comes out, but usually it doesn't. It's like I have to artificially induce it, trick my brain into doing it, otherwise it gets suppressed. I think the only way I can be a good human being is to acquire wealth. I also care about my health and well being. Not so much about relationships (no desire to have friends). But I still feel screwed up without happiness, because it affects my productivity. In the office I find myself politely smiling at jokes etc., but I struggle to make them, and they're just awkward when I try to make them. Ugh, I'll stop here."

About since the end of summer. The scary part is, it almost feels normal. I fail to see what the point is to anything. Everything has lost its purpose/meaning/value. I see a pretty girl, I think, whats the point, we will have a good time and eventually break up. I think about starting a family with a good girl, whats the point? It will bring more suffering and struggles not to mention if you get divorced you pretty much wrecked a kids life. Sure there is pleasure, but what is the end of pleasure? It is a passing moment, thats it. What is the point to doing well in life if your end is only the grave and in 100 years no one will remember you. Nobody will know your story, whether you were a good man, or a piece of trash. I suppose there is a truth that the consequences of our actions supercede our own observations of them. Maybe I can find hope in that, knowing every good thing I do, has the possibility of changing the future in an immense way for the better. Even though men may not observe the net ripple effect of our lives, maybe God does. There is a girl at my work. My heart is drawn towards her, not her beauty but her inner hope, an optimism, a happiness for simple things. The thing is, I know shes nuts. Not literally, but pretty much your archetypal, dumb fun/crazy girl thats good for a night or 2. I like that shiny things and compliments amuse and exicte her so much. When I think of something witty and sweet to say to her she swoons over it, she eats it all up, hook line and sinker. I want to run game on her. I know exactly what excites her. I know what looks to give, and what words to say. I know how to setup the close. I know how to be romantic. I know how to take control. I know how to capture her emotions. Because she is simple, yet extremely passionate. My intellect keeps tight regulation on my emotions. If I am sad, angry, depressed, or happy, I decide in what ways I will express this, or if I will keep it locked away. If I find myself developing feelings or experiencing emotions I dont like, I decide whether I will express them or if I will rationalize or ignore them away. Not her. When she sees a puppy, she cant control herself from adoring and pouring over it. Her passions and actions are instantaneous, there is no barrier between her passions and her immediate action. I like this. It is so liberating to be with somebody whose passion is so free. I love to capture her emotions. To do all the things I know she likes, I control her passion like a running river, yet she is extremely chaotic. She can break or withdraw within a second. I like this also. I have to keep a tight reign on my tongue or else I could hurt or offend her. I am in a box. My passions stay locked in my chest. I yearn to be free with you and not afraid. Im afraid what Ill find in you, what youll find in me, so I keep my heart locked in a box. Im afraid you'll discover somebody better and leave me alone; there is no security. Yet I loathe the security of stability. Deep down I love the wild, the untamed and free. The cost is too high for me, yet I desire to unleash myself upon you in a furious release of my deepest passions, to capture and take you in the rawest form of my desires. I imagine us together, watching tv like a regular couple on the couch. And I hate the image. I hate it because it is a symbol of comfort, complacency, and security in an object which is destined to fail. I hate it because it shows my vulnerability. I hate it because of the comfort and security you would be putting into me and how unstable I am to provide it; a castle made of sand. I hate that I know in my heart it would not make me happy and always in the back of my mind I would know this relationship has a time limit. I hate that I want this, that Im thinking about this, and I hate that I know if I were to find somebody in the long term I would eventually get sick of them and find passion elsewhere. I hate that passionate love has a time limit and that true love is only a commitment, and I hate that I want you so bad just so I could feel uncontrollable and free for a time. I throw in a lip of chewing tobacco and forget about her, and everything else because it is too maddening to think about. Going crazy. Goodbye"

I have an exam in two hours and I just pulled an all-nighter because I wasn't ready and I didn't even study the whole night. I've had two weeks to study for this one. I need to talk about the thoughts I've been thinking and it's too much for me to share with anyone I know I'm in my 4th year at university... and for the fourth time I am failing almost all my second semester courses. I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know what to attribute it to. Depression? I dated a girl for almost a year and we broke up in first year. I didn't think much of her after.. I learned a lot and knew she wasn't right for me. Looking back now, I see I've been heavily depressed ever since, for 4 years. I think I may have shut myself off more than I did before. Honestly I was happy when I was with her I don't know what I'm doing. I used to be an extreme overachiever in school... I aced everything with no effort and everybody praised me for being smart, that was my self worth. Now I cannot pass a first year calculus course in my fourth year....it hurts me to type that. This is just ridiculous. And tonight, I have no words. I literally cannot do the only thing I have to do I went through some horrific abuse as a child.. but somehow that was when I was at my brightest? And no one saw past that. Anyone I somehow said anything about it would say dismissive stuff like people have it worse or just be happy. My dad would tell me your mom hits and yells that everybody hates you and wants to kill because she cares about you and just try to not feel anything. Now after years and years of more passive manipulation and things finally I set my boundaries. But I still live with my parents. I'm 22. I've been thinking and talking about moving out at least since I was 16. Is this some Stockholm Syndrome? I feel so pathetic. I've been talking about it forever and here I am now...... trudging along living in the only place in the world I didn't want to live in. It's like a bird sulking in a cage, and when the door opens to freedom, he doesn't fly I also think I've been alone for all of 22 years. I've always been surrounded by loving people who think the best of me.. but I've never shown any vulnerability.. anything to anyone. Even when I began to deliberately do it.. it would just be a matter of fact instead of personal. I really have been alone in terms of personal support for 22 years. It's so hard to live like this. Ok that's not fair to the people who were there for me... but those relationships don't last and the only constant is me. I'm always so down. I don't open. I am completely invulnerable I don't know where I am going with this but I think the point I started at was I may be more depressed than I think. I don't know why I can't study or work or do anything. At night I can't sleep, and when I can I don't want to. For anyone who's read this far, thank you. I guess I should include some medical stuff.. I have been taking anti-depressants for a year and it's been very helpful. A bunch of different doctors convinced me to take it. I have seen two psychologists. One for consultation. The second one I saw her maybe 12 times but I had to stop. She wasn't good. She believed in a bunch of random stuff and would often talk more than I did. Those didn't work. I am currently seeing my family doctor for ""counselling"" 30 minutes each month. He is very understanding and wise but I don't think that's enough. It's strange how at moments I am highly sociable and functional but I think at my core I am not okay because how could I be like this? Well time to go to school and fail my exam. Thanks for reading and I hope your day goes better."

I've been going to a therapist every other week(recently every week) for the past 3 months at a short term(6 month) agency. She (my therapist) and her supervisor strongly believe I have depression.

Sleep seems my [only escape](URL Last Wednesday, 3 days ago, I went to my therapist, and she described why she thought I was depressed, talking about my low self-esteem, thoughts of death, and self-blaming among other things. I showed her [this photo](URL I had taken at a park near my house. At the end of the last few sessions, I would get anxious, feeling I had not done what I needed to do, that I had wasted my time with her, not told her/expressed something I needed to. This session, I agreed to try antidepressant medication and as the time ran out, she asked me how I felt right now, and I said ""I don't know. It's kind of like this phrase 'The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say.'"", citing lyrics from Pink Floyd's Time. She asked me how a hug makes me feel, and I remarked that I had never really been hugged, and then remembered a gay guy in my orchestra class that had a crush on me and how I had once laid my head in his lap and tried to nap. In the middle of mentioning him to her, I realized that she was offering me a hug, and a surge of adrenaline and a sense of dread came into me. It was the same feeling I had felt before some performance, or healthy social dare by one of my friends. Knowing that if I waited too long I would likely not do it, I accepted her offer and we stood up and hugged. My first thought was 'Shouldn't I feel something?'. I moved my chin away from her neck hoping to not be too close for her comfort. I quivered my breath to make her think she was affecting me, giving me something that I needed. The noise of the adrenaline had obscured any other feeling except for a thought near the end of the hug. The realization that I was *holding her*. And she was holding *me*. She is 27, about 5'5, 120 pounds, small breasts, and has a very pretty, 9/10 heart-shaped face. I looked down at her small back, and realized that *I* was *holding* her small frame. It seemed as soon as I realized this, we pulled away from each other and it was over. As we left her office, I jokingly continued about that gay guy and how he had confessed his affection towards me through Facebook messenger when he had his wisdom teeth removed and was under anesthesia. On the ride home I began typing in my phone a note to figure out how I felt about what had just happened. I realized that I wanted us to hold each other for hours, so my adrenaline could subside and I--we could [relax against each other in wordless understanding, and trusting intimacy, the only ticking clock existing for either of us our heartbeats and breaths, and I would have a vague feling of happiness encompassing my consciousness like a fluffy and heavy blanket as we drift off into the peace and vulnerability of sleep in each other's arms.](URL Needless to say, when I got home, I wanted to cuddle a girl. I realized that her question about hugs reminded me of how I often listen to the posts in [r/pillowtalkaudio](URL while hugging a body pillow (a solid-colored one, no anime character on it). Hugging a pillow seems like nothing now that I had held a conscious being in my arms who knew about my deepest problems. I've never kissed a girl or asked one out, and I feel the need to have an SO that I can hold. The problem is, I'm in a very unstable and low state right now and I worry rejection could make things even worse. I hope I would understand that any relationship I would get into right now would probably just be puppy love, but I think I could take it for what it is. I don't know what I should do about that. Right now I feel the need to expedite the confirmation of depression and get medication, because things are feeling really bad. I want to talk to her again and I want another hug from her. Maybe I could not be so nervous next time. TL;DR I feel awful, been seeing a therapist for 3 months, hugged her a few days ago, now I want more holding-type stuff, but rejection could make it not worth it."

Im 20 years old male, living by myself, extremely isolated. Right now, as I'm typing this, there's a stabbing pain in my bladder area (I think it's the bladder area, the lower stomach area). I would experience this pain on and off, but much more frequently recently. I don't know what to do, I have no one to turn to really. I am locked up in my own prison right now. I need help. More about me: For almost 4 years or maybe more, I've been really depressed. I'm 20 years old male. Living by my own in a rented room in NYC. I basically dropped out of high school because my problems prevented me from focusing on school. I have many physical and of course mental issues along with a very bad living situat right now and no means of sustaining this excuse of a life for much longer. Right now I'm eating maybe one takeout meal a day. I don't have a place to cook, no money to buy healthy good food. I have very little money, clothing, or anything. I can't sustain myself like this any longer. I'm 5 10ish and I weight only 110 lbs the last time I checked. I've always been skinny, but not this skinny. I feel so weak and my physical health problems are mounting to a point I just ignore them because Im not sure what else to do. I have no one and i dont know any place to seek for help. My family don't really care about me, they have their own things to do. The only person who cares for me is my mom, however she can barely even take care of herself right now. I can tell she's starting to seriously giving up on me recently... this makes me feel even more hopeless. I don't know if the word hopeless can describe my situation badly enough... I seriously don't know what to do. I have no friends, no girl friend because of my health problem (I'll tak about that soon), no money, no prospect of a future, no help from anywhere, I need to get help now, I think I've suffered long enough. I tried to kill myself before but that didn't work out and now I'm stuck with a big medical bill as a result of that incident. Im not paying it anytime soon though. I hate myself, I hate my physical appearance, everything about me and my life. Anyway my health problems are bad. I'm going to be honest on this post if anyone is serious about helping me. Basically I've always been depressed but only when I was about 16 or 17 that I became really super depressed. I think I'm super ugly, I lost all the little self confidence I had. However the one of the main problems if not the main problem? It's embrassing to say this, but basically I can't have sex. Yes I basically can't have any sexual pleasure anymore because I would get this pain whenever I try to even masterbate. Plus overall very very bad sexual health. I don't know for sure when this situation started, but probably around age 16. This deeply personal problem prevented me from having any girl friends during high school. Killed my confidence and my self esteem. I was lucky enough to have a few really good opportunities with a few really attractive girls. They liked me and a few even asked me out. I had to turn away from that because I knew I have a very bad health problem. This problem worsen my depression to a point where I don't think I'm a proper human being anymore. Filled me with regret and anger. I feel I would be alone for the rest of my life. I never seeked help for this problem. Even to this day. So 4 years later, here I am with all my health problems worsen to a point where I don't know what I am anymore. I am also extremely underweight, very bad immune system, I have a few skin problems as well, and probably more heath problems like the bladder pain I feel right now. I lost all the few friends I had during high school. Isolated myself completely. Had a part time job, saved a little money and been living by myself for a few months now. I live my everyday in pain physically and mentally. I feel as if I'm in some sort of a prison that tortures my soul daily. I live my day full of regrets, loneliness, worthless, and worse of all completely hopeless. I'm talk to myself and are haunted by memories of good old times and daydreams. Things are so bad right now I think death might be my only way of achieving calmness, but I just want to hold on to existence just for a little bit longer to see if anyone can be kind enough to offer me any help right now. I don't know what I mean by help or in what form of help I need, but I am seeking out right with all my vulnerability exposed. With my covers stripped, I am begging for help. Please, help. Please. I am scared of death, honestly, death is deeply scary when I have all day/ everyday to think of it."
408,vulnerability,depression,I think I might be depressed. I feel like I've repressed something bad.,1,456e9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/456e9i/i_think_i_might_be_depressed_i_feel_like_ive/,2016-02-11 12:55:46,"Im a 22 year old girl and over the past year Ive had a growing sense that some kind of sexual abuse happened to me as a child. In advance Im sorry that this is extremely long but its all been building up inside of me over the past year. One of the most concerning realisations for me was my awareness of sexuality from a really young age. I remember masturbating from a young age, from before I had been explained what it meant or the sexual nature of it. I know this alone doesnt say much, but the more Ive thought about it the more Ive come to remember. I have a vivid memory of being at kindergarten, perhaps age 5, and being asked to escort a younger child inside. I have a memory of leading her out of the play area and, as I did, reaching down and squeezing her bottom once. I have no idea why I would do that, I feel guilty and ashamed as I type this experience out. I also remember engaging in romantic or sexual play with my soft toys, in that I would partner them and role play scenarios. Im a little unclear of how explicit these scenarios were, but thinking back makes me uncomfortable. I also vividly remember around the same time being caught drawing a picture a picture of a naked man, complete with genitalia. This really stands out to me as a memory because at that age (as far as I can remember) I had never seen a fully grown naked man, although I suppose I had seen another child. But I had never seen my father naked and being an only child with no brothers or male cousins I dont understand where I would have got the need to draw this from. It wasnt the drawing of a child but of a fully aged man. Probably my biggest childhood red flag appears when I think back to one particular incident. At about the age of 5 or 6 I had a friend from kindergarten named Jack. I remember Jack visiting my house and we were left to play on our own devices in my room. I remember we both at some point were undressed, perhaps not unusual for childhood play. But then I vividly remember observing his genitals and telling him that I wondered if it could fit in my own private areas, and that we should see if it went in. Nothing happened but I clearly remember saying it. Its made me distressed and worried about where I learnt this behaviour, or how I even conceived that thought at that age, when nothing like it had ever been explained to me. That wasnt the only incident of sexual-based play in my childhood. There were scenarios I vaguely remember (but not in as much detail) of looking at each others genitals and playing doctor with a male friend. Even as an older child of around 10 I remember playing games with my best female friend where we would essentially act out romance/sexual based scenarios but fully clothed with no actual sexual contact involved. As an adult Ive found that I have fetishized extreme and violent sexual acts. I have fantasised about being raped even though at the same time I know I am disgusted at the thought of it actually happening. Within sex I enjoy being choked, slapped, spanked, bound, gagged. Feelings of helplessness and humiliation. I have a hard time achieving orgasm without these elements. Ive also become disgusted at myself in that I find myself physically, but not mentally, aroused when reading about incidents of female child abuse. I want to be clear that I have absolutely no attraction to children, and I am not aroused by any physical sight of a child. But when I read about news stories involving violence I sometimes feel a slight arousal while simultaneously feeling a wave of empathy for the child- often reduced to tears by the idea of their ordeal. And while I have not been squeamish about sex, the idea of visiting a gynaecologist physically repulses me. I remember once at the age of about 16 or 17 being talked to at school about pap smears and gynaecological exams. The teacher spoke about how the instrument is inserted and it made me feel sick. I fainted off of my chair in the middle of class- the only time I have ever fainted. Also, while I know many peoples hymen breaks before intercourse because of physical activity, I was always a very indoorsy child yet I did not bleed when I lost my virginity. Ive had issues throughout my life with finding healthy ways to deal with hurt, upset, anger, and stress. For years I would obsessively push back and pick at the skin around my nails (hands and toes) until the point they would hurt and bleed. I went through a period where I would hurt myself as a way of coping with emotions, cutting myself with scissors and knifes along my arms, my legs, and my stomach. I would deliberately hit my wrist until it caused bruising. While these were largely superficial and not intended to cause lasting harm, I did have suicidal thoughts almost every day for a couple of years at around 12-14. I even thought about how I would do it and remember going through the medicine draw and counting how many pills we had in the house. Since the age of about 17 I have stopped all incidents of self harm. Until earlier this month when one incident occurred, and I felt unable to cope with feelings of rejection and vulnerability and I relapsed- I carved some lines into my arms, my legs and my stomach with a kitchen knife. There was drink involved which elevated my negative feelings, and while Im confident its something that wont happen again its really disturbed me that I could do it. Nobody knows about any of this, and I feel like the person I outwardly project to the world is drastically different to the one which I really am by myself. I also had persistent OCD traits throughout my childhood, which I believe emerged at some point between the ages of 6-8. Ive read that OCD traits can be signs of childhood abuse. I had (and to a lesser extent still have) an obsession with numbers. Everything had to be done in multiples of two or five, whether it be touching an object that number of times or the volume on a television, steps it took to reach my desired destination, turning on a light switch, eating a certain number of sweets which was even an even number or a multiple of five. While this has gotten a lot better with age (I still obsess over volume numbers and very occasionally find myself needing to do something an even number of times) it was a huge part of my memory of childhood. This also corresponded with my hatred of odd numbers and fear of objects feeling left out. I used to personify household objects, give them feelings- If I used one glass for my first drink Id need to use the other one the next time so it didnt feel left out. I would try and put objects in pairs or groups so they were never alone. I remember that even when I would draw stick people or smiley faces I could never just draw one, because I was afraid they would be lonely without another one beside them. If I touched one toy I would need to touch the others so they didnt feel excluded. I feel these were mimicking my own feeling of vulnerability. I was also incredibly shy as a child, traits which carried on for a long time. I found it difficult to talk to stranger or approach people I didnt know. I hated answering the phone and would never ask for help in shops even when I needed it. I had extreme startle responses and couldnt stand loud noises like fireworks as they made me physically flinch and jump. I remember once in kindergarten there was a nativity play when I was a Shepard, and part of it was one child clapping his hand against a tambourine very hard in succession and each time he did it I would flinch and jump to the point I noticed laughter. Within my relationships I have always been incredibly emotionally dependent. I seek validation from my partners and have always been extremely sensitive to criticism- taking it very personally. I have a fear of abandonment to the level that even when I have no longer wanted to be in a relationship with a partner Im unable to let them go because I dont want them to leave me. I feel like Im on a constant quest for intimacy and have a huge need to please whoever Im with. Even when Ive been in healthy relationships Ive found myself crying for no reason even when nothings gone wrong. Ive also found that I let partners walk over me in a sense. While Im incredibly strong and independent in my everyday life, when in a relationship I minimise the bad things a partner might do and try to let them go rather than confront bad behaviour or express my dissatisfaction. I find it difficult to recognise, own and express anger within my romantic relationships. I have, however, always cried incredibly easily. Minor inconveniences or hurt feelings cause extreme emotional responses from me. I can also be incredibly empathetic. I cry at films both when the endings are too happy or too sad. I regularly cry when watching or reading the news- usually when observing stories which involve hurt children and abuse. Another red flag is that Ive always been very private and secretive even when I have nothing to hide, something which many people including friends and my own mother have picked up on. Ive had a very complicated relationship with sleep. As a child I had terrible nightmares and remember one recurring one where I was chased by a wolf who progressively got closer to catching me vividly to this day. Ive also always had this fear of being watched while in my bedroom. As a child I would be terrified somebody outside of the windows in the night was looking through watching me, I wouldnt allow even the smallest gap in the curtains. Even to this day I get a fear that there is somebody in my bedroom and sense a presence. Ive also had a complicated relationship with food. While Ive always been naturally skinny I go through periods where I become obsessive over my weight and counting calories, usually when Im encountering stress in other aspects of my life. I come from a loving family and am close with both of my parents and if there was any incidents of abuse I cannot possibly think they were involved. I was given warnings about strangers as a child and taught about parts of my body which were private in very simplistic, non-detailed terms. Ive never had any diagnosis for a condition and Ive never been to therapy. But my family does have a history of depression with both my mother and my maternal grandmother (and by some accounts my great grandmother) suffering from depression at some point within their lives. I just cant shake this feeling that something happened to me and the more Ive read about sexual abuse and the manifestations it causes the more I recognise within my own life. Im really starting to wonder if I have repressed abuse. I just have a strong, unexplained sense that something bad has happened to me. As Ive written this all out Ive also become increasingly aware that I may have some other real issues, any advice or help will be appreciated. "
409,vulnerability,depression,I can't handle being an adult.,29,3zohec,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3zohec/i_cant_handle_being_an_adult/,2016-01-06 16:56:53,"I don't think I'm looking at my childhood through rose tinted glasses; it was actually that much better. I didn't develop depression until I started puberty at the age of ten, and I've had it ever since despite going through copious amounts of therapy and taking antidepressants. I'm 24. The only type of pleasure that increased for me was sexual. Every other type, from enjoying food to enjoying beauty, lessened greatly in magnitude. The good things that came with adulthood are like consolation prizes. Falling in love, for me, isn't as pleasant as summer vacation was for me as a child. Being able to go where I want when I want isn't as fun as making a pillow fort was when I was a child. Being able to buy things with my own money isn't as fun as having the ability to get completely absorbed into a game of pretend with my toys. Having sex and masturbating aren't as fun as playing outside used to be. Even though I can technically do all of the things I did as a child, the pleasure just isn't there and I feel stupid doing them. Something about my brain must have changed to make me incapable of ever enjoying those games in the same way again. Adult responsibilities can be hellish if you don't have the ability to fulfill them. For example, you're expected to get a job, but you aren't guaranteed one. As a child, I was loved and admired by default. I could draw something incredibly stupid and be praised for it. Now I am judged for every little thing, be it how I talk or the fact that I still live with my mom. Often, I find that the only way I can find temporary relief from reality is by thinking about my childhood. I think about my small, light, and androgynous body as compared to my current lumbering, easily worn out, sexually mature one. I think about the simplicity of friendships back then and the magic of the smallest things. I think about how my imagination was so powerful that I could make myself feel like my imaginings were really taking place. I think about how even school was fun in some way at any time I was there. I think about how everything looked more impressive from my smaller point of view. I think about how I used to feel like adulthood was very far away and would cherish that. I was actually one of those rare kids who never wanted to grow up, and leaving elementary school actually caused me so much stress that I got shingles on my thighs. It seems to me that adulthood is mainly about dealing with existential anxiety. We're too aware of our mortality to relax. We feel the need to prove our worth, although this is reinforced by not receiving the attention we received by default as children. Our minds are enslaved to the tribe; we're too worried about looking silly or being perceived as less than valuable to the community. Now that we're legally allowed to pursue things, we feel pressure to do it continuously with no ultimate satisfaction in sight. I also miss being naive. Now that I know too much, I frequently experience rage and suffocating despair. My naivety was violently interrupted by 9/11 (I'm American). From that day forward and increasingly with every time I saw the attacks on the news, I realized my own vulnerability and the vulnerability of everything I loved. I also know too much about common-place things such as factory farms and sweatshops. I can't not see evil everywhere now. I can't engage with my peers in the way I used too because we're all too worried about how we're perceived. I can't just turn toward a person my own age and say, ""Hi, I'm daftmunk. Do you wanna play with me?"" That would be fucking weird. And if I did get someone to play with me, it would have to be something socially acceptable for our age, like a sport. No blanket monster in the dark hallway sorts of games. So yeah, fuck adulthood. "

Since my depression hit me hard I've hated literally every picture of myself. Looking at myself in pictures makes me feel ill. I never notice what looks right, I only notice what looks wrong. (Spoiler alert: it's me.) Lately my mood has been more peaceful and more positive. Today I posted my first ""selfie"" on my social media account. Prior to that I've only had pictures with friends and family, never by myself, with me usually hidden somewhere within. So when I posted the selfie, I felt a flash of absolute fear and vulnerability. How is it that something so simple as posting a picture can affect me, or someone else, so deeply? I found it interesting and alarming. Thoughts? Feelings? Rants? "

We were just chilling around the living room area and the conversation had eventually led to us talking about our families, and I suddenly felt the urge to talk about my mother's death from a few years ago and how that contributed to my depression (that I haven't told anyone ever) It was definitely a risk because I'm not his closest friend, and we haven't spent a lot of time hanging out outside our flat but he actually listened to me for 20 minutes non stop about my past (and saw me cry which was embarrassing) He was surprisingly supportive and empathetic about it. He even said ""thanks for opening up"" afterwards. It was surprising because he was your typical athletic, outgoing ""bro"" type of guy who doesnt like vulnerability and I didn't expect him to give me the type of reaction that he did. I felt better opening up to him than I ever did to my counsellor at school!! Can I consider him a real friend now? "

I've been feeling a longing lately. It wasn't until recently where I stopped several small, but self-destructive behaviors and distractions, where it revealed to me that removing these things made the hole bigger. It made me realize that I miss feeling real emotions and passion. I've been trying to escape them this whole time with distractions, and building walls that it became second nature to suppress them. But lately my dreams have been becoming emotionally intense, reminding me the passion I used to have as an early child, and I miss them so much. It's as if something so real is trying to finally break out. I used to go after things with such passion. Bliss used to just empower my mind that compares to no high. Love used to just be so easy to soak up with vulnerability. And the feelings of happiness used to drag on for days, triumphing the most stressful times. I just miss it. The dreams are making me want to go after this but it's so hard when you feel nothing in the tank. How do I create the spark with no fuel? How? I just miss it so much. I've been working really hard after growing up through child abuse well into high school, heartbreaks, and being taken advantage of. That no amount of effort of trying to feel gratitude is helping. No hard work or accomplishments are making me feel. Sorry, it's just this came to me and I want to see what others may think. Maybe some can explain how to get it back. Or someone that can tell me there experience when they did. It's just been in my thoughts lately, and I'm feel just ready to tear down these walls to feel again. Thanks for reading."
413,vulnerability,depression,(xpost from r/relationships) I (33m) need advice on how to reach out to my deeply depressed brother (30m),3,3wm4jr,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3wm4jr/xpost_from_rrelationships_i_33m_need_advice_on/,2015-12-13 16:37:11,"My brother, Mike, was always the black sheep of the family (I have three brothers and one sister, Mike is the second youngest). He is different - he's always had a dark streak - very dark sense of humour, etc. Aside from that, he is incredibly good looking, charming, and very intelligent - he was the type of kid who would take apart radios and engines and put them back together for fun - I think his IQ is somewhere around 140. Growing up, he has had more than his share of painful experiences. I'll list some of them here: * My father left the family several times, which impacted all of us to varying degrees and in different ways * When Mike was 8 or 9, one of his teachers developed an inappropriate relationship with him, buying him presents and favouring him in class - we think he wanted him as a son. My mother dealt with that well, basically utilising the school administration to pull him into line. As far as we know, this was not an abusive relationship * We moved to the other side of the world - Mike would have been 11 at the time * My mother was the principle of the school Mike attended and one of his teachers was going through a disciplinary process which he blamed my mother for. There were several incidents, including one where he had Mike stand on the desk and ranted at the class that 'Mike's mother is the reason I'm going to have to find another job' * Mike was moved to a private school where his classmates were all incredibly rich - we're talking multi-millionaires who received cars and jet skis for their 15th birthdays-rich. We are not a rich family, in fact, we have struggled to get by for much of our lives. This contrast in lifestyle seemed to breed a huge resentment in my brother This brings me to my main concerns. When he was 24 he moved to another country to pursue a career - a physically demanding job, but one he was extremely passionate and motivated by. He was over the moon upon his arrival - the happiest I have ever known him. Shortly after settling down, he was brutally attacked in a bar fight. Basically, a man ran up behind him and, as my brother turned around, brought a glass ashtray down on his face. Mike was rushed to hospital and underwent over two years of facial reconstructive surgery, cosmetic surgery and physical rehabilitation. He lost huge amounts of blood and was leaking brain fluid. His face is permanently altered following the reconstruction, he has lost his sense of smell and taste and he is no longer able to work in the field of his chosen career - it could literally kill him to do so. He has been told my doctors that a tennis ball thrown hard enough at the right spot on his head could kill him. He went into dire depression after this, basically building up a rage and resentment at everything in his path. Many people reached out to help him, including friends who allowed him to live rent-free, etc., but he burned every one of them in some way. He has refused to acknowledge his role in this, basically saying that they turned into assholes. He returned to the country my family lives in and moved in with my sister, again, rent-free. They managed to get along OK, but it was a tense relationship that was exacerbated by Mike's complete lack of acknowledgement about her efforts to help and unwillingness to contribute to the household in any way. He eventually moved in to a house my mother had poured her savings into to own as a rental. Some repairs/refurbishments were required, and he took on the task of doing them. That was supposed to take three months and it has now turned into approx. 2 years. Several months into him living there, and finally getting a job, he was diagnosed with diabetes. He has been awaiting a compensation payment following his injuries, and he recently received an offer, which is basically a joke - they have many of the details wrong and the total sum is meager compared to what he was lead to believe he would receive. We are trying to convince him to enlist a lawyer to deal with it, but all offers of advice or assistance are met with hostility. I fear that, if this compensation falls through, it will add another, enormous layer of depression and may be the straw that breaks the camel's back. I spoke with him today and asked if he was OK, and I think he began to cry. He made an excuse and got off the phone. He lives thousands of miles away so I rarely get the chance to see him, but when I do we get along brilliantly. I count him as one of my best friends. Mike is very hostile to any form of help or assistance. He has, under duress, sought counselling, but it never lasts more than a session or two. He hates doctors, etc - basically, any form of authority, he despises. He is emotionally airtight, although I can see his sensitivity and vulnerability all over him. He is in deep emotional pain and I have no idea how to reach out to him. He doesn't drink at all or take drugs, but he regularly smokes marijuana. I'm so scared that, one day, I'll wake up to find he has checked out. Please help with any advice on how I can help my brother to feel loved and start to value himself and the life he has. Sorry this is a little garbled. **tl;dr**: Brother suffers depression and refuses to acknowledge it or open up. Worried I may lose him and need advice!"
414,vulnerability,depression,How do you accept depression in your daily life?,1,3wtrf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3wtrf3/how_do_you_accept_depression_in_your_daily_life/,2015-12-15 06:59:49,"I've been going to therapy for anxiety and depression for a little over a year now, but just recently I've realized that my struggles may not be situational, or something that I can expect to ""get better"" anytime soon. In fact, the more I try to carry on with my normal life and push aside negative feelings, the more they come bulleting back at me-- often in the form of images of self-harm, which is pretty fucking upsetting. I try to push the thoughts away harder, they intrude more strongly, yada yada. In the words of Fat Bastard, it's a vicious cycle. *I think I need to find a way to accept that this is my life now.* Demonstrated by the above humorously-attempted sentence, I'm struggling with this. I want to joke, or rationalize. I want to ""motivate"" myself-- argue that if I accept I am depressed, then I'm accepting living a half-life, one where I'm unmotivated, unlikeable, a shadow of my full potential. It would mean accepting that there's something wrong with me, versus blaming an external force. I'd feel like I was accepting an even more fail-tastic existence than the one I'm currently pissing around in. And yet, I'm pretty sure this needs to happen. A part of me wants to start blogging about it (I used to enjoy writing until my MFA program made me despise my own voice) and I actually find vulnerability cathartic, nearly intoxicating-- but I'm also terrified by what my friends, family, and colleagues will think of me if they know I'm depressed. My parents know I've been unhappy and that I go to therapy, but they've also told me I have no reason to be sad, that I should ""quit it"" and be grateful for all I have. I can't help feeling that they're right-- all in all, I've enjoyed (and still enjoy, largely) a good life. I'm living in a cool city with my husband; we got married this past October and share an amazing bond. I have an adjuncting gig at a local community college that I love (except for the fact that it's only part-time) and my husband makes enough to support us both while I find something more permanent (although I feel extremely guilty and useless about this and my compounding student debt). I'm healthy, fit, passingly attractive, and can affect enough verve and confidence to fool pretty much everybody. What the fuck do I have to complain about? Hell, I'm anxious that users in this subreddit are going to kick me out for being a depression poser. But I hope you don't. I hate this. I hate sitting in the car for 10 minutes trying to will myself to just get out and go into the grocery store to buy some fucking ingredients for chicken pot pies because the activity will make me feel better, while my entire soul yearns to put on pajama pants and sink into the sofa and a book or reddit until I can go to sleep and not have to feel any more pain. And then even after I win the battle and make the pies and have fun and feel the tiniest bit proud, the negativity starts up, like ""Wow. You want to feel proud of yourself for making dinner, you sad, useless woman who can't get a job and is going to end up another fat, disenfranchised housewife? You would've been able to do this so easily a year ago, AND applied to that job you totally put off today. Yup, you're really winning today. Soooo winning."" And then I'm like, Well fuck, Me! How am I supposed to get better if I hate on myself for trying? Or if I'm hating on myself for hating on myself? And so on. This is ridiculous. And that's when I want to push it all away... except then I'm right back to imaging my wrists cut open oozing blood and saying my mantras about the thoughts not having power, just being ""clouds in the sky that pass"" which helps, but still tells me: This isn't going to get better if I keep pushing it away. **All this is to say: How do you accept your depression when it feels like acceptance will only tear you farther away from the person you wish you could be?** (Just to clarify: I'm not actively suicidal. I want to live and feel better. I think the intrusive thoughts of self-harm are my mind ""acting out"" because I'm not acknowledging my own emotions... or something. Mostly they just scare and upset me, even though I know intrusive thoughts are common.) "

As with most graduates, the sword of debt repayments ($40000 in my case) is dangling above my head. Since May 2013, I have worked at degrading, arduous jobs (twice dishwashing and once at an overpriced grocery store), I have had nervous breakdowns every few months, especially in November. In March of 2014 I moved to Toronto on my own and went to a employment assistance program for young adults with Asperger's syndrome. What did that get me? Three months of being treated like a child, no meaningful training or guidance, and then a job as a goddamn dishwasher in a busy neighbourhood (despite a psychological test stating my vulnerability to stress). By the end of August 2014, I couldn't afford to live in Toronto, so I moved back to the town where I went to university. I spent an entire year scrounging for any work I could get, and one of my best friends, a rare source of sanity, had to leave town in January because his roommate became a psychopath. My mother and stepdad occasionally helped me financially, but I was still on welfare which barely supported rent for the filthy apartment I lived in. I visited several governmental and private employment services in a desperate attempt to find something, **anything** that I could apply my education towards. Nothing, not anything. Since the end of August, I moved back in with my parents. They're moving to an isolated neighbourhood in two weeks, and it is too far from any source of employment. The only option I have left is to apply for a post-graduate journalism program, but that doesn't start until September of next year. So now I'm trying to look for an apartment, again. Look for work, again. Try to make a life I can just barely tolerate, again. As I mentioned, I have Asperger's along with depression. Job interviews are mortifying for me. Does anyone know what it's like to be asked &gt;""What was the most rewarding thing you *accomplished* at work""? What the hell am I supposed to say?! &gt;""Well, having a crotchety old hag bitch at me because the meat I ground up didn't look nice enough, that's a contender right there sir/ma'am"". Nothing has worked. Nothing is working. The past 30 months have amounted to a mountain range of bullshit. I can't wait 10 months to have a meaningful change in my life, and hell, I might not even get into the journalism program. And what if I take the program, get the degree, and still end up working in a fucking kitchen?! My university fucked me over by providing no advice, no adequate consultation and not even a post-grad job board (which was inexplicably removed from the website over a year ago). I could easily get fucked over again and fall into deeper debt. Again. What am I to do in the meantime? Should I still live with my parents and continue to have my sanity degrade through boredom and ennui? Should I move somewhere else yet again and beg for menial labour in a desolate job market? Anti-suicide PSAs sometimes warn vulnerable individuals ""don't be a statistic"". But you know what? People pay attention to statistics. Statistics end up in academic journals. Statistics don't aimlessly wander the world like Cain. To be honest, being a statistic sounds like the only dignified option left. Addendum **moderately graphic**: for the past two years, I occasionally suffer painful rectal bleeding. Possibly induced by stress, possibly colorectal cancer. Yippee "
417,vulnerability,depression,"On life as a game of chess, Breaking Bad vs. Gilmore Girls and mental greenhouses. What's your opinion?",2,3rzueg,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3rzueg/on_life_as_a_game_of_chess_breaking_bad_vs/,2015-11-08 22:08:00,"So, I would love to discuss something. In case anybody has an opinion about this, I would appreciate very much to hear it. Yesterday I have been thinking about the world teaching me a lesson over and over again until I learn it. I feel my following though process might point me in a vital albeit bitter direction. This is long, so thanks for taking the time to read it. Having been very honest and up front to certain people in the real nondigital world about my depression, social anxiety, sometimes even self harm, eating disorders and the whole ugly package that comes along with it, has not lead to a reliable circle of friends who really know me and whom I really know and has not led me into a healthy position in which I can sustain myself. That kind of pure genuine friendship we might all secretly wish for and that morally untainted way of earning a living. (Why would I let people in on the details of my depression and anxiety? Because hiding and denying it made it much worse. I felt healthier when I recognized and dealt with it. I imagine much like as when gay people have their coming out, they destroy much of the pressure and pain of having to deny an essential part of their personality.) But these days I feel it especially strongly, that it has led to me being left behind, because my depression doesn't simply go away when admitting it; I am constantly high maintenance to deal with. It has left me with this very bitter feeling of them talking about me behind my back. Of them saying, hey let's meet for this big party, shall we invite HER too? Nooooo, let's not, and let's not tell her, she's a drag. And she's so weak, she blames everything on her depression and anxiety, yeah well, probably she is just dumb and a big tool. She doesn't add any value to our lives, let's just leave her to pout in her lonelyness, it's her own fault after all. Let's not waste time and energy on her. (Let's create a drinking game about her misery symptoms instead!...) It all comes down to simple social economics: Does the price justify the assets? Life feels very much like a strategic game of chess. I have always wanted life to feel like taking a bath in kitties and puppies and everybody loving each other and being surrounded by nature and peace. I have wanted life to be like Gilmore Girls, instead it is much more like Breaking Bad. Life seems not the ""good, virtuous people on the one side (of which OF COURSE I am one /s)"" versus the ""evil people on the other side (how COULD they only?! /s)"", but instead: ""the smart people understanding the game and playing it's rules to sustain a prospering powerful life in this system"" versus ""the oblivious naive tools and losers who end up being taken advantage of"". I start to question my picture of people in general. People around me are not simply ""nice"" or ""altruistic"" or ""good people"". What if the general majority of people rather want to have power? Everybody has the potential in them of being an egoistic power struggler and social calculator. People take advantage of each other which might feel like being ""nice"". In the end, they don't look out for others, they look out for themselves. I am being naive, very naive, because I am very weak and soft, and I have a big distrust towards and inability to plan and carry out schemes. I long to connect in a genuine and naturally easy way, because that's the thing I am good at. I suck at other stuff, that's why I retreat to that position of niceness and love and peace and idiocy. People who have the disposition of ""I want a long prospering powerful life"" act very different to people with the disposition of ""I will not make it for a long time here on earth (as a resulting belief of depression), so I can reveal myself all the way right now anyway; I will not need to scheme and plan and organize myself a grand future"". People with the first disposition feel they have something to lose; people with the second feel they have nothing more to lose. The point is, even though sometimes people with disposition 1 might feel a certain regret, that they won't ever show themselves the way they are, that they won't ever go in fully and completely, that they won't be brave enough to mess up for the bigger dream....; people with disposition 2 forget that it is very likely in our modern society to end up having a long life with a decent amount of health and having to deal with the consequences of their thoughtless, feeling-led actions of exposing themselves. I feel like I am one of the last to realize this in my social circle. I feel like a fool. It's a conflict between the deep wish to genuinely be recognized and appreciated and loved by another person for who you are on the one side, versus protecting yourself from harm by not exposing and not being vulnerable on the other side. I don't really want to have to live in such a power struggle world where nobody shows themselves and everybody just takes advantage of each other in order to be better off than the others. It sounds fake and exhausting and depressing and mean and plain and hurtful and not worthwhile. I want to live in a world where I can show myself without fear, where I can see others for who they are, where I don't have to worry or be ashamed that I have completely natural feelings of weakness, sadness and fear and that it is ok to have them and to connect over them. I don't know how to find a good balance in this, or to not get depressed while playing that fake-game. I know that I was lucky to live in such a world when I was a kid, but I don't know where to find it in the adult world, except in rural tribes in the Andes or the desert or the jungle or hippie communes in South East Asia far away from capitalist logic. Or by creating it myself, which hasn't worked out so far and has just brought me to where I am now. The only compromise I see is to keep my truth inside a mental greenhouse and knowing exactly who I can let inside and who I just show the pretty facade to. Like leading a double life. Skepticism towards people seems to be a healthy tool in this context. Don't trust anybody, only select very few and only after you've observed their behavior and loyalty over a long period of tests. I feel it's time for me to start playing the game if I don't want to perish financially and socially. To tackle my anxiety and not let it have me retreat in my little loser corner. Maybe I will start liking it, and if not I can still run off to the Caribbean and live as a recluse. I feel if I continue the way I do, inside this society that I am in right now, I will get into very big long lasting trouble. Unless I can find a niche that caters to my exposed uncontrollable vulnerability, but I wouldn't know where. What are your thoughts on this? Have you had this conflict? How have you dealt with it? Have you found your compromise? Or did you find a way to not compromise? Do you play the game? Do you know any resources that might get me further along that thought path? Or is this just a depressed mind speaking? Am I overgeneralizing and seeing the world in black and white? Am I being just like the people I talk about without realizing it?"

For the last 2/3 years i've been in survival mode and depressed. Every day is different in how i'm feeling, nothing really stable. The psychotic/paranoid thoughts are always kind of with me, although this week ive noticed that when I surrender to the thoughts that happen to me and not struggle against them/give in to them, they first increase in intensity and then they fade. A short while after that it seems like the episode is 'beat' and I feel like myself again. Sadly it doesn't take very long for the next 'challenge' to come up and it takes a long time for me to figure out how to 'beat' it again (how to let it go). In general if I would have to explain to someone how im feeling i would say that I almost never get a moment to just relax, let things be, accept how things are and just be comfortable with myself and my situation in the present moment, because my condition is always lurking around. I've already tried meditation but I never seem to get good results from it. My goal is to not struggle against myself and life, but to flow with it, like water. Relaxed, happy and content. Does anyone have tips or can someone relate to my situation? I'm looking particularly for tips how to tackle negative thoughts by finding their cause, not by thinking positive and struggle against them. Thanks for reading."

It's a default. It's easy to fall into and hard to climb out of. It's a black hole that is, at once, both comforting and invasive. Depression is pervasive. It sits quietly in my background until I'm vulnerable. Depression takes advantage of my vulnerability before I even realize that I've made room for it. Depression tells me, ""come to bed; sleep me away."" It prefers me to itself, alone. I crawl into bed with it and feel like I will never want to come out. I withdraw from everything and everyone: from my family, my friends, my husband, my dogs, my responsibilities, myself. I become a part of depression as much as it becomes a part of me. So I resist it, as best I can. This feels safest. To step anywhere near it makes me feel too weak; too vulnerable and too easily manipulated. I distract. I refuse to feel. If emotion is a boat sailing on a sea, I jump ship. I want no part of it. This reaction has become almost immediate. I find myself, now that I realize how out of touch I am with my emotions, having to search intently to gain some idea of what I might be feeling."
420,vulnerability,depression,Concerning Me,2,3nm5y8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3nm5y8/concerning_me/,2015-10-06 06:59:18,"In honour of Mental Illness awareness week, I wrote and submitted a piece to a local news column. Reading so many lovely emotional stories helps me realize how many of us suffer. I am encouraging everyone to break the stigma and share their story, because it's worth telling, and I'll always listen. Concerning Me. Ive been battling various forms of depression and anxiety for a large portion of my 25 years on this planet. My journey has taken me away from a small university town in my home province of Nova Scotia, to the big, busy and beautiful city of Vancouver. As a child, I was picked on and name called, words like fat, ugly, gay, homo, etc. Many of these words came from my friends at the time as well, leaving me with a tainted definition of friendship, one I continue to struggle with at times. My parents separated when I was 10, while I didnt and dont blame myself, Im sure there is some lasting effect. My self- confidence and self-image has been mostly negative for as long as I can remember, in part to experiences during my formative years no doubt. Adolescence was filled with typical teenage drama, but I wasnt the kid who was overly noticeable, and got along with most everybody. I never went to parties and drank, but would spend time with friends playing video games or playing sports. The one time I did drink I got caught, that kind of kid. I went through high school largely worry free and happy. Had a job, was in a relationship, getting good grades, ready for university. I went to the same school as my then girlfriend, pursuing my interest in physics. Four years later, I had a chemistry degree, the relationship had ended, my grandmother had passed away and my grandfather had been diagnosed with leukemia. Suffice to say, life happened, things change. Now what? I really enjoyed several chemistry courses and enjoyed the work Id done, so my next logical step was grad school. The first year went smoothly, I took my courses, worked in the department, met new friends through various gaming outlets and other societies. I dated, fell in and out of love, but nothing ever got very serious. My grandfather passed away after surviving much longer than the 4 months first predicted. This sparked a deep depression which has lurked within me ever since. In a way, I lost the balance in my life. My love for science became tainted with my lost interest in my education. I lost the work/play balance that I had maintained so strongly before. I lost any sense of accomplishment, and felt like a failure for having an attitude as such. It kept feeding; every single negative became a negative for something else. Some days, it still does. From days alone, inside, crying on the shower floor, to facebook conversations about wanting to die, to utter breakdowns to those I felt closest, I couldnt help but feel like a drain, as my suffering was difficult to watch I inferred. I felt like a failure, daily tasks felt impossible, as did work, and my thesis, all building upon a feeling of failure. The depression ate away. Except, and this is why I feel I was a drain, I wasnt failing anything or anyone, I was constantly moving forward. But I was really struggling, and I felt helpless, and whenever I had felt helpless before in life, my grandfather knew how to help. Sometimes it is really difficult to ask for help when you arent quite sure what you need. Hell, even if you know what you want or need, its difficult to ask at all, pride, anxiety and vulnerability all play a role.. As I write and try to tell this story, I keep getting upset and frustrated at myself, feeling that same notion of failure. I need to breathe. Thinking about what parts are missing or how much is too much, analyzing every last aspect, somehow I can never be satisfied with myselfIve always needed to be better. And now, more than ever I need to be so, as I struggle with mental illness, unemployment, lingering thesis corrections and a need for attention. No, actually I just need to BE. Its so awful to set goals, like writing this article or applying for one job, and falling short. I feel disabled, even though I know I possess every skill necessary to succeed, adding to that defeated feeling. There is never an upside with depression, things dont feel like they are getting better, even though things arent either good or bad, they just are. Im hurting inside, self-defeated, anxious, heart-broken and lonely. I want to get that hurt out, and throw it away, or share it with the world. I need someone to take that hurt away, we all do. Ive met and continue to meet amazing people, who are slowly helping to strip away those negative feelings, while I do my best to protect them. Theyve become my comfort zone of sorts, even though it is in no way comfortable. I worry about what people think of me, and validate myself as such. I struggle letting go, certain things are worth holding on to. I make myself vulnerable and probably get taken advantage of. I procrastinate, and it makes me feel guilty. I cry, almost on the verge of tears almost all of the time, craving the warmth of a hug, or a pat on the back, even though either would probably make me cry. I seek to provide people with something because I cant fathom what else about me people may value. I constantly compare myself to others, a really bad thing to do, I know. I wonder if Ill ever date again. I want so badly to feel like my story is worth telling, but who wants to hear a story about this? I mean, I guess I would, but I enjoy taking on the emotions of others, especially the negative ones, and challenging them. So how do I do that with myself? Im not quite sure right now, just making it up as I go. Zack O'Toole"

Or a valid reason to.,10,3p7tt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3p7tt3/i_dont_think_i_have_the_energy_to_keep_trying_or/,2015-10-18 22:31:53,"**Disclaimer:** Wall of text ahead. I've lurked this sub for some time, I feel dirty posting my problems when I've done so little to help others here - but I rarely feel anything I have to say would be constructive. But I care enough about y'all to spill my guts, so that's something I guess? To hell with making a throwaway, I barely know anyone. With that out of the way, actual content - apologies if it turns into a non sequitur ramble, there's a lot of ground to cover. So 2 years ago as a straight early-20s male in a committed relationship with an early-20s female, I was abducted and sexually assaulted by a man in his 60s. This is by and large the easiest way I can think of to destroy an otherwise happy human being, I would not endorse it as a lifestyle enhancer. I wasn't convinced I had a strong enough case to prosecute, nor did I want to speak of it to anyone at first, so I naively decided to... hell I don't even know what my plan was - the man was a work colleague, not like I could just pretend it never happened. I was talked around to contacting the police; they were amazing, but words cannot describe the vulnerability of handing over: **detailed** information, clothing, ""samples"" and so forth. The investigation dragged, and dragged, and dragged. Which I found equal parts surprising and infuriating, given that he did not claim the acts hadn't happened, but simply claimed there was consent. The case was only actually closed **very** recently (no dates as court listings are public, and I'd rather not be identified). I was referred to a therapist for some time during this 2 years - it was an unusual experience, I would recommend it - I could never pin down any particular thing that had changed but generally felt a little better when I left. After some progress, she dropped an ultimatum. ""This **will** change your life, as strange as it sounds you must make something positive out of this, or it will consume you"". With a slightly improved outlook, I enrolled to finally do my last year of Uni. In the interim waiting for Uni to start up again, I started going back to work, after ~6 months off sick with anxiety and depression. As far as work goes, I reintegrated well, a few setbacks and weeks off when I got bad news from the courts, but generally it was business as usual. Once September rolled around, I had to balance work and studying. Things were looking good, I was handling it amazingly - while taking on overtime for more money I was also on track for a 1st. The illusion here is that I was ""cured"", but instead I was merely coping. Home life was a more realistic perception; frequent suicidal tendencies and dissociation. By December my long-since-dying relationship became dead. It probably should have finished much sooner, but that's another matter. I finally decided it wasn't worth saving when she told me she didn't love me any more, but was worried if she left I'd be a danger to myself. Incensed at having a carer instead of a partner, I called it quits. My therapist's words echoed all the more at this point, I **had** to see the positives in this, or I'd be fucked. I enjoyed the freedom, no walking on egg shells, that kind of thing. I was content being alone, despite coming out of a ~7 year relationship. Not happy, but happier than being in a perpetually failing relationship. Nobody wants the emotionally unstable rape victim of course, so I began to mentally prepare for a life of contented solitude... prematurely it would appear. By chance and dumb luck I became reacquainted with an old friend/previous girlfriend. I know she frequents this sub but I'm hoping this post slips under the radar. If you see this, just pretend you didn't I guess? We started hanging out as friends, quickly becoming more than that. We both fell prettymadlydeeply before long, it was beautiful. I **believed** that my ship was finally coming in, so to speak. There were problems, given her polyamorous nature to my monogamous, combined with my general anxiety, coming across as ultra needy at times. It was worth fighting for though, I wouldn't consider that kind of relationship with anyone else, but I had to give this chance meeting a chance, even if I had to be more open minded. We had amazing times together, a holiday which she thanked me for as ""the best week of her life"". It was mine too, for sure. We went to see the singer who we bonded over as teens, neither having seen him live before. All good so far. About 5 months in, it's getting harder to see each other. She's busy, or needs time alone. Not a huge issue, she's always been more of a loner than me. The problem being, previously she'd miss me, and try to make later plans when **now** was no good. Here it became more of a ""not today, try again another time"". I tried to respect the space, but only got more anxious. Eventually we came to the old favourite, ""we need to talk"" moment. I came prepared to address problems like trust, space, etc - mentally ready to save this amazing relationship. What actually happened is she explained that the whole thing was a fantasy, which in reality can't live up to expectation - and **surely** I can see it too or I'm kidding myself. All the while she seems devoid of emotion, we have a one sided heartfelt goodbye and I begin to realise she probably didn't love me in the first place, but was enjoying the experience for a while at least. The uncertainty is killing me, I can't let go. So far so good, rape, breakup, breakup. Fair enough, at least there's cause for hope again - the case is closed and I won, right? Everyone tells me just how good I must be feeling to finally be through this and be able to get on with my life. First and foremost, it doesn't **fucking** end there. It doesn't end, period. But there is a more important, more sinister angle here. Putting that fucker in prison was my **primary motivation** for living, my reason to keep going. Now it's all over, I've won. And I have nothing left in light of everything else going tits up. Living with parents, have a degree that I'm frightened to use in case I fail, working the same shit job that doesn't pay enough to move out - catch 22. This time around I'm not comfortable being alone; I was (am) so lovestruck I can't imagine living any other way. We're now on day 2 of missed work, I sense a big regression incoming. I don't expect many/any to wade through all of this, but I hoped it would be cathartic to write all the same. For anyone wanting to save some time: **TL;DR** Got raped, struggled through legal proceedings for 2 years. Thought I was going to be okay though, found hope in a new relationship - but it failed. Winning the case was my last reason to live, now I don't even have that."

I (24M) just started on antidepressants two weeks ago after being in a really dark place for 3-4 years. So far they've just made me feel like I can do things again, but up until this point I hadn't really felt anything in the way of emotion. I was on a 16 hour road trip alone yesterday and about 6 hours into it I got into some really bad traffic. I drive long distances a lot and it never gets to me, its really just a long relaxing (if boring) drive. This time though, I started getting..really worked up. I don't know how to describe it. After two hours of almost not moving, I was borderline panicked. I had to pull off the highway and go sit in a parking lot. I ended up calling my Mother to calm me down and CRIED afterwords. I haven't cried in probably six years. I'm just really confused right now. I got really worked up over nothing and kind of broke down. I'll admit..I felt really relieved after crying, but it's left me with this weird sense of vulnerability. This wouldn't have been such a big deal if I wasn't six hours from home, but I was too nervous to keep going so I turned around and drove back. I don't really know what I'm asking, but does anyone have any experiences similar to this? I just want to know that this is normal, because I really have no frame of reference anymore.

I've been having romantic relationships since I was very young (nothing traumatic) but they all seem to fizzle out fairly quickly for me. Towards the end of the honey-moon phase and when I'm really getting into it with someone and we're learning about each other... I get to the point where I start to resent all their quirks and shortcomings and even redeeming qualities turn into negative ones. I've been with my current girlfriend for 6 months. I haven't spoken to her in about a week. Nothing has really happened between us. I just stopped talking to her unless she texted me. She's obviously not happy with what's going on. But i don't know what to do? I'm constantly concocting this long list of seemingly petty reasons to break up with her. I'll spend days feeling really negative about the relationship. How it almost feels like a chore to even text her. I never think about her. I only think about myself and what I need to get done for the day or week. I start resenting my own girlfriend. Is this my depression? Am I removed, irritated and resentful because this relationship is making me break out of my routine and show vulnerability to someone finally? To care about someone other than myself? Why am I so exhausted of what we have going already? On top of all of this because of all of these shitty thoughts that i have. I think to myself, ""You should break up with her not for all these reasons you've been thinking but because you're even thinking these things. Stop wasting her time. Stop trying to force yourself to change. You are not broken. There are a million different types of relationships to be had. Maybe a somewhat traditional relationship just isn't for you and you need something different."""

I always try to be at least a semihappy person with all the horrible jokes I can come up with and try to make people laugh but as typical, it can also help me hide my negative feelings. The more people there are, the easier it is to hide it. I'm not used to showing negative feelings. It makes me feel strange and scared to be vulnerable like that under someone's eyes. I can talk about it later on, sure, but at the moment of the vulnerability, the thought of showing it feels terrifying. It needs to be a really safe person and the few safe people I have are rarely there. I also feel bothered when people ask if everything is okay. Most of the time right now I would rather be six feet underground. I know I'm not that old and no, I'm not planning to commit suicide or so since my life seems to get on a safe rail. I just want to get rid of this feeling but I feel like I can't. Even writing this makes me feel shitty but I really hope it would make me feel a little bit better when I'm done with it.

430,vulnerability,depression,I'm tired of sorting out my feelings... but here goes.,2,3hzids,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3hzids/im_tired_of_sorting_out_my_feelings_but_here_goes/,2015-08-23 03:08:32,"Hey, guys, I've never posted anyplace before, but after a particularly bad experience with the psychiatrist today... I just guess I have no place else to go. I don't even know how to wade through all of the stuff that's going on in my brain, much less sounding less whiny and obnoxious, but, here goes. I'm 18, currently in college, and I feel that I've had depression for around two years, and I don't think I have any social support. My parents tell me to 'Get a part-time job, it'll help you take your mind off things' and 'Exercise, because all the energy you have is going to your brain.' and I have a rather strained relationship with them; I feel very uncomfortable showing any vulnerability or kindness to them for some reason, but I have persuaded them to make an appointment with a psychiatrist, which they have, but it didn't help because we couldn't communicate effectively. I don't have a lot of friends in college either - I don't know how to talk to them, and I've become increasingly distrustful of other people after many bad experiences with them (long stories), to the point of unjustified hostility and paranoia. The few I do have... I'm not very close, so I keep on pretending I'm happy in front of them. My old friends... they've been too busy with school and college work, and I don't want to disturb them. I did talk to a friend today though, but all he said was 'Maybe you should try chanting, it helps a lot.' I refused him, the next thing he said was 'I have to go, bye.' I've met lots of friends like this before, who try to convert me to their religion when they hear about my struggles, but... it just doesn't help. All I do nowadays is do things to distract myself. Going to college worked, for some reason, up until I feel isolated once more and end up feeling the same. I sometimes go out by myself to watch movies, or spend my money on useless things, but there are times where I can't even find the energy to get out of bed. So, nowadays, I just sit at home and go online for 19 hours a day, until I lose sleep. I've tried calling suicide hotlines to talk to, but the people there... one said that she doesn't 'feel so good around me' because of my American accent, another blocked my number after I called them too many times. I've even went to a psychiatrist last year where he asked my father about my age and promptly said 'I don't deal with kids. Kids can't have depression.' He only prescribed me with some anti-depressants when I started talking in a threatening way, but he didn't even diagnose me with depression. Right now, I feel really trapped because I can't find any support. I've lost interest in what I used to love doing; I constantly criticize and compare my drawings to others', and that's only when I can even muster up the energy to draw. I feel numb and tired, but, for some reason, I can't cry. It's like this calm echo of sadness and despair, but much more louder. I just feel that my life has no purpose, aside from the need to please others. I just constantly fluctuate between blaming the people around me and my environment, and loathing and telling myself that there's nothing wrong with them, I'm the one with the problem, which is why everyone either hates me or takes me as a joke. I'm tired of playing the victim to gain sympathy from others, and this post is no exception, and I hope I can get help to take charge of my life once more. I've entertained the thought of running away from home and walking the world. Perhaps it'll make me learn some humility, while getting away from the people that I despise, a strong word, but I mean it when I say it. I'm sorry if this post gets confusing at times, but I am currently overwhelmed with so many thoughts going through my mind currently."
431,vulnerability,depression,Kinda looking for someone to validate that I have reason to be depressed and give me a little support in a rough time (18m),1,3i9bp8,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3i9bp8/kinda_looking_for_someone_to_validate_that_i_have/,2015-08-25 08:26:59,"Usually I like to stay on the more optimistic subs. I checkout /r/howtonotgiveafuck, /r/stoicism, and /r/malelifestyle pretty much everyday, which I consider to be better than nothing since its a form of self-improvement, but I shy away from confronting the problem that I'm depressed and I have been for just about as long as I remember. Every now and then I'll stumble upon /r/depression or /r/raisedbynarcacissts and bawl my eyes out for a while and then spend the next few days feeling shitty. I workout daily and take antidepressants, I eat fairly well and try to meditate and journal and read about neuroscience and happiness, but at the end of the day all those only do so much. I think I'm coming to the conclusion that I have to confront the underlying reasons for my depression. When i was growing up my parents really didn't care about me. I've always been pretty smart and my mom has claimed that as her doing and has always paraded my around to her peers, belittling my achievements and claiming them as hers. She's a textbook narcissist. To make things worse she's a psychologist so I feel like I must be full of shit since she is more qualified in this area. My dad's has maybe told me two or three times in my whole life that he loves me, and I don't think he's ever told me he's proud of me. I've always felt judged in my house and I've had my problems belittled for as long as i can remember. I never really had friends when i was little, partly because I was just awkward, but I also feel like my parents should have pushed me out of my shell a bit more. The long-and-short of all this is that I've felt depressed for as long as I remember. Maybe that's just me projecting my current feelings on my early years, but I do remember being unhappy as early and pre-school and I can remember thinking life would be easier if i killed myself in elementary school. I feel like kind of a dick saying all this when other went through way worse as kids, but I feel like my childhood wasn't exactly on the positive end of the spectrum. I started running Cross Country and Track when i got into high school and that's when things started to get better. I realized i was funny and started to make friends who excepted my difficulties. The competition also helped my improve my self-esteem, and I had a big crush that inspired me to start making myself a better person. My brother is a heroin addict, and has been since I was around 12. And for whatever reason I feel like it hasn't really messed with me that much. I guess I just desensitized myself to it so fast. I've also got a cousin that died from a heroin overdose, and a couple of alcoholics. I leave for college 10 hours away from home on Monday. (I busted my ass through high school to earn a scholarship at a school a long way from my parents so I won't have to see/rely on them) I feel like this is my opportunity to seek real help without feeling judged by my parents. I've also talked to my girlfriend and we've decided that even though neither of us want to we're gonna break-up just cause a long-distance relationship just seems destined to fail. I told her a lot of stuff i was always afraid to tell anyone, and my feeling of self-worth was really tied into our relationship. I'm also leaving behind the group of friends that took me in and taught me to socialize well when I was at the peak of my awkwardness and social anxiety. I don't really know exactly what this post is for, probably just to vent more than anything. That said I feel like i haven't been through enough to really be depressed and I feel like I'm just kind of emotionally weak. I'm also trying to work on my vulnerability in preparation of hopefully getting some cbt while I'm away from home. I know more or less what I've got to do to keep getting better, and I've gotten pretty good at staying positive so I've got hope for the future, I'ts just gonna be a long process. "
432,vulnerability,depression,An attempt to get it all out,1,3ii7ht,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3ii7ht/an_attempt_to_get_it_all_out/,2015-08-27 05:41:33,"Things have been difficult for almost as long as I can remember. Mostly I remember the yelling. My mom always had a problem with the way that I dressed or what book I wanted to read or how I was loading the cookie dough onto the cookie sheet. A constant, unceasing barrage of insults and criticism. I grew a little. Boys liked me now. There was one, Justin, who would send me notes under the table in second grade. Can I kiss you? Yes or No, it would say. I never answered. What was I supposed to say? At the time I wore a pair of boys black pants with pockets that were too large. I wanted to be a boy so badly back then. I didnt want to kiss anyone. That kid came over to my house with a knife one day. He asked me to take off my pants. He tried to stick his flaccid penis inside me. I laid there, mostly dead. He was frustrated with his droopy member, so he cut me across the stomach. It didnt hurt but I was startled. I dont remember anything after that. If Mom hits me again, I swear Ill kill myself. I swear it. Shell rue the day she drove me to death! ... Except that I dont want to die. What do you do when you dont want to die? I grew a little more still. I beat up the boys as much as I could. They would try to play me in soccer but I was better. I kicked a kid named Bradley between his legs on purpose because he was making fun of me. I lied about it to the aid on the playground. She didnt believe me. I guess she knew I was violent, even then. Mom wont stop hitting me. I hate her. I want to kill her. I grew into a young woman, much to my dislike. Full breasts and a teenage body. Yay. A month after I told my boyfriend I loved him, he broke up with me. Two months later I find myself on my living room floor rolling around with Tim from Biology class. He was bigger and stronger. I told him I was on my period but he stuck his hand in my pants anyway. He tried to pull them off of my legs but I told him he should kill me first. That made him want to leave. Driving home your would be rapist is demoralizing. She spit on me today. In public. At the river with the dogs. Who does that? If I push her in maybe shell drown. And NOW! We jumped. I could feel his hand in mine. I was happy he came with me to the river that day. But all that stopped when he never popped back up. I used to think I killed him. Now I dont know what to think. You should be around 120, he said. I think to myself, How Im supposed to lose 25 pounds in order for this person to accept me? I still said yes though when he asked me to marry him.

433,vulnerability,depression,My turning point in front of 300 hundred of my peers and a lesson in vulnerability,2,3cdc2f,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3cdc2f/my_turning_point_in_front_of_300_hundred_of_my/,2015-07-07 10:55:45,"A little bit of background first: About a year ago, my friend and I gave a TEDx talk at our university about our experiences with depression and our attempt to give a voice to mental illness. (Here's the link if you're interested: URL That was the first time either of us had thought about publicly addressing our day-to-day struggles, and leading up to it, we wondered if we were ready to share such intimate experiences with an audience. The response we received extinguished any doubts. People came up to us afterwards to tell us how brave we were (which I still deny as bravery.) I didn't feel judged as being weak or damaged. The biggest impact, however, came in the form of people who said that our decision to speak prompted them to open up to their friends. That still strikes a chord with me. In turn, it made me more open about my depression. It's surprising how many people share their story once you demonstrate vulnerability. Partly because of that, the past year has been stable beyond belief. For once I feel secure in what's going on. I'm not writing this to brag or to say that I've 'overcome' depression. Hell no. I still freak out about stuff at times and fall into whirlwinds of self-destructive thoughts. Rather, I wanted to share how surprised I was when I found out I could open share so much of what I held in common with so many others. And yeah, I know it sounds as sappy as hell. I doubt there's some universal lesson to be taken from this. If anything, my experience was a time in my life when some of the convictions I held within my depression were stuck down by evidence that was hard to refute. If that idea helps any of you at all, then that's the most I could ask for. I just wanted to share something that played a integral role in my ability to live with my depression. Peace. "

For a while now, I've been experiencing depressive episodes about a couple times a week and most of them are regarding how vulnerable our lives are. In the news I keep hearing about how people just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time... And then I just think to myself, what if that happens to me? Is there even a point of going to College if I can die anytime? Is there a point in making friends if I never know for how low I will even be there for? And then sometimes I get very anxious. I love my family and I could never do anything to hurt them. But what if I died because I was at the wrong place at the wrong time? It would destroy their lives. At this point, I am scared to go places and travel because I think it's to risky. I don't know why I think this way and I don't think like this all the times but sometimes it just makes me extremely sad. I don't expect anyone to respond to this but I just had to write it out once.

I think the information which he explains in this book might be relevant to people who identify as having depression. It certainly is for me. I'm going to put some excerpts from it here in this post for those who may not have access to this book, or to encourage you to purchase it if you do have access to books like this. I. **ABOUT THE ""Inner Child"" AND THE ""Inner Critic""** *The Inner Child responds to energies rather than words *Your Inner Critic was born to protect your Inner Child. Its role was to help you fit in, to conform to the world around you. *At some point the Inner Critic grows beyond its original boundaries &amp; takes on an uncontrollable life of its own. Now you have within you an abuser, and a major part of you that is being battered by its endless, and seemingly justified abuse is your Inner Child. *This creates intense psychic pain. II. **MORE INFO ABOUT HOW THE ""Inner Critic"" FUNCTIONS** *In some cases, the Inner Critic is actually unable to rest until some punishment has been received. Some actual physical suffering or great emotional pain is required. *Then the Critic is relieved. It knows that it has done its job, and it has peace for a short while. *Critics vary in how powerful they are. *We often refer to them as lightweight, middleweight, and heavyweight. *We have not seen many lightweights. *The more severe the abuse we suffer in our early life, the more likely it is that we have a heavyweight Inner Critic III. **ABOUT ""Killer Critics""** *At some point in the heavyweight category, the quality of the Inner Critic shifts. *One cannot be humorous with this type of Critic. *One cannot talk about underlying vulnerability or anxiety with this type of Critic. *This type of Critic hates us and wants us dead. *These Critics must be treated with the utmost respect. There are good reasons for why they are as angry and as vicious as they are. *It takes longer to find out why they hate so deeply. *It takes a great deal of patience, strength, and skill on the part of the therapist. *It is absolutely possible to become aware of, to separate from, and to change a Killer Critic. It just takes a little more work. I'll leave it at that. Hope this has been helpful to some. Note all of these quotes come from chapters 8 and 9 from the book mentioned above. Peace. "
437,vulnerability,depression,I mean this with the utmost sincerity-- could someone please tell me something I haven't heard before?,1,39l4cn,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/39l4cn/i_mean_this_with_the_utmost_sincerity_could/,2015-06-13 00:16:10,"If I could condense all the conversations I've had with people trying to help me get over my depression/anxiety (and/or trying to motivate me), it'd go something like this: * Me: I'm really depressed, and I have terrible anxiety. * Them: You should talk to your doctor or go see a therapist/psychiatrist * Me: I tried that many times. It never worked very well, and in some cases it made my situation worse. * Them: You should keep trying, though. * Me: I would, but my mental health has gotten so bad recently that I can barely do anything without feeling as if I'm going to have a nervous breakdown/panic attack. I'm emotionally sensitive to almost everything. * Them: But you have to be willing to take that risk. * Me: No, it's not worth it. Talking about my problems hasn't helped for the last four years I've been trying it and prescription medication has been a colossal failure. I'm not going to go out of my way to possibly compromise my mental state to try something that repeatedly fails. * Them: There's nothing you can think of that can put you in a state of mind where you could maybe handle taking that risk? * Me: Maybe if I had a girlfriend or something. Before I moved out, my dad always told me I was visibly much happier when I was with someone. * Them: You can't think of *anything* else? Nothing else makes you happy enough that it can mitigate your emotional vulnerability? * Me: Not really. * Them: So go find a girlfriend. * Me: But I need psychological stability and/or emotional willpower to get a girlfriend. And I need a girlfriend to get psychological stability and/or emotional willpower. I'm trapped in a Catch 22. And then at that point, we just go in circles. People always tell me I'm too negative, that I worry too much, that I make excuses to not do things (namely the ""I won't risk a panic attack"" excuse), and that I have too many ""Yeah, but"" responses to their suggestions. When I tell them that maybe they're wrong, that I'm not making excuses, and that maybe it really isn't worth it for me to actually try what they suggest, they call bullshit and imply (or sometimes outright say) that I'm being or acting weak and that I could easily do it if I just did it. Basically, if someone could convince me that I'm wrong, and that I *could* just do it if I wanted to, that'd be cool. Or if someone could give me advice other than ""just do it,"" that would be fine, too. Also, one more thing, just so you don't think I'm being completely baseless-- I went to get a haircut this morning, and the barber I go to is a cool dude. I called his cell to see if he had opened yet, and he sort of curtly asked ""Who's this?"" That alone had a strong (negative) emotional effect on me, as if I thought my world was going to come crashing down around me because he used a bit of a tone with me before he even knew it was me on the phone. I still have that ""Tears welling up"" feeling from when that happened (which I experience often), but I haven't actually cried (although it feels like I should be, I guess). That's pretty much what I deal with regularly. Any small, seemingly meaningless occurrence can take a profound toll on my emotional state. I like to compare it to hemophilia, where a small cut can cause a person to bleed profusely because their blood doesn't clot (I think that's how it works). And the thing is, whenever I do anything other than just sit in my room doing nothing, I feel like I'm walking through razor wire (and that's no exaggeration, I promise)."

I've gotten closer to my friend's dad which offers more guidance and for that I'm grateful. The other day, I was telling him how I felt guilty and lonely all the time. The guiltyness is an attribute of me not being able to ignore insults, but the loneliness comes from something more overwhelming that has everything to do with my upbringing. I'm strange in the way I'm a very open person and most people love that and grow quickly attached to me. It's nothing I'm not used to and always confused me. I'd find out even though I'm very open, i have a lot of emotional guards and it's very difficult to make me feel both vulnerable and loved. This may explain why when i have a crush, it's a race to find out how crazy they are before i get too deeply involved with them. He tells me I assume the worst in people. Easy solution is learn to be vulnerable and the loneliness will go away. The reason that is so difficult for me is because in the past year, the few people I have gotten vulnerable and emotionally connected to have intentionally hurt me and taken advantage of me and i knew i should have listen to my gut. The other part of vulnerability is the risk of getting hurt and I'm really tired of getting hurt and the loneliness gets worse when i get dissapointed by someone.

439,vulnerability,depression,My story of depression and Pixar's Inside Out,15,3bcmbt,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3bcmbt/my_story_of_depression_and_pixars_inside_out/,2015-06-28 09:12:22,"I apologize for the long post and the grammatical errors. English is not my first language. Minneapolis June 25, 2015 Home Thursday evening yet the sun was still beating down on the hot asphalt, I came home to accept defeat. I left this place seven years ago eager to find my place in life, only to return hollow, empty, and bone-tired.  numb. In that seven years Ive accomplished a lot. I graduated from college, made friends, fell in love. I failed classes to learn the lesson of perseverance (or that I should just stick with science instead of trying my hands at music). I trusted so that I could comprehend the lesson of letting someone in and others go. And I loved deeply and completely to understand the phrase Time heals all wound. Next year, I have a beautiful job lining up, an apartment to decorate to my heart content, and another chapter of my life to start writing. I do have a lot to be thankful for. I know that. Yet at the moment none of that mattered. Looking at designs for my new home, I tried to look inside myself for some flicker of emotion, to feel something, and came up empty. Filling my head right now is the pain of rejection and the bitterness of deception and mistrust. Somewhere in the midst of that jumble of emotions the inability to let go of the past, the hope, though false as it is, that if I cling on hard enough I might be happy as I once was again. Those voices, those feelings grew louder and louder with each day and then all of a sudden stopped, leaving in their wake a black hole sucking in every kind of enthusiasm, excitement, sadness, disgust, fear, and anger Ive ever felt. All I could sense was numbness. And as I watched the movie Inside Out, it was my struggle, my failure, my hurt and pain displayed on the big screen and emerged in its core the idea that spoke to me the most: loss and vulnerability. Pixars Inside Out portrayed the idea of change and loss so poignantly as Riley struggles to come to terms with her family moving halfway across the country. All her joyful core memories built in Minnesota were beginning to tinge with sadness and she resisted. Oh how the emotions inside her mind resisted. Her pain was hidden away in the circle of sadness, her mind filled with excitement and a little dash of nervousness. Our girl Riley was brave, to smile despite her sadness, to see the positive in midst of all the wrong things that came her way. Yet underneath that brave smile of her lies a world of hurt. As Riley cried in front of her new classmates recounting her beautiful happy time in Minnesota and the recognition in her eyes that that part of her life was the past, I quietly wiped the tears rolling down my face in the darkened movie theater. I understood the pain that was so crippling yet cathartic as you let yourself embrace the sadness of beginning to grasp the idea of letting the past go. As the story progressed, taking us on a colorful journey across Rileys mind, some was funny and childish, some was scary, some was bittersweet, and some was downright heart-breaking, every one of us in the audience went on another journey in our own mind, of our own past, our own sub-consciousness. Thats another beautiful aspect of this movie. And at the same time, in headquarters, Riley has lost her grip on her emotions and was bombarded with a barrage of emotions. She was confused, hurt, and unable to find her way out. Her control panel was greyed out. She cannot respond to her own emotions. It was only at the end, when Joy let Sadness embrace all of Rileys core memories, to permeate them with the understanding of letting the past go that Riley was able to come out of her numbness. Thats what vulnerability is, to reach out a hand for help as you embrace the sadness in you, hoping that people at the other end will reach back to share your pain, to help you overcoming the hurt that you are feeling. It was poetic how it was the family island that helped Joy and Sadness get back to headquarters, just as it was Rileys family that held their hands out, reaching back to help her reconcile with the changes in her life. The moment attests to how brave Riley is, because being vulnerable is hard. It is the trust that the person you reach out to will reach back. It is risking that chance of falling further into that abyss of numbness that might very well consume you. And only in that moment of vulnerability can Riley find comfort... ... and joy. After seven long years, I came home to Minnesota because I was hurt and the hurt was becoming too much for me to bear. I came home to find my personality islands, one in particular, the one I thought I lost by leaving so many years ago. Waiting for me outside was my sister, her smile sunny and her eyes full of concern. And greeting me at home was my adopted family. My dad with his worn Voyager Brewery cap welcomed me in his gruff reserved measured tone. My mom enveloped me in such a warm hug that made my eyes water. In the backyard, my adopted sister was happily mowing the lawn, sunshine bouncing off her long blond hair doing its merry dance. The moment she saw me, she skipped up the deck and made a beeline straight toward me. Close to her heels was Rudy the dog, his 100-lb body bouncing up, tails wagging in earnest. Somewhere nearby, Willow, our cat, lazily strolled over, checking to see what was causing all the ruckus. And I knew I was lucky. I knew that whatever happens, this core memory, this island of mine is still standing. This is the story of me, finding my way back to headquarters. tl;dr: Story of how I got lost in my depression and finding my way back to headquarters. "
440,vulnerability,depression,Uncomfortable truth verified by years of personal experience,0,37mo7t,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/37mo7t/uncomfortable_truth_verified_by_years_of_personal/,2015-05-29 05:19:45,"It doesn't matter if you're intelligent, hard-working, talented, empathetic or any number of other positive attributes. It doesn't matter how highly the people who know you personally might value you or how many things you've accomplished that that show your skill, dedication and potential. If you're born poor, the incompetence and disinterest of the bureaucrats, management class and government systems that hold ultimate power over you will ensure that you will have a slim-to-none chance at basic survival, much less any hope for ""upward mobility"" into a middle class that no longer exists. In the modern age, those who come from ""humble beginnings"" have their general course in life economically determined for them by years of capitalistic wisdom and entrenched policy. Your vulnerability works to their advantage and the general response is to charge the poor additional fees for their poverty and failure to conjure arbitrary sums of money as needed. Rational thought does not apply. There is no valid reason why anyone should take a chance on you. Cases where these principles do not hold are rare and it is statistically unlikely that you would be among them no matter what you do. OWS gave me a slight twinge of hope back in ~2012 but it fizzled out quickly as I realized that ""awareness"" is meaningless and that most people will revert to unflinchingly believing in our meritocracy with a sort of religious conviction (i.e. in the absence of all evidence to the contrary.) At the end of the day, the truth is too painful for them to face for more than a few seconds at a time. Of all the 'truisms' you've heard, the ones in the family of ""you have to have money to make money,"" ""it's not what you know, it's who you know,"" and ""you have to put your money to work for you"" are the most accurate. If you begin with nothing, there is most likely nothing to be done. You should concentrate on resigning yourself to life devoid of dignity and understanding that your overall goal will always remain desperately trying to validate your existence to those whose implicit job is to select who will survive as a valued members of society and who will be left to struggle and fail. Otherwise, feel free to kill yourself, secure in the knowledge that in all likelihood, no amount of personal effort would have been sufficient to secure you a livable life and that the probability of improving your situation significantly in the future is akin to winning the lottery: astronomically unlikely; technically possible but not a question of effort or merit. Starry-eyed optimists have rarely-to-never faced actual adversity and their advice does not apply to you. What they consider to be ""hard times"" in their lives are often nothing compared to the dehumanization you face in your every day experience. You should avoid the temptation to fall into the false hope offered by those who point at statistical anomalies as though you have some conscious control over whether you could possibly become one yourself. I'm on your side but I'm powerless like you and my prospects are grim in spite of my efforts and accomplishments. This is all meant as tough love. Those who are willing to help will be unable to do so and those who are able will be unwilling and disinterested, as a general rule. I wish someone had had the courage to tell me these things so that I could have faced the reality of the world sincerely instead of filling me with false hope and giving me an unjustified sense of personal value only to have it all gradually erode away as I came to terms with what life actually is. My origins and subsequent personal history proceeding inevitably from them, have left me emotionally scarred and have indelibly marked me as a worthless, broken animal with no place in society. Only investors are fully-fledged humans now. I hope you can do better than I have at finding some personal peace, self-acceptance and survival within this framework. Try to keep in mind that it has nothing to do with you personally; it's the just the way things are. You're probably wonderful, but that's simply not what anyone is looking for anymore. It's a numbers game and the initial conditions at your birth determine almost everything about your place within it. You're not a person to those in control, you're a paper trail to be assessed and dismissed at their leisure. Finally, your only remaining chance lies in keeping this understanding to yourself and presenting yourself as an unflappable optimist outwardly at all times. Of any given personal trait that might yet help you out of your situation, profound ignorance is chief among them. You have a much better chance of finding your way among the monied by supporting and enabling their delusions and denying the wanton waste of human life that is now occurring en-mass. This is the core of the ""positive attitude"" that you've likely heard so much about. Cultivate a distorted worldview and stop trying to change the world, for your own sake. Maintain the thin illusion for yourself that life is not a competition of all-against-all and avoid idealistic thinking as much as you can."

It was excruciating to watch my former husband descend into mental illness and not know where to turn or who to ask for help. The unexpected gift of writing on this topic is that people now share their most closely held stories with me; they are vulnerable and open, recounting life experiences that aren't generally water cooler talk. After hearing about my book, the big burly guy who sat next to me on an airplane told me in detail about his brother, an Iraq war veteran, who suffers from PTSD so severely he sweats through his sheets every night. ""He served three tours,"" the man said, ""and he's still at war."" A hairdresser told me about her battle with postpartum depression, and how, after months of seizures she believed were caused by anti-depressants, she attempted to take her life. If her baby hadn't crawled in the bedroom as she was downing a bottle of pills, she says, she likely wouldn't have found her way to recovery. An older gentleman listened quietly to my brief description of the book and then whispered, ""You young people are so brave. I've never told anyone about my depression."" I smiled and said, ""I've never told anyone else I'm not young."" We shared a good laugh. One in five Americans suffers from a mental health disorder. But, those numbers don't hint at the tens of thousands of people who suffer in silence. Darkness wins, shame wins, and people feel more alone, and unworthy of love. Brene Brown defines vulnerability as ""Emotional risk, exposure, uncertainty."" It fuels our daily lives. As a therapist in her 12th year doing research, Brown says, ""Vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage; to be vulnerable, to let ourselves be seen, to be honest."" What stops many from showing vulnerability is shame. Shame, according to Brown, is not guilt. It is a focus on self. Shame is highly correlated with addiction, depression, violence, aggression, bullying, suicide, and eating disorders. So, here's my message if you are one of those people shaming yourself, denying yourself love, hiding from your emotions. Know this. You are not alone. There are so many people who want to hear your story and they want to help. People who care are waiting to hear from you at Lines for Life, NAMI, and your local County Mental Health services. These people will fight for you, with kindness and compassion. Be vulnerable, be open, and do not give up. Demand hope. Demand recovery. You are worth it. Read more stuff like this at URL"

I've dealt with depression on and off for the past several years. Over the past few months, it peaked again. There was a period of time during which all I could think about was killing myself. I was unable to keep up with my classwork and I lost all interests in the things that I care about. It was like I stopped being a person, and instead was just a blob aimlessly coasting along. I used hookups with random men from Tinder as a way of temporarily alleviating my loneliness, instead of reaching out to close friends. This was definitely not the right way to deal with it--in the end, the hookups just exacerbated things. I wish I had reached out to my friends sooner. While they knew that I was falling behind a bit in school, they had no idea the extent it had reached. It was only after I started seeing a counselor that I got the courage to start talking to people about how I had been feeling. As a naturally unrevealing person the thought of allowing myself that kind of emotional vulnerability made me very uncomfortable, but in the end it was much easier to talk to people than I had anticipated. To those of you who are dealing with similar issues, I urge you to reach out to your friends and to see a counselor. It is very easy to underestimate the effect that social support has on you. We are social creatures and we need others to support us, contrary to the individualistic notions that are so greatly pushed in our society. As cliche as it is, no one is truly alone. If you open up to others, they will support you. We all deserve happiness and friendship."

I don't go through the motions anymore, I feel capable of affecting my life in a positive way and making the changes I need to make. The numbness fades, and that moment of brief mindfulness and zen is then lost when I realize that I've been here before, I've had this rare event happen to me before, and I failed to carry through. I suffer severe anxiety and, as I've been conditioned, I suppress it with a lot of conscious effort, being as stoic as I can, but actively denying a part of who I am. That's how I somehow functioned earlier in life, being a sensitive boy growing uphone with an emotionally unavailable mother, who suffers from her own anxiety, and a largely absent father who I only saw occasionally since the age of 6. There wasn't really anyone I could talk to that was steady in my life, the people I managed to trust and confide in just kept fading away from my path in life. So I figured I would build my mind like a fortress, figuring out rules on how to behave or act in social situations I couldn't deal with, and later it just metastasized into a profound lack of confidence in myself should I ever move out of those walls. The obsession was what one psychiatrist suspected was OCPD, a behavioral disorder that caused me to live in my mind, disconnect from others, and carry on a behavior of avoidance that haunts me to this day. In the past, there are exceptionally few moments after grade school where I was myself and comfortable around others, having a genuinely good time. If I step out show some vulnerability, be unfiltered, I am hyper critical of how I was and just unhinged from any reasonable view of me being me and it being okay. This isn't about anything deeply personal, it can be from sharing music I like, or expressing an opinion that I am not sure what I read as something other people won't criticize or object to. There are many times where I step out, and become so anguished with insecurity about how I was, what I said, etc etc that it would linger for a week. Relationships are strange to me, there is a part that wants to be liked, help others, be social, that struggles against the isolation of my personality. I'm usually very kind and helpful to others, I tend to be diplomatic in confrontations among the few friend I have, and helpful to others. I enjoy making people I care about happy, but I sometimes disconnect hard. I stop caring but knowing I have to show it and be a certain way, remain functional, but it tends to put a lot of strain on friendships. I broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years, because I genuinely believed I was bad for her. There are glimpses of the kind of person I want to be, and know I can be, but I don't think I have the emotional health or ability to communicate with others about it effectively. I'm an artist who was a straight A student in college, but my perfectionism, anxiety, insecurity would always catch up, and I've had to drop from programs several times. I'm not sure where I was going with this, but I just needed to put it somewhere. I hate the way my mind works, I wish I had siblings or family available to talk to and confide in when I was seriously suffering from anxiety for years. I feel like I'm just broken inside, and it's getting harder to fight the belief that I am broken. That I'll just alienate myself from others and be abandoned. I'm just so tired of it. The medication helps, but it also sucks away my energy from time to time. there are times where I wonder if my life isn't just some internal nightmare that I've succumbed to, and wake from time to time. There are no profound tragedies in my life, or serious lacks of material for my needs, and as such I always feel guilty and ashamed once over about how I am.

I was excited about the possibility, but because I suffer from MDD, I also knew that a potential consequence of winning would be severe depression. I ended up winning, and it's provided me with so many opportunities that I feel completely overwhelmed. Now I'm scheduled to give talks, write papers, and connect with high profile people in my field. I'm totally overwhelmed, and just want to sleep through it all, even though now I have more on my plate than ever. Articles were written about the award that I refused to read, which makes me feel like an asshole. I can barely function, and thanking people for their generous support is a challenge, because I just want it to go away, but then I don't, because I've worked so hard to achieve it. I just want to get to the part where I can accept it. I feel like I'm the only person in the world who has won this award that has reacted this way because nobody else has discussed such a vulnerability. Everyone else is so positive, and I suppose that's what I look like from the outside, but inside, I want to be left alone, at least for right now. No social media. No calls. No requests. All this at a time when I'm supposed to be basking in the exposure. I suppose I'm terrified that this award has only granted an expectation from me of others, and I won't live up to it. I take pride in my work, but I'm also an expert in something very specific, while my award is granted to an overall expertise. What if I fuck up something basic? I've tried to find articles about award exhaustion, but I couldn't find specific examples of people telling their stories. I take comfort in Hyperbole and a Half, because I think she has experienced something similar. I want to hear from others out there that have had great success, not necessarily an award, but any kind of success that caused them to crumble. I imagine people who get into their top choice school may feel this way. Or others who become overnight sensations. Or just finished a project at work, that granted many accolades. Or even got their degree, or whatever. How did you get past it, and how long did it take? Have you ever accepted that you were rightfully awarded? Sorry if my thoughts are jumbled. Depression."

I don't know what else to say. I'm tired of living a life where my only happiness is creating false hope for my future. I'm terrified that it's too late and I'm always going to be unhappy. 10 years ago I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. 5 years ago it felt like a disease I could overcome. Now it's no longer a disease, it's just who I am. I have no one who I feel truly understands. I have family who I'm around regularly but it's like they've just come to terms with me being a loser. Actually, they see my vulnerability and take advantage of it. It fucking hurts. I've failed at everything I've attempted. I doubt myself before I get started. This fucking disease has ruined my life. Literally. I quit school in 09 because I was miserable. I've held one job for a year since 2009 because I have no confidence in myself. I feel like everyone around me doesn't really like me. This isn't paranoia neither, it's the truth. I think it's because they see my misery and obviously that's not what they want to be around. My last real gf was 8 years ago. 8 fucking years ago and I still miss her. My first/last love. This can't be normal. I'm out of shape. I'm broke. I have a vehicle with no insurance. I'm losing it. I've never taken medication for depression/anxiety simply because I live in a rural area with very little options for help and I don't have insurance. I've let my family down. I continue to let myself down everyday and I don't know what to do. But... I love life. I could never commit suicide simply because I still love the memories of better times I've held on to. I love the possibilities of being happy that go through my head. I wasted many years living in the past and waiting for the future. Life simply can't go on like this forever. I don't want to carry on like this. I need help in the worst way guys. I need to know it's not too late for me. I mean, what do you do when the walls are closing in and everyone is walking out of a door you can't fit through? Do you end it all even though you don't want to? Or do you just patiently wait for the walls to crush you? "

Today we talked about my mask, the great fear of being found out, and why that is shame rather than guilt. Guilt, he said, was for actions we did or didn't do. It's based on morals. Shame is internal, it's about how we perceive other's perceptions of us. It's avoiding vulnerability. It's the mask. It's not telling our friends and family how hard the struggle is because we are afraid of their reactions. That's shame. And that my life-threatening vice. So. How do YOU personally handle it?

The world can be so fake that I start to feel alienated by the endless, surreal reality of my most honest sentiments. I'm not fully together in myself. If peace of mind exists at all- it is after finding enough pieces of the mind. Then you feel whole, fill hole, because all I can feel is the hole in me. Sorry for the riddling at the end.

Blood is pouring down its trembling chin. The sound of all the other playing children is completely drowned out, by the screams of your tiny, fragile loved one. Nothing you do or say can stop its screaming, so you bundle the child up and gather your tupperware lunch, your thermal coffee cup, the discarded size 2 hat, bought for a fortune because it has an 50+ spf sun rating and you run to the car. From the amount of blood, you can see this is a job for the hospital, stitches are certainly in order. You hold this screaming child still while the doctor stitches up that lip that you have kissed a thousand times, all the while his/her accusing eyes are looking at you for comfort and reprieve from the pain. With a lolly-pop in hand in one hand and an exhausted child in the other donning seven new stitches, a swollen lip and a cheek bruise for good measure to take your still whimpering child home. When finally sleep befalls your young charge your shoulders slump a little, the wine you were holding almost evaporates, then you give yourself permission to fall apart and let out all those tears you have been holding back all day. These are the actions of a true survivor. I am a survivor. I cant say that strongly enough; I am a survivor! I have survived two violent sex attacks before I was twelve. I didnt receive counselling but rather I was condemned by the police for my provocative attire. I tried to bury the incidents in my mind and rise above, as Taylor Swift may say, I tried to shake it off. Crumbling was not an alternative, as any form of vulnerability be it mental or emotional increased ones exposure to further harm. Predators only attack the weak, as the expression goes. The scenes I have bared witness too still haunt me; death, murder, assault, violent abuses, parental neglect, and betrayal. Yet at the time your inner voice is telling you not to dwell on the ugliness you are witnessing, move on; survive. Dwelling on problems gets you nowhere, like a shark, keep moving, keep earning, keep vigilant. By nineteen I was a single-parent, which gave me a whole new motivation to ignore all my emotions, you are the glue that holds this family together, she needs to know that you are happy and confident, show no self-doubt, handle every crisis with a grin. My baby is still my baby but she is in her 20s. She has become the girl that I dreamed she would become, so now I can pour my wine, and let the tears flow. Forty years worth. Tears were a relatively new thing for me, I had fought them off for so many years, but now I found myself incapable of controlling them. It was like asking the tide to stop rolling in. My husband had never seen me this way for that matter neither had I, so we sought some expertise. After bearing my soul, I was quickly diagnosed with chronic anxiety disorder bought on my years as a sexworker. My tears dried up in a heartbeat. WTF? Blame my childhood, blame the loss of my daughters father to suicide, blame exhaustion for ten years of eighteen hour days, but why jump to sexworker? Hadnt sexworker saved me from poverty? Hadnt sexwork bought my financial freedom to choose my life goals? I walk away and reflect on my holiday in depression land, I come to the conclusion that the stigma of sexwork pervades even the wisest of minds. The prejudice, and assumptions that surround this work choice are thick, ever present and counterproductive. I now know that I need to heal myself as I am not prepared to pay a fortune to convince a medical expert that my trauma lies outside sexwork. URL "
449,vulnerability,depression,My finest hour,2,2umesc,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2umesc/my_finest_hour/,2015-02-03 20:55:48,"[After crying alone in my room for half an hour, I feel like I need to post this. Just like Faris, this truly is my finest hour.](URL Hi everyone. I'm 16 years old and am currently a junior in a profoundly gifted high school. Every single day at my school, I act like the happiest person alive. Whenever I see a friend in the halls I smile and wave at them and I generally have a very positive vibe. Some people at my school have even gone so far to describe me as ""their personal cheerleader"" because I constantly provide moral support to others and try to make other people's realities as great as possible. Whenever people used to ask me how I was, I would always respond with ""great"" or ""never better"". However, everything about that is fake. I am incredibly depressed and have extreme anxiety issues. I rarely open up to anyone about my depression because when I do tell anyone, I feel like they immediately downplay it to be nothing or ""teenage problems"", begin to think of me as mentally insane, or even go so far as to say ""I want to punch you in the dick"" (yes, someone actually said this to me). I think the reason for my depression is because I view life from a very different spectrum than others. In July of 2013, my sister passed away from cancer at the age of 13. This had a severe impact on my family and things have not been the same since. While my dad and I talk a lot and are able to really connect, my mom has completely disassociated from nearly everything and being around her is one of the hardest things for me to do. Often, at dinner or other times, she will complain about how her life sucks and how much she wants to die. She has said on numerous occasions that I am the only reason that she has not committed suicide yet. A huge stigma surrounding profoundly gifted kids is that we basically have things handed to us and that we can get into almost any profession/college that we want to. However, I know from talking to a lot of my friends that the majority of us have NO FUCKING CLUE WHAT WE WANT TO DO WITH OUR LIVES. While I know I'm incredibly good at math, I have no clue how I want to apply myself into the job world and I feel like now that I have to worry about college admissions that I need to know this, because if I choose the wrong major/college, I could be fucked. Furthermore, I don't know what will give me fulfillment in my life, because while there are some things which provide me temporary job/a distraction from my reality (such as guitar and being around my friends), there is not a single thing which brings me true happiness. As The Replacements so bluntly put it, [I'm so unsatisfied.](URL And I worry that I may live the rest of my life like this if the pieces don't begin to fall into place. I want to find some career path that will bring me fulfillment in my work and surround myself with people/activities that I love, but instead I'm stuck at home doing homework every single day. Also, a few months ago, me and this girl I had a huge crush on for the longest time broke up. The ""relationship"" was nothing serious (I wouldn't even call it a relationship), but I feel like it's had a permanent effect on me in that I'm really really scared to ever try romance again, because I realized how vulnerable it made me and how just one person was able to (unintentionally) completely exploit my vulnerability. I still have to see her every single day and it hurts me so much because each time I see her beautiful face I just want to walk right out of the school door. The thing is though, too, I still act like the nicest guy ever to her (we're just friends now), and she has no idea how much she hurt me because I know that she was struggling too and I feel like telling her would hurt our friendship a lot. Furthermore, going back to that last point, I have extreme anxieties about people. I'm in an incredibly comfortable environment right now where I don't have to really worry about people using me/taking advantage of me, however, I know that as soon as I walk into the doors of college that this is a very likely risk. As I said before, I'm by far one of the nicest guys I know, and unfortunately, nice guys get taken advantage of A LOT. I really don't want to leave my cozy environment and get into the ""real world"" because fuck that man. I'm nearly 17 and I still don't have a permit and I'm really scared to grow up. Several times a die, the thought of death pop into my head. Now, my friends will immediately mistake this for me being suicidal; I'm most definitely not suicidal before any of you ask. As Bush writes in their latest song, ""the only way out is through"" and I have no intention of doing anything other than going through life. But I think of death as more or less and incredibly peaceful state of mind where all the makings of our materialistic, egocentric society falls apart. Lastly, I'm dealing with extreme insecurities too. I have a speech impediment which hinders the way I say ""r""s and while people don't make fun of me for it anymore, I used to be teased and bullied a lot and I tend to censor my speech a lot. A lot of people tell me that I'm a good looking dude, but no amount of compliments will ever get me to like my face or my hair. For every one ""good thing"" that a person could say about me, I could list 5 bad things. I also have a pretty gross out of shape body, and I'm trying to get into shape but I'm really struggling keeping myself focused. I leave post it notes around my room to reflect the way I'm feeling about stuff. The most reason one I put on my mirror is ""I don't know"". That's the way I feel about life right now. "

This is a long one. I dont know what else to do with all these feelings so I just need to get them all out. I'm in grad school to get a degree in the mental health field, ironically, and I was at my internship today getting an evaluation. It went great and I kept it together. I didnt feel much. I was just going through the motions. After my evaluation from one of my professors, my supervisor pulled me aside and asked me if I was all right. She had noticed that I looked down. That was it for me. I tried to hold it. Ive broken down in front of her before, but I was overcome with sadness. I burst into tears and told her I was depressed. I didnt care about anything anymore and couldnt focus on my studies. I was falling behind in school and feeling guilty about pushing off my projects and papers but I couldnt sit down and focus for the last week or two. I have an underlying problem that has been pushing me into a depression every so often, which Im finally trying to seek help for (I need a referral for a specialist from my doctor first). Im exhausted. Thats really the only word I can use. Exhausted from constantly falling into a black pit of misery every few months and barely being able to climb out of it. Only to fall back in again. I go to sleep and hope I dont wake up. Ive thought about suicide, but I have no intent or plan. I know I wont do it. I just wish it could happen naturally. My supervisor listened to me so patiently with so much care and concern in her eyes that I just cried even more. Shes been a huge support system for me throughout my first year placement so if I had to break down Im glad it was in front of her. Still, I felt helpless and cornered by my feelings. She told me to take the day off and do whatever I felt I needed to do. I told her I was going to go seek counseling at my campus and she asked that I call her and let her know how it goes and that shed be here for me no matter what. Shes a saint this woman. I drove to school and filled out a bunch of paperwork and had a brief assessment. I told the intake coordinator that I felt suicidal but had no intent or plan. We talked for a bit, and again the waterworks. She asked about my childhood trauma and depression and who I go to for support. Honestly, I went to therapy for a couple of months during undergrad and that was about it. Im not one to talk about the darkest corners of my mind to friends or family. Vulnerability does not come easy to me. She said I must be *exhausted* from having to carry all of that around by myself. Again, that word. She summed it up quite nicely. I am exhausted. But, because I wasnt going to kill myself, I suppose there wasnt an immediate need for them to schedule me sooner than the end of March. This system is so broken. I am broken. I booked the appointment anyway, got a list of resources should I need them sooner than the end of next month, and drove home. I didnt know what I was going to do. I called one of the counseling clinics on the resource sheet but I hung up. I just spent my day explaining my feelings and hopelessness to my supervisor and then a stranger. I didnt have it in me to do it again. Exhaustion. I came home and spent my afternoon moping and sleeping. Took my dog out for a long walk after I couldnt stand to be in my room anymore. And now here I am. I cant get myself to start my projects. I cant stop crying. My eyes and cheeks burn. I miss happy me. I want to sleep forever. "

A pessimist stays up to make sure the old year leaves. - Bill Vaughn The title means: ""I am in great pain, please help me."" in Bird person language. There was a boy who struggled with angst. He had OCD and always questioned people whether they were friends or not? The boy had problems, people knew and exploitation was inevitable. The boy bought friends with candy, and his parents didn't approve, but the boy was kinda happy, he had fun I guess. My momma told me it wasn't OK, I told myself I was O-K. I mean sure I was an obnoxious kid at times, but I needed to hear you say WE. ARE. FRIENDS. I couldn't and can't be alone. He whispered. A child trauma thing, that's pussy man talk. I fucked up okay? I did, nobody else. Big Time. I was cynical, mean, I struggled, schizoid, but it was because I was afraid. I couldn't deal with more rejection and ostracization. I was weird and I was awkward. I was always awkward, I was rude and rebellious. I pushed you all away, but nobody understood me. He loved teasing and getting chased. The thrill of being looked and searched for. Children right? Maybe it was my father's beating and my mother's screaming or my frequent moving. Who the hell knows right? I don't know what and how you guys feel in social situations, but I'm retarded, like seriously. Seriously though, really nice memories that stick with me are going for long evening walks with a good friend where we connect and talk stuff and laugh, finding some place to chill that's pretty empty of people, eating chips and drinking some soda outside in the rain or the snow. Parties on the other hand where I got drunk, they were really fun, but they don't bring that childhood mystic memories. I'm weird I guess. I love doing drugs though, but I prefer doing them with a close group of friends. I like to just chill and talk, play some games, go for a walk, laugh, watch a movie, EAT. Parties. They are fun, but too shallow for me. Anyway. I don't know how deep any of you've fucked up, but I screwed my first two years of high school due to various reasons. I am where I am at the moment, and there is little I can do right know. I used to be able to function in social situations because I knew that I was safe because I had already existing friendships. I feel that I lack meaningful relationships. I perceive myself as isolated and feel that I don't have many friends that care about me, maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm not. How the fuck did I survive the summer vacation?!?! (crying) There seems to be that people distance themselves from me because I want so desperately to have a close and intimate friend/girlfriend. I've realized that I've adopted a series of maladaptive habits and actions that I guess make me appear desperate and that make me appear clingy and needy. I've therefore made my New Year's Resolution to gather up a list of all the bad habits I, ""WE"" whatever have and put them here. I've also added points from psychology today that I find practical in use and that may benefit others. ** The biggest problem ** is that I don't function properly if my needs aren't filled. I can't think properly, I feel retarded. Unfortunately, since I screwed life up years ago and gradually building it up again, I'm not at my most optimal so I have some bad habits. ** *I will add yours, just comment* * I have to say goodnight to people. * I have to say goodbye to people. * I care too much about what strangers that show me attention think about me. * I care too much about what pretty girls that look at me think about me. * I worry about what to talk about, and often say dumb shit. * I force myself to talk during school hours due to the fact that I'll probably feel shitty if I don't. Therefore conversations tend to become monotone and tedious. * I want everyone to like me. * I adopt a ""guilt"" mentality. If I don't say yes to a friend request to do something, I'll regret it because I'm lonely, but do it just to keep me sane. * I barely touch my hobbies during the afternoon, because everyone expects of you to do something socially. * I come off as needy and clingy depending on my vulnerability. * I panic if a friend leaves mid-conversation * I panic if I'm home alone. * I may enter the room of my brother and just sit together with him if he plays games with his friends, because I'm about to crack open if I don't find safety soon. **Some tip:** &gt; * ""...Susans anxious-dependency needs drove her to reach out for contact and assurance. However, the response was neurotic because the likely consequence was that her actions probably worked against her long- term goals. While Brians response, I will be there in a minute alleviated Susans short term anxiety, it is also likely that at some level Brian will register Susan as dependent and needy, which will increase the likely that he will actually avoid her in the futurewhich, of course, is exactly Susans fear."" &gt;* Neurotic habits are automatic or ritualized patterns of overt behavior that people engage in to alleviate anxiety and provide a sense of familiar security. The problem is that, carried out over the long term, the habitual patterns are maladaptive. A classic example is the anxious drinker. Stressed all day, riddled with achievement and relational anxieties, alcohol becomes a short term, medicating balm. Unfortunately over time, it comes with significant costs (hangovers, weight gain, health problems, etc). Binging and purging, ritualistic ordering or cleaning, nail biting or trichotillomania (hair pulling) are all common examples of neurotic, maladaptive habits. &gt;* Susans needs for relational value drove her to respond in a maladaptive way. Individuals who hide in their apartments out of social anxiety, individuals who hunt for any signs of betrayal, and individuals who vacillate between being needy and fearing control all engage in neurotic relational patterns in that they each are attempting to manage their needs for relational value, but are doing so in a way that ultimately produces intense conflict or pushes others away leaving such needs fundamentally unmet. * URL (MAY BE A TRIGGER) * **FULL ARTICLE:** URL &gt;* 1. Being Self-Critical When Our Self-Esteem is Already Low: The most common and most damaging psychological habit we have is employing negative self-talk when our self-esteem is already hurting. We often respond to rejection, failure, and other blows to our self-worth with an inner dialogue that is punitive, harsh, and even abusive. We rationalize this brutal assault on our self-esteem by telling ourselves we deserve it or that were just preparing ourselves for future disappointments.. &gt;* 2. Psyching Ourselves Out after a Failure: One of the most common responses to failure is to convince ourselves that although weve tried, our goal is impossible to reach and that our chances of doing so in the future are poor. We believe were just being realistic and that it is prudent to lower our expectations to avoid the inevitable disappointment to come. However, such thoughts are neither realistic nor prudent as we are merely succumbing to the perceptual distortions that get activated after a failure.. &gt;* 3. Pushing People Away When We Feel Lonely: Loneliness has a devastating impact on both our mental and physical health. One of the most common habits we develop when were lonely is to unconsciously push away the very people with whom we might forge deeper and more satisfying personal or social connections. We feel so vulnerable to rejection and so convinced others will disappoint or hurt us, we believe that avoiding situations in which we might get hurt or keeping a low profile when we do attend them is the smartest thing we can do. &gt;* 4. Indulging the Urge to Brood and Ruminate: While its natural to reflect on upsetting, angering, or distressing events when they occur, the point of doing so is to figure things out, learn what we can, and decide on potential action we might take, as reaching these insights eases our internal tension and allows us to move on. But sometimes we get stuck. We replay the same scenes, worries, or experiences in our minds, reach no new insights, and experience no easing of internal tension. &gt;* 5. Distancing Ourselves When We Feel Guilty Instead of Repairing the Relationship: Guilt usually arises when we intend to do or have done something that can cause harm to another person. To ease our guilt we avoid the action or take corrective steps if we've already caused harm by apologizing and repairing any damage our relationship might have sustained. But studies indicate that our apologies are typically extremely ineffective and often fail to garner authentic forgiveness. **HAVE NO EXPECTATIONS:** &gt;* 1. You take sole responsibility for your decisions. I push myself to make my sales figures because it is part of my being a good worker or because I like the challenge. I clean the kitchen because I want it neater or because I dont want my wife to have to worry about it. This sidesteps any of those thoughts that someone else is making me or expecting me to do something. This is about me running my life, doing what I consider important. Its Nietzsches Ubermensch who creates his own values, who doesnt succumb to herd mentality, who avoids going on auto-pilot. &gt;* 2. You separate your wants from should's. The herd mentality and auto-pilot are usually tied to the shoulds. These come from our heads, our superego, the parent voice in our heads. Shoulds are by definition expectations imposed by others. When we fail to do them we feel guilty. When we do follow them we often feel driven...and expect a payoff for our efforts: Since I am doing what I really dont want to do, I do expect others to appreciate, notice, give me a reward, pat me on the head, do what I expect. When the expected payoff doesn't come, our disappointment and resentment are fueled. The way out of this mental dance is focusing on wants  heart, gut-based rather than head based. Values, core beliefs, foundation of our integrity. Expectations are a red flag that shoulds are the probable drivers. Skip the expectations and youre falling back on wants. Theres youand you. &gt;* 3. You avoid feeling disappointed, angry, etc. Nuf said. &gt;* 4. You avoid becoming a martyr. All this disappointment and resentment can overtime congeal into martyrdom, that lethal combination of domineering shoulds and unfulfilled expectations that drag on: I do everything I should. I expect people to appreciate, reward, etc.it doesnt happen. I trudge on and on and on. Eventually martyrs either collapse from exhaustion, or get fed up by the unfairness of it all  get massively resentful, get massively depressed, massively act out  shopping, raging, drinking, etc.  understandably thinking in their minds that they absolutely deserve to do whatever they just did. People generally hate martyrs. Theyre hard to be around. &gt;* 5. You live in the present. The decisions / choices of life come one-by-one in the moment. Expectations forever push you look ahead, mentally entrap you in the future. Like a chess player youre always thinking 8 moves out  what should I do, how will others react, how will respond, how can I get them to react in the way I expect, what if they question my decision.etc. **Keep it simple. What do I want right now. Done. Act. See what happens next.** So if youre inclined to experiment with this type of thinking, start slow and go slow. Its about rewiring your brain, it takes concentration. Be proactive. Listen to yourself. Whatever decision you make, action you take, own it, no auto-pilot. Push aside the shoulds, the mental rush towards the outcome, the response of others, the future. Stay in the moment, see your decision right now as your decision, as the best decision you can make in the moment. What happens next  how it turns out, how others respond  doesnt matter right now. * **STOP MAKING COMPARISONS.** &gt; Social media sites represent a perfect platform to make us covet the lives of friends and acquaintances. In such a culture, its easy to get caught in the trap of comparing our relationships to other peoples that may be painted through perfect photos, sappy updates, and location tagging at the most romantic sites in town. * **DON'T TAKE PSEUDO-FRIENDS FOR GRANTED.** They can keep your sanity straight, if the aren't that meaningful, they are someone and sometimes you need someone. Even if that is someone you can't talk about your problems with. Sometimes those are also the only ones you have. That is all I have. These maladaptive habits is something I really have to get rid of. I'm first and foremost anxiously-dependent, but I occasionally swap with avoidant. It's pretty disgusting.

I used to have existing friendships that made me feel safe in social situations, then I fucked up and this old habit isn't sustainable anymore. I perceive myself as isolated sometimes and I feel I lack in meaningful relationships where my friends care about me. It's all because I fucked up Big Time. I was cynical, mean, I struggled, schizoid, but it was all because I was afraid. I couldn't deal with more rejection and ostracization. I was weird and I was awkward. I had always been awkward, but now I was rude and rebellious too. I pushed you all away, but nobody understood me. Nevertheless I've realized that I've adopted a series of maladaptive habits and actions in relationships that make me appear desperate, clingy and needy which hurts my long-term goals - a friendship. I was thinking we could make a list of things that all of us do that make us appear desperate, unvaluable, needy and clingy that we can work on this year. I've written down mine and I'll add yours: * I have to say goodnight to people. * I have to say goodbye to people. * I care too much about what strangers that show me attention think about me. * I care too much about what pretty girls that look at me think about me. * I worry about what to talk about, and often say dumb shit. * I force myself to talk during school hours due to the fact that I'll probably feel shitty if I don't. Therefore conversations tend to become monotone and tedious. * I want everyone to like me. * I adopt a ""guilt"" mentality. If I don't say yes to a friend request to do something, I'll regret it because I'm lonely, but do it just to keep me sane. * I barely touch my hobbies during the afternoon, because everyone expects of you to do something socially. * I come off as needy and clingy depending on my vulnerability. * I panic if a friend leaves mid-conversation * I panic if I'm home alone. * I may enter the room of my brother and just sit together with him if he plays games with his friends, because I'm about to crack open if I don't find safety soon. * I panic if someone doesn't answer a SMS and write the typical anxious messages.

I have always struggled to find friends, which I'm pretty sure is down to two things: a. the influence my antisocial parents have had on me and b. my insecurities about the way I look. At school I was never truly bullied, but snide remarks every now and then made me go into a shell during my later teens when most people my age came out of theirs. I've never had a girlfriend and don't now what it is like to function in a relationship. I took a year out in the middle of my first year due to depression during which I ended up working on my appearance and losing a lot of weight; now that I'm back at university much more comfortable with the way I look, I realise that the way I looked was never actually that consequential in my ability to function socially and what I think people think of me; I still feel isolated (especially because I don't know anyone in my year) and I have convinced myself that my lack of social life and existing social anxiety will always hold me back. I am very aware that I have a lot to live for so was just looking for opinions from people about what I can do to work on myself. I realise I may not have provided enough info about my situation so please feel free to ask questions! PS: Unfortunately my interests and the kind of person I am means I only seem to get along with social, outgoing people. The fact that socially inclined people don't respond to people who come from a place of vulnerability and loneliness like myself makes it hard for me to make friends with the people I want to be friends with."

I might be better if I'm not weighted down by regret, or fear, or vulnerability. Being alone is inevitable. The only constant/permanent thing in life is myself.

He was in and out of the hospital for several months. My Dad knew what was coming and asked us to promise him that we would be ok. My Mom and I were by his side as he slowly fade until he no longer recognized me and he ultimately passed. It hit my Mom hard. They were together most of their lives. For a time we were homeless, but we started over. We got a place, I got my first job, and things were good. I started a degree in Cybersecurity. I met a girl online, talked, watched shows, and played games with her every night for two years. We met in person for the first time in the summer of 2018, things went well, and we decided to move forward. I moved across the country and we moved in together. For the first few months, things were good. We fought as most couples do, but she made it clear that she no longer wanted to try after less than a year. I left and went back home. My Mom later informed me that she had married someone else about a month after I left. I don't know the full story, but I've forgiven her and moved on with my life regardless. My Mom ended up falling into a depression believing that she wouldn't live long enough to see grandchildren. This became a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy as over the course of six months she drank herself repeatedly into the hospital and refused to get help until ultimately one day it became clear she wasn't coming home from the hospital. Even though my Mom made her own choices, I do kind of feel like I failed my Dad's dying wish that we would be ok. The Doctors gave me a choice, they could try to save her that would be painful and have little chance of saving her or make her comfortable. I chose to make her comfortable. She soon started to fade like my Dad did, but I had experience this time. I did my best to make her happy by telling her stories about my Father, that I loved her, and went along with her disillusions if they gave her peace/happiness. I got a really good job in IT shortly after that and have been promoted since then. I'm about half way through my Cybersecurity degree now and recently started getting into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Lately I've just been feeling tired being cooped indoors with the whole COVID thing. My childhood friends are big part of my life, but they can't be online every night as they have other things going on. My family has been gone for over a year, but the silence is especially loud lately. I still can't bring myself to look at the pictures of my family. I do listen to this voicemail from my Mom from time to time where she tells me not to forgot this cart thing so I don't struggle to bring the groceries inside. It's the only thing I have where I can still hear her voice. I wish I had something similar of my Dad. Some days, all I want is to forget, but the best I can do is go to sleep and hope that I can out run the demons in the morning."

I have very bad imposter syndrome where I feel like Im not deserving to be in my major. I suffer from major depression and anxiety. I no longer take my meds because they just werent doing it for me anymore. Im doing well in all of my classes except for one. My professor is known for being harsh and he left an aggressive comment on one of my assignments. I showed it to many people that work in the field to get other opinions and they all agreed the response was very much out of line. Thats when I talked to one of the heads at my schools center for student success about it who later referred to me to the dean. I talked to the dean and he has 5-6 students that complain about my professor a year. I told the dean to take no action because Im afraid of retaliation. The intensity of the course and other things happening in my life made it difficult for me to do well. First off, I was getting cyber stalked by a guy I was seeing on this platform. Secondly, my grandpa from italy died and due to the coronavirus my family couldnt attend a funeral. There was no funeral for him sadly. I told none of my professors about my loss because I didnt want to seem like an over emotional female. I also feel like I only had one day to grieve because the next day I had to go to my work study job. On the bright side in my other Cybersecurity classes I have all As in them and I also have an A in my German class.

I suck at socializing and so the only people who hang out with me do so because I give them free weed. I got kicked out of my college dorm because of corona and so now I'm staying with my best friend's family (call him Dean). Dean is a high school dropout. All I've done since the quarantine started is smoke weed. Every time I decide ""I'm getting my shit together, stopping weed, and working"", Dean rolls a joint and I just don't have the willpower to say no. My grades are in the toilet and I'm getting more and more out of shape. Our other (homeless) friends come over and talk about selling trash weed to high school kids and beating people up for being ""disrespectful"". My friend who I'm staying with almost got shot for another friend, who then turned around and robbed me and threatened to jump the both of us. I need to make better friends, but I have near non-existent social skills and the only things I enjoy these days are smoking weed and fighting. I've lost my drive and my passion for the things that once interested me: computer science, programming, and cybersecurity. Under normal circumstances, finding friends in college is very difficult for me. I've tried several times. But now, with COVID-19, it's impossible. A few months ago, my friends encouraged me to sell weed out of my college dorm and I did for about a month until I realized it was a bad idea. I just see my life falling apart and myself becoming a loser, and I don't want to do be living like this anymore. I want real friends who don't rob me and jump me when I get boring. I don't know how to make friends under normal circumstances and I feel it's impossible for me to do while in quarantine. I'm embarrassed for what I've become and who I hang out with. If my father could see the company I keep he would probably disown me. I can't even leave the negative influence until the quarantine is over, and I know I'm too weak minded to endure it and build myself up. I literally have no more drive or passion for anything anymore. What the fuck do I do?"
460,cybersecurity,depression,Nothing new to say here,1,gao6j6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gao6j6/nothing_new_to_say_here/,2020-04-30 13:33:40,"Like the title says, I've got nothing new to say or add to the conversation that hasn't already been said better by someone else. It's hard sometimes to remember that each of us isn't alone in this and there are others out there feeling the exact same way we feel. It's so weird scrolling the subreddit and reading so many posts that feel like they could have come straight from myself because one of the worst parts of this thing is how alone and isolated it makes you feel. And the worst part is, I should be happy. I have a beautiful fiancee, we own a house, and we have way too many adorable little animals running around for our own good. This is what I wanted 10 years ago and yet I haven't been able to enjoy it. I've always struggled a bit with managing my emotions, but the last 2 years have been extremely tough. I finally stopped being a student (my first Associate Degree) and got a full time job and I think that's when I began sliding downhill. At first I didn't mind it because it was a way for me to get something I wanted: an apartment with my fiancee and the chance to level up into adulthood. But slowly, day by day, it dawned on me that I'd be doing this forever. Maybe not necessarily that job, but a job. I'd always be giving at least 40 hours a week of my life to something I didn't care about. And that there was basically no escape from that. And now here I am, 2 years later. I've been on and off antidepressants trying to not be a worthless piece of shit for my fiancee. But it's hard. She's very understanding and patient and she's always there for me, but I feel like one day she'll have had enough and she'll bail. Which I wouldn't really blame her for, because I am not a lot of fun to be around sometimes and nobody wants to constantly be propping up somebody else just so that person can function at a basic level. I changed jobs 6 months ago thinking maybe that was it. Things got better for me and I felt better, but I think it was just the novelty of something new distracting me from being so miserable because the feelings came back. 2 months ago I was put on new meds that REALLY messed me up and knocked me out of commission. I was so embarrased to go back to work after missing so much time (I took all my PTO hoping I'd eventually be able to function again) that my illogical brain decided to go back to my old job. And then Covid happened and they made work optional and I stayed home drawing unemployment, until my job terminated me because it was a factory job and they claimed to be essential and needed everybody back and I just couldnt do it because I hate that place. So here I am, unemployed. I finally got my dream of staying home and not having to work, but all of this time off hasn't made me feel anything but regret for everything I haven't accomplished with all this free time. I'm taking online courses for CyberSecurity now and I'm acing all of the classes and plan on getting an actual high paying job one day, so I guess maybe it's not all wasted. But still. I feel like I should feel differently. I feel like I don't have hobbies that make me feel happy, as much as I have hobbies that I do to forget that I'm sad. I am constantly doing less and less each day, as chores pile up and I just don't feel the need to bother. My fiancee works from home now and seeing her every day is nice, but it's also a reminder of how little I'm probably living up to her expectations. I keep telling her (and myself) that putting up with this will all be worth it. I tell her one day I'll have a good job and I'll be happy and things will be alright again. But I keep thinking how nice it would be just to buy a gun and never look back. It's not that I want to be dead...it's basically I just don't want to be alive anymore. Those are actually very different things, at least how I see it. I don't want to go through life feeling this way. Feeling nothing about most things and misery towards everything thats left. I dont want to feel like an immense burden to the person I love the most. I don't want to go through the motions day by day, only to be assaulted by my thoughts when I try to sleep at night. I don't want to stress about finances and health and housework and managing relationships and being a good productive member of society. I feel like I'm under so much pressure that I'm threatening to buckle at any minute, and that it would be much easier to just not have to fuck with it anymore. The only reason I haven't is because I don't want to hurt the people I'd leave behind. I've seen what that does to people and I don't think I could do it. I want to, but I can't. I was going to start therapy soon but since I'm now freshly unemployed and I live in the worst country in the world, I now have no health insurance and can't afford it. I just don't know what to do to be happy and I don't know if I even remember how to be. I guess I just needed to vent. Tldr; sad boy rants about being sad"

My classes were not enrolling and now most of them have closed. The last few weeks, even months, have just sneaked up on me out of nowhere. I am getting told that getting back to school and getting my degree in something is the answer to getting out of my depressive conundrum because it'll help me ""grow"" or whatever the fuck, but I do not care to go back to school in the mental health state I'm in, I don't care to continue to ""grow"" academically, and to say otherwise is met with zero receptiveness, just ""you should do it anyway and see what happens"" or a similar response. So maybe it's better this happens and I say fuck attending, don't care for what major I applied for (Cybersecurity), didn't care to go back now when I can barely process what my day is/will consist of. I've been burnt out for over three months and practically bedridden for most of it, therapy is not useful, I live with the constant pressure of needing to ""get better"" ASAP because the so-called patience people have for me is contingent on my recovery and doing things that will ""help me grow"" (that did not help me in the past but I struggled through anyway).

Before QCC I went to a 4 year university but unfortunately due to my financial circumstances and my GPA which went to a 1.9, I had to transfer to a community college. I promised myself I would do well so that I can transfer and go to a 4 year and graduate but honestly every semester I start to lose my passion in studying and start slacking alot in the middle of the semester. It's so sad that this has happened to me and I'm really upset that if I don't continue school not only will I be very depressed about it but my parents will also be upset. I honestly went for computer science for the money. I was interested in cybersecurity but I can't even do a simple program. I'm really upset over it.

This is my first post in this group. I've been following your posts here for quite a while and I noticed that you guys always try to find the best solution and are really helpful. Maybe you'll be able to help me at least a little bit, as well. First of all... I'm from Poland and English isn't my first language. Hopefully, you'll be able to understand everything. I don't even know where to start and where I want to go with this post... The title describes my current situation pretty well. I feel stuck, lost and hopeless. I feel anxious almost all the time. Bitter is also a very good word. I've been struggling with depression for the past 15 years or so. Currently, I'm on antidepressants again because my anxiety was really really bad. Recently, I turned 24. I work in IT. I really like my job and people working there. Currently, I'm waiting for my second job interview because I wanted to move somewhere else and decided to apply to a different company. I'll be working in CyberSecurity for one of the best IT company. I don't even know if IT is something I want to focus my career on. In the past, I wanted to work as a Sales Representative. I finished dozens of different courses about management, sales techniques, marketing, public speaking... Now, I work in IT. I really liked the idea of setting sales/business goals and achieving them on a daily basis. The rush, the motivation to strive for more... And this is pretty much all I can say about my current life... I'm working with people I really like and for a really good company. But right now, I'm on a sick leave. On Monday, I just couldn't go there. I got ready, left my house and after 3 minutes or so I decided to go back to my apartment. I called my manager and said that I'll have to go and see my doctor and I won't be able to work that day. I just wanted to be alone. I knew that I wouldn't be able to have normal conversations with my coworkers. It was all too much. My own thoughts, questions, internal emptiness and problems combined with sitting in my office with people calling me, me trying to solve their problems, coworkers asking me random questions, managers calling me... I feel like I'm unable to feel any deeper emotions. I'm constantly seconds away from crying. I can't decide what to do with my life. I signed up for salsa classes but I didn't go. I decided that I'm not in the mood for it. My coworkers organized like 5 different parties... My goal was to attend every single one of them, but I decided to stay home. I used to suffer from really bad social anxiety but in 2016 after taking antidepressants I overcame it after dozens of years struggling with it. I don't even think it has anything to do with that. I just stayed home, feeling empty inside and I wanted to come up with any idea how to overcome my problems/feelings of hopelessness. I wanted to move to Italy or Spain to try and see things from a different perspective, but no one ''accepted'' my resume despite the fact that I speak Italian and Spanish. I got an offer from Amsterdam, but I decided that even though I want to move abroad I have a ''better job opportunity'' here, in Poland in CyberSecurity. I don't have a partner. + I've never had one. Not only is it difficult to find one as a gay woman, but I also screw up every single opportunity I get. I even decided to focus solely on my career because at least I know what I'm doing and work isn't stressful to me at all. Any kind of relationship would be a total disaster. My depression, awkwardness around some women, no goals, no future, feeling like a mess, feeling empty,... Other than that, I noticed that I've become a really negative person, who is very easy to piss off because of this fact and I have no idea what to do. Recently, as I tried to become more aware of my feelings, I noticed that I feel lonely, as hell. I feel like every single decision I make is my responsibility and there is no one out there to help me, if I need any advice. No one to talk to. I go out regularly to pubs and clubs but it doesn't help. My family is very negative. I decided to stop contacting my father who is a very toxic person. My mother has her own problems. My grandma doesn't perceive life as I do. And her views are also quite limiting and negative. It seems like I'm constantly trying to be optimistic and achieve something (anything meaningful to me) in my life, but I really don't know what to do and I can't see any future for myself. I know that I should start with one thing and go from there but nothings interests me anymore. Not to mention the feeling of wasting my time... What am I supposed to do? I really like the idea of setting new goals and going after them, but right now I don't even know what I want. Which direction should I choose? I even considered moving to Japan or Tibet to start from the beginning and see things in a new way. I don't actively want to die, I'm definitely not ready to give up (--&gt; scared af). But I really can't picture a future for myself. I'm basically living ''on a daily basis.'' I don't know what's gonna happen next week/month and idgaf."

I worked as a lab tech at NIH for 2 years (2015-2017) and went to a dental school when I had my breakdown and psychosis which eventually led to 2 hospitalization in a month. My psychosis was pretty bad at that time and I am ashamed about the stuff I have done. I couldn't take the risk of going back to dental school emotionally and financially (still have 3 years left with 70K in debt) and I am out of the job market for 2 years. I am thinking about: 1. work as a lab tech for the rest of my life and making 15 dollars an hour (job market is really shitty because of too many pre-med/bio grads) 2. Go back to a college and get a certificate in Certified Lab Technology in one year. I will be able to work in a hospital and make 50k a year, but I would have to spend another 30k to get that certificate. Plus the accelerated CLT program is super specialized and I will have to choose among hematology, microbiology, blood bank, etc. Not as competitive as someone who graduate with a 4 year degree in CLT 3. Go to a local community college to get a LPN (only cost about 3k) in one year or RN (only 4k) in two years. The only concern is that I am already 28, and by the time I graduate I will be 32. The school is located in a semi-rural area and it is really hard for me to find a boyfriend as an Asian with BP. I have way better luck at finding an SO in big cities like New York or Baltimore. Also working rotating shift as a nurse is scary for BP people. 4. Find something else in health care that is more flexible and less intense, such as Physician assistant (no enough clinical hours, need to start over as a CNA or something like that), Occupational therapy, PTA, etc 5. Find something else in non hands-on health care field, such as cybersecurity, health IT. 6. Go for a PhD program in biology/clinical psychology and live on student stipend I am currently taking pre-req for the nursing program and it is very expensive!! Also any recommendations for BP people in late 20s without a steady job to find love in this crazy world?"

Went to school for cybersecurity. Loved it. Loved getting into systems and exploiting weaknesses, etc. Get a job in cybersecurity. Manager says my mindset is exactly what they need. Turns out that was a fucking lie. Get placed in a cube. No one checks in with me, maybe once a day. Be told to do paperwork and create charts with absolutely no instruction. Go to meetings where I have no idea whats going on. Go back to cube to do more paperwork etc... I always told myself I didn't want to be in a place where I had to work but hated my job. I wanted to like what I did. Turns out that was a fucking lie. I'm only a month in and I've already lost all my starting vigor. This is why people do substances to get through the day I guess. Everyone I work with talks about drinking all the time. This fucking blows."

I make a lot of money working in Cybersecurity. I've never been more miserable. I have job offers out the @$$. Right now, I'm even interviewing with Facebook. The girl who I was with for 5 years left me because I refused to move to the bay area. It cost too much money and I worked too hard to be poor. I grew up like dirt floor and somehow climbed my way out. She told me she is hooking up with some other guy but is not in relationship. We've been broken up for 15 months. I loved this woman with all my heart. I worked day and night to make all of our dreams come true, I wanted to marry her and live happily ever after. I don't know how much longer, I can live like this, I feel like I have made it to the top of the world only to lose the most important thing in my life."

Into cybersecurity and feeling like I have a purpose but stepdad kept taking car away and manipulating my family. 2017 - mom loses disability income because in 2016 she took out a house loan and put it in her bank. Social security told her to either pay back the creditors or get a house. she paid off her existing debt 2018 - this was a huge decline in my personality. first half of the year is great, i finish through community college and get in my dream school. I've been attending EDM concerts. Post August - I get in a lyft accident, everyone is safe. but I get a ticket, October I get a ticket again for making an improper turn. November I'm about to get a ticket for same mistake but I only got a warning. December- my account is on hold and I need to pay 3k out of pocket which I don't have. January 2019 - fortunately got help with my student account but now I have maxed out credit card and barely any income. I've applied to several internships and jobs, not getting any email back. I feel like I'm going to be stuck at the retail level which I want to avoid. It's really depressing. I feel like my only options are either transfer college but I spent 3 years trying to get in to this university. No job would even pay enough unless I work full time. My friends are telling me to work full time or take a gap semester but my program director is a hardass so I don't think he would take that well either. TL;DR - broke college student is really broke and having anxiety and depression 75% of the time. a part time job won't even nearly cover my tuition. r/personalfinance gave me crap for posting this thread so I had deleted it.

For context my parents were(physically) and to some extent still are abusive(more verbal than physical) and honestly I don't feel like they're my parents, I never really felt any love from them not that I know what that is really. I remember moving from Fiji to New Zealand and just seeing how much love other parents showed their kids and just wishing mine loved me in the slightest and now I just have painful memories whenever I think about them, particularly my mom's trying to kill me when I was like 12 saying that I shouldve never been born. Honestly I just wish I could forget. For a short while all those bad things faded away when I got a girlfriend that I thought I was super in love with but it was a long distance thing and I broke up with her twice because I don't really know why, I guess I was too scared really and I messed everything up but we got together again or tried to recently but now(two days ago) I'm pretty sure she's moved on and I don't really know how to deal with this break up Coupled with this I'm 20 turning 21 soon and I don't really know what I'm doing with my life, I was supposed to finish Uni this year but I'm just starting due to setbacks and circumstances such as me fucking up highschool and whatnot and my dad's been yelling at me(it's practically verbal abuse) to get a job and Ive honestly been trying but I couldn't find any but he managed to set me up with a work experience at a computer store(I am planning to be a cybersecurity engineer) and I managed to land a job but because of the break up my mind was a mess and I dropped and damaged some stuff which lead to me being fired which was today. I haven't told my parents since I'm scared they'll kick me out and I'll have nowhere to go or abuse me again. I don't really have any hope to be honest. I've talked to friends but they can't fix this and I really just wanna die rn -- Thanks for reading if you got this far, I don't really expect anything, just wanted to get it off my chest"

But I didn't fully realize what it was until the middle of tenth grade. Starting junior year, I have made a few cuts, but I take blood tests monthly (sometimes every other month) so I have to be careful about hiding them and, as such, haven't made any recent ones. I guess my road downhill started off by my hanging out with the wrong crowd. These people who I label in the ""wrong crowd"" aren't socially wrong by any means. They don't drink, smoke, party, or go out except for extracurriculars and supplementary classes at all. They're all really smart (4.1 - 4.6 GPA students) and probably will become doctors and lawyers in the future. They're all extremely driven and some of them will probably be picked up by Ivy Leagues and brand-name colleges. I used to be one of them. I used to constantly stress about grades, about every single little point. I remember arguing for 0.5 points more on a daily quiz worth only 10% of my grade. But I guess in the middle of sophomore year, after having lived like a grade-demon for years, I just got tired. I got tired of school, tired of menial work, tired of looking at the number, tired of logging into my grade site everyday, tired of trying to be the perfect little Asian daughter. And so, I started procrastinating big time. And my grades slipped. I went from straight-A to two B's. And people will say ""Oh, B's are nothing. They're fine."" Yeah. But it gets worse. I slipped from an A student to an A- student then to a B student and now to a C student. I think I even have a D somewhere in there. Seriously I'm so tired of school. I'm done with my SATs and I'm above the 99th percentile for every single category, but my friends look at my score and tell me to retake it until I'm above 1550 since ""that's what colleges want"". I'm so tired. I'm taking five APs this year because I was trying to make up for the points I lost in sophomore year with my B's. For me, it's a never-ending cycle. I got tired of school and my grades slipped. And once my grades slipped, I got even more depressed and even more tired of school and my grades slipped even further. I tried to get help I really did. And it sounds so stupid that I'm depressed because of school. Because what the fuck? Is that even possible? I tried to get help, but my mom said that therapists don't work. And ever since then, I haven't asked. I don't even feel sorry for myself anymore. My depression has turned into outright self-hatred. My parents have spent thousands of dollars for supplementary classes and SATs, but with the C student status that I now have, what use are they? My best bet now is a community college. And when I told my friends this, they said ""No, you can do so much better than that. Aim for Ivy League. They'll definitely accept you. you're so smart."" Fuck I want to kill myself and shrivel up and die when I hear that. But get this: my parents don't care if I end up in community college, so why do I hate myself so much? my parents don't care if I'm a c student, so why do I care so much? my parents just want me to be happy and live well so why can't I do that? They don't care if thousands of dollars go to waste so why do I? they don't care if I'm not the daughter who will give them ten thousand dollars a month, so why do I? I seriously have no idea what my brain wants anymore. I want help, but I hate myself so much that I refuse to ask for help anymore, since in my sick and twisted logic I deserve this pain. I don't know what I need anymore. I don't even know why I'm posting this. The only reason I've been working hard these past few years was so that when I got older and got a high-end job that would pay six digits, I would be able to repay my parents and buy them a bunch of stuff. My mom's dream car is a Tesla. I want to buy it for her. My dad hasn't bought new clothes for at least a decade because he wants all his money to go to his two daughters' education. I want to buy some expensive watches and shoes for him. I want to give them so much. I don't just want them to live off of retirement money and interest. I'm such a fuck-up. I had such a bright future and then I ruined it because I was ""tired"". Like, shut the fuck up. I ruined myself and now I'm moaning and whining. I was on my way to a computer science major for a job in either the gaming industry or in the cybersecurity industry. And now I don't even know how to get back there anymore. I just want to stop existing. My parents mean the world to me and I can't just up and suicide on them. That'll destroy them. My mom once told me after watching a sad movie that if me or my sister died, she would never get over the heartbreak. So I can't do that to my parents. I'm stuck. There's no way out. I can't die before them. I don't even know where this post is going. Maybe it's just an emotional spill on the internet? I have no idea. "

I was so embarrassed I would skip class just so people wouldnt see me walking into the classroom. The Ritalin caused me to become horribly depressed and withdrawn. My homeroom teacher in middle school even told me she didnt know why I was in special classes. By high school they stopped forcing me to take Ritalin thanks to my Dad but I was so far behind all the other students I had completely given up on anything school related and started purposefully annoying teachers and skipping as much school as possible to the point that the state even threatened my parents with fees. Eventually I had to drop out of high school because the school would not let me into normal classes and there was no way I was going to be able to pass the states test. So I entered into a high school program at a local technical college and got my high school diploma and an AA degree in Information Technologies. I later found out the only way to get a decent job in IT is with a BA but the AA I got could not be transferred so I went to a local community college and earned a degree in Networking and Cybersecurity. &amp;nbsp; I was so proud when I graduated college my whole life I had been called stupid, ugly, and in middle school all the girls would call me Sasquatch but now I feel like I have wasted 4 years of my life working to get a degree in the IT field to discover that I hate IT, the people, the companies, the politics, shit pay, shit hours, always on call and never any respect. &amp;nbsp; I don't know what to do, I feel like my only real option is to just be a slave working for giant company earning minimal wage while constantly being treated like shit by customers/employees. I can't go back to doing IT customer service it makes me feel so horrible like I'm worthless like its middle school all over again. &amp;nbsp; I worked so hard and none of it matters no one will hire me for a real position. Im going through the motions of living but I feel like I have already given up. &amp;nbsp; After writing this I'm pretty sure I have a lot of repressed anger and self-esteem issues but I no idea how deal with it.
