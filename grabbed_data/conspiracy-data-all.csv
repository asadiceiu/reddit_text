There are several techniques for the control and manipulation of a internet forum no matter what, or who is on it. We will go over each technique and demonstrate that only a minimal number of operatives can be used to eventually and effectively gain a control of a 'uncontrolled forum.' ### Technique #1 - 'FORUM SLIDING' If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by 'forum sliding.' In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to 'age.' Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a 'forum slide.' The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a 'forum slide' and 'flush' the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then 'replying' to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting 'slides' down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items. ### Technique #2 - 'CONSENSUS CRACKING' A second highly effective technique is 'consensus cracking.' To develop a consensus crack, the following technique is used. Under the guise of a fake account a posting is made which looks legitimate and is towards the truth is made - but the critical point is that it has a VERY WEAK PREMISE without substantive proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under alternative fake accounts a very strong position in your favour is slowly introduced over the life of the posting. It is IMPERATIVE that both sides are initially presented, so the uninformed reader cannot determine which side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger 'evidence' or disinformation in your favour is slowly 'seeded in.' Thus the uninformed reader will most like develop the same position as you, and if their position is against you their opposition to your posting will be most likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings, you can then 'abort' the consensus cracking by initiating a 'forum slide.' ### Technique #3 - 'TOPIC DILUTION' Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a 'RESOURCE BURN.' By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a 'gossip mode.' In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to 'drive in the wedge.' By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator. ### Technique #4 - 'INFORMATION COLLECTION' Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a 'show you mine so me yours' posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered. An example is to post your 'favourite weapon' and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favourite 'technique of operation.' From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities. ### Technique #5 - 'ANGER TROLLING' Statistically, there is always a percentage of the forum posters who are more inclined to violence. In order to determine who these individuals are, it is a requirement to present a image to the forum to deliberately incite a strong psychological reaction. From this the most violent in the group can be effectively singled out for reverse IP location and possibly local enforcement tracking. To accomplish this only requires posting a link to a video depicting a local police officer massively abusing his power against a very innocent individual. Statistically of the million or so police officers in America there is always one or two being caught abusing there powers and the taping of the activity can be then used for intelligence gathering purposes - without the requirement to 'stage' a fake abuse video. This method is extremely effective, and the more so the more abusive the video can be made to look. Sometimes it is useful to 'lead' the forum by replying to your own posting with your own statement of violent intent, and that you 'do not care what the authorities think!!' inflammation. By doing this and showing no fear it may be more effective in getting the more silent and self-disciplined violent intent members of the forum to slip and post their real intentions. This can be used later in a court of law during prosecution. ### Technique #6 - 'GAINING FULL CONTROL' It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the 'ultimate victory' as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a 'honey pot' gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes. CONCLUSION Remember these techniques are only effective if the forum participants DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THEM. Once they are aware of these techniques the operation can completely fail, and the forum can become uncontrolled. At this point other avenues must be considered such as initiating a false legal precidence to simply have the forum shut down and taken offline. This is not desirable as it then leaves the enforcement agencies unable to track the percentage of those in the population who always resist attempts for control against them. Many other techniques can be utilized and developed by the individual and as you develop further techniques of infiltration and control it is imperative to share then with HQ. ## Twenty-Five Rules of Disinformation Note: The first rule and last five (or six, depending on situation) rules are generally not directly within the ability of the traditional disinfo artist to apply. These rules are generally used more directly by those at the leadership, key players, or planning level of the criminal conspiracy or conspiracy to cover up. Eight Traits of the Disinformationalist 1. Avoidance They never actually discuss issues head-on or provide constructive input, generally avoiding citation of references or credentials. Rather, they merely imply this, that, and the other. Virtually everything about their presentation implies their authority and expert knowledge in the matter without any further justification for credibility. 2. Selectivity They tend to pick and choose opponents carefully, either applying the hit-and-run approach against mere commentators supportive of opponents, or focusing heavier attacks on key opponents who are known to directly address issues. Should a commentator become argumentative with any success, the focus will shift to include the commentator as well. 3. Coincidental They tend to surface suddenly and somewhat coincidentally with a new controversial topic with no clear prior record of participation in general discussions in the particular public arena involved. They likewise tend to vanish once the topic is no longer of general concern. They were likely directed or elected to be there for a reason, and vanish with the reason. 4. Teamwork They tend to operate in self-congratulatory and complementary packs or teams. Of course, this can happen naturally in any public forum, but there will likely be an ongoing pattern of frequent exchanges of this sort where professionals are involved. Sometimes one of the players will infiltrate the opponent camp to become a source for straw man or other tactics designed to dilute opponent presentation strength. 5. Anti-conspiratorial They almost always have disdain for 'conspiracy theorists' and, usually, for those who in any way believe JFK was not killed by LHO. Ask yourself why, if they hold such disdain for conspiracy theorists, do they focus on defending a single topic discussed in a NG focusing on conspiracies? One might think they would either be trying to make fools of everyone on every topic, or simply ignore the group they hold in such disdain.Or, one might more rightly conclude they have an ulterior motive for their actions in going out of their way to focus as they do. 6. Artificial Emotions An odd kind of 'artificial' emotionalism and an unusually thick skin -- an ability to persevere and persist even in the face of overwhelming criticism and unacceptance. This likely stems from intelligence community training that, no matter how condemning the evidence, deny everything, and never become emotionally involved or reactive. The net result for a disinfo artist is that emotions can seem artificial. Most people, if responding in anger, for instance, will express their animosity throughout their rebuttal. But disinfo types usually have trouble maintaining the 'image' and are hot and cold with respect to pretended emotions and their usually more calm or unemotional communications style. It's just a job, and they often seem unable to 'act their role in character' as well in a communications medium as they might be able in a real face-to-face conversation/confrontation. You might have outright rage and indignation one moment, ho-hum the next, and more anger later -- an emotional yo-yo. With respect to being thick-skinned, no amount of criticism will deter them from doing their job, and they will generally continue their old disinfo patterns without any adjustments to criticisms of how obvious it is that they play that game -- where a more rational individual who truly cares what others think might seek to improve their communications style, substance, and so forth, or simply give up. 7. Inconsistent There is also a tendency to make mistakes which betray their true self/motives. This may stem from not really knowing their topic, or it may be somewhat 'freudian', so to speak, in that perhaps they really root for the side of truth deep within. I have noted that often, they will simply cite contradictory information which neutralizes itself and the author. For instance, one such player claimed to be a Navy pilot, but blamed his poor communicating skills (spelling, grammar, incoherent style) on having only a grade-school education. I'm not aware of too many Navy pilots who don't have a college degree. Another claimed no knowledge of a particular topic/situation but later claimed first-hand knowledge of it. 8. Time Constant Recently discovered, with respect to News Groups, is the response time factor. There are three ways this can be seen to work, especially when the government or other empowered player is involved in a cover up operation: a) ANY NG posting by a targeted proponent for truth can result in an IMMEDIATE response. The government and other empowered players can afford to pay people to sit there and watch for an opportunity to do some damage. SINCE DISINFO IN A NG ONLY WORKS IF THE READER SEES IT - FAST RESPONSE IS CALLED FOR, or the visitor may be swayed towards truth. b) When dealing in more direct ways with a disinformationalist, such as email, DELAY IS CALLED FOR - there will usually be a minimum of a 48-72 hour delay. This allows a sit-down team discussion on response strategy for best effect, and even enough time to 'get permission' or instruction from a formal chain of command. c) In the NG example 1) above, it will often ALSO be seen that bigger guns are drawn and fired after the same 48-72 hours delay - the team approach in play. This is especially true when the targeted truth seeker or their comments are considered more important with respect to potential to reveal truth. Thus, a serious truth sayer will be attacked twice for the same sin. ### How to Spot a Spy (Cointelpro Agent) One way to neutralize a potential activist is to get them to be in a group that does all the wrong things. Why? 1) The message doesn't get out. 2) A lot of time is wasted 3) The activist is frustrated and discouraged 4) Nothing good is accomplished. FBI and Police Informers and Infiltrators will infest any group and they have phoney activist organizations established. Their purpose is to prevent any real movement for justice or eco-peace from developing in this country. Agents come in small, medium or large. They can be of any ethnic background. They can be male or female. The actual size of the group or movement being infiltrated is irrelevant. It is the potential the movement has for becoming large which brings on the spies and saboteurs. This booklet lists tactics agents use to slow things down, foul things up, destroy the movement and keep tabs on activists. It is the agent's job to keep the activist from quitting such a group, thus keeping him/her under control. In some situations, to get control, the agent will tell the activist: ""You're dividing the movement."" [Here, I have added the psychological reasons as to WHY this maneuver works to control people] This invites guilty feelings. Many people can be controlled by guilt. The agents begin relationships with activists behind a well-developed mask of ""dedication to the cause."" Because of their often declared dedication, (and actions designed to prove this), when they criticize the activist, he or she - being truly dedicated to the movement - becomes convinced that somehow, any issues are THEIR fault. This is because a truly dedicated person tends to believe that everyone has a conscience and that nobody would dissimulate and lie like that ""on purpose."" It's amazing how far agents can go in manipulating an activist because the activist will constantly make excuses for the agent who regularly declares their dedication to the cause. Even if they do, occasionally, suspect the agent, they will pull the wool over their own eyes by rationalizing: ""they did that unconsciously... they didn't really mean it... I can help them by being forgiving and accepting "" and so on and so forth. The agent will tell the activist: ""You're a leader!"" This is designed to enhance the activist's self-esteem. His or her narcissistic admiration of his/her own activist/altruistic intentions increase as he or she identifies with and consciously admires the altruistic declarations of the agent which are deliberately set up to mirror those of the activist. This is ""malignant pseudoidentification."" It is the process by which the agent consciously imitates or simulates a certain behavior to foster the activist's identification with him/her, thus increasing the activist's vulnerability to exploitation. The agent will simulate the more subtle self-concepts of the activist. Activists and those who have altruistic self-concepts are most vulnerable to malignant pseudoidentification especially during work with the agent when the interaction includes matter relating to their competency, autonomy, or knowledge. The goal of the agent is to increase the activist's general empathy for the agent through pseudo-identification with the activist's self-concepts. The most common example of this is the agent who will compliment the activist for his competency or knowledge or value to the movement. On a more subtle level, the agent will simulate affects and mannerisms of the activist which promotes identification via mirroring and feelings of ""twinship"". It is not unheard of for activists, enamored by the perceived helpfulness and competence of a good agent, to find themselves considering ethical violations and perhaps, even illegal behavior, in the service of their agent/handler. The activist's ""felt quality of perfection"" [self-concept] is enhanced, and a strong empathic bond is developed with the agent through his/her imitation and simulation of the victim's own narcissistic investments. [self-concepts] That is, if the activist knows, deep inside, their own dedication to the cause, they will project that onto the agent who is ""mirroring"" them. The activist will be deluded into thinking that the agent shares this feeling of identification and bonding. In an activist/social movement setting, the adversarial roles that activists naturally play vis a vis the establishment/government, fosters ongoing processes of intrapsychic splitting so that ""twinship alliances"" between activist and agent may render whole sectors or reality testing unavailable to the activist. They literally ""lose touch with reality."" Activists who deny their own narcissistic investments [do not have a good idea of their own self-concepts and that they ARE concepts] and consciously perceive themselves (accurately, as it were) to be ""helpers"" endowed with a special amount of altruism are exceedingly vulnerable to the affective (emotional) simulation of the accomplished agent. Empathy is fostered in the activist through the expression of quite visible affects. The presentation of tearfulness, sadness, longing, fear, remorse, and guilt, may induce in the helper-oriented activist a strong sense of compassion, while unconsciously enhancing the activist's narcissistic investment in self as the embodiment of goodness. The agent's expresssion of such simulated affects may be quite compelling to the observer and difficult to distinguish from deep emotion. It can usually be identified by two events: 1. the activist who has analyzed his/her own narcissistic roots and is aware of his/her own potential for being ""emotionally hooked,"" will be able to remain cool and unaffected by such emotional outpourings by the agent. 2. The agent will recompensate much too quickly following such an affective expression leaving the activist with the impression that ""the play has ended, the curtain has fallen,"" and the imposture, for the moment, has finished. The agent will then move quickly to another activist/victim. The fact is, the movement doesn't need leaders, it needs ### Movers ""Follow the leader"" is a waste of time. A good agent will want to meet as often as possible. He or she will talk a lot and say little. One can expect an onslaught of long, unresolved discussions. Some agents take on a pushy, arrogant, or defensive manner: 1) To disrupt the agenda 2) To side-track the discussion 3) To interrupt repeatedly 4) To feign ignorance 5) To make an unfounded accusation against a person. Calling someone a racist, for example. This tactic is used to discredit a person in the eyes of all other group members. ### Saboteurs Some saboteurs pretend to be activists. She or he will .... 1) Write encyclopedic flyers (in the present day, websites) 2) Print flyers in English only. 3) Have demonstrations in places where no one cares. 4) Solicit funding from rich people instead of grass roots support 5) Display banners with too many words that are confusing. 6) Confuse issues. 7) Make the wrong demands. 8) Cool Compromise the goal. 9) Have endless discussions that waste everyone's time. The agent may accompany the endless discussions with drinking, pot smoking or other amusement to slow down the activist's work. ### Provocateurs 1) Want to establish ""leaders"" to set them up for a fall in order to stop the movement. 2) Suggest doing foolish, illegal things to get the activists in trouble. 3) Encourage militancy. 4) Want to taunt the authorities. 5) Attempt to make the activist compromise their values. 6) Attempt to instigate violence. Activisim ought to always be non-violent. 7) Attempt to provoke revolt among people who are ill-prepared to deal with the reaction of the authorities to such violence. ### Informants 1) Want everyone to sign up and sing in and sign everything. 2) Ask a lot of questions (gathering data). 3) Want to know what events the activist is planning to attend. 4) Attempt to make the activist defend him or herself to identify his or her beliefs, goals, and level of committment. Recruiting Legitimate activists do not subject people to hours of persuasive dialog. Their actions, beliefs, and goals speak for themselves. Groups that DO recruit are missionaries, military, and fake political parties or movements set up by agents. ### Surveillance ALWAYS assume that you are under surveillance. At this point, if you are NOT under surveillance, you are not a very good activist! Scare Tactics They use them. Such tactics include slander, defamation, threats, getting close to disaffected or minimally committed fellow activists to persuade them (via psychological tactics described above) to turn against the movement and give false testimony against their former compatriots. They will plant illegal substances on the activist and set up an arrest; they will plant false information and set up ""exposure,"" they will send incriminating letters [emails] in the name of the activist; and more; they will do whatever society will allow. This booklet in no way covers all the ways agents use to sabotage the lives of sincere an dedicated activists. If an agent is ""exposed,"" he or she will be transferred or replaced. COINTELPRO is still in operation today under a different code name. It is no longer placed on paper where it can be discovered through the freedom of information act. The FBI counterintelligence program's stated purpose: To expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, and otherwise neutralize individuals who the FBI categorize as opposed to the National Interests. ""National Security"" means the FBI's security from the people ever finding out the vicious things it does in violation of people's civil liberties. ### Disinformation Seventeen Techniques for Truth Suppression Strong, credible allegations of high-level criminal activity can bring down a government. When the government lacks an effective, fact-based defense, other techniques must be employed. The success of these techniques depends heavily upon a cooperative, compliant press and a mere token opposition party. 1. Dummy up. If it's not reported, if it's not news, it didn't happen. 2. Wax indignant. This is also known as the ""How dare you?"" gambit. 3. Characterize the charges as ""rumors"" or, better yet, ""wild rumors."" If, in spite of the news blackout, the public is still able to learn about the suspicious facts, it can only be through ""rumors."" (If they tend to believe the ""rumors"" it must be because they are simply ""paranoid"" or ""hysterical."") 4. Knock down straw men. Deal only with the weakest aspects of the weakest charges. Even better, create your own straw men. Make up wild rumors (or plant false stories) and give them lead play when you appear to debunk all the charges, real and fanciful alike. 5. Call the skeptics names like ""conspiracy theorist,"" ""nutcase,"" ""ranter,"" ""kook,"" ""crackpot,"" and, of course, ""rumor monger."" Be sure, too, to use heavily loaded verbs and adjectives when characterizing their charges and defending the ""more reasonable"" government and its defenders. You must then carefully avoid fair and open debate with any of the people you have thus maligned. For insurance, set up your own ""skeptics"" to shoot down. 6. Impugn motives. Attempt to marginalize the critics by suggesting strongly that they are not really interested in the truth but are simply pursuing a partisan political agenda or are out to make money (compared to over-compensated adherents to the government line who, presumably, are not). 7. Invoke authority. Here the controlled press and the sham opposition can be very useful. 8. Dismiss the charges as ""old news."" 9. Come half-clean. This is also known as ""confession and avoidance"" or ""taking the limited hangout route."" This way, you create the impression of candor and honesty while you admit only to relatively harmless, less-than-criminal ""mistakes."" This stratagem often requires the embrace of a fall-back position quite different from the one originally taken. With effective damage control, the fall-back position need only be peddled by stooge skeptics to carefully limited markets. 10. Characterize the crimes as impossibly complex and the truth as ultimately unknowable. 11. Reason backward, using the deductive method with a vengeance. With thoroughly rigorous deduction, troublesome evidence is irrelevant. E.g. We have a completely free press. If evidence exists that the Vince Foster ""suicide"" note was forged, they would have reported it. They haven't reported it so there is no such evidence. Another variation on this theme involves the likelihood of a conspiracy leaker and a press who would report the leak. 12. Require the skeptics to solve the crime completely. E.g. If Foster was murdered, who did it and why? 13. Change the subject. This technique includes creating and/or publicizing distractions. 14. Lightly report incriminating facts, and then make nothing of them. This is sometimes referred to as ""bump and run"" reporting. 15. Baldly and brazenly lie. A favorite way of doing this is to attribute the ""facts"" furnished the public to a plausible-sounding, but anonymous, source. 16. Expanding further on numbers 4 and 5, have your own stooges ""expose"" scandals and champion popular causes. Their job is to pre-empt real opponents and to play 99-yard football. A variation is to pay rich people for the job who will pretend to spend their own money. 17. Flood the Internet with agents. This is the answer to the question, ""What could possibly motivate a person to spend hour upon hour on Internet news groups defending the government and/or the press and harassing genuine critics?"" Don t the authorities have defenders enough in all the newspapers, magazines, radio, and television? One would think refusing to print critical letters and screening out serious callers or dumping them from radio talk shows would be control enough, but, obviously, it is not."
1,vulnerability,conspiracy,Evidence for Massive and Consistent Manipulation of the Electronic Vote in U.S. Federal Elections Since at Least 2004,1,iejqow,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/iejqow/evidence_for_massive_and_consistent_manipulation/,2020-08-23 00:49:26," The evidence for massive manipulation of electronic voting machines in the United States since 2004 or earlier, which has had substantial influence on election results at the Presidential, Congressional, and state gubernatorial levels, is overwhelming. Ive been studying this issue since Election Night 2004, worked as a volunteer for the Election Defense Alliance (EDA) as their data coordinator for a few years, and wrote a book, [Democracy Undone](URL Unequal Representation, The Threat to our Election System, and Impending Demise of American Democracy, published by *Biting Duck Press* in 2012. Since then, a great deal more evidence has accumulated. Ive recently written a 52 page summary of the major evidence that Im aware of, which is solely focused on election fraud involving our voting machines. Because that document is too large to post here, the information in this post is a brief summary of the larger document. If you are interested in exploring this further, you can access the full document [at this link](URL And if you have questions about it that arent answered on this thread or would like to discuss it with me further for any reason, you can e-mail me at [daletavris@gmail.com](mailto:daletavris@gmail.com). Some people have expressed concern to me that writing about election fraud is dangerous because it potentially could depress voter turnout and consequently hurt Democrats. I have two comments about that: First, nobody should ever take allegations of election fraud, proof of election fraud, on anything in between allegations and proof, as a reason not to vote. Despite all that I have written about election fraud in the United States, I have never thought that the capacity to cheat in infinite. It seems quite obvious to me that it has limits, though I dont know exactly what those limits are. Consequently, other than finding a way and the political will to prevent the cheating (See Section 9, below), the best way to prevent it from changing the results of an election is to run up a large margin of victory  which prevented the substantial cheating in our 2008 Presidential election from changing the results of that election. And secondly, I think that discussing election fraud is unlikely to depress turnout much (it could increase turnout, out of anger), if it does depress turnout I see no reason why it wouldnt depress it equally on both sides, and in any event, I see election fraud in our country as a far greater danger than depressed turnout. Indeed, I believe that there will never again be meaningful reform in our country on any issue that affects the wealth and power of those who control our voting machines, unless and until this issue is adequately addressed and remedied. With that in mind, here is a brief summary of most of the major evidence that I am aware of: &amp;#x200B; **1. Large, Widespread, and Consistent Deviations of Exit Polls from Official Election Results** Since 2004 or earlier, exit polls for national elections have repeatedly deviated by large amounts from official vote counts, and this deviation is almost always in the same direction: Whenever the deviation is large, the more right-wing candidate receives a larger share of the official vote than what is predicted by exit polls. When this happens, the deviation of the exit poll from the official vote count is known as a red-shift. Large, statistically significant, and numerous red-shifts occurred in federal elections in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2014, 2016 (including the Democratic Presidential primaries), and 2020 (Democratic Presidential primaries). In 2012 they were negligible to non-existent. In 2018 they didnt appear to affect House races at all, but fraud that resulted in red-shifts probably changed the results of the Florida and Missouri U.S. Senate races and the Florida and Ohio Governor races. It is almost certain that it changed the results of the [Presidential elections of 2004](URL and [2016](URL and likely the [Democratic Presidential primaries of 2016](URL and 2020. Undoubtedly, the fraud that was almost certainly behind most of these red-shifts has had great influence in determining the composition of our Congress, in the years noted above, and beyond, to this day. I have specific data by state for the Presidential general elections of 2004 and 2016 and the Presidential Democratic primaries of 2016 and 2020 (Im not including Republican primaries here because the concept of red-shift doesnt make sense for a Republican primary, since all of the candidates are so far right-wing  and consequently, the exit polls for the Republican primaries have been pretty much on target with the official election results). For all of these elections together, there were a total of 122 state elections/primaries where exit polls were performed. Of those 122 state elections, there were 45 statistically significant red-shifts and 2 statistically significant blue-shifts (on the basis of random chance, one should have expected to see approximately 3 red-shifts and 3 blue shifts). In the general elections, those red-shifts were very highly concentrated in swing states. In those swing states, the exit polls in the two Presidential elections combined predicted wins for the Democratic candidate in 9 state elections that the Republican won, and it was those states that ended up determining the winner of the Electoral College (George W. Bush in 2004, Donald Trump in 2016). In the Democratic primaries, the assessment of red-shift involved a comparison of Bernie Sanders vs. his closest competitor (Clinton in 2016, Buttigieg in the New Hampshire 2020 primary, and Biden in all of the other 2020 primaries). The red-shifts in the Democratic primaries of 2016 and 2020 were even larger and more frequent than the red-shifts in the 2004 and 2016 general Presidential elections. For those who believe the corporate news media propaganda that exit polls are not a useful tool for monitoring our elections, keep in mind the following: Exit polls are used in many other countries for the purpose of monitoring elections; the United States, though it never uses exit polls to monitor its own elections, has often sponsored exit polls for that purpose for use in other countries, and some of those elections, which were characterized by large discrepancies between the exit poll and the official result, were overturned because they were considered fraudulent; though the United States doesnt use exit polls for the purpose of monitoring its own elections, it does use them for other purposes, including the [early calling of its elections](URL sometimes before any official votes are counted, and for the purpose of displaying data for public consumption on voter demographic and other characteristics by whom they voted for. The vast magnitude, frequency, and consistency of red-shifting of our federal elections in our country since at least 2004 could not possibly be due to random chance. That leaves only two possibilities: Massive election rigging, almost always in favor of the more right-wing candidate; or Massive, pervasive exit poll bias, always or almost always favoring the more left-wing candidate What could cause such a massive amount of exit poll bias, persistently over close to two decades, in so many states across our country, for a wide variety of different candidates, and almost always pointing in the same direction? What we are talking about is the possibility of a pervasive and consistent reluctance of right-wing voters to participate in exit polls. Good scientific studies on this issue, closely following the massive numbers of red-shifts found in the 2004 Presidential election, could not identify any evidence to support the theory of exit poll bias, and [even found good evidence against it](URL I find such a massive and persistent exit poll bias not to be plausible. Trump voters dont strike me as meek and unlikely to participate in exit polls that allow them to voice support for their candidate. If exit poll bias explained the ubiquitous red-shifting that weve been seeing for so many years, then it should occur approximately equally in competitive and non-competitive elections. But if the red-shifting is explained by election fraud, then it should be far more frequent in competitive than in non-competitive elections, because there is little or no motivation to rig a non-competitive election. So that issue was tested in a [study that compared red-shifting in competitive vs. non-competitive elections](URL and it was found that red-shifting occurs much more in competitive that in non-competitive elections  thus providing significant additional evidence for the idea that the red-shifting that weve been seeing is due to election fraud rather than exit poll bias. &amp;#x200B; **2. The Vulnerability of our Vote Counting Machines to Fraud** The United States is [ranked last among the 47 long-established democracies](URL by the Election Integrity Project founded by the Kennedy School of Government. There are many reasons for this. One of the most important reasons is the vulnerability of our electronic vote counting process to election fraud. Both the running of our elections and the registering of voters have to a large extent been turned over to private for-profit corporations in recent years. Today the voting machine industry is [dominated by just three or four corporations](URL These corporations have displayed great resistance to any laws or policies that would make their voting systems more transparent or less susceptible to fraud, and they have been [very right-wing, with ties to the Republican Party](URL The unreliability of our electronic voting machines is only part of the problem. Im much more concerned about the well-known potential for them to be hacked or programmed for fraud. Worse yet, the voting machine owners have steadfastly refused to allow election integrity activists or anyone else to inspect their machines for potential fraud, before or after elections, [claiming that their machines are proprietary](URL meaning private property. Unbelievably (to me), our courts have repeatedly and consistently supported them in this claim! The courts even supported them in [denying John Kerrys request](URL to have some of them inspected prior to the Presidential election of 2004. And furthermore, many of the key staffers involved in running our elections have been [accused or convicted of various white-collar crimes](URL including conspiracy, bribery, bid rigging, computer fraud, tax fraud, stock fraud, mail fraud, extortion, and drug trafficking. For God sake, many of our states wont even allow a person to vote, for the rest of their lives, after being convicted of any of these crimes. It's very difficult for me to fathom how this kind of thing can be allowed in a country that claims to be a democracy. &amp;#x200B; **3. The Tremendous Obstacles to Utilizing Hand Recounts of Paper** **Ballots** Hand recounts of paper ballots are potentially critically important because (when available) they are by far the best way to investigate suspected election fraud due to manipulation of the electronically produced vote count, and to determine the true vote count. Indeed, one could argue in most instances that that is the *only* way to prove election fraud and to determine the true vote count. Yet, in the United States hand recounts of paper ballots have proven to be extremely difficult to obtain except when the margin of victory is extremely thin. Sometimes they are impossible to perform because no paper trail of the vote is available. In the 2016 elections, [28% of U.S. voters lived in jurisdictions which used only DRE (Direct Recording Electronic) voting machines](URL for counting our votes, and another 19% of voters lived in jurisdictions where both DRE and optical scan voting systems were in use. DRE machines are those for which the voters do not directly produce a paper trail, meaning that they record their vote electronically only. Some DRE machines produce associated paper trails and some do not. When they do not produce a paper trail there is no way that the votes can be recounted by hand because the votes exist only in electronic form. But even when a DRE machine does produce a paper trail the situation is problematic because, among other problems, it may not be clear that the paper trail produced by the machines is accurate  If the electronic vote is programmed for fraud, then the same machine may also be programmed to produce a fraudulent paper trail. Most U.S. voters do directly produce a paper trail when they vote, usually using an optical scan machine  where the voter makes a mark directly on the ballot itself, and then deposits the ballot in a box, where the ballot is stored, and will potentially be available for recounting if requested, or required by state law because of a very small margin of victory. But even when optical scan machines are used, over 95% of the time the votes are counted by the machine, rather than by hand. And what is worse, in the United States hand recounts of paper ballots are rarely done, as noted above. Recounts usually cost a great deal of money, which may prove impossible to raise. The election winner generally uses every legal measure available to block them on the rare occasions on which they are requested. Ordinary U.S. citizens have no legal standing to even request them. Only the losing candidates for the office have legal standing to request them, and losing Democratic candidates have rarely requested recounts because of great pressure not to request them (unless the victory margin is razor thin). Except for some elections with very thin victory margins, whenever hand recounts have actually been performed in high profile elections they have been corrupted to the point where they are worthless. Despite the many red-shifts in the 21st Century noted above, Im pretty sure that there has never been a valid hand recount of machine counted votes in the United States in a situation where the initial machine count demonstrated a red-shift when compared with an exit poll. In my full document on election fraud, which I linked to above, I describe in detail the five examples of U.S. elections that Im aware of where the results were highly suspicious and therefore screamed out for the need for a valid hand recount, and yet it wasnt done. Three of these examples involved Presidential elections (2004 and 2016 general elections, and 2016 Democratic primaries). In three of the examples the suspicions arose from exit polls that demonstrated large and statistically significant red-shifts. Of the five examples, two involved corrupted recounts, which were corrupted among other ways by the simple fact that those running the recount were [caught changing the results of the recount to match the official count](URL In one of those cases, this was done (as noted by a whistleblower) upon the instructions of a voting machine company representative. In one of the examples, [ballots were destroyed upon the orders of the supervisor of elections](URL while the case was pending in court. In another of the examples, a partial hand recount of 0.4% of the states ballots showed large gains by the losing candidate (Bill Nelson, running for re-election for U.S. Senator from Florida) which, if extrapolated to the rest of the state would have given that candidate a lead of tens of thousands of votes. And yet, there was no follow-up to the partial recount, with the only rationale being that the partial recount failed to give the losing candidate the lead. And in the last example, Donald Trump sued to prevent or stop hand recounts in three states with highly suspicious results, and all three state courts supported him (PA, WI, MI), thus stopping or preventing the recounts. In all five examples it was the more right-wing candidate who won the election, absent a valid hand recount. In only one of the above examples was anyone prosecuted for the malfeasance I described. In each of the five examples it was the more right-wing candidate who won the election, and in none of the examples did I hear or see a single word on the subject from our corporate news media. None of these things should happen in a country that calls itself a democracy. &amp;#x200B; **4. Voting Machine Glitches Favoring Right-Wing Candidates** Although the title of this section might suggest that I cherry picked my examples, the truth is that I am not aware of any significant examples of progressive candidates benefitting from voting machine glitches. Of the examples I provide in this section, the most convincing is [my analysis of voter observed complaints of vote switching](URL from one Presidential candidate to another in the 2004 Presidential election, because that example involved a systematic scientific study rather than stand-alone anecdotal examples. In that analysis I searched the national Election Incidence Reporting System (EIRS) for reports of voter observed computer vote switching from one Presidential candidate to another. I found the database to contain 87 reports of vote switches from Kerry to Bush, and only 7 reports of switches from Bush to Kerry  a 12 to 1 ratio in favor of Bush. Of those 87 cases of reported vote switches from Kerry to Bush, a highly disproportionate number of them, 67 of the 87, came from one of the 11 swing states, which represented a *rate* of reports that was 9 times higher in swing states than in non-swing states. The 87 voter reports of vote switching from Kerry to Bush almost certainly represented the very small tip of a much larger iceberg. That seems like a plausible conclusion for many reason: Several of the EIRS reports include statements by the voter something to the effect that the switches were happening all day at their precinct; many voters would not have noticed the vote switch; the vast majority of voters would not have even been aware of the EIRS system, and; it seems unlikely that even a significant percent of voters who were aware of it would have taken the time to report a complaint to the system. In addition, there were other sources than EIRS that strongly supported the idea that reports to EIRS included only a very small portion of the total voter observed switches. For example, the *Washington Post* [identified 25 voting machines in a single city](URL in Ohio (the state whose Electoral votes determined the winner of the 2004 election) that switched an unknown number of votes from Kerry to Bush, while there were only 8 reports to EIRS of such switches in the whole state of Ohio in 2004. Nobody knows for sure if the machine glitches that have been noticed and reported were accidental or purposeful. But if they were accidental, then how can it be explained why such a highly disproportionate number of them favored the more right-wing candidate at the expense of the more progressive candidate, and how can it be explained why such a highly disproportionate number of them reported in Presidential elections came from swing states? And because courts have disallowed any inspection of the machines by election integrity activists or anyone else, the matter could never be proven one way or they other. Furthermore, certainly whoever programmed the machines to act this way would not have wanted these glitches to have been observed  thus suggesting that there were likely many more such glitches than we know about that were never identified by anyone outside of those who programmed them. &amp;#x200B; **5. Right-Wing Candidates Perform Better When Votes Are Counted by Machines** When red-shifts are the result of election fraud, then we should expect to see greater discrepancy between exit polls and official vote counts (red-shifting), as well as better performance in the official vote count for the more right-wing candidate, where votes are counted by machines than where paper ballots are counted by hand, because it is widely accepted among those knowledgeable about our voting process that hand counting of votes is far less vulnerable to substantial fraud than machine counting of votes. In every example that I am aware of, where someone decided to evaluate red-shifts or official vote count for hand counted vs. machine counted jurisdictions (because of suspicions about the accuracy of the official vote count), the more right-wing candidate was found to perform better and/or be the beneficiary of a red-shift in the machine counted jurisdictions, and the more progressive candidate was found to perform better in the hand counted jurisdictions (thus supporting the suggestions of exit polls that demonstrated large and statistically significant red-shifts). I discuss the details of such analyses in my larger document on election fraud. These examples include the 2004 Presidential election, 2010 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts, and the [2020 Democratic primaries in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts](URL Here Ill discuss only some of the details from the 2004 Presidential election. In that election, a [report written by Warren Mitofski](URL (See page 40), whose company produced the exit polls for that election, contained a table that presented a variable called WPE (Within Precinct Error), which was an indication of amount of red-shift, with negative values of WPE representing red-shift. The average WPE for each precinct that was exit polled in the whole country was represented in the table for each type of machine and for hand counted paper ballots. The average WPE for each machine type varied between -6.1 and -10.6 (meaning large red-shifts for each machine type), compared to an average WPE for hand counted ballots of -2.2 (meaning a much smaller red-shift). This is a substantial and undoubtedly statistically significant difference between hand counted vs. machine counted precincts. What the table shows is that the more right-wing candidate (in this case George W. Bush) vastly over-performed in the official vote count, *as compared with exit poll predictions*, in machine counted precincts, while the difference between exit polls and official vote counts was far less in hand counted precincts. That is exactly what would be predicted if and only if the machines were programmed to manipulate the vote count in favor of Bush. &amp;#x200B; **6. Testimony, Pending Testimony, and Deaths Associated with Election Fraud in the 2004 Presidential election.** The deaths of two men who appeared to be on the verge of blowing open the evidence for election fraud in the 2004 Presidential election shine additional light on this issue: &amp;#x200B; *The death of Raymond Lemme* In October 2000 Clint Curtis, a computer programmer and a life-long Republican who worked for the Florida based Yang Enterprises, Inc. (YEI), wrote a computer program for switching votes from one candidate to another, at the request of Republican operative and Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, Tom Feeney, according to [Curtis sworn testimony](URL to House Judiciary Committee Democrats in December 2004. According to his testimony, Curtis believed at the time that the purpose of Feeneys request was to better understand how *Democrats* might plan to commit election fraud. But after be became aware that the purpose of the program was to actually switch votes in the 2004 Presidential election, he reported the incident to the state of Florida, which then appointed Raymond Lemme from the Florida Inspector Generals Office to investigate Curtis allegations. In his affidavit to the House Democrats, Curtis described a June 2003 meeting with Lemme, where Lemme told Curtis that he (Lemme) had tracked the corruption all the way to the top, and that the story would break shortly. But two weeks later, on July 1, 2003, Lemme was found dead in a Valdosta, Georgia, Knights Inn motel room bathtub. His arm was slashed twice with a razor blade, near the left elbow. The *Brad Blog* thoroughly investigated this case and [put forth several reasons](URL to believe that Lemmes death was not suicide, as had been ruled by the Valdosta police. &amp;#x200B; *The death of Michael Connell* Michael Connell was a high-level Republican operative and IT consultant, sometimes referred to as Karl Roves IT guru. At the time of the 2004 national election he was president of GovTech solutions, which was hired by Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell to set up an election website for the Ohio presidential 2004 elections. Given the red-shift of 6.7% in the Ohio 2004 presidential election, the numerous irregularities surrounding that election, and the fact that the awarding of Ohio to Bush was responsible for his re-election, numerous lawsuits were brought in Ohio to challenge the election results. Given Connells close connections with Karl Rove and the Bush campaign, in combination with his official duties with respect to the presidential election in Ohio, he was sought to provide testimony in connection with a case that alleged tampering with the 2004 election. It was alleged in the case that Connell participated in vote tampering. On September 17 and October 26, 2008, Stephen Spoonamore, a computer security expert and friend or associate of Connell, [submitted](URL [affidavits](URL that explained how he believed that the 2004 Presidential election was stolen in Ohio through computers that were under Connells control, and what he believed to be Connells role in the theft. On September 22, 2008, [Connell was subpoenaed to testify](URL in the case about the matters that Spoonamore had raised. Connell initially sought to avoid testifying, and [even put forth a motion to quash his subpoena](URL But that motion was denied. When it became apparent that Connell would testify in the case, [Connell was warned not to fly his plane](URL Cliff Arnebeck, the Ohio lawyer who brought the suit and subpoenaed Connell, warned the U.S. Justice Department that Connells life might be in danger, and requested witness protection. On December 19, shortly before he was scheduled to testify, [Connell died in a plane crash](URL presumably caused by his plane running out of gas, though circumstances [strongly suggested otherwise](URL &amp;#x200B; **7. National Corporate News Media and Other Power Structure Ignoring of Election Fraud** With the exception of Keith Olbermann for a period of time following the 2004 Presidential election, our national corporate news media never peeps a word about the issues Ive discussed in this document. Although they are willing to acknowledge, when pressed, that our voting system is vulnerable to fraud, they make every effort to assure us that it rarely if ever actually occurs, or that it hasnt changed the results of our elections if and when it has occurred. Indeed, they refer to people who believe that election fraud in a U.S. national election actually changed the results of an election, as conspiracy theorists, which they mean in a derogatory sense. They want us to believe that it is unthinkable that such a thing could happen in this country or that a sane and sensible U.S. citizen could believe such a thing. They are willing to acknowledge other forms of unfair elections, such as voter suppression, gerrymandering, and absurdly undue influence of money in politics, but the subject of actual successful electronic rigging of our elections remains an absolutely taboo subject among our national news media, politicians, and even most progressive news outlets. Yes, there has been a lot of talk by our news media of Russian interference in our 2016 Presidential election, and their intent to do so again in 2020. But when our corporate news media talks about this they are usually careful to reassure us that there is no evidence that Russian interference in our 2016 election actually changed any results. And to the extent that they sometimes omit such reassurances, I guess that this can be tolerated by the fact that it involves a foreign country, rather than the admission of internal, American rigging of our elections. In 2008, Nate Silver wrote an article titled [Ten Reasons You Should Ignore Exit Polls](URL Silver is perhaps the most well-known and respected pollster in our country. Consequently, when most people read his article on reasons to ignore exit polls, they take it at face value. Indeed, I have seen it cited by many people in arguing that exit polls are totally useless for the purpose of monitoring elections. Yet none of the 10 reasons for ignoring exit polls that Silver cites in his article is in fact a valid reason for ignoring exit polls or for suggesting that they arent of value in monitoring elections. I have read many of Silvers other articles, and they all point to the fact that he is highly intelligent and has a great deal of statistical expertise. So why would such a highly respected pollster write such nonsense? I can only conclude that he was persuaded to do so by some very powerful people. I have no idea what form this persuasion took, but I can think of no other reason why he would risk his reputation among knowledgeable people by writing such nonsense. Here is one of the critiques Ive written where I explain [the many fallacies in Silvers denigration of exit polls](URL Massive election fraud in the United States, or even unsubstantiated *evidence* of it is, I believe, one of the most important news stories of our times  for the simple reason that everything else depends on it. I believe that we wont be able to have meaningful reform in anything until this issue is adequately addressed, because our current government is far too corrupt to do anything that benefits ordinary people but which displeases those who control them. Therefore, this issue should currently be a central focus, if not *the* central focus of our news media, and I look upon the consistent efforts of our national corporate news media to conceal or willfully ignore this issue with great cynicism. &amp;#x200B; **8. Why Do we Keep on Electing and Re-electing People so Unresponsive to our Needs?** American approval of its elected representatives in Congress over the past decade and a half has been extremely low for what one would expect of a Democracy with fair elections. Since March, 2005,[ Gallup polling has shown a Congressional approval rate](URL that has hovered between 9% and 39%, not once hitting as high as 40%, with the vast majority of polls indicating approval rates in the teens or twenties. It seems as if either the people whom we vote for arent the same people who are winning elections, or that, if they are, for some reason, once they take office, they feel little or no need to respond to the desires or needs of their constituents, and yet their constituents keep on voting for them. How can this happen? Of course, there are several counts on which our elections are unfair, other than manipulation of our electronic vote counts, including voter suppression, gerrymandering, the undue influence of money in politics, and bias of our national corporate news media. But I believe that the most important barrier to fair elections, in large part because it is invisible to public awareness, is the direct manipulation of the machines that count our votes It seems to me that if a reason other than electronic manipulation of the vote was the main cause for electing the wrong people to public office, then *that* would be the most taboo subject, not electronic manipulation of the vote. I believe that the fact that this subject is so taboo in our country among news organizations and politicians, with no other plausible reason to explain that taboo, points to electronic manipulation of our votes as the major reason why we repeatedly elect to public office people who choose to serve the wishes of the powerful rather than the needs of those who presumably vote for them. The wealthy and powerful of our country tend to choose what is nationally taboo and what isnt. It makes sense that they would choose as the most taboo subject that which has the greatest potential to cut into their wealth and power if it comes to public attention. &amp;#x200B; **9. The solution** The solution is technically very simple. There are just a few basic principles: *1. Elections are a public, not a private matter* To the extent that private individuals or corporations have any role to play in our elections at all, they have no right whatsoever to restrict the public from examining any and all evidence pertaining to the counting of our votes, before or after elections. The fact that in a nation that calls itself a Democracy, we have allowed private corporations (often or usually with obvious vested interests in the outcome of the elections) to count our votes and then *successfully* restrict the public from examining evidence that could help to resolve questions about the integrity of our elections, is absurd. Any of our elected representatives who have contributed to this should be ashamed of themselves, and they should be removed from office. *2. Vote counts must be verifiable* That is, we cannot entrust the counting of our votes to machines that produce results that cannot be verified. Being verifiable means that the votes must be available in a physical form -- not just on a computer, which can be programmed to miscount the votes. Ideally, all vote counting should be done by hand counting of paper ballots. But if we cant bring ourselves to accept this process of vote counting in return for verifiable election results, then we can go to solution #s 3 and 4: *3. There must be a solid verification process in place, to be used whenever elections produce controversial results, regardless of how large the margin of victory is* Having a verifiable system in place is of no value whatsoever if it isnt used. There have been many very high profile national elections this century which evidence strongly suggests were stolen, and yet in every case where a full and properly conducted recount (i.e. hand recount of paper ballots) should have resolved the issue, all efforts for verification were successfully blocked. The blocking of efforts to verify the integrity of our elections takes many forms. We have seen that the cost of having a statewide hand recount of the vote is sometimes jacked up to well over a million dollars, as a means of obstructing recounts. Individual citizens should not have the responsibility for raising money to pay for a recount. Recounts should be built into the system, and the cost, which should be minimal especially if public volunteers are willing to donate their time, should be borne by the government. There should be a very low bar for hand recounting our elections, based on simple criteria that should be written into law so that our right-wing courts cant block them. *4. There must be a valid monitoring process used for all elections, that will detect red flags as a signal that a recount is necessary* Valid means of monitoring elections include exit polls or audits. If exit polls or audits (i.e. hand counts of statistically valid samples of the votes) indicate that the election results are suspicious, then a hand recount of the entire jurisdiction should be done. This should NOT be dependent upon anyone requesting the recount or upon court rulings. It should be automatic whenever the red flag appears, indicating suspicious results. The integrity of our elections is the most important issue facing the American people today. Without fair elections we have no democracy. Without fair elections we should expect that we will be ruled by someone elses choice of rulers, rather than our own  as we are to a large extent today. We can expect that those in power will cater to the whims of those who put them in power, rather than to our needs. The solution to the problem is technically very simple. It is mainly a matter of the political will to demand that we get our democracy back."
2,vulnerability,conspiracy,The Origin of the Virus,3,hlwfdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hlwfdj/the_origin_of_the_virus/,2020-07-06 09:16:04,"I know some people think that the covid virus isnt real. Some people think its real but are advocates for its low mortality rate. And the rest of us are afraid of it because we dont want anyone we know to die. But once again I have to go back to the beginning and question where the virus came from and why. This virus is obviously man made. But there was a huge push to say it started with zoonotic transmission. I think they were hoping people would be gullible enough to buy that claim. This is where predictive programming with the movie Contagion comes into play. If it wasnt zoonotic then it was man made in a lab. There is at least one benign reason to do this which is vaccine research. And there is a theory that it was accidentally released in China because of the lack of proper safety measures. But other theories heavily outweigh this. So then we must ask, why else would it be made? Some of the more sinister theories include the following: 1. China created the virus and released it to bring down the American economy and destroy the global infrastructure in order to become the dominating force. They knew their country would be hit hard but were confident in their strict authoritarian measures to keep it in check. Too many countries are dependent on Chinese products and they know it. 2. Iran released the virus in retaliation to the assassination of General Qasem Soleimani. Or to set off a chain of events which will lead us into WW3. This could have been done with the help of China seeing as they have a large stake in Irans structural development. 3. The virus was released by whichever garden variety secret organization in order to bring us into a new world order and maybe depopulate a few places along the way, i.e the Georgia Guidestones. Societal collapse would be the main goal, making the U.S vulnerable and ready for the taking. 3. The Gates Foundation theory is probably the most complex and full of potential possibilities. Its definitely more strategic like a game. Each move has a purpose or sets off a certain reaction in order for the next move to come into play. * Perhaps the foundation released the virus hoping it would have a successful mortality rate which would create wide acceptance of a vaccine. Many believe they desire to track us or force a digital currency into everyone, or thats its going to be mark of the beast. But there are other motivations for the vaccine * Bill Gates refers to something called pandemic number two. What if the vaccine contains a deadly hidden virus which eventually manifests itself? Or what if the vaccine creates a vulnerability making everyone susceptible to the pandemic 2 virus yet to be released? * Another vaccine motivation could be mass infertility or sterilization. What if the vaccine is meant to destroy human reproductive systems as another step towards depopulation? Maybe a controlled Children of Men type scenario? 4. By far the wildest theory would be the virus was released by a secret Alien race as an act of war. Their goal would be to make the world vulnerable enough to be taken over. This argument is backed up by the government recently admitting to the existence of unknown extraterrestrial life. I know there are many more theories out there which is why I wrote this. I want to encourage everyone to think outside of the box. If you have any other theories or wish to elaborate on the ones I mentioned, please do so. I will continue to gather information, hypothesize some more and eventually create a second post relating to origin of the virus. Thank you for taking the time to read this."
3,vulnerability,conspiracy,Fauci Is a Deep State Fraud,1,hpw0qn,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hpw0qn/fauci_is_a_deep_state_fraud/,2020-07-13 01:19:18,"By [Angelo Codevilla](URL  July 10, 2020 I knew for sure that Anthony Fauci is a [fraud](URL after listening to him for about 10 secondsas anyone who listens carefully would have known as well. President Trump had been charging the Chinese government with obscurancy and deception in its handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Fauci had dealt intimately with the Chinese on that matter. **His National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Centers for Disease Control had partially financed the notorious Wuhan laboratory where Chinese scientists were researching the virus.** Fauci knew a lot. A reporter asked Fauci if he agreed with Trump that the Chinese have not been fully forthcoming about the scope of the pandemic. Fauci answered that although the Chinese had lacked candor in previous years, this time they had turned over the sequence of the virus. Spoken like a wily swamp reptile! His words were factually correct. The Chinese had turned over all they knew about the viruss sequencenamely, its genetic structure. But the reporter and the audience neither knew nor cared about that. **They were interested in the Chinese governments misrepresentations of the viruss contagion, fatality rate, and so forth. That is what they had dissembled and lied about.** Faucis answer artfully deceived the audience into believing the opposite of the truth. Thus did Fauci help plant a dagger between Trumps shoulder blades and help his partythe Democrats and the deep stateextort the American peoples compliance to their agendas. ## Deep State Doctor Donald Trumps decision to accredit Dr. Anthony Fauci as the COVID-19 pandemics guru is largely responsible for the extent of the panic that gripped America in the spring and now summer. Fauci is a bona fide graduate of medical school. Many attest to his earlier epidemiological brilliance. But none of the words by which he has helped inflict chaos on America have reflected either medical or epidemiological facts. Fauci has acted as, and has been, a politicized, partisan bureaucrat while pretending to be the disinterested authority of physicians and scientists. **The pretense that COVID-19 is something like, and hence is to be treated like, the plague is the essence of the scam that the deep state and the Democratic Party are perpetrating on America. Anthony Faucis pseudo-medical, pseudo-scientific pretense is the foremost pillar of that lie.** Sowing and maintaining confusion about the severity of cases of COVID-19 infectionsindeed, about the very meaning of the word casehas been the heart of that lie. ***Understanding the truth begins with comparing the infection/fatality rate (IFR) of ordinary seasonal flu, 0.01 percent, with that of the bubonic plague or smallpoxaround 30 percentand then realizing that COVID-19s IFR is roughly that of the flu.*** Although Fauci was not the sole author of the confusion, he surely was most influential in spreading it. And it was a lie, because by January Fauci knew that, despite the Chinese governments indications and media management to the contrary, COVID-19 was what we in the West have since learned from experience: deadly to the very old and otherwise compromised, but milder than most flu strains for just about everyone else. That knowledge notwithstanding, Fauci concurred with the mathematical modelers dire forecasts of frightful across-the-board mortality rates. He substantiated their (baseless) assumptions of an IFR around 5 percent for everyone by citing as a case any sick person who tested positive for the virus or who had a fever, cough, and other respiratory symptoms like those caused by the virus. He then agreed that all such persons who died should have their deaths attributed to the virus. In late March, Fauci convinced President Trump that a wave of such deadly cases would overwhelm Americas healthcare system unless Americans huddled at home. Trump agreed. (Remember, [15 Days to Slow the Spread](URL Thereafter, the lockdowns took on a momentum of their own. ## Mindless Momentum So mindless of reality was this momentum that it shoved aside the *only* medical fact that made any difference, namely, the vulnerability of old, fragile people. Hence, Faucis CDC, all keen to free up hospital space, advised state and local health systems to transfer all manner of patients into nursing homes and long-term care facilities. Thus did Faucis CDC become the efficient cause of the holocaust that killed perhaps 60,000 practically captive old folks. By mid-April however, as the great wave simply was not happening, any number of independent studies were establishing COVID-19s true, low IFR. Fauci retreated, no longer linking cases to deaths, he used the panic he had helped foment and the credit that Trump had naively given him, to finagle Trump into agreeing to a staged plan to end the lockdowns which, upon closer look, was really a plan for perpetuating them regardless of what happened. The essence of *this* fraud is the pretense that all COVID-19 infections are cases requiring sequestration and quarantine, even if they involve persons to whom the virus poses no dangeri.e., nearly all Americans. To keep down the number of cases Fauci now preaches, Americans must be willing to accept any number of arbitrary restrictions, not least of which is superintendence by contact tracers empowered to allow or disallow anyone from ordinary employment and human contact. To grasp Faucis dishonestybeing anything but ignorant, he knows *exactly* what he is doingwe need not recall his self-contradictions regarding the wearing of masks or regarding the risks associated with Holy Communion versus sex with strangers. Let us only recall what this board-certified physician has said and done about the drug hydroxychloroquine. This standard antimalarial drugs usefulness against COVID-19 was discovered accidentally as physicians around the world found it useful for treating patients, especially in the diseases early and mid-stages. President Trump praised it. The deep state howled. Fauci tried to backstab Trump by pointing out that the drug had not been specifically approved to treat COVID-19. Reporters refused to accept a backhanded put-down. When one asked whether he would take the drug were he infected with COVID-19, Fauci said yes, but qualified that he would do so only as part of an FDA study. Later, as the deep states campaign against Trumps drug produced studies obviously biased against it, Fauci happily retreated to saying that the drug was now off the table. But by June, as major peer-reviewed studies confirmed hydroxychloroquines usefulness, Fauci remained silent. He was doing the best he could for his class. Not for us. This is not how scientists behave. Much less is it how doctors behave who take seriously the Hippocratic Oath. Fauci, unfortunately, behaves as an ordinary creature of the Washington swamp."

6,vulnerability,conspiracy,"How To Lockdown A City Simply By Testing It: Second Wave Blueprint = Leicester, UK - Totalitarian Trailblazer!",5,hvyboy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hvyboy/how_to_lockdown_a_city_simply_by_testing_it/,2020-07-23 03:44:20,"Due to an apparent spike in COVID cases, Leicester became the first city in England to experience a second lockdown on the 29th June 2020. This was wildly and hysterically reported at the time and was meant to signal our general vulnerability to similar measures, should the need arise. We have since then been reminded constantly that our temporary return to relative freedom might be retracted at any time. EDIT DUE TO COMMENT BELOW: The possible reasons for the spike in the number of cases were VARIOUSLY reported in the mainstream (EID STREET PARTIES, POOR CONDITIONS IN FACTORIES, BLM PROTESTS), BUT I could only find a few non-MSM references to the fact **that increased testing in the last weeks of June might adequately explain it. Trying to find how many actual COVID deaths have occurred in Leicester is a further difficulty.** Usually the MSM is deluged with terrifying graphs, alarming numbers and statistics, but not so here. As of 14th July, **Leicester has a COVID-positive testing rate of 118.2 cases per 100,000.** [URL But, as of today, how many have died after testing positive, let alone OF COVID? No mention I could find after an hour of trying in the MSM. Leave it to a local newspaper today to offer any specifics: A UHL spokesperson said: ""Sadly, we can confirm **that 429 patients being cared for at our hospitals, and who had tested positive for Covid-19, have died.** **""Four of those deaths have been announced since last Wednesday.** [**URL (22nd July 2020) With a population of over 400,000, **429 people have died in Leicester, with no confirmation they actually died** ***of/ from*** **COVID? And for this they closed a city down for a second time? This kind of sick numbers manipulation is pretty systemic right now, in a desperate bid to keep us scared and dependent.** Testing must be considered as a leading cause of this COVID-positive spike: The \[Public Health England\] report found an increase in the number of people aged under 19 who had been infected in the East Midlands city, from 5 per cent of all cases in mid-May to 15 per cent in June, and a similar increase in infections among working-age people. **The report said the increase in positive tests is probably linked, in part, to the availability of testing to the general public.** **It came as the NHS set up another temporary coronavirus testing centre** in the north east of Leicester  the epicentre of the citys Covid-19 outbreak  **taking the total to five in the city.** Experts have said that increased testing could be responsible for the rise in cases  but not entirely responsible. **Prof Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine at UEA in Norwich, said: It is possible  though in my view unlikely  that, as raised in the conclusions, the increase reflects increased uptake of pillar 2 testing. \[He did have not to raise the idea, but then to shoot it down? Why? - me\]** The PHE report also revealed: * The infection was spreading primarily in people in their 20s, 30s and 40s and **most were not severely ill because they were not tested in hospital;** [URL The county council areas of Oadby and Wigston will **remain under lockdown because the prevalence of Covid  due to testing  is too high,** Mr Nick Rushton, County council leader said. [URL An admittedly anonymous Leicester doctor, Dr Q, who claims to be risking suspension for speaking out, had this to say: By June we were down to between three and eight positive cases a day in UHL (also known as Pillar 1 testing, shown as dark green on the graph). This has remained unchanged throughout the whole of June. &amp;#x200B; [Pillar 2 \(light green\) - private testing company data, which the Government accepts is not the same as the number of people with COVID-19.](URL The issue and alleged cause of the Local Lockdown is our Pillar 2 numbers, which are the lighter green ones on the graph. These are the community tests outsourced to private companies. There is no guarantee that these tests are all taken from different people (unlike the Pillar 1 data, which is cross checked against a unique patient identifier). In fact, **the Government accepts that the number of Pillar 2 cases is not the same as the number of people with COVID-19** because Pillar 2 data includes people whove been tested more than once  often because they have to re-test before theyre allowed back to work. The median age of those with a positive community test is 39. The risk of a 39 year-old dying from COVID-19 is less than that of them drowning (based on the ONS data). Thirty-nine year-olds are out at work, particularly 39 year-olds who live in North Evington, the worst affected area in Leicester city. **Over 95% cases are in under-65 year-olds, again at substantially decreased risk.** [URL Door to door testing began on the 10th July, which of course increased the number of positive cases, thereby justifying the necessity of the second lockdown. The effect proved the cause. [URL Dr Q went on to conclude: Local Lockdown in Leicester is purely a tool of control. Its a threat to make us behave. We werent actually misbehaving for the record  our protests have had lower numbers and less violence than the national average, we havent been going to any beaches  there arent any  and the vast majority of the population have taken the random rules of lockdown very seriously. Be warned. Given our cases have already started falling, they will be able to call this a success in two weeks. By then it might be your turn. Leicesters second lockdown is a joke and a clear exemplum of how easy it is to fool us into gullible submission, without needing to offer even the most basic evidence for such disproportionate decision-making.

7,vulnerability,conspiracy,UC Berkely History Professor challenges the ideology of BLM (he/she is black),20,h8zcet,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/h8zcet/uc_berkely_history_professor_challenges_the/,2020-06-15 04:51:06,"**UC Berkeley History Professors Open Letter Against BLM, Police Brutality and Cultural Orthodoxy** Dear profs X, Y, Z I am one of your colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley. I have met you both personally but do not know you closely, and am contacting you anonymously, with apologies. I am worried that writing this email publicly might lead to me losing my job, and likely all future jobs in my field. In your recent departmental emails you mentioned our pledge to diversity, but I am increasingly alarmed by the absence of diversity of opinion on the topic of the recent protests and our community response to them. In the extended links and resources you provided, I could not find a single instance of substantial counter-argument or alternative narrative to explain the under-representation of black individuals in academia or their over-representation in the criminal justice system. The explanation provided in your documentation, to the near exclusion of all others, is univariate: the problems of the black community are caused by whites, or, when whites are not physically present, by the infiltration of white supremacy and white systemic racism into American brains, souls, and institutions. Many cogent objections to this thesis have been raised by sober voices, including from within the black community itself, such as Thomas Sowell and Wilfred Reilly. These people are not racists or Uncle Toms. They are intelligent scholars who reject a narrative that strips black people of agency and systematically externalizes the problems of the black community onto outsiders. Their view is entirely absent from the departmental and UCB-wide communiques. The claim that the difficulties that the black community faces are entirely causally explained by exogenous factors in the form of white systemic racism, white supremacy, and other forms of white discrimination remains a problematic hypothesis that should be vigorously challenged by historians. Instead, it is being treated as an axiomatic and actionable truth without serious consideration of its profound flaws, or its worrying implication of total black impotence. This hypothesis is transforming our institution and our culture, without any space for dissent outside of a tightly policed, narrow discourse. A counternarrative exists. If you have time, please consider examining some of the documents I attach at the end of this email. Overwhelmingly, the reasoning provided by BLM and allies is either primarily anecdotal (as in the case with the bulk of Ta-Nehisi Coates undeniably moving article) or it is transparently motivated. As an example of the latter problem, consider the proportion of black incarcerated Americans. This proportion is often used to characterize the criminal justice system as anti-black. However, if we use the precise same methodology, we would have to conclude that the criminal justice system is even more anti-male than it is anti-black. Would we characterize criminal justice as a systemically misandrist conspiracy against innocent American men? I hope you see that this type of reasoning is flawed, and requires a significant suspension of our rational faculties. Black people are not incarcerated at higher rates than their involvement in violent crime would predict. This fact has been demonstrated multiple times across multiple jurisdictions in multiple countries. And yet, I see my department uncritically reproducing a narrative that diminishes black agency in favor of a white-centric explanation that appeals to the departments apparent desire to shoulder the white mans burden and to promote a narrative of white guilt. If we claim that the criminal justice system is white-supremacist, why is it that Asian Americans, Indian Americans, and Nigerian Americans are incarcerated at vastly lower rates than white Americans? This is a funny sort of white supremacy. Even Jewish Americans are incarcerated less than gentile whites. I think its fair to say that your average white supremacist disapproves of Jews. And yet, these alleged white supremacists incarcerate gentiles at vastly higher rates than Jews. None of this is addressed in your literature. None of this is explained, beyond hand-waving and ad hominems. Those are racist dogwhistles. The model minority myth is white supremacist. Only fascists talk about black-on-black crime, ad nauseam. These types of statements do not amount to counterarguments: they are simply arbitrary offensive classifications, intended to silence and oppress discourse. Any serious historian will recognize these for the silencing orthodoxy tactics they are, common to suppressive regimes, doctrines, and religions throughout time and space. They are intended to crush real diversity and permanently exile the culture of robust criticism from our department. Increasingly, we are being called upon to comply and subscribe to BLMs problematic view of history, and the department is being presented as unified on the matter. In particular, ethnic minorities are being aggressively marshaled into a single position. Any apparent unity is surely a function of the fact that dissent could almost certainly lead to expulsion or cancellation for those of us in a precarious position, which is no small number. I personally dont dare speak out against the BLM narrative, and with this barrage of alleged unity being mass-produced by the administration, tenured professoriat, the UC administration, corporate America, and the media, the punishment for dissent is a clear danger at a time of widespread economic vulnerability. I am certain that if my name were attached to this email, I would lose my joband all future jobs, even though I believe in and can justify every word I type. The vast majority of violence visited on the black community is committed by black people. There are virtually no marches for these invisible victims, no public silences, no heartfelt letters from the UC regents, deans, and departmental heads. The message is clear: Black lives only matter when whites take them. Black violence is expected and insoluble, while white violence requires explanation and demands solution. Please look into your hearts and see how monstrously bigoted this formulation truly is. No discussion is permitted for nonblack victims of black violence, who proportionally outnumber black victims of nonblack violence. This is especially bitter in the Bay Area, where Asian victimization by black assailants has reached epidemic proportions, to the point that the SF police chief has advised Asians to stop hanging good-luck charms on their doors, as this attracts the attention of (overwhelmingly black) home invaders. Home invaders like George Floyd. For this actual, lived, physically experienced reality of violence in the USA, there are no marches, no tearful emails from departmental heads, no support from McDonalds and Wal-Mart. For the History department, our silence is not a mere abrogation of our duty to shed light on the truth: it is a rejection of it. The claim that black intraracial violence is the product of redlining, slavery, and other injustices is a largely historical claim. It is for historians, therefore, to explain why Japanese internment or the massacre of European Jewry hasnt led to equivalent rates of dysfunction and low SES performance among Japanese and Jewish Americans respectively. Arab Americans have been viciously demonized since 9/11, as have Chinese Americans more recently. However, both groups outperform white Americans on nearly all SES indices  as do Nigerian Americans, who incidentally have black skin. It is for historians to point out and discuss these anomalies. However, no real discussion is possible in the current climate at our department. The explanation is provided to us, disagreement with it is racist, and the job of historians is to further explore additional ways in which the explanation is additionally correct. This is a mockery of the historical profession. Most troublingly, our department appears to have been entirely captured by the interests of the Democratic National Convention, and the Democratic Party more broadly. To explain what I mean, consider what happens if you choose to donate to Black Lives Matter, an organization UCB History has explicitly promoted in its recent mailers. All donations to the official BLM website are immediately redirected to ActBlue Charities, an organization primarily concerned with bankrolling election campaigns for Democrat candidates. Donating to BLM today is to indirectly donate to Joe Bidens 2020 campaign. This is grotesque given the fact that the American cities with the worst rates of black-on-black violence and police-on-black violence are overwhelmingly Democrat-run. Minneapolis itself has been entirely in the hands of Democrats for over five decades; the systemic racism there was built by successive Democrat administrations. The patronizing and condescending attitudes of Democrat leaders towards the black community, exemplified by nearly every Biden statement on the black race, all but guarantee a perpetual state of misery, resentment, poverty, and the attendant grievance politics which are simultaneously annihilating American political discourse and black lives. And yet, donating to BLM is bankrolling the election campaigns of men like Mayor Frey, who saw their cities devolve into violence. This is a grotesque capture of a good-faith movement for necessary police reform, and of our department, by a political party. Even worse, there are virtually no avenues for dissent in academic circles. I refuse to serve the Party, and so should you. The total alliance of major corporations involved in human exploitation with BLM should be a warning flag to us, and yet this damning evidence goes unnoticed, purposefully ignored, or perversely celebrated. We are the useful idiots of the wealthiest classes, carrying water for Jeff Bezos and other actual, real, modern-day slavers. Starbucks, an organisation using literal black slaves in its coffee plantation suppliers, is in favor of BLM. Sony, an organisation using cobalt mined by yet more literal black slaves, many of whom are children, is in favor of BLM. And so, apparently, are we. The absence of counter-narrative enables this obscenity. Fiat lux, indeed. There also exists a large constituency of what can only be called race hustlers: hucksters of all colors who benefit from stoking the fires of racial conflict to secure administrative jobs, charity management positions, academic jobs and advancement, or personal political entrepreneurship. Given the direction our history department appears to be taking far from any commitment to truth, we can regard ourselves as a formative training institution for this brand of snake-oil salespeople. Their activities are corrosive, demolishing any hope at harmonious racial coexistence in our nation and colonizing our political and institutional life. Many of their voices are unironically segregationist. MLK would likely be called an Uncle Tom if he spoke on our campus today. We are training leaders who intend, explicitly, to destroy one of the only truly successful ethnically diverse societies in modern history. As the PRC, an ethnonationalist and aggressively racially chauvinist national polity with null immigration and no concept of jus solis increasingly presents itself as the global political alternative to the US, I ask you: Is this wise? Are we really doing the right thing? As a final point, our university and department has made multiple statements celebrating and eulogizing George Floyd. Floyd was a multiple felon who once held a pregnant black woman at gunpoint. He broke into her home with a gang of men and pointed a gun at her pregnant stomach. He terrorized the women in his community. He sired and abandoned multiple children, playing no part in their support or upbringing, failing one of the most basic tests of decency for a human being. He was a drug-addict and sometime drug-dealer, a swindler who preyed upon his honest and hard-working neighbors. And yet, the regents of UC and the historians of the UCB History department are celebrating this violent criminal, elevating his name to virtual sainthood. A man who hurt women. A man who hurt black women. With the full collaboration of the UCB history department, corporate America, most mainstream media outlets, and some of the wealthiest and most privileged opinion-shaping elites of the USA, he has become a culture hero, buried in a golden casket, his (recognized) family showered with gifts and praise. Americans are being socially pressured into kneeling for this violent, abusive misogynist. A generation of black men are being coerced into identifying with George Floyd, the absolute worst specimen of our race and species. Im ashamed of my department. I would say that Im ashamed of both of you, but perhaps you agree with me, and are simply afraid, as I am, of the backlash of speaking the truth. Its hard to know what kneeling means, when you have to kneel to keep your job. It shouldnt affect the strength of my argument above, but for the record, I write as a person of color. My family have been personally victimized by men like Floyd. We are aware of the condescending depredations of the Democrat party against our race. The humiliating assumption that we are too stupid to do STEM, that we need special help and lower requirements to get ahead in life, is richly familiar to us. I sometimes wonder if it wouldnt be easier to deal with open fascists, who at least would be straightforward in calling me a subhuman, and who are unlikely to share my race. The ever-present soft bigotry of low expectations and the permanent claim that the solutions to the plight of my people rest exclusively on the goodwill of whites rather than on our own hard work is psychologically devastating. No other group in America is systematically demoralized in this way by its alleged allies. A whole generation of black children are being taught that only by begging and weeping and screaming will they get handouts from guilt-ridden whites. No message will more surely devastate their futures, especially if whites run out of guilt, or indeed if America runs out of whites. If this had been done to Japanese Americans, or Jewish Americans, or Chinese Americans, then Chinatown and Japantown would surely be no different to the roughest parts of Baltimore and East St. Louis today. The History department of UCB is now an integral institutional promulgator of a destructive and denigrating fallacy about the black race. I hope you appreciate the frustration behind this message. I do not support BLM. I do not support the Democrat grievance agenda and the Partys uncontested capture of our department. I do not support the Party co-opting my race, as Biden recently did in his disturbing interview, claiming that voting Democrat and being black are isomorphic. I condemn the manner of George Floyds death and join you in calling for greater police accountability and police reform. However, I will not pretend that George Floyd was anything other than a violent misogynist, a brutal man who met a predictably brutal end. I also want to protect the practice of history. Cleo is no grovelling handmaiden to politicians and corporations. Like us, she is free. **Source** URL"

Other religious groups are casted out by stereotypes and its disgusting to call this a free country for religious rights. The biggest eye opener that should be talked about in this thread is about Alcoholics/Narcotics Anonymous playing a role in the war on drugs and Big Pharma. If you arent aware the AA big book was written in 1939 by the man of Bill Wilson. BW was using peoples vulnerability by showing them a path to sobriety. He was a gifted a mansion for his help. The big book is just about peoples stories with addiction. Written in 1939 there was not enough scientific understanding around addiction. Big Pharama push medications on addicts such as psychotropics, these are prescriptions altering the brains chemicals. Rehabs sell these medicines and force them on their patients. A big drug in this scene is Lithium. You become a lab rat on this, so you dont feel depressed and has the side affect of suicidal thoughts/actions. This is where you can call bull shit. Lithium only works when it is almost at a lethal dose causing a patient to receive bloodwork once a week to monitor levels. Who profits off this you may ask? (Lithium manufactures selling the drug in mass, LabCorp collecting blood to monitor, Rehabs and Doctors prescribing it) -You are the money bag, they make $$$ from your insurance leaving you with copays that will demish your credit score- Still here? Where this has to relate to separation of church and state is where it gets juicy. This is where the dots will connect. A person can be court mandated to rehab or mandatory AA/NA meetings. These groups claim to be non-religious, yet everyone is held in a church. You start a meeting off by saying a serenity prayer, sounds very non religious right? These programs is the only tool our country has for addiction. An outdated book written long ago that is being upheld over science around addiction. -May I add Bill Wilson the founder, stayed jacked up on lsd the rest of his life, profited off this non profit organization by selling the Big Book, and was also gifted a fucking mansion- This is where Big Pharama comes into play. Someone can get sent to a rehab. Rehab will jack you up on medication because you have insurance. The psychotropic medication you will get put on is addictive, it is very dangerous to go cold turkey on any of these. Detoxing from this will cause an offset in brain chemicals, a common side affect from just stopping this type of medication is called Brain Zaps. It essentially makes you Tweak from South Park. So Rehabs will fight your addiction with addiction in the name of promoting good mental health. The biggest example of hypocrisy is like I said before Suicidal Thoughts/Actions as side affects from these drugs. The only thing most Rehabs offer is a place to retreat to for 10k-100k+ for breif therapy and have you in groups of talking about how Karen overdosed cause her cat died. Rehabs also use alot from the AA Big book and will most of time take you to AA meetings. I shall drop the mic here -(TLTR)- So in todays society you can fall victim of the war on drugs very easily, even for something like a crumb of cannabis on your shirt. A court can force you to attend rehab. A rehab can force you on medication. All this happens while AA/NA force you to believe in a god and that he is your answer to becoming sober. Your credit score will never recover because you have Rehab, Court, and Copay fees. Now youre stuck in the loop of relapsing being used as money bag for insurance. (Mic hit ground and go boom)"

People who call themselves liberal seem to have forgotten how to double check news media stories, how to read scientific studies, and instead accept at face value all propaganda issued forth by the NYT, WAPO, and NPR, sources who sold them the Iraq war, and other wars and interventions, sources who sell them, like a wrestling match, presidential elections, sources exposed decades ago for being CIA outlets. People who call themselves liberal think that the biggest issue we face here at home is the oppression of identity groups, rather than the fact we live in an imperialist and globalist corporate dominated capitalistic system that has captured our institutions and exploits every groups vulnerability, bringing the hammer down hardest on those with a history of horrific and systemic disenfranchisement. People who call themselves liberal forget to factor in their race issue analysis the fact that were an empire that has overthrown countless foreign governments, regularly raining down bombs that slaughter black and brown families across the globe, no matter who is the president, including Obama. People who call themselves liberal never bothered to learn the history of the lawless multi-billion dollar, multi-agency, national security bureaucracy and the effects of its actions here at home including citizen surveillance, disruption and co-optation of political movements, assassinations, and propaganda through its media partners. People who call themselves liberal have forgotten regulatory capture and the power of the medical and pharmaceutical companies to bend the FDA, the CDC, WHO, and scientific journal publishers and authors to their will.

People who call themselves liberal boast about their intelligence and moral superiority while falling for every propaganda trick issued through the controlled corporate media and as a result regularly police their neighbors for improper voting habits and failure to follow corrupt government health directives, further sewing divineness on a horizontal level, thus ensuring there will be no public unity as our government enacts, step by step, a system of complete authoritarianism. People who call themselves liberal are the advant guard in ushering in the 4th Industrial Revolution, where workers are replaced by robots, cash is replaced by a global, company-store cryptocurrency money system, where you cant work or shop without a digital health certificate, a future wherein liberal values are flushed down the toilet along with our rights and freedoms outlined in the constitution and international human rights treaties, all now being implemented under the new paradigm of health security. The people who call themselves ""liberal"" have forgotten all of this because they are afraid. They are deathly afraid of a virus that according to all recent sero-anitbody based studies has no higher a death rate than a bad flu season (no the disease is not the same as the flu, but the death rates are the same, do we get imprisoned inside our houses every flu season?).

The Emergency Exits are simply painted on. But we don't ever cheap out on Nuclear reactor saftey, do we? Aging nuclear plants, industry cost-cutting, and [reduced safety oversight: a dangerous mix.](URL Or let security get so bad that anyone can break in and possibly start an incident. [Nuns and Nuclear Security | The New Yorker.](URL Mar. 9, 2015  Break-In at Y-12. How a handful of pacifists and nuns exposed the vulnerability of America's nuclear-weapons sites. Yes, that was an eighty something year old nun who broke in at Oak Ridge Institute. [Her name is Megan Rice.](URL She's one scary looking special forces nun operator, isn't she? SONCOM: Special Operations Nun Command, the new normal military elite fighting force. They put the fear of God in you. And thank God for that, because these guys need some fear of God to make them see the light. Or maybe they just like the Dark. And this is where the July 18th prophecy warning becomes very strange. Yesterday I had briefly mentioned about an incident at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. &gt;**A criticality accident occurred on December 30, 1958, at the Los Alamos National Laboratory** in Los Alamos, New Mexico, in the United States. It is one of only ten such events that have occurred outside a nuclear reactor, **though it was the third such event that took place in 1958 after events on 16 June at the Y-12 Plant in Oak Ridge**, Tennessee, and on 15 October at the Vina Nuclear Institute in Vina, Yugoslavia. The accident involved plutonium compounds dissolved in liquid chemical reagents, and it killed one man, Cecil Kelley, a chemical operator, by severe radiation poisoning, within 35 hours. So being the naturally curious monkey that I am, I click on the link that takes me to the Los Alamos Criticality accident, and this is what I found. &gt;Among other ideal characteristics, the ideal shape for any fissile substance to become supercritical is the shape of least surface area, a sphere. Although the plutonium-rich solution was not spherical, the vortex made it thicker in the center, and this, along with the corresponding increase in density and the neutron reflectivity of the aqueous layer surrounding it, caused the dissolved plutonium to reach and cross the criticality threshold in approximately one second: neutrons within the mixture began to bombard the nuclei of the solution's plutonium atoms with sufficient frequency to cause these atoms to break apart and release other neutrons in a sustained nuclear chain reaction lasting only 200 microseconds but releasing a huge burst of neutrons and gamma radiation. Such an uncontrolled release of nuclear energy is [often referred to as an excursion.](URL Which reminded me about a show I just recently started watching on Netflix, Dark. Why? Let me explain. Dark is about time travel, wormholes, nuclear disaster, and a prophecy (I can't make this crap up, seriously) that so far they haven't explained. But there is a scene in the second season where a character has to use electricity to stabilize a ball of gaseous, liquid, and matter, into a **sphere**. And I can't help myself. Even though the show is German and isn't set in America, this can't just be a coincidence, can it? The show has three primary timelines at the start. The story begins in **2019**, but spreads to include story-lines in **1986 and 1953**. **Remember the prophecy**. So I go to 1953 Oak Ridge National Laboratory and search that year. Would you look at the result, **Oak Ridge National Laboratory engineers assisted Argonne National Laboratory during the early 1950s in design and fabrication of the Oak Ridge Automatic Computer and Logical Engine. Its name was selected with reference to a lyrical acronym from Greek mythologyORACLE, defined as 'a shrine in which a deity reveals hidden knowledge**.' The computer was called Oracle. An Oracle makes prophecies. The show has a prophecy and it involves a nuclear incident. The ad had a prophecy involving a nuclear incident. The ad was placed next to an article about Oak Ridge and a Manhattan Project, and the lab was involved in the original Manhattan Project. That's strange, right? Seriously **Stranger Things** are happening here. And since this show is set in 1986 they constantly bring up Chernobyl, the power plant disaster in the Soviet Union, and how it's causing **Acid Rain** (and if you've been reading my posts about hydrogen sulfide and the rotten egg smell all over the planet, then you understand, and if not, get reading). And the second talks started in Iceland between Gorbachev and Reagan, which were centered around SALT (Strategic Arms Limit Talks). &gt;Reagan and Gorbachev eventually concluded the landmark Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) agreement and established the foundation for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which was concluded in 1991. The SALT led to the START. Interesting. And here's the radioactive salt. &gt;After shutdown, the salt was believed to be in long-term safe storage. At low temperatures, radiolysis can free fluorine from the salt. As a countermeasure, the salt was annually reheated to about 302 F (150 C) until 1989.[20] But beginning in the mid-1980s, there was concern that radioactivity was migrating through the system.[by whom?] Sampling in 1994 revealed concentrations of uranium that created a potential for a nuclear criticality accident, as well as a potentially dangerous build-up of fluorine gas  the environment above the solidified salt was approximately one atmosphere of fluorine. Removal of uranium from the salt was finally complete in March 2008, however still leaving the salt with the fission products in the tanks. Now lets get to the heart of the matter. &gt;Part of the contaminated site of Oak Ridge's old Molten Salt Reactor Experiment may be entombed in concrete, according to Jay Mullis, manager for the Oak Ridge Office of Environmental Management. That's about 100 to 200 times the amount radiation workers are allowed to be exposed to in an entire calendar year. Entombment is the cheaper route and has been done before  most notably, at Chernobyl, where the contents of the steel and concrete sarcophagus are expected to remain radioactive for at least the next 10,000 years. A second seal was placed over the hot zone just last year. In the United States, entombment had been used in Ohio and Nebraska to contain radioactive pieces of other nuclear power plants decommissioned in the late 1960s, and to cocoon nine plutonium reactors at the Hanford Site in Washington state. So guess what else they show in Dark? Radioactive waste being stored in concrete underground. Why? Because the town has a nuclear reactor there. Radioactive Sphere. A computer called Oracle. Radioactive meltdown. Acid Rain. Radioactive material stored in concrete. Perfect! Let's keep this apocalyse party going everyone! Let's follow the White Rabbit to 2019 at Oak Ridge. Vitalii Starchenko | ORNL. March, 2019. The Development of Wormholes In Laboratoryscale Fractures: Perspectives from Three dimensional Simulations. Or. Scientists attempting to open portal to a parallel universe | The Independent. Could 2019 be the year humans open the first portal to a shadowy dimension which mirrors our own world? So we have: Radioactive Sphere. A computer called Oracle. Radioactive meltdown. Acid Rain. Radioactive material stored in concrete. Wormholes. Ok. At his point I have to travel backwards and check out 1921. Surely nothing happened there, right? There can't be a real link tied into this show called Dark, can there? &gt;The three-day May 1921 geomagnetic storm was caused by the impact of an extraordinarily powerful coronal mass ejection on Earth's magnetosphere. It occurred on 1315 May as part of solar cycle 15, and was the most intense geomagnetic storm of the 20th century. Since it occurred before the extensive interconnectivity of electrical systems and the general electrical dependence of infrastructure in the developed world, its effect was restricted; however, its ground currents were up to an order of magnitude greater than those of the March 1989 geomagnetic storm which interrupted electrical service to large parts of northeastern North America. The storm's electrical current sparked a number of fires worldwide, including one near Grand Central Terminal which made it known as the ""New York Railroad Storm"". Contemporary scientists estimated the size of the sunspot (AR1842) which began on May 10thand caused the stormas 94,000 by 21,000 miles (131,000 km by 33,800 km). Whelp. A massive solar flare and magnitude greater ground currents. Folks, we have the electrical current. Radioactive Sphere. A computer called Oracle. Radioactive meltdown. Acid Rain. Radioactive material stored in concrete. Wormholes. Electrical Current. And a prophecy. (I'm still waiting on the partridge in a pear tree). Ok. Lets throw it all together and drain this swamp like the Frontline workers we are in this new normal, cause we're all in this together. The computer was called Oracle. An Oracle makes prophecies. The show has a prophecy and it involves a nuclear incident. The ad had a prophecy involving a nuclear incident. The ad was placed next to an article about Oak Ridge and a Manhattan Project, and the lab was involved in the original Manhattan Project. The lab has nuclear waste. A wormhole is made with electricity. ORNL is researching wormholes. In 1921 we had a solar storm and electrical currents, and power went out and the show is called Dark. Oh, I almost forgot, acid rain. And when does this prophecy in Dark start? June 27th, 2020. And how? An incident at the nuclear plant after they encase the waste underground in cement. Which leads to an apocalypse. Oh. And the show has another timeline in 2053 where we learn that we have ended up in a Mad Max world and where told that the prophecy will be fulfilled. Quite the trip, isnt it? Is this coincidence? A pattern? A warning? A message? That's above my pay grade, so share your thoughts with me in the comments and let's see if we can figure anything out. Oh, can you believe there's more? Because there is. About what? Let's just say the Dark isn't what it seems when you actually start looking at it. Take care. Be safe. Stay aware and be prepared. Talk soon."

COINTELPRO Techniques for dilution, misdirection and control of a internet forum 2. Twenty-Five Rules of Disinformation 3. Eight Traits of the Disinformationalist 4. How to Spot a Spy (Cointelpro Agent) 5. Seventeen Techniques for Truth Suppression ______________________________________________________________________________________ COINTELPRO Techniques for dilution, misdirection and control of a internet forum.. There are several techniques for the control and manipulation of a internet forum no matter what, or who is on it. We will go over each technique and demonstrate that only a minimal number of operatives can be used to eventually and effectively gain a control of a 'uncontrolled forum.' Technique #1 - 'FORUM SLIDING' If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by 'forum sliding.' In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to 'age.' Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a 'forum slide.' The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a 'forum slide' and 'flush' the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then 'replying' to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting 'slides' down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items. Technique #2 - 'CONSENSUS CRACKING' A second highly effective technique (which you can see in operation all the time at URL is 'consensus cracking.' To develop a consensus crack, the following technique is used. Under the guise of a fake account a posting is made which looks legitimate and is towards the truth is made - but the critical point is that it has a VERY WEAK PREMISE without substantive proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under alternative fake accounts a very strong position in your favour is slowly introduced over the life of the posting. It is IMPERATIVE that both sides are initially presented, so the uninformed reader cannot determine which side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger 'evidence' or disinformation in your favour is slowly 'seeded in.' Thus the uninformed reader will most like develop the same position as you, and if their position is against you their opposition to your posting will be most likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings, you can then 'abort' the consensus cracking by initiating a 'forum slide.' Technique #3 - 'TOPIC DILUTION' Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a 'RESOURCE BURN.' By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a 'gossip mode.' In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to 'drive in the wedge.' By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator. Technique #4 - 'INFORMATION COLLECTION' Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a 'show you mine so me yours' posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered. An example is to post your 'favourite weapon' and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favourite 'technique of operation.' From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities. Technique #5 - 'ANGER TROLLING' Statistically, there is always a percentage of the forum posters who are more inclined to violence. In order to determine who these individuals are, it is a requirement to present a image to the forum to deliberately incite a strong psychological reaction. From this the most violent in the group can be effectively singled out for reverse IP location and possibly local enforcement tracking. To accomplish this only requires posting a link to a video depicting a local police officer massively abusing his power against a very innocent individual. Statistically of the million or so police officers in America there is always one or two being caught abusing there powers and the taping of the activity can be then used for intelligence gathering purposes - without the requirement to 'stage' a fake abuse video. This method is extremely effective, and the more so the more abusive the video can be made to look. Sometimes it is useful to 'lead' the forum by replying to your own posting with your own statement of violent intent, and that you 'do not care what the authorities think!!' inflammation. By doing this and showing no fear it may be more effective in getting the more silent and self-disciplined violent intent members of the forum to slip and post their real intentions. This can be used later in a court of law during prosecution. Technique #6 - 'GAINING FULL CONTROL' It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the 'ultimate victory' as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a 'honey pot' gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes. CONCLUSION Remember these techniques are only effective if the forum participants DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THEM. Once they are aware of these techniques the operation can completely fail, and the forum can become uncontrolled. At this point other avenues must be considered such as initiating a false legal precidence to simply have the forum shut down and taken offline. This is not desirable as it then leaves the enforcement agencies unable to track the percentage of those in the population who always resist attempts for control against them. Many other techniques can be utilized and developed by the individual and as you develop further techniques of infiltration and control it is imperative to share then with HQ. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Twenty-Five Rules of Disinformation Note: The first rule and last five (or six, depending on situation) rules are generally not directly within the ability of the traditional disinfo artist to apply. These rules are generally used more directly by those at the leadership, key players, or planning level of the criminal conspiracy or conspiracy to cover up. 1. Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. Regardless of what you know, don't discuss it -- especially if you are a public figure, news anchor, etc. If it's not reported, it didn't happen, and you never have to deal with the issues. 2. Become incredulous and indignant. Avoid discussing key issues and instead focus on side issues which can be used show the topic as being critical of some otherwise sacrosanct group or theme. This is also known as the 'How dare you!' gambit. 3. Create rumor mongers. Avoid discussing issues by describing all charges, regardless of venue or evidence, as mere rumors and wild accusations. Other derogatory terms mutually exclusive of truth may work as well. This method which works especially well with a silent press, because the only way the public can learn of the facts are through such 'arguable rumors'. If you can associate the material with the Internet, use this fact to certify it a 'wild rumor' from a 'bunch of kids on the Internet' which can have no basis in fact. 4. Use a straw man. Find or create a seeming element of your opponent's argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues. 5. Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary 'attack the messenger' ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as 'kooks', 'right-wing', 'liberal', 'left-wing', 'terrorists', 'conspiracy buffs', 'radicals', 'militia', 'racists', 'religious fanatics', 'sexual deviates', and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues. 6. Hit and Run. In any public forum, make a brief attack of your opponent or the opponent position and then scamper off before an answer can be fielded, or simply ignore any answer. This works extremely well in Internet and letters-to-the-editor environments where a steady stream of new identities can be called upon without having to explain criticism, reasoning -- simply make an accusation or other attack, never discussing issues, and never answering any subsequent response, for that would dignify the opponent's viewpoint. 7. Question motives. Twist or amplify any fact which could be taken to imply that the opponent operates out of a hidden personal agenda or other bias. This avoids discussing issues and forces the accuser on the defensive. 8. Invoke authority. Claim for yourself or associate yourself with authority and present your argument with enough 'jargon' and 'minutia' to illustrate you are 'one who knows', and simply say it isn't so without discussing issues or demonstrating concretely why or citing sources. 9. Play Dumb. No matter what evidence or logical argument is offered, avoid discussing issues except with denials they have any credibility, make any sense, provide any proof, contain or make a point, have logic, or support a conclusion. Mix well for maximum effect. 10. Associate opponent charges with old news. A derivative of the straw man -- usually, in any large-scale matter of high visibility, someone will make charges early on which can be or were already easily dealt with - a kind of investment for the future should the matter not be so easily contained.) Where it can be foreseen, have your own side raise a straw man issue and have it dealt with early on as part of the initial contingency plans. Subsequent charges, regardless of validity or new ground uncovered, can usually then be associated with the original charge and dismissed as simply being a rehash without need to address current issues -- so much the better where the opponent is or was involved with the original source. 11. Establish and rely upon fall-back positions. Using a minor matter or element of the facts, take the 'high road' and 'confess' with candor that some innocent mistake, in hindsight, was made -- but that opponents have seized on the opportunity to blow it all out of proportion and imply greater criminalities which, 'just isn't so.' Others can reinforce this on your behalf, later, and even publicly 'call for an end to the nonsense' because you have already 'done the right thing.' Done properly, this can garner sympathy and respect for 'coming clean' and 'owning up' to your mistakes without addressing more serious issues. 12. Enigmas have no solution. Drawing upon the overall umbrella of events surrounding the crime and the multitude of players and events, paint the entire affair as too complex to solve. This causes those otherwise following the matter to begin to lose interest more quickly without having to address the actual issues. 13. Alice in Wonderland Logic. Avoid discussion of the issues by reasoning backwards or with an apparent deductive logic which forbears any actual material fact. 14. Demand complete solutions. Avoid the issues by requiring opponents to solve the crime at hand completely, a ploy which works best with issues qualifying for rule 10. 15. Fit the facts to alternate conclusions. This requires creative thinking unless the crime was planned with contingency conclusions in place. 16. Vanish evidence and witnesses. If it does not exist, it is not fact, and you won't have to address the issue. 17. Change the subject. Usually in connection with one of the other ploys listed here, find a way to side-track the discussion with abrasive or controversial comments in hopes of turning attention to a new, more manageable topic. This works especially well with companions who can 'argue' with you over the new topic and polarize the discussion arena in order to avoid discussing more key issues. 18. Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents. If you can't do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how 'sensitive they are to criticism.' 19. Ignore proof presented, demand impossible proofs. This is perhaps a variant of the 'play dumb' rule. Regardless of what material may be presented by an opponent in public forums, claim the material irrelevant and demand proof that is impossible for the opponent to come by (it may exist, but not be at his disposal, or it may be something which is known to be safely destroyed or withheld, such as a murder weapon.) In order to completely avoid discussing issues, it may be required that you to categorically deny and be critical of media or books as valid sources, deny that witnesses are acceptable, or even deny that statements made by government or other authorities have any meaning or relevance. 20. False evidence. Whenever possible, introduce new facts or clues designed and manufactured to conflict with opponent presentations -- as useful tools to neutralize sensitive issues or impede resolution. This works best when the crime was designed with contingencies for the purpose, and the facts cannot be easily separated from the fabrications. 21. Call a Grand Jury, Special Prosecutor, or other empowered investigative body. Subvert the (process) to your benefit and effectively neutralize all sensitive issues without open discussion. Once convened, the evidence and testimony are required to be secret when properly handled. For instance, if you own the prosecuting attorney, it can insure a Grand Jury hears no useful evidence and that the evidence is sealed and unavailable to subsequent investigators. Once a favorable verdict is achieved, the matter can be considered officially closed. Usually, this technique is applied to find the guilty innocent, but it can also be used to obtain charges when seeking to frame a victim. 22. Manufacture a new truth. Create your own expert(s), group(s), author(s), leader(s) or influence existing ones willing to forge new ground via scientific, investigative, or social research or testimony which concludes favorably. In this way, if you must actually address issues, you can do so authoritatively. 23. Create bigger distractions. If the above does not seem to be working to distract from sensitive issues, or to prevent unwanted media coverage of unstoppable events such as trials, create bigger news stories (or treat them as such) to distract the multitudes. 24. Silence critics. If the above methods do not prevail, consider removing opponents from circulation by some definitive solution so that the need to address issues is removed entirely. This can be by their death, arrest and detention, blackmail or destruction of their character by release of blackmail information, or merely by destroying them financially, emotionally, or severely damaging their health. 25. Vanish. If you are a key holder of secrets or otherwise overly illuminated and you think the heat is getting too hot, to avoid the issues, vacate the kitchen. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Eight Traits of the Disinformationalist 1) Avoidance. They never actually discuss issues head-on or provide constructive input, generally avoiding citation of references or credentials. Rather, they merely imply this, that, and the other. Virtually everything about their presentation implies their authority and expert knowledge in the matter without any further justification for credibility. 2) Selectivity. They tend to pick and choose opponents carefully, either applying the hit-and-run approach against mere commentators supportive of opponents, or focusing heavier attacks on key opponents who are known to directly address issues. Should a commentator become argumentative with any success, the focus will shift to include the commentator as well. 3) Coincidental. They tend to surface suddenly and somewhat coincidentally with a new controversial topic with no clear prior record of participation in general discussions in the particular public arena involved. They likewise tend to vanish once the topic is no longer of general concern. They were likely directed or elected to be there for a reason, and vanish with the reason. 4) Teamwork. They tend to operate in self-congratulatory and complementary packs or teams. Of course, this can happen naturally in any public forum, but there will likely be an ongoing pattern of frequent exchanges of this sort where professionals are involved. Sometimes one of the players will infiltrate the opponent camp to become a source for straw man or other tactics designed to dilute opponent presentation strength. 5) Anti-conspiratorial. They almost always have disdain for 'conspiracy theorists' and, usually, for those who in any way believe JFK was not killed by LHO. Ask yourself why, if they hold such disdain for conspiracy theorists, do they focus on defending a single topic discussed in a NG focusing on conspiracies? One might think they would either be trying to make fools of everyone on every topic, or simply ignore the group they hold in such disdain.Or, one might more rightly conclude they have an ulterior motive for their actions in going out of their way to focus as they do. 6) Artificial Emotions. An odd kind of 'artificial' emotionalism and an unusually thick skin -- an ability to persevere and persist even in the face of overwhelming criticism and unacceptance. This likely stems from intelligence community training that, no matter how condemning the evidence, deny everything, and never become emotionally involved or reactive. The net result for a disinfo artist is that emotions can seem artificial. Most people, if responding in anger, for instance, will express their animosity throughout their rebuttal. But disinfo types usually have trouble maintaining the 'image' and are hot and cold with respect to pretended emotions and their usually more calm or unemotional communications style. It's just a job, and they often seem unable to 'act their role in character' as well in a communications medium as they might be able in a real face-to-face conversation/confrontation. You might have outright rage and indignation one moment, ho-hum the next, and more anger later -- an emotional yo-yo. With respect to being thick-skinned, no amount of criticism will deter them from doing their job, and they will generally continue their old disinfo patterns without any adjustments to criticisms of how obvious it is that they play that game -- where a more rational individual who truly cares what others think might seek to improve their communications style, substance, and so forth, or simply give up. 7) Inconsistent. There is also a tendency to make mistakes which betray their true self/motives. This may stem from not really knowing their topic, or it may be somewhat 'freudian', so to speak, in that perhaps they really root for the side of truth deep within. I have noted that often, they will simply cite contradictory information which neutralizes itself and the author. For instance, one such player claimed to be a Navy pilot, but blamed his poor communicating skills (spelling, grammar, incoherent style) on having only a grade-school education. I'm not aware of too many Navy pilots who don't have a college degree. Another claimed no knowledge of a particular topic/situation but later claimed first-hand knowledge of it. 8) Time Constant. Recently discovered, with respect to News Groups, is the response time factor. There are three ways this can be seen to work, especially when the government or other empowered player is involved in a cover up operation: a) ANY NG posting by a targeted proponent for truth can result in an IMMEDIATE response. The government and other empowered players can afford to pay people to sit there and watch for an opportunity to do some damage. SINCE DISINFO IN A NG ONLY WORKS IF THE READER SEES IT - FAST RESPONSE IS CALLED FOR, or the visitor may be swayed towards truth. b) When dealing in more direct ways with a disinformationalist, such as email, DELAY IS CALLED FOR - there will usually be a minimum of a 48-72 hour delay. This allows a sit-down team discussion on response strategy for best effect, and even enough time to 'get permission' or instruction from a formal chain of command. c) In the NG example 1) above, it will often ALSO be seen that bigger guns are drawn and fired after the same 48-72 hours delay - the team approach in play. This is especially true when the targeted truth seeker or their comments are considered more important with respect to potential to reveal truth. Thus, a serious truth sayer will be attacked twice for the same sin. ______________________________________________________________________________________ How to Spot a Spy (Cointelpro Agent) One way to neutralize a potential activist is to get them to be in a group that does all the wrong things. Why? 1) The message doesn't get out. 2) A lot of time is wasted 3) The activist is frustrated and discouraged 4) Nothing good is accomplished. FBI and Police Informers and Infiltrators will infest any group and they have phoney activist organizations established. Their purpose is to prevent any real movement for justice or eco-peace from developing in this country. Agents come in small, medium or large. They can be of any ethnic background. They can be male or female. The actual size of the group or movement being infiltrated is irrelevant. It is the potential the movement has for becoming large which brings on the spies and saboteurs. This booklet lists tactics agents use to slow things down, foul things up, destroy the movement and keep tabs on activists. It is the agent's job to keep the activist from quitting such a group, thus keeping him/her under control. In some situations, to get control, the agent will tell the activist: ""You're dividing the movement."" [Here, I have added the psychological reasons as to WHY this maneuver works to control people] This invites guilty feelings. Many people can be controlled by guilt. The agents begin relationships with activists behind a well-developed mask of ""dedication to the cause."" Because of their often declared dedication, (and actions designed to prove this), when they criticize the activist, he or she - being truly dedicated to the movement - becomes convinced that somehow, any issues are THEIR fault. This is because a truly dedicated person tends to believe that everyone has a conscience and that nobody would dissimulate and lie like that ""on purpose."" It's amazing how far agents can go in manipulating an activist because the activist will constantly make excuses for the agent who regularly declares their dedication to the cause. Even if they do, occasionally, suspect the agent, they will pull the wool over their own eyes by rationalizing: ""they did that unconsciously... they didn't really mean it... I can help them by being forgiving and accepting "" and so on and so forth. The agent will tell the activist: ""You're a leader!"" This is designed to enhance the activist's self-esteem. His or her narcissistic admiration of his/her own activist/altruistic intentions increase as he or she identifies with and consciously admires the altruistic declarations of the agent which are deliberately set up to mirror those of the activist. This is ""malignant pseudoidentification."" It is the process by which the agent consciously imitates or simulates a certain behavior to foster the activist's identification with him/her, thus increasing the activist's vulnerability to exploitation. The agent will simulate the more subtle self-concepts of the activist. Activists and those who have altruistic self-concepts are most vulnerable to malignant pseudoidentification especially during work with the agent when the interaction includes matter relating to their competency, autonomy, or knowledge. The goal of the agent is to increase the activist's general empathy for the agent through pseudo-identification with the activist's self-concepts. The most common example of this is the agent who will compliment the activist for his competency or knowledge or value to the movement. On a more subtle level, the agent will simulate affects and mannerisms of the activist which promotes identification via mirroring and feelings of ""twinship"". It is not unheard of for activists, enamored by the perceived helpfulness and competence of a good agent, to find themselves considering ethical violations and perhaps, even illegal behavior, in the service of their agent/handler. The activist's ""felt quality of perfection"" [self-concept] is enhanced, and a strong empathic bond is developed with the agent through his/her imitation and simulation of the victim's own narcissistic investments. [self-concepts] That is, if the activist knows, deep inside, their own dedication to the cause, they will project that onto the agent who is ""mirroring"" them. The activist will be deluded into thinking that the agent shares this feeling of identification and bonding. In an activist/social movement setting, the adversarial roles that activists naturally play vis a vis the establishment/government, fosters ongoing processes of intrapsychic splitting so that ""twinship alliances"" between activist and agent may render whole sectors or reality testing unavailable to the activist. They literally ""lose touch with reality."" Activists who deny their own narcissistic investments [do not have a good idea of their own self-concepts and that they ARE concepts] and consciously perceive themselves (accurately, as it were) to be ""helpers"" endowed with a special amount of altruism are exceedingly vulnerable to the affective (emotional) simulation of the accomplished agent. Empathy is fostered in the activist through the expression of quite visible affects. The presentation of tearfulness, sadness, longing, fear, remorse, and guilt, may induce in the helper-oriented activist a strong sense of compassion, while unconsciously enhancing the activist's narcissistic investment in self as the embodiment of goodness. The agent's expresssion of such simulated affects may be quite compelling to the observer and difficult to distinguish from deep emotion. It can usually be identified by two events, however: First, the activist who has analyzed his/her own narcissistic roots and is aware of his/her own potential for being ""emotionally hooked,"" will be able to remain cool and unaffected by such emotional outpourings by the agent. As a result of this unaffected, cool, attitude, the Second event will occur: The agent will recompensate much too quickly following such an affective expression leaving the activist with the impression that ""the play has ended, the curtain has fallen,"" and the imposture, for the moment, has finished. The agent will then move quickly to another activist/victim. The fact is, the movement doesn't need leaders, it needs MOVERS. ""Follow the leader"" is a waste of time. A good agent will want to meet as often as possible. He or she will talk a lot and say little. One can expect an onslaught of long, unresolved discussions. Some agents take on a pushy, arrogant, or defensive manner: 1) To disrupt the agenda 2) To side-track the discussion 3) To interrupt repeatedly 4) To feign ignorance 5) To make an unfounded accusation against a person. Calling someone a racist, for example. This tactic is used to discredit a person in the eyes of all other group members. Saboteurs Some saboteurs pretend to be activists. She or he will .... 1) Write encyclopedic flyers (in the present day, websites) 2) Print flyers in English only. 3) Have demonstrations in places where no one cares. 4) Solicit funding from rich people instead of grass roots support 5) Display banners with too many words that are confusing. 6) Confuse issues. 7) Make the wrong demands. Cool Compromise the goal. 9) Have endless discussions that waste everyone's time. The agent may accompany the endless discussions with drinking, pot smoking or other amusement to slow down the activist's work. Provocateurs 1) Want to establish ""leaders"" to set them up for a fall in order to stop the movement. 2) Suggest doing foolish, illegal things to get the activists in trouble. 3) Encourage militancy. 4) Want to taunt the authorities. 5) Attempt to make the activist compromise their values. 6) Attempt to instigate violence. Activisim ought to always be non-violent. 7) Attempt to provoke revolt among people who are ill-prepared to deal with the reaction of the authorities to such violence. Informants 1) Want everyone to sign up and sing in and sign everything. 2) Ask a lot of questions (gathering data). 3) Want to know what events the activist is planning to attend. 4) Attempt to make the activist defend him or herself to identify his or her beliefs, goals, and level of committment. Recruiting Legitimate activists do not subject people to hours of persuasive dialog. Their actions, beliefs, and goals speak for themselves. Groups that DO recruit are missionaries, military, and fake political parties or movements set up by agents. Surveillance ALWAYS assume that you are under surveillance. At this point, if you are NOT under surveillance, you are not a very good activist! Scare Tactics They use them. Such tactics include slander, defamation, threats, getting close to disaffected or minimally committed fellow activists to persuade them (via psychological tactics described above) to turn against the movement and give false testimony against their former compatriots. They will plant illegal substances on the activist and set up an arrest; they will plant false information and set up ""exposure,"" they will send incriminating letters [emails] in the name of the activist; and more; they will do whatever society will allow. This booklet in no way covers all the ways agents use to sabotage the lives of sincere an dedicated activists. If an agent is ""exposed,"" he or she will be transferred or replaced. COINTELPRO is still in operation today under a different code name. It is no longer placed on paper where it can be discovered through the freedom of information act. The FBI counterintelligence program's stated purpose: To expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, and otherwise neutralize individuals who the FBI categorize as opposed to the National Interests. ""National Security"" means the FBI's security from the people ever finding out the vicious things it does in violation of people's civil liberties. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Seventeen Techniques for Truth Suppression Strong, credible allegations of high-level criminal activity can bring down a government. When the government lacks an effective, fact-based defense, other techniques must be employed. The success of these techniques depends heavily upon a cooperative, compliant press and a mere token opposition party. 1. Dummy up. If it's not reported, if it's not news, it didn't happen. 2. Wax indignant. This is also known as the ""How dare you?"" gambit. 3. Characterize the charges as ""rumors"" or, better yet, ""wild rumors."" If, in spite of the news blackout, the public is still able to learn about the suspicious facts, it can only be through ""rumors."" (If they tend to believe the ""rumors"" it must be because they are simply ""paranoid"" or ""hysterical."") 4. Knock down straw men. Deal only with the weakest aspects of the weakest charges. Even better, create your own straw men. Make up wild rumors (or plant false stories) and give them lead play when you appear to debunk all the charges, real and fanciful alike. 5. Call the skeptics names like ""conspiracy theorist,"" ""nutcase,"" ""ranter,"" ""kook,"" ""crackpot,"" and, of course, ""rumor monger."" Be sure, too, to use heavily loaded verbs and adjectives when characterizing their charges and defending the ""more reasonable"" government and its defenders. You must then carefully avoid fair and open debate with any of the people you have thus maligned. For insurance, set up your own ""skeptics"" to shoot down. 6. Impugn motives. Attempt to marginalize the critics by suggesting strongly that they are not really interested in the truth but are simply pursuing a partisan political agenda or are out to make money (compared to over-compensated adherents to the government line who, presumably, are not). 7. Invoke authority. Here the controlled press and the sham opposition can be very useful. 8. Dismiss the charges as ""old news."" 9. Come half-clean. This is also known as ""confession and avoidance"" or ""taking the limited hangout route."" This way, you create the impression of candor and honesty while you admit only to relatively harmless, less-than-criminal ""mistakes."" This stratagem often requires the embrace of a fall-back position quite different from the one originally taken. With effective damage control, the fall-back position need only be peddled by stooge skeptics to carefully limited markets. 10. Characterize the crimes as impossibly complex and the truth as ultimately unknowable. 11. Reason backward, using the deductive method with a vengeance. With thoroughly rigorous deduction, troublesome evidence is irrelevant. E.g. We have a completely free press. If evidence exists that the Vince Foster ""suicide"" note was forged, they would have reported it. They haven't reported it so there is no such evidence. Another variation on this theme involves the likelihood of a conspiracy leaker and a press who would report the leak. 12. Require the skeptics to solve the crime completely. E.g. If Foster was murdered, who did it and why? 13. Change the subject. This technique includes creating and/or publicizing distractions. 14. Lightly report incriminating facts, and then make nothing of them. This is sometimes referred to as ""bump and run"" reporting. 15. Baldly and brazenly lie. A favorite way of doing this is to attribute the ""facts"" furnished the public to a plausible-sounding, but anonymous, source. 16. Expanding further on numbers 4 and 5, have your own stooges ""expose"" scandals and champion popular causes. Their job is to pre-empt real opponents and to play 99-yard football. A variation is to pay rich people for the job who will pretend to spend their own money. 17. Flood the Internet with agents. This is the answer to the question, ""What could possibly motivate a person to spend hour upon hour on Internet news groups defending the government and/or the press and harassing genuine critics?"" Don t the authorities have defenders enough in all the newspapers, magazines, radio, and television? One would think refusing to print critical letters and screening out serious callers or dumping them from radio talk shows would be control enough, but, obviously, it is not."

I live north of the Olympic Mountains and we have veryyyy active skies at night. My girlfriend and I initially noticed it about a year and a half ago, some kind of machine flying with no noise, irregular lighting (very intense laser like lights that would sometimes shine directly into your eyes, strange patterns in movement inconsistent with traditional planes. We stopped seeing them for awhile, we took a break from LSD (no joke intended-those of you with real familiarity know that LSD heightens your sensitivity to frequencies outside of sober minded perception). However, maybe in November, we started seeing them again but this time they were different. At first they were usually solitary crafts that had no real organization in its movement, and almost seemed receptive/reactive to attempted telepathy. The ones we have been seeing more commonly are always in groups, ranging from 3 to over 20 (only saw that many once, every other night its about 3-5 that we can point out at one time). These crafts are organized, almost moving in a surveillance form, as if theyre following a graphed out section to go around and around. When they fly next to each other, its in formation. They have one solid circular white light at the bottom of each craft, no blinking lights or anything that is commonly associated with FAA. No FAA flight tracking reinforces what we see. They are silent, they still move in ways that arent feasible with currently familiar tech (90 degree turns, staying in one place to rapid acceleration, so on). Skip the kook jokes about ufos and lsd. I want to know what you guys are seeing. I am near several military bases and theres also some black budget land in the middle of the Olympic National Park (gov entity purchased a few thousand square miles, nothing much on the internet to confirm but i saw it in the local paper in 2016). Im sure some of you heard of the DC blackout last night, the insurgency (or whatever its called) order by trump, as well as the social media executive order from last Thursday. Trump is even taking it upon himself to call off the next election (no physical voting due to social distancing, no technological voting due to vulnerability). Pushing the wall to be built amidst all that is going on, going as far as blowing up Native burial sites. Some weird shit is going on. I know space force was pretty much swept under the rug, but i have a weird feeling about its actual intent and current activity. If anyone has any relevant info please share."

Perhaps a bigger example - Death. When I lost a parent, life was not real for the following months. Actually, it's still hard to process. ""How was my dad here one minute... and now he just doesn't exist. How can someone just not exist? Where did they go?"". Now imagine an alien invasion. Perhaps this is too extreme but I can imagine a lot of suicide happening. ""Oh my god, we really are a meaningless infant species. Of what use am I?"".

23,vulnerability,conspiracy,Conspiracy theories: A government conspiracy,1,fyizdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fyizdh/conspiracy_theories_a_government_conspiracy/,2020-04-11 02:22:32," Originally Published at The Forbidden Truth Blog: &amp;#x200B; URL &amp;#x200B; The universal matrix of deception and illusion that humans have chosen to create and dwell within, cannot be accurately perceived, deciphered, and understood by any individual who functions within the matrix itself. A perfect illustration of this, is the conspiracy theory phenomenon. Countless millions of humans are obsessed with the idea that organized social structures are engaged in complex conspiracies to withhold factual information from them, and yet when the conspiracy theories they cling to are dissected within the light of Truth, it becomes obvious and clear that all of the most popular conspiracy theories exist as socially organized, promoted, and sponsored deceptions, in and of themselves. A popular conspiracy theory never exists within organic independence. It always has sponsors, organizations and governments which promote it, either overtly or covertly. Humans who believe they have uncovered valuable Forbidden Truth within the context of conspiracy theory embrace, are blind to the reality that conspiracy theories are just as potent a weapon being used against them by society and government, as are the actual conspiracies that promoted conspiracy theories are specifically designed and intended to cloak. Popular conspiracy theories always serve a specific agenda of government and society. Embrace of these conspiracy theories does not merely serve this agenda, but just as importantly, it renders the actual conspiracies that all governments and societies absolutely do engage in, impossible to accurately perceive and understand. Let us take a brief look at a few of the more popular conspiracy theories that you brainwashed sheeple are addicted to, and the actual Forbidden Truths that these theories are specifically designed to conceal. **The John F. Kennedy presidential assassination:** Millions of humans are convinced that there was a conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy, and that the usa government is concealing this fact. Absolutely absurd! There is not a single shred of legitimate evidence that any such conspiracy existed, or that Lee Harvey Oswald did not successfully plan and execute this act all by himself. Since the day after this assassination occurred, the usa government has actively promoted the conspiracy theory that Lee Harvey did not act alone. This promotion has occurred on both covert and overt levels, most primarily by leaders and agents of the usa regime, but also by leaders and agents of other governments. Why do leaders of government want you to believe John F. Kennedy was assassinated as part of an organized conspiracy? Because the actual Truth of what happened is far **more** dangerous to the functional viability of a cloaked fascist dictatorship pretending to exist as free democracy, as the usa regime is. And what is this Truth? That a single and lone individual, slight of build and balding and possessing no extraordinary weapons or tactical skills, all by himself could and **did** successfully assassinate the most powerful and supposedly well-protected leader of government in the entire world. This is the Truth that government seeks to conceal, in deliberately promoting this conspiracy theory. The intended goal is obvious: To discourage any and all future attempts of this nature, and to try to encourage organized conspiracies against government, as they are far easier to uncover and prevent the successful execution of. **9/11 was an inside job:** Here again we have an utterly absurd conspiracy theory, not backed up by even the tiniest shred of legitimate evidence, encouraged by the usa regime because of how successful the event actually was. To the brainwashed citizen-slave, the question of why the usa regime would want to promote the idea that it organized and orchestrated 9/11 as an attack upon itself, makes no logical sense. But to the unbiased observer with a piercing Alien Eye, the answers are obvious, and twofold: First, the successful execution of the attack necessitates mitigation of the True vulnerability of government structures. The insane claim that this could not have happened unless it was an inside job, unless the usa orchestrated the attack upon itself, mitigates and denies this True vulnerability. And second. this conspiracy theory reduces the capacity of citizen-slaves to understand how the war ritual exists as organized partnership between governments, to dissipate domestic unrest by soliciting external attack and then using such attacks to terrorize allegiance and patriotism. **Extraterrestrials have been/are here on earth:** Another promoted conspiracy theory, lacking all credibility and evidence. This type of conspiracy theory serves as valuable distraction, inspiring millions to obsess over something which has absolutely no impact over any aspect of their actual existence, therefore ignoring the horrific structures of government and society, which enslave and oppress every aspect of every moment of their lives. This conspiracy also places another protective layer upon the existing social matrix, convincing humans that there is some alien force controlling the directional paths of their day to day existence, cloaking the totally human created and imposed matrix. **New World Order:** This conspiracy theory promotes the concept that a single government is being planned in order to rule the entire world within totalitarianism, and it is one of the most toxic and harmful of all organized conspiracy theory deceptions. The Forbidden Truth is: governments can only maintain their universal slavery over you fools, by pretending to compete against each other, pretending they are protecting you from the evil and inferior ways of rival governments. No government wants to rule the world, least of all the cloaked dictatorships of the west, such as usa or england. These governments depend totally upon the demonization of other governments, to maintain public support and allegiance. Those who obsess over a new world order are playing directly into the hands of their greatest oppressor, their own government, fearing an imagined future problem that will never come to pass, blinded to the Truth that government already has them hopelessly trapped, exactly where it wants them. Do you recognize the theme of all promoted conspiracy theories, from the four examples I am providing above? Promoted conspiracy theories specifically serve to conceal and render invisible, the **actual and real conspiracies,** far greater in scope, magnitude, and harmfulness, which are being imposed and deployed against and upon you. Conspiracy theories exist as operational tactic of society and government, in and of themselves. In embracing these theories you are not uncovering any valuable insights of hidden Truth, but rather playing right into the hands of your greatest enemy and deceiver.

COINTELPRO Techniques for dilution, misdirection and control of a internet forum 2. Twenty-Five Rules of Disinformation 3. Eight Traits of the Disinformationalist 4. How to Spot a Spy (Cointelpro Agent) 5. Seventeen Techniques for Truth Suppression ______________________________________________________________________________________ COINTELPRO Techniques for dilution, misdirection and control of a internet forum.. There are several techniques for the control and manipulation of a internet forum no matter what, or who is on it. We will go over each technique and demonstrate that only a minimal number of operatives can be used to eventually and effectively gain a control of a 'uncontrolled forum.' Technique #1 - 'FORUM SLIDING' If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by 'forum sliding.' In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to 'age.' Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a 'forum slide.' The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a 'forum slide' and 'flush' the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then 'replying' to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting 'slides' down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items. Technique #2 - 'CONSENSUS CRACKING' A second highly effective technique is 'consensus cracking.' To develop a consensus crack, the following technique is used. Under the guise of a fake account a posting is made which looks legitimate and is towards the truth is made - but the critical point is that it has a VERY WEAK PREMISE without substantive proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under alternative fake accounts a very strong position in your favour is slowly introduced over the life of the posting. It is IMPERATIVE that both sides are initially presented, so the uninformed reader cannot determine which side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger 'evidence' or disinformation in your favour is slowly 'seeded in.' Thus the uninformed reader will most like develop the same position as you, and if their position is against you their opposition to your posting will be most likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings, you can then 'abort' the consensus cracking by initiating a 'forum slide.' Technique #3 - 'TOPIC DILUTION' Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a 'RESOURCE BURN.' By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a 'gossip mode.' In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to 'drive in the wedge.' By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator. Technique #4 - 'INFORMATION COLLECTION' Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a 'show you mine so me yours' posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered. An example is to post your 'favourite weapon' and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favourite 'technique of operation.' From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities. Technique #5 - 'ANGER TROLLING' Statistically, there is always a percentage of the forum posters who are more inclined to violence. In order to determine who these individuals are, it is a requirement to present a image to the forum to deliberately incite a strong psychological reaction. From this the most violent in the group can be effectively singled out for reverse IP location and possibly local enforcement tracking. To accomplish this only requires posting a link to a video depicting a local police officer massively abusing his power against a very innocent individual. Statistically of the million or so police officers in America there is always one or two being caught abusing there powers and the taping of the activity can be then used for intelligence gathering purposes - without the requirement to 'stage' a fake abuse video. This method is extremely effective, and the more so the more abusive the video can be made to look. Sometimes it is useful to 'lead' the forum by replying to your own posting with your own statement of violent intent, and that you 'do not care what the authorities think!!' inflammation. By doing this and showing no fear it may be more effective in getting the more silent and self-disciplined violent intent members of the forum to slip and post their real intentions. This can be used later in a court of law during prosecution. Technique #6 - 'GAINING FULL CONTROL' It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the 'ultimate victory' as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a 'honey pot' gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes. CONCLUSION Remember these techniques are only effective if the forum participants DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THEM. Once they are aware of these techniques the operation can completely fail, and the forum can become uncontrolled. At this point other avenues must be considered such as initiating a false legal precidence to simply have the forum shut down and taken offline. This is not desirable as it then leaves the enforcement agencies unable to track the percentage of those in the population who always resist attempts for control against them. Many other techniques can be utilized and developed by the individual and as you develop further techniques of infiltration and control it is imperative to share then with HQ. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Twenty-Five Rules of Disinformation Note: The first rule and last five (or six, depending on situation) rules are generally not directly within the ability of the traditional disinfo artist to apply. These rules are generally used more directly by those at the leadership, key players, or planning level of the criminal conspiracy or conspiracy to cover up. 1. Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. Regardless of what you know, don't discuss it -- especially if you are a public figure, news anchor, etc. If it's not reported, it didn't happen, and you never have to deal with the issues. 2. Become incredulous and indignant. Avoid discussing key issues and instead focus on side issues which can be used show the topic as being critical of some otherwise sacrosanct group or theme. This is also known as the 'How dare you!' gambit. 3. Create rumor mongers. Avoid discussing issues by describing all charges, regardless of venue or evidence, as mere rumors and wild accusations. Other derogatory terms mutually exclusive of truth may work as well. This method which works especially well with a silent press, because the only way the public can learn of the facts are through such 'arguable rumors'. If you can associate the material with the Internet, use this fact to certify it a 'wild rumor' from a 'bunch of kids on the Internet' which can have no basis in fact. 4. Use a straw man. Find or create a seeming element of your opponent's argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues. 5. Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary 'attack the messenger' ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as 'kooks', 'right-wing', 'liberal', 'left-wing', 'terrorists', 'conspiracy buffs', 'radicals', 'militia', 'racists', 'religious fanatics', 'sexual deviates', and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues. 6. Hit and Run. In any public forum, make a brief attack of your opponent or the opponent position and then scamper off before an answer can be fielded, or simply ignore any answer. This works extremely well in Internet and letters-to-the-editor environments where a steady stream of new identities can be called upon without having to explain criticism, reasoning -- simply make an accusation or other attack, never discussing issues, and never answering any subsequent response, for that would dignify the opponent's viewpoint. 7. Question motives. Twist or amplify any fact which could be taken to imply that the opponent operates out of a hidden personal agenda or other bias. This avoids discussing issues and forces the accuser on the defensive. 8. Invoke authority. Claim for yourself or associate yourself with authority and present your argument with enough 'jargon' and 'minutia' to illustrate you are 'one who knows', and simply say it isn't so without discussing issues or demonstrating concretely why or citing sources. 9. Play Dumb. No matter what evidence or logical argument is offered, avoid discussing issues except with denials they have any credibility, make any sense, provide any proof, contain or make a point, have logic, or support a conclusion. Mix well for maximum effect. 10. Associate opponent charges with old news. A derivative of the straw man -- usually, in any large-scale matter of high visibility, someone will make charges early on which can be or were already easily dealt with - a kind of investment for the future should the matter not be so easily contained.) Where it can be foreseen, have your own side raise a straw man issue and have it dealt with early on as part of the initial contingency plans. Subsequent charges, regardless of validity or new ground uncovered, can usually then be associated with the original charge and dismissed as simply being a rehash without need to address current issues -- so much the better where the opponent is or was involved with the original source. 11. Establish and rely upon fall-back positions. Using a minor matter or element of the facts, take the 'high road' and 'confess' with candor that some innocent mistake, in hindsight, was made -- but that opponents have seized on the opportunity to blow it all out of proportion and imply greater criminalities which, 'just isn't so.' Others can reinforce this on your behalf, later, and even publicly 'call for an end to the nonsense' because you have already 'done the right thing.' Done properly, this can garner sympathy and respect for 'coming clean' and 'owning up' to your mistakes without addressing more serious issues. 12. Enigmas have no solution. Drawing upon the overall umbrella of events surrounding the crime and the multitude of players and events, paint the entire affair as too complex to solve. This causes those otherwise following the matter to begin to lose interest more quickly without having to address the actual issues. 13. Alice in Wonderland Logic. Avoid discussion of the issues by reasoning backwards or with an apparent deductive logic which forbears any actual material fact. 14. Demand complete solutions. Avoid the issues by requiring opponents to solve the crime at hand completely, a ploy which works best with issues qualifying for rule 10. 15. Fit the facts to alternate conclusions. This requires creative thinking unless the crime was planned with contingency conclusions in place. 16. Vanish evidence and witnesses. If it does not exist, it is not fact, and you won't have to address the issue. 17. Change the subject. Usually in connection with one of the other ploys listed here, find a way to side-track the discussion with abrasive or controversial comments in hopes of turning attention to a new, more manageable topic. This works especially well with companions who can 'argue' with you over the new topic and polarize the discussion arena in order to avoid discussing more key issues. 18. Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents. If you can't do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how 'sensitive they are to criticism.' 19. Ignore proof presented, demand impossible proofs. This is perhaps a variant of the 'play dumb' rule. Regardless of what material may be presented by an opponent in public forums, claim the material irrelevant and demand proof that is impossible for the opponent to come by (it may exist, but not be at his disposal, or it may be something which is known to be safely destroyed or withheld, such as a murder weapon.) In order to completely avoid discussing issues, it may be required that you to categorically deny and be critical of media or books as valid sources, deny that witnesses are acceptable, or even deny that statements made by government or other authorities have any meaning or relevance. 20. False evidence. Whenever possible, introduce new facts or clues designed and manufactured to conflict with opponent presentations -- as useful tools to neutralize sensitive issues or impede resolution. This works best when the crime was designed with contingencies for the purpose, and the facts cannot be easily separated from the fabrications. 21. Call a Grand Jury, Special Prosecutor, or other empowered investigative body. Subvert the (process) to your benefit and effectively neutralize all sensitive issues without open discussion. Once convened, the evidence and testimony are required to be secret when properly handled. For instance, if you own the prosecuting attorney, it can insure a Grand Jury hears no useful evidence and that the evidence is sealed and unavailable to subsequent investigators. Once a favorable verdict is achieved, the matter can be considered officially closed. Usually, this technique is applied to find the guilty innocent, but it can also be used to obtain charges when seeking to frame a victim. 22. Manufacture a new truth. Create your own expert(s), group(s), author(s), leader(s) or influence existing ones willing to forge new ground via scientific, investigative, or social research or testimony which concludes favorably. In this way, if you must actually address issues, you can do so authoritatively. 23. Create bigger distractions. If the above does not seem to be working to distract from sensitive issues, or to prevent unwanted media coverage of unstoppable events such as trials, create bigger news stories (or treat them as such) to distract the multitudes. 24. Silence critics. If the above methods do not prevail, consider removing opponents from circulation by some definitive solution so that the need to address issues is removed entirely. This can be by their death, arrest and detention, blackmail or destruction of their character by release of blackmail information, or merely by destroying them financially, emotionally, or severely damaging their health. 25. Vanish. If you are a key holder of secrets or otherwise overly illuminated and you think the heat is getting too hot, to avoid the issues, vacate the kitchen. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Eight Traits of the Disinformationalist 1) Avoidance. They never actually discuss issues head-on or provide constructive input, generally avoiding citation of references or credentials. Rather, they merely imply this, that, and the other. Virtually everything about their presentation implies their authority and expert knowledge in the matter without any further justification for credibility. 2) Selectivity. They tend to pick and choose opponents carefully, either applying the hit-and-run approach against mere commentators supportive of opponents, or focusing heavier attacks on key opponents who are known to directly address issues. Should a commentator become argumentative with any success, the focus will shift to include the commentator as well. 3) Coincidental. They tend to surface suddenly and somewhat coincidentally with a new controversial topic with no clear prior record of participation in general discussions in the particular public arena involved. They likewise tend to vanish once the topic is no longer of general concern. They were likely directed or elected to be there for a reason, and vanish with the reason. 4) Teamwork. They tend to operate in self-congratulatory and complementary packs or teams. Of course, this can happen naturally in any public forum, but there will likely be an ongoing pattern of frequent exchanges of this sort where professionals are involved. Sometimes one of the players will infiltrate the opponent camp to become a source for straw man or other tactics designed to dilute opponent presentation strength. 5) Anti-conspiratorial. They almost always have disdain for 'conspiracy theorists' and, usually, for those who in any way believe JFK was not killed by LHO. Ask yourself why, if they hold such disdain for conspiracy theorists, do they focus on defending a single topic discussed in a NG focusing on conspiracies? One might think they would either be trying to make fools of everyone on every topic, or simply ignore the group they hold in such disdain.Or, one might more rightly conclude they have an ulterior motive for their actions in going out of their way to focus as they do. 6) Artificial Emotions. An odd kind of 'artificial' emotionalism and an unusually thick skin -- an ability to persevere and persist even in the face of overwhelming criticism and unacceptance. This likely stems from intelligence community training that, no matter how condemning the evidence, deny everything, and never become emotionally involved or reactive. The net result for a disinfo artist is that emotions can seem artificial. Most people, if responding in anger, for instance, will express their animosity throughout their rebuttal. But disinfo types usually have trouble maintaining the 'image' and are hot and cold with respect to pretended emotions and their usually more calm or unemotional communications style. It's just a job, and they often seem unable to 'act their role in character' as well in a communications medium as they might be able in a real face-to-face conversation/confrontation. You might have outright rage and indignation one moment, ho-hum the next, and more anger later -- an emotional yo-yo. With respect to being thick-skinned, no amount of criticism will deter them from doing their job, and they will generally continue their old disinfo patterns without any adjustments to criticisms of how obvious it is that they play that game -- where a more rational individual who truly cares what others think might seek to improve their communications style, substance, and so forth, or simply give up. 7) Inconsistent. There is also a tendency to make mistakes which betray their true self/motives. This may stem from not really knowing their topic, or it may be somewhat 'freudian', so to speak, in that perhaps they really root for the side of truth deep within. I have noted that often, they will simply cite contradictory information which neutralizes itself and the author. For instance, one such player claimed to be a Navy pilot, but blamed his poor communicating skills (spelling, grammar, incoherent style) on having only a grade-school education. I'm not aware of too many Navy pilots who don't have a college degree. Another claimed no knowledge of a particular topic/situation but later claimed first-hand knowledge of it. 8) Time Constant. Recently discovered, with respect to News Groups, is the response time factor. There are three ways this can be seen to work, especially when the government or other empowered player is involved in a cover up operation: a) ANY NG posting by a targeted proponent for truth can result in an IMMEDIATE response. The government and other empowered players can afford to pay people to sit there and watch for an opportunity to do some damage. SINCE DISINFO IN A NG ONLY WORKS IF THE READER SEES IT - FAST RESPONSE IS CALLED FOR, or the visitor may be swayed towards truth. b) When dealing in more direct ways with a disinformationalist, such as email, DELAY IS CALLED FOR - there will usually be a minimum of a 48-72 hour delay. This allows a sit-down team discussion on response strategy for best effect, and even enough time to 'get permission' or instruction from a formal chain of command. c) In the NG example 1) above, it will often ALSO be seen that bigger guns are drawn and fired after the same 48-72 hours delay - the team approach in play. This is especially true when the targeted truth seeker or their comments are considered more important with respect to potential to reveal truth. Thus, a serious truth sayer will be attacked twice for the same sin. ______________________________________________________________________________________ How to Spot a Spy (Cointelpro Agent) One way to neutralize a potential activist is to get them to be in a group that does all the wrong things. Why? 1) The message doesn't get out. 2) A lot of time is wasted 3) The activist is frustrated and discouraged 4) Nothing good is accomplished. FBI and Police Informers and Infiltrators will infest any group and they have phoney activist organizations established. Their purpose is to prevent any real movement for justice or eco-peace from developing in this country. Agents come in small, medium or large. They can be of any ethnic background. They can be male or female. The actual size of the group or movement being infiltrated is irrelevant. It is the potential the movement has for becoming large which brings on the spies and saboteurs. This booklet lists tactics agents use to slow things down, foul things up, destroy the movement and keep tabs on activists. It is the agent's job to keep the activist from quitting such a group, thus keeping him/her under control. In some situations, to get control, the agent will tell the activist: ""You're dividing the movement."" [Here, I have added the psychological reasons as to WHY this maneuver works to control people] This invites guilty feelings. Many people can be controlled by guilt. The agents begin relationships with activists behind a well-developed mask of ""dedication to the cause."" Because of their often declared dedication, (and actions designed to prove this), when they criticize the activist, he or she - being truly dedicated to the movement - becomes convinced that somehow, any issues are THEIR fault. This is because a truly dedicated person tends to believe that everyone has a conscience and that nobody would dissimulate and lie like that ""on purpose."" It's amazing how far agents can go in manipulating an activist because the activist will constantly make excuses for the agent who regularly declares their dedication to the cause. Even if they do, occasionally, suspect the agent, they will pull the wool over their own eyes by rationalizing: ""they did that unconsciously... they didn't really mean it... I can help them by being forgiving and accepting "" and so on and so forth. The agent will tell the activist: ""You're a leader!"" This is designed to enhance the activist's self-esteem. His or her narcissistic admiration of his/her own activist/altruistic intentions increase as he or she identifies with and consciously admires the altruistic declarations of the agent which are deliberately set up to mirror those of the activist. This is ""malignant pseudoidentification."" It is the process by which the agent consciously imitates or simulates a certain behavior to foster the activist's identification with him/her, thus increasing the activist's vulnerability to exploitation. The agent will simulate the more subtle self-concepts of the activist. Activists and those who have altruistic self-concepts are most vulnerable to malignant pseudoidentification especially during work with the agent when the interaction includes matter relating to their competency, autonomy, or knowledge. The goal of the agent is to increase the activist's general empathy for the agent through pseudo-identification with the activist's self-concepts. The most common example of this is the agent who will compliment the activist for his competency or knowledge or value to the movement. On a more subtle level, the agent will simulate affects and mannerisms of the activist which promotes identification via mirroring and feelings of ""twinship"". It is not unheard of for activists, enamored by the perceived helpfulness and competence of a good agent, to find themselves considering ethical violations and perhaps, even illegal behavior, in the service of their agent/handler. The activist's ""felt quality of perfection"" [self-concept] is enhanced, and a strong empathic bond is developed with the agent through his/her imitation and simulation of the victim's own narcissistic investments. [self-concepts] That is, if the activist knows, deep inside, their own dedication to the cause, they will project that onto the agent who is ""mirroring"" them. The activist will be deluded into thinking that the agent shares this feeling of identification and bonding. In an activist/social movement setting, the adversarial roles that activists naturally play vis a vis the establishment/government, fosters ongoing processes of intrapsychic splitting so that ""twinship alliances"" between activist and agent may render whole sectors or reality testing unavailable to the activist. They literally ""lose touch with reality."" Activists who deny their own narcissistic investments [do not have a good idea of their own self-concepts and that they ARE concepts] and consciously perceive themselves (accurately, as it were) to be ""helpers"" endowed with a special amount of altruism are exceedingly vulnerable to the affective (emotional) simulation of the accomplished agent. Empathy is fostered in the activist through the expression of quite visible affects. The presentation of tearfulness, sadness, longing, fear, remorse, and guilt, may induce in the helper-oriented activist a strong sense of compassion, while unconsciously enhancing the activist's narcissistic investment in self as the embodiment of goodness. The agent's expresssion of such simulated affects may be quite compelling to the observer and difficult to distinguish from deep emotion. It can usually be identified by two events, however: First, the activist who has analyzed his/her own narcissistic roots and is aware of his/her own potential for being ""emotionally hooked,"" will be able to remain cool and unaffected by such emotional outpourings by the agent. As a result of this unaffected, cool, attitude, the Second event will occur: The agent will recompensate much too quickly following such an affective expression leaving the activist with the impression that ""the play has ended, the curtain has fallen,"" and the imposture, for the moment, has finished. The agent will then move quickly to another activist/victim. The fact is, the movement doesn't need leaders, it needs MOVERS. ""Follow the leader"" is a waste of time. A good agent will want to meet as often as possible. He or she will talk a lot and say little. One can expect an onslaught of long, unresolved discussions. Some agents take on a pushy, arrogant, or defensive manner: 1) To disrupt the agenda 2) To side-track the discussion 3) To interrupt repeatedly 4) To feign ignorance 5) To make an unfounded accusation against a person. Calling someone a racist, for example. This tactic is used to discredit a person in the eyes of all other group members. Saboteurs Some saboteurs pretend to be activists. She or he will .... 1) Write encyclopedic flyers (in the present day, websites) 2) Print flyers in English only. 3) Have demonstrations in places where no one cares. 4) Solicit funding from rich people instead of grass roots support 5) Display banners with too many words that are confusing. 6) Confuse issues. 7) Make the wrong demands. Cool Compromise the goal. 9) Have endless discussions that waste everyone's time. The agent may accompany the endless discussions with drinking, pot smoking or other amusement to slow down the activist's work. Provocateurs 1) Want to establish ""leaders"" to set them up for a fall in order to stop the movement. 2) Suggest doing foolish, illegal things to get the activists in trouble. 3) Encourage militancy. 4) Want to taunt the authorities. 5) Attempt to make the activist compromise their values. 6) Attempt to instigate violence. Activisim ought to always be non-violent. 7) Attempt to provoke revolt among people who are ill-prepared to deal with the reaction of the authorities to such violence. Informants 1) Want everyone to sign up and sing in and sign everything. 2) Ask a lot of questions (gathering data). 3) Want to know what events the activist is planning to attend. 4) Attempt to make the activist defend him or herself to identify his or her beliefs, goals, and level of committment. Recruiting Legitimate activists do not subject people to hours of persuasive dialog. Their actions, beliefs, and goals speak for themselves. Groups that DO recruit are missionaries, military, and fake political parties or movements set up by agents. Surveillance ALWAYS assume that you are under surveillance. At this point, if you are NOT under surveillance, you are not a very good activist! Scare Tactics They use them. Such tactics include slander, defamation, threats, getting close to disaffected or minimally committed fellow activists to persuade them (via psychological tactics described above) to turn against the movement and give false testimony against their former compatriots. They will plant illegal substances on the activist and set up an arrest; they will plant false information and set up ""exposure,"" they will send incriminating letters [emails] in the name of the activist; and more; they will do whatever society will allow. This booklet in no way covers all the ways agents use to sabotage the lives of sincere an dedicated activists. If an agent is ""exposed,"" he or she will be transferred or replaced. COINTELPRO is still in operation today under a different code name. It is no longer placed on paper where it can be discovered through the freedom of information act. The FBI counterintelligence program's stated purpose: To expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, and otherwise neutralize individuals who the FBI categorize as opposed to the National Interests. ""National Security"" means the FBI's security from the people ever finding out the vicious things it does in violation of people's civil liberties. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Seventeen Techniques for Truth Suppression Strong, credible allegations of high-level criminal activity can bring down a government. When the government lacks an effective, fact-based defense, other techniques must be employed. The success of these techniques depends heavily upon a cooperative, compliant press and a mere token opposition party. 1. Dummy up. If it's not reported, if it's not news, it didn't happen. 2. Wax indignant. This is also known as the ""How dare you?"" gambit. 3. Characterize the charges as ""rumors"" or, better yet, ""wild rumors."" If, in spite of the news blackout, the public is still able to learn about the suspicious facts, it can only be through ""rumors."" (If they tend to believe the ""rumors"" it must be because they are simply ""paranoid"" or ""hysterical."") 4. Knock down straw men. Deal only with the weakest aspects of the weakest charges. Even better, create your own straw men. Make up wild rumors (or plant false stories) and give them lead play when you appear to debunk all the charges, real and fanciful alike. 5. Call the skeptics names like ""conspiracy theorist,"" ""nutcase,"" ""ranter,"" ""kook,"" ""crackpot,"" and, of course, ""rumor monger."" Be sure, too, to use heavily loaded verbs and adjectives when characterizing their charges and defending the ""more reasonable"" government and its defenders. You must then carefully avoid fair and open debate with any of the people you have thus maligned. For insurance, set up your own ""skeptics"" to shoot down. 6. Impugn motives. Attempt to marginalize the critics by suggesting strongly that they are not really interested in the truth but are simply pursuing a partisan political agenda or are out to make money (compared to over-compensated adherents to the government line who, presumably, are not). 7. Invoke authority. Here the controlled press and the sham opposition can be very useful. 8. Dismiss the charges as ""old news."" 9. Come half-clean. This is also known as ""confession and avoidance"" or ""taking the limited hangout route."" This way, you create the impression of candor and honesty while you admit only to relatively harmless, less-than-criminal ""mistakes."" This stratagem often requires the embrace of a fall-back position quite different from the one originally taken. With effective damage control, the fall-back position need only be peddled by stooge skeptics to carefully limited markets. 10. Characterize the crimes as impossibly complex and the truth as ultimately unknowable. 11. Reason backward, using the deductive method with a vengeance. With thoroughly rigorous deduction, troublesome evidence is irrelevant. E.g. We have a completely free press. If evidence exists that the Vince Foster ""suicide"" note was forged, they would have reported it. They haven't reported it so there is no such evidence. Another variation on this theme involves the likelihood of a conspiracy leaker and a press who would report the leak. 12. Require the skeptics to solve the crime completely. E.g. If Foster was murdered, who did it and why? 13. Change the subject. This technique includes creating and/or publicizing distractions. 14. Lightly report incriminating facts, and then make nothing of them. This is sometimes referred to as ""bump and run"" reporting. 15. Baldly and brazenly lie. A favorite way of doing this is to attribute the ""facts"" furnished the public to a plausible-sounding, but anonymous, source. 16. Expanding further on numbers 4 and 5, have your own stooges ""expose"" scandals and champion popular causes. Their job is to pre-empt real opponents and to play 99-yard football. A variation is to pay rich people for the job who will pretend to spend their own money. 17. Flood the Internet with agents. This is the answer to the question, ""What could possibly motivate a person to spend hour upon hour on Internet news groups defending the government and/or the press and harassing genuine critics?"" Don t the authorities have defenders enough in all the newspapers, magazines, radio, and television? One would think refusing to print critical letters and screening out serious callers or dumping them from radio talk shows would be control enough, but, obviously, it is not."

CREW (another subsidiary) will be the leading non-partisan ethics watchdog group in a period of crisis with a president and administration represent possible conflicts of interest and ethical problems on an unprecedented scale. **Crew will demand ethical conduct from the administration and all parts of government, expose improper influence from powerful interests, and ensure accountability when the administration and others shirk ethical standards, rules, and laws.** Heres what success will look like: \-Trump will be afflicted by a steady flow of damaging information, new revelations, and an inability to avoid conflicts and issues. \-The Trump administration will be forced to defend illegal conduct in court. \-Powerful industries and interest groups will see their influence wane. \-Dark money will be a political liability in key states. \-Shareblue will take back social media for Democrats. \-We will delegitimize Donald Trumps presidency by emboldening the opposition and empowering the majority of Americans who oppose him. **Shareblue will be the dynamic nucleus of a multi platform media company that informs, engages, and arms Americans to fight.** Heres what successful look like: \-Shareblue will become the de facto news outlet for opposition leaders and the grassroots. \-Trump allies will be forced to step down or change course due to news pushed by Shareblue. \-Under pressure from Shareblue, Democrats will take more aggressive positions against Trump. \-Shareblue will achieve financial sustainability while diversifying content offerings and platforms. \-Top editorial and writing talent will leave competitors to join share blue. Right now, our institutions are among the critical few that stand between the America we love and the abyss. We must protect and defend our democratic values. We will not back down. We will only move forward. Page 8...Stopped Donald Trumps phone interview privileges. Media matters was the first to call out national cable broadcast networks for allowing Trump to phone into their shows instead of forcing him to appear via satellite or in studio. Because of this unprecedented privilege, Trump could appear on more shows (he conducted 69 phone interviews in the first 69 days of 2016 alone), and he could avoid being confronted by images and interviewers showing his lies for what they are. As a result of our campaign urging major networks to correct course, CBS News and NBC news publicly stated that they discontinue Trumps phone privileges. Eventually others followed suit and Trumps ability to control the new cycle from the comfort of his home was greatly reduced. Page 11...Facebooks virtual monopoly on information distribution has supercharge the fragmented landscape. Almost 2/3 of Americans (200 million) consume news on social media. By contrast, less than half of adults watch the local news, less than a third watch cable news or nightly network news, a quarter listen to radio, and only one and five read newspapers. In 2016, a full 2/3 of Facebook users use the platform to get news. Facebooks algorithm fuels confirmation bias by feeding content from outlets that tell the users what they want to hear. Fake news purveyors exploited this vulnerability for profit and political influence. Fake news was so profitable during the 2016 election that teenagers in Macedonia began publishing pro-Trump propaganda for the sole purpose of making money. In instances where fake news can be funded by political operations or even foreign governments, facebooks algorithm is the only barrier to mass access. **We are already experts in monitoring the way information moves through the media landscape; we understand where and how a lie is manufactured and how it proliferates. Now is the time to build on our expertise and unique audio and video archive to develop the technology is necessary to combat this new onslaught of misinformation.** Heres how well do it: \-Big data analysis and early warning system. Media monitoring enables us to identify pernicious misinformation and develop strategies for combating it. Historically, this has meant monitoring conservative media, television news, and newspapers. But relying on human media monitors is no longer sustainable. Fake news and alt-right communities are multiplying exponentially. Page 12...**Media matters has already secured access to raw data from Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites.** We have also put in place the technology necessary to automatically mine White nationalist message boards and alt-right communities for our archive. We will now develop technologies and processes to systematically monitor and analyze this unfiltered data. The earlier we identify a fake news story, the more effectively we can quash it. *With this new technology at their fingertips, researchers monitoring news in real time will be able to identify the origins of a lie with mathematical precision, creating an early warning system for fake news and disinformation. Bringing the data analysis to scale will also allow media matters to identify which individuals and outlets are the most destructive forces driving fake news, misinformation, and harassment. Cutting edge advances in cloud computing and machine learning will enable us to identify patterns and connections that would otherwise go under the radar.* We will be able to assess where and how misinformation is likely to move, who will be affected by it, and what needs to be done to neutralize it. But predictive technologies are only as good as the data that goes into them. The more data the system has to analyze, the richer its insights. Media matters already extensive 12 year archive gives this new system a big jumpstart. Collaborating with social media platforms...**After Facebook responded to our campaign by acknowledging the problem of fake news and agreeing to do something about it, we began a dialogue.** It became clear from these conversations that Facebook needed our help and fully understanding the problem and identifying concrete solutions. Further, it also became clear that we had information and insight that they didnt have that was helpful in educating them on the full scope of the problem. For example, media matters had a detailed map of the constellation of right-wing Facebook pages that had been the biggest purveyors of fake news-Outlets that push fake news are completely dependent on Facebook to spread their lies, and Media matters has unique insight to help fix problems in this part of the media landscape. Theres so much more. Full memo below. [URL"

It is of the upmost importance because I work in the finance industry and the SEC is cracking down hard on technology due diligence during their audits. Cyber security is mostly a game of cat and mouse (hacker finds vulnerability &gt; host notices hacker exploiting vulnerability &gt; host patches vulnerability &gt; repeat). This used to be the forefront of my attention, but ever since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been another issue that has catapulted its way to the forefront of my personal concerns... Information Warfare. In finance, I was taught to never listen to the medias prediction of the stock market. If their predictions were correct even most of the time, every Joe Shmoe would be a successful investor. Thats not the case. But in THIS case, Im seeing the mainstream media is actually affecting the volatility of the S&amp;P 500 and Dow via spreading fear. Because we arent on the gold standard, the economy heavily relies on confidence on what will happen in the future. Heres the scary part. Big Tech has been compliant in parroting the narrative of MSM and CENSORING anything that goes against that narrative. Recently Elon Musk retweeted a video that expressed the opinion of two doctors who determined the mandatory lockdowns are actually harmful to our health. They went over the official statistics on COVID-19 and put them into perspective of common struggles we deal with every year. It went viral..briefly.. This video has largely been scrubbed from the internet. (You can find it on Bitchute if youre curious) Why? Adam Schiff wrote a personal letter to US big tech companies asking them to essentially suppress opinions of professional doctors and anyone else (first amendment right) if it doesnt comply with the W.H.O., for our safety. They complied... Traitors... Meanwhile, videos from accounts predicting death rates will far exceed that of current projections remain available despite it not agreeing with the W.H.O.. Theres a clear trend here: (more deaths) = allowed. (less deaths) = removed. Meanwhile entire accounts like David Ickes are being deleted (I have never listened to him, I just heard he was conspiratorial and I saw he was banned). A large amount of our population only know to use Google, only know to watch YouTube, only get news through Facebook, etc.. Technology skills tend to favor younger generations and many still dont know to use different search engines. At the same time, the voting demographic is largely older generations who use only Big Tech sources and MSM to get their information. I know this is antidotal but, my father (50 years of age) is a pretty intelligent man with a health distrust of government. He can use technology better than most people of his age (not the best but still). Hes never heard of DuckDuckGo. Hes never heard of Bitchute. Hes never heard that doctors are being pressured to write COVID on death certificates. Hes never heard there are college studies indicating the death rate might be as low as .1%. Hes always been skeptical of government, but hes never thought to be skeptical of google, or YouTube, or Facebook. I realized this will be a problem for the large portion of citizens who dont understand algorithms and how they can drastically affect what information youre being fed. Im not here to debate capitalism. I personally believe that, while its flawed, its the best system available. Critics of capitalism predicted large corporations would eventually do the bidding of the government to suppress the people. We are seeing that now. In 2019 we saw a record number of CEOs step down from major corporations with publicly traded stocks. CEOs often step down before turmoil to avoid reputation damage, so that they might be hired as CEO for another company. This is not illegal because reputation is not considered insider information. While this is highly speculative and weak evidence, this is evidence to suggest prior knowledge the economy will harmed. For a lot of people, its currently difficult to find opinions of highly creditable people who disagree with the narrative were being told. They are being silenced, not directly through the government, but through Big Tech whos doing the bidding for the government. I dont want to speculate on why or even what the deep state agenda is.. Im just here to tell you what I know: domestic information warfare is increasing at an alarming rate. Its evolving and its working. Welcome to the dystopia."

Questions for the truth and arguments for where to look for the origins and how the virus may have spread and how to combat it, are lost in the noise of wanton chaos. But isnt that what the Black Men behind this intended pandemic want  chaos, panic, hopelessness, leading to human vulnerability  a people becoming easy prey for manipulation?* **Today WHO declared the coronavirus COVID-19 a pandemic**  when there is not the slightest trace of a pandemic. A pandemic might be the condition, when the death to infection rate reaches more than 12%. In Europe, the death rate is about 0.4%, or less. Except for Italy which is a special case, where the peak of the death rate was 6% (see below for further analysis). &gt;[**World Health Organization (WHO)**@WHO](URL  [Mar 11, 2020](URL to @WHO](URL has been assessing this outbreak around the clock and we are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction""-[@DrTedros](URL [\#COVID19](URL &gt; &gt;[**World Health Organization (WHO)**@WHO](URL BREAKING  ""We have therefore made the assessment that [\#COVID19](URL can be characterized as a pandemic""-[@DrTedros](URL [\#coronavirus](URL [59.7K](URL AM - Mar 11, 2020](URL Ads info and privacy](URL [60.9K people are talking about this](URL China, where the death rate peaked only a few weeks ago at about 3%, is back to 0.7%  and rapidly declining, while China is taking full control of the disease  and that with the help of a not-spoken-about medication developed 39 years ago by Cuba, called *Interferon* Alpha 2B (IFNrec), very effective for fighting viruses and other diseases, but is not known and used in the world, because the US under the illegal embargo of Cuba does not allow the medication to be marketed internationally. WHO has most likely received orders from above, from those people who also manage Trump and the leaders (sic) of the European Union and her member countries, those who aim to control the world with force  the One World Order. This has been on the drawing board for years. The final decision to go ahead NOW, was taken in January 2020 at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos  behind very much closed doors, of course. The Gates, GAVI (an association of vaccination-promoting pharmaceuticals), Rockefellers, Rothschilds *et al*, they are all behind this decision  the implementation of **Agenda ID2020**  see below.  After the pandemic has been officially declared, the next step may be  also at the recommendation either by WHO, or individual countries, **force vaccination,** under police and/or military surveillance. Those who refuse may be penalized (fines and / or jail  and force-vaccinated all the same). If indeed force-vaccination will happen, another bonanza for Big Pharma, people really dont know what type of cocktail will be put into the vaccine, maybe a slow killer, that acts-up only in a few years  or a disease that hits only the next generation  or a brain debilitating agent, or a gene that renders women infertile . all is possible  always with the aim of full population control and population reduction. In a few years time, one doesnt know, of course, where the disease comes from. Thats the level of technology our bio-war labs have reached (US, UK, Israel, Canada, Australia). Another hypothesis, at this point only a hypothesis, but a realistic one, is that along with the vaccination  if not with this one, then possibly with a later one, **a nano-chip may be injected, unknown to the person being vaccinated.** The chip may be remotely charged with all your personal data, including bank accounts  digital money. Yes, digital money thats what they are aiming at, so you really have no control any more over your health and other intimate data, but also over your earnings and spending. Your money could be blocked, or taken away  as a sanction for misbehavior, for swimming against the stream. You may become a mere slave of the masters. Comparatively, feudalism may appear like a walk in the park. Its not for nothing that Dr. Tedros, DG of WHO, said a few days ago, we must move towards digital money, because physical paper and coin money can spread diseases, especially endemic diseases, like the coronavirus. A precursor for things to come?  Or for things already here?  In many Scandinavian countries cash is largely banned and even a bar of chocalate can be paid only electronically. We are moving towards a totalitarian state of the world. This is part of **Agenda ID2020**  and these steps to be implemented now  prepared since long, including by the coronavirus computer simulation at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore on 18 October 2019, sponsored by the WEF and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Bill Gates, one of the chief advocates of vaccinations for everybody, especially in Africa  is also a huge advocate of population reduction. Population reduction is among the goals of the elite within the WEF, the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Morgens  and a few more. The objective: fewer people (a small elite) can live longer and better with the reduced and limited resources Mother Earth is generously offering. This had openly been propagated already in the 1960s and 70s by Henry Kissinger, Foreign Secretary in de Nixon Administration, a co-engineer of the Vietnam war, and main responsible for the semi-clandestine bombing of Cambodia, a genocide of millions of unarmed Cambodian civilians. Along with the CIA-Kissinger engineered coup on 9/11, 1973, in Chile, killing the democratically elected Salvador Allende and putting the military dictator Pinochet in power, Kissinger has committed war crimes. Today, he is a spokesman (so to speak) for Rockefeller and their Bilderberger Society. [**More than Just a Virus**](URL Two weeks after the computer simulation at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland, that produced (aka simulated) 65 million deaths (!), the COVID-19 virus first appeared in Wuhan. By now it is almost certain that the virus was brought to Wuhan from outside, most likely from a bio-war lab in the US. See also [this](URL and [this](URL \* What is the infamous **ID2020?** It is an alliance of public-private partners, including UN agencies and civil society. **Its an electronic ID program that uses generalized vaccination as a platform for digital identity.** The program harnesses existing birth registration and vaccination operations to provide newborns with a portable and persistent biometrically-linked digital identity. **GAVI, the** ***Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization***, identifies itself on its website as a global health partnership of public and private sector organizations dedicated to immunization for all. GAVI is supported by WHO, and needless to say, its main partners and sponsors are the pharma-industry. The ID2020 Alliance at their 2019 Summit, entitled Rising to the Good ID Challenge, in September 2019 in New York, decided to roll out their program in 2020, a decision confirmed by the WEF in January 2020 in Davos. Their **digital identity** program will be tested with the government of Bangladesh. GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and partners from academia and humanitarian relief (as they call it), are part of the pioneer party. Is it just a coincidence that ID2020 is being rolled out at the onset of what WHO calls a Pandemic?  Or is a pandemic needed to roll out the multiple devastating programs of ID2020? Here is what Anir Chowdhury, policy advisor of the Bangladesh government program, has to say: &gt;*We are implementing a forward-looking approach to digital identity that gives individuals control over their own personal information, while still building off existing systems and programs. The Government of Bangladesh recognizes that the design of digital identity systems carries far-reaching implications for individuals access to services and livelihoods, and we are eager to pioneer this approach.* Wow! Does Mr. Anir Chowdhury know what he is getting into? Back to the Pandemic and the panic. Geneva, the European seat of the United Nations, including the headquarters of WHO, is basically shot down. Not unlike the lock-down that started in Venice and later expanded to northern Italy until a few days ago  and now the lock-down covers all of Italy. Similar lock-down may soon also be adopted by France  and other European vassal states to the Anglo-Zionist empire. Numerous memoranda with similar panic-mongering contents from different UN agencies in Geneva are circulating. Their key message is  cancel all mission travel, all events in Geneva, visits to the Palais des Nations, the Geneva Cathedral, other monuments and museums. The latest directives, many agencies instruct their staff to work from home, not to risk contamination from public transportation. This ambiance of panic and fear  outstrips any sense of reality, when the truth doesnt matter. People cant even think any more about the causes and what may be behind it. Nobody believes you (anymore), when you refer to Event 201, the coronavirus simulation, the Wuhan Military Games, the closing last August 7, of the high-security biological war lab at Fort Detrick, Maryland. what could have at one point been an eye opener for many, today is sheer conspiracy theory. The power of propaganda. A destabilizing power  destabilizing countries and people, destroying economies, creating hardship for people who may lose their jobs, usually the ones who can least afford it. Also, at this time it becomes increasingly important to remind people that the outbreak in China was targeting the Chinese genome. Did it later mutate to transgress the borders of Chinese DNA? When did that happen, if it happened? Because at the beginning it was clear that even the infected victims in other parts of the world, were to 99.9% of Chinese descent. What happened later, when the virus spread to Italy and Iran, is another issue, and opens the way to a number of speculations. (i) There were various strains of the virus circulated in sequence  so as to destabilize countries around the world and to confound the populace and media, so that especially nobody of the mainstream may come to the conclusion that the first strain was targeting China in a bio-war. (ii) In Iran, I have a strong suspicion that the virus was an enhanced form of MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, man-made, broke out first in Saudi Arabia in 2012 , directed to the Arabic genome)  which was somehow introduced into government circles (by aerosol spray?)  with the goal of Regime Change by COVID19-caused death. Its Washingtons wishful thinking for at least the last 30 years. (iii) In Italy  why Italy?  Maybe because Washington / Brussels wanted to hit Italy hard for having been officially the first country to sign a Belt and Road (BRI) accord with China (actually the first was Greece, but nobody is supposed to know that China came to the rescue of Greece, destroyed by Greeces brothers, the EU members, mainly Germany and France). (iv) The hype about the high death to infection rate in Italy, as of the time of this writing: 10,149 infections vs. 631 deaths = death rate of 6.2 (comparatively Iran: 8042 infections vs. 291 deaths = 3.6 death rate). The death rate of Italy is almost double that of Iran and almost ten-fold that of average Europe. (Are these discrepancies the result of failures in the establishing reliable data pertaining to infections, see our observations pertaining to Italy below). Why?  Was is Italy being affected with virus panic? Was there a much stronger strain introduced to Italy? The common flu in Europe in the 2019 / 2020 season, has apparently so far killed about 16,000 (in the US the death toll is, according to CDC between 14,000 and 32,000, depending on which CDC website you look at). Could it be that among the Italian coronavirus deaths there were also common flu victims, as the affected victims are mostly elderly with respiratory preconditions? **Also, symptoms are very similar between coronavirus and the common flu, and nobody questions and checks the official authorities narrative?** Maybe not all the coronavirus strains come from the same laboratory. A journalist from Berlin of Ukrainian origin, told me this morning that Ukraine is host to some 5 high security US bio-war labs. They test regularly new viruses on the population  yet, when strange diseases break out in the surroundings of the labs, nobody is allowed to talk about it. Something similar, she says, is happening in Georgia, where there are even more Pentagon / CIA bio-war labs  and where also new and strange diseases break out. All of this makes the composite picture even more complicated. Overarching all is this super hype is profit driven, the quest for instant profit, instant benefits from the suffering of the people. This panic making is a hundred-fold of what its worth. What these kingpins of the underworld, who pretend to run the upper world, perhaps miscalculated, **is that in todays globalized and vastly outsourced world the west depends massively on Chinas supply chain, for consumer goods, and for intermediary merchandise**  and, foremost for medication and medical equipment. **At least 80% of medication or ingredients for medication, as well as for medical equipment comes from China. The western China dependence for antibiotics is even higher, some 90%. The potential impacts on health are devastating.** **During the height of the COVID-19 epidemic Chinas production apparatus for everything was almost shut-down.** For deliveries that were still made, merchandise vessels were regularly and categorically turned back from many harbors all around the world. **So, the west has tricked itself into a shortage-of-everything mode by waging a de facto economic war on China.** How long will it last?  Nobody knows, but Chinas economy which was down by about half, has rapidly recovered to above 80% of what it was before the coronavirus hit. How long will it last to catch up with the backlog? What is behind it all?  A total crackdown with artificially induced panic to the point where people are screaming *help, give us vaccinations, display police and military for our security*  or even if the public despair doesnt go that far, it would be easy for the EU and US authorities to impose a military *stage of siege* for health protection of the people. In fact, CDC (Center for Disease Control in Atlanta), has already designed harshly dictatorial directives for a health emergency. Along with forced vaccination, who knows what would be contained in the cocktail of mini-diseases injected, and what their long-term effects might be. Similar to those of GMOs, where all sorts of germs could be inserted without us, the commons, knowing? We may indeed be just at the beginning of the implementation of ID2020  which includes, forced vaccination, population reduction and total digital control of everybody  on the way to One World Order  and global financial hegemony  Full Spectrum Dominance, as the PNAC (Plan for a New American Century) likes to call it. A windfall for China. China has been purposely targeted for economic destruction, because of her rapidly advancing economy, an economy soon to overtake that of the now hegemon, the US of A, and because of Chinas strong currency, the Yuan, also potentially overtaking the dollar as the worlds main reserve currency. Both occurrences would mean the end of US dominance over the world. The coronavirus disease, now in more than 80 countries, has crashed the stock markets, a decline of at least 20% over the last few weeks  and rising; the feared consequences from the virus of an economic slow-down, if not recession, has slashed petrol prices within about two weeks almost in half. However, without Chinas central bank interference, the Yuans value vis--vis the dollar has been rather stable, at around 7 Yuan to the dollar. That means, the Chinese economy, despite COVID-19, is receiving still much trust around the globe. Advice to China  buy all the US and European corporate shares you can at current rock-bottom prices from the stock markets that collapsed by a fifth or more, plus buy lots of oil futures. When the prices recover, you have not only made billions, probably trillions from the west, but you also may own or hold significant and influence-yielding amounts of shares in most of the largest US and European corporations  and will be able to help call the shots of their future endeavors. There is however, one little silver lining oscillating at the horizon full of dark clouds. It could miraculously be an awakening of consciousness of a critical mass that could put an end to it all. Although, we seem to be far from such a miracle, somewhere in a hidden corner of our brain, we all have a spark of consciousness left. We have the spiritual capacity to abandon the disaster path of western neoliberal capitalism, and instead espouse solidarity, compassion and love for each other and for our society. That may be the only way to break the gridlock and doom of western egocentric greed. \* Note to readers: please click the share buttons above or below. Forward this article to your email lists.

It wasnt until the virus had become prevalent in their own town killing many. Only then would they have begun to see any sign of success with their risky business endeavor. Having taken on the role of the town chef, the amount of food available had become extremely limited. Keeping his wife and, unborn son safe from the contaminated world lying just beyond their doorstep. He ran that pizza shop all on his own towards the end. Proud of the life he had built for him and, his family in Wickford. Charlie had become a well-respected member of the town just before those dark times. Ensuring that everyone remained fed even if they had depleted all their savings or never had any. He knew it wasnt possible to roam the surface like we were once free to do. He couldnt stand aside and let people starve around him. It was Monday, and the food delivery would surely be arriving at Wickford shortly. The streets had become naked as debris blew freely across them by the strong winds. Lines of cars typically clogged the streets as they honked at each other in frustration over nothing. Everyone was always so concerned about themselves. All the way to the end too. Ignorant to the fact that all along we could have kept things contained. It didnt have to turn out this way and the blame had become clear. A severe lack of responsibility was the main catalyst for the sudden epidemic. The Mishandling of the initial cases in the United States had spiraled quickly out of control. One thing remained on Charlies mind throughout those difficult times. Helping those who no longer had the ability to do it for themselves. He didnt have time to point any useless fingers at others. Careful as he had always been while driving down the streets. Even though no one was around to enforce the rules if they were broken, he would still abide by them. Stopping at red lights that turned as the time passed even though the streets held no traffic. Aware of the danger lurking around every corner. Driving around the bend coming to the empty shopping plaza that once was full of curious customers. Exploring what the creative storefronts had to offer with their hard-earned money. This town was once a thriving economy of goods. Perfect spot for a restaurant to emerge bringing unique talent along with it. Mac the food supplier had not arrived yet giving Charlie enough time to begin preparing the busy day. He knew it wouldnt be long though until his reliable friend would make his appearance. The long black truck drove by another individual just like himself. Forced to provide for those who depended on him. Forced to turn the gears of society for some specially printed paper. A genuine family man. Just as Charlie turned the thick steel key as it fell perfectly into the grooves of the mechanism. Successfully unlocking the only storefront that would open that day along the strip. The dark black trucks horn could be heard echoing from off in the distance as it got closer. One of Macs favorite pass times when rolling into each town alerting others of his arrival. Every morning he prayed that when he flicked the switch on the wall the lights would turn on. Crossing his fingers as Charlie paused for a moment. Losing electricity was his biggest fear at that time. Too busy to convert the building over to a personal source of production for this precious commodity. Always had been taken for granted in the past as we consumed more and more. He was still attached to the unreliable grid. He knew it would only be a matter of time before the workers at the power plant would fail. The large reactors were just down the road and, were a requirement for preparing Wickfords food. One person he could always rely on was his friend Mac. Rolling into the empty parking lot stretching out his enormous vehicle perfectly in front of the small pizzeria to be unloaded immediately. Closing his eyes he flipped the stiff switch quickly lighting up the store and, firing up the brick ovens. Propping the front door wide open with a wooden doorstop to prepare for the incoming delivery. The thick metal door of the truck swung shut shaking the entire cabin of the vehicle. The heavily built driver jumped down to the black asphalt lot. Failing in his attempts to sneak along the side of the trailer unnoticed. Avoiding any direct eye contact with the restaurant owner he quickly started his work. He knew his friend was standing at the door waiting for him. Giving in he just spilled the beans. Charlie I'm afraid this weeks order is a little lighter than the last one. Crossing his arms as he stood outside the open door with his head down in disappointment. He expected this news but was holding on to some glimmer of hope that wouldnt come through. Blown away in the strong winds as the towns people remained unaware. Thats three weeks in a row now Mac. Are you sure everything is alright back at the processing center? Waving his hand in a pathetic attempt to dismiss his friend's concern. The old driver just looked back with this stern blank look he had never seen before. He felt that his friend was paranoid because of the stressful days he had to endure lately. Dont you worry about that Charlie boy. You got enough on your plate right here in Wickford. Hows Dakota coming along? Thats your number one priority and dont you forget it. He knew he was right but insisted on getting more information out of his friend. This wasnt a matter that could be so easily dismissed here in Wickford. If I run out of food, we all will be in trouble. Dakota included so dont you forget that. All of us here in Wickford are counting on you, Mac. Pulling his reliable hand truck down from the side of the trailer to begin unloading. Without saying another word, he began stacking the week's delivery. As the stacks of boxes made their way up the cement walkway. The weight of the load leveraged perfectly against the bold wheels of the elegant architectural design. Charlie stood at the door taking inventory of everything as it passed the front counter. Parked center of the large walk-in cooler where it would be stored until it was time to be prepared. Looks like less beef again. The cows aren't becoming infected, are they? Stopping dead in his tracks Mac just stood there with this blank expression. Silence stood out more than usual in the newly deserted environment. Continuing with his work as he dropped the last load off-center of the cooler. See you next week Charlie, and do me a favor will you. Stop worrying so much, please. The worst is behind us. Last I heard the scientist has got the vaccination nearly complete. Apparently, they are only missing one last piece to the puzzle. Anyway, it shouldnt be long now till we are out of the woods. Take care, Charlie. Thick black smoke from the twin exhaust pipes escaped into the already contaminated atmosphere. The 500 H.P. engine ignited as it began pulling the massive load behind it with 1800 lbs. of torque. Charlie pulled the doorstop lose from under the door as he watched Mac drive off into the distance. The horn rang out loud and clear echoing throughout the town as he made his way to the next stop. Where another disappointment restaurant owner awaited in another struggling town. This trend would continue for hundreds of miles. In less than a season the world as we knew it was gone. The tone of the automated phone system had already begun taking orders. Letting out a sigh as the cooler door slowly came to a close. Here goes nothing.  Walking over to the small sink protruding from the white wall to wash his hands. He would repeat this process dozens of times each day. Certainly, before he started preparing any kind of food. Looking up to the small monitor attached to the wall above his work area. The screen was full of orders just like any other morning. Distracted from the upsetting delivery this week he found himself unprepared for the day. Realizing that he was the only one being held accountable for the entire community these days. His employees slowly stopped returning to work out of fear of becoming infected. This was the case for most of the world. The superior industrial production the United States once relied on has diminished to near extinction. Taking a moment to see what ingredients he needed for today's orders. Annoyed by the relentless tone from the phones began crawling under his skin. Overwhelmed by the massive workload he began to think to himself. Would money even be useful anymore? Why was he doing this to himself? It wasnt his problem that others were too afraid to leave their homes. How much longer would he even be able to feed everyone? Should he be saving all these supplies for his own family? After all, he was the one with the connection. He was the one risking his life day in and day out for others. Unaware of what the future would hold. Receiving little to no payment for his life-threatening work these days. Clicking on the old radio that hung on the wall it was previously tuned to his favorite station. *WLEO your NPR radio* *reaching out to any remaining listener's.* *Today we have* *an urgent* *announcement.* *Local hospitals are encouraging those who have not displayed any symptoms to come forward.* *A small blood donation is all they are asking of you as they* *comb* *for an answer.* *Desperately searching for the final piece* *completing* *an effective* *vaccine.* *Stopping any further spread* *of the virus.* *Someone out there must hold the missing key to this puzzle.* *Humanity has no time left to spare, unfortunately.* *Thank you all and, good luck out their folks.* *Stay clean. * Turning the dial all the way to the left until a slight click echoed throughout the silent pizzeria. Alexa, play me the most recent update on the virus. The gentle tone of a robotic woman vibrated from its tiny speakers of the small device above the counter. Whats the magic word, Charlie? Chuckling as he came to the realization that the machine demanded more than most individuals. Respect for others vanished in a society plagued by such a vicious outbreak. Giving in to the stern machine. Alexa my dear, will you please show me the latest update? Sure, but next time please will do just fine. I dont appreciate your sarcasm. But here you are as requested... Released this morning from the Center of Disease and Control at exactly 7 A.M. *We are encouraging anyone out there to come forward in a desperate attempt to eliminate this virus.* *We here at the CDC have deciphered the majority of the cure.* *We are missing one critical strand of DNA that contains the antigen capable of defeating the virus.* *Honestly, we are unsure if such an individual even exists within the world today.* *As time continues to pass the chance that a person will come forward shrink with every second passed.* *Affective as of today, any newborn child will automatically be tested.* *Remember if you are infected to remain in your home.* *The military has launched clean-up efforts in the most heavily contaminated areas.* *Black Xs will be painted on the doors to homes containing confirmed contamination.* *Please refrain from entering any of these properties.* *All local hospitals will be accepting blood from those who have not experienced any symptoms.* *Help us save humanity before its too late for us all.* *We appreciate your time and remember to stay inside.* *Stay clean.*"

I heard this on NPR a couple months ago and I thought it was really interesting. Apparently Russian state media isnt your basic twentieth century propaganda machine. Instead of suppressing opinions, Russian state media provides a plethora of conspiratorial and contradictory takes on the news. Moreover, Ive been noticing something weird on social media. In the comment section, where one typically finds a myriad of hateful and zealous comments, Ive also noticed people accusing each other of being Russian bots. Personally, I think Russia has a lot to gain with Trump in office. However, I also think Russia is more than happy sowing discord by inciting panic through paranoia in the US and undermining voter confidence.

When you say and do things which are meant to gain the approval of others, youre cutting yourself off from what you really think and who you really are. Youre participating in a lie, maybe you mean well. I dont mind if you lie, I dont think its a moral issue really. People are free to not ask questions and just accept things - what do you think school is all about? Its place where they talk about critical thinking but youll get suspended if you ever try it. We are taught that its good to cultivate fake realities: How are you?, Oh Im great, amazing actually. What youre actually doing here, over and over, is telling your subconscious, the part that is responsible for your feelings, your emotional center, What ever you actually feel is not worth talking about or thinking about. What do you think happens to angry feelings which are never allowed to come out because its not very nice? Or expressions of vulnerability which must be kept away because it doesnt fit other peoples expectations? Or spontaneous expressions of joy? I wonder where depression and mental illness really comes from... It doesnt matter how smart you think you are, existing in a state of emotional invalidation will cause psychosis. Gas lighting is wonderful technique for breaking people down, all you have to is consistently doubt someones perceptions. Slowly get your victim to believe theres something wrong with them and then hand them opiates to soothe the pain. Theyll never know whats wrong with them. Theyll have friends, good times, a normal life and wonder why they sometimes have suicidal thoughts. The subconscious is actually an excellent guide. Even if you live a, soul crushing, modern existence, the subconscious doesnt really listen to you. It has this wonderful habit of sabotaging your life if you ignore it too much. Maybe youve wondered why that job interview went badly or that time you bombed socially. Youre being told directly that youre not living quite right. This doesnt mean the thing that you went after is necessarily wrong, but something about you is not being acknowledge by you and this is the only way to get you to pay attention. Propaganda seeks to divorce us from that still small voice. The main purpose of society is to unify its members. As humans, we are all attuned to co-operation and mimicry. That social co-operation message is so over-played that people no longer understand what authenticity is anymore. Authenticity i.e. the person you really are and the way you actually feel, is systematically suppressed from the day we are born. Our parents, our teachers, our peers all form a conspiracy around us. We are told facts that are true. Not following the herd brings us face to face with one of the most frightening prospects we as humans can imagine: a life cut off from others and ultimately dying alone. Whether this is true or not, emotionally, subconsciously, we face this. This is a much more insidious control mechanism than anything we think of as conspiracy theorists. Society is bi-polar on this issue. On the one hand people are trained to reject authenticity but when a truly authentic person appears, that person is hailed as a savior (although quietly crucified later). But for a few moments their authenticity is like rain in the desert. If there is a master conspiracy in this world, that is it. This can get quite profound. We all know deep inside, were not a cosmic accident. We know that the person we are is an incredibly valuable, unique being. When we see ourselves and treat ourselves with honor, as the divine beings we are, things just... work better, life becomes worth living, we see other people for the beings they are. How far can we go with this, is this too much woo? Its like looking for your keys in a dark room and someone turns on a light. This sweeping sense of relief from the realization that there is a way, there is a truth. You do matter. You are loved. The turning point comes when you no longer need someone to remind you of this. When you know it inside and out, when you reach a point when no-one can take it away from you - then you will have your revolution."

Victims Testify of Child Sex Trafficking and Satanic Ritual Abuse...|| |:-|:-|:-| |||| &amp;#x200B; 800,000 children a year in the United States go missing, many of them being sexually trafficked through pedophilia networks where the children suffer unimaginable horrors such as Satanic ritual abuse. This number is comprised of documented cases of children gone missing, and does not include children who are born and bred into pedophilia networks and have no birth certificates, or undocumented immigrant children who come across the borders. Worldwide, the number is close to 8 million children missing and being sexually trafficked. Such is the scope of the problem that was reported earlier this year (2018) in Westminster, London by *The International Tribunal for Natural Justice* ([ITNJ](URL as the court convened over a 3-day period to launch their *Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Human Trafficking and Child Sex Abuse.* *Processing img axlq402greb41...* The Judicial Commission is comprised of world leaders who have been involved in fighting child sex trafficking for years, and includes intelligence officers, politicians, legal scholars, and many others. (Website: [URL The International Tribunal was formed because most of the world's government bodies today have been corrupted and no longer represent the people, but instead serve the interest of private corporations, and as such, justice is seldom found in most government judicial courts around the world today to stop such a heinous crime as child sex trafficking. In fact, the child sex trafficking network today is actually facilitated by the rich and powerful, whose influence reaches into the political and judicial branches of society. From the INTJ report ([Commemorative Issue - The Westminster Seatings 2018](URL &gt;The ITNJ initiative has arisen as a response to the disregard for the rule of law exhibited by (alleged) public officials, corporate directors, and 'world leaders' who have deliberately privatized and weaponized the governments of the world against their own people. It is the culmination of years of endeavor and research on the part of many people from a diverse set of backgrounds dedicated to safeguarding a viable future for human kind. It is recognized that we the people must take responsibility in holding government to account when it violates basic human rights and natural law. Today we know conclusively that many of these activities are being facilitated by politically and financially powerful individuals, government, and corporate organizations who perennially avoid being brought to account for their actions due to their affluence and influence. Included in the court proceedings of the first Judicial Commission of the Tribunal were powerful testimonies from victims who suffered unimaginable horrors as children being sexually abused and trafficked through this powerful world-wide pedophilia network that sexually trafficks children, a human trafficking network that brings in more revenue than the trafficking of weapons and drugs. During the opening Plenary Session, Chief Counsel **Robert David Steele**, a former CIA officer, gave perhaps the best summary of the purpose of Tribunal's Judicial Commission, which has been condensed into a 15 minute video: &amp;#x200B; [VIDEO](URL &amp;#x200B; A partial transcript: As a parent and as a patriot I have been outraged for some time by the clear and present danger to society of pedopredation (pedophilia or paedophilia). I recognize now that child torture, child murder, and child organ harvesting is an 'accepted' practice at, * the highest levels of government * the NGO * the multinational corporate sector, ...as well as throughout academic institutions and civil society. This scourge persists because it is allowed to exist by the complicit authorities. As a former spy and pioneer for *Open Source Intelligence* ([OSINT](URL I have worked with INTERPOL, EUROPOL, Scotland Yard, the FBI, and the national intelligence and law enforcement services or their representatives from over 66 countries. What I have found, without exception, is that they are all staffed by good people trapped in bad systems - systems that are not allowed to properly address this scourge - the multi-generational crime against humanity known as pedophilia. Pedophilia - a 'love for children' - is not an accurate term. There is no love for children manifest in any aspect of child slavery, sexual abuse, torture, murder, or body harvesting. For this reason the inaugural seating of the Commission of Inquiry into Human Trafficking &amp; Child Sex Abuse, at the behest of ITNJ Commissioner **Carine Hutsebaut** (a criminologist and psychotherapist) the term 'Pedopredation,' has been designated as a more appropriate term, along with the term 'pedosexual,' for that considerable sub-set abuses of children outside the Satanic ritual network. It is vital to note that many organizations that started out with the best of intentions - from the Boy Scouts to the day care centers to [United Nations](URL assistance and development groups to Oxfam as the most recent example - appear to have been infiltrated by pedopredators. By virtue of being in daily contact with the most vulnerable members of society, our children, many of the mandated organizations have, over time, attracted numerous pedopredators to their ranks, and been compromised by their lack of proper vetting processes, as well as also turning a deliberate blind eye to the transgressions of staff. This need not be so if governments were honest and counterintelligence were to be exercised. It appears to be a matter of policy at the highest levels of global leadership to turn a blind eye to pedopredation and pedosexuality. It appears that pedopredation - including the attendant torture and murder of infants to produce [adrenalized blood](URL via ritual Satanic abuse - is in some cases considered an elite 'privilege' whereupon these echelons are permitted to practice such perversity with impunity. There are two additional causes for alarm. \- First, there appears to be a deliberate campaign [by the elite](URL to infect local, state (province) and national police, prosecutors, and judges - from Australia to Zimbabwe - with a 'taste' for pedosexuality. It is used as both an *initiation* rite into [the Deep State and Shadow Government](URL and as a basis for blackmail. Worse, we are now seeing two terrible trends: one toward abusing and murdering children before they learn to speak (they cannot bear witness) the other, perhaps brought back by U.S. forces from Afghanistan, the combination of war dogs and toddlers in a devastating combination of child rape and bestiality - dogs raping children for videos to be sold Add to this the growing market in fetuses, the most prized being those delivered on the floor as part of a Satanic ritual, and one has an inkling of the greatest evil on the planet. \- Second, it has become clear from our early inquiries with ample documentation, that both the family courts and the insolvency courts are being used to strip children from families to convert the children into a commodity that can be sold for cash, and are also being used to strip assets from wealthy individuals who are not part of the Deep State network. Governments are complicit in child and asset stripping, which would not occur if registrars, lawyers (barristers), and judges were held accountable. False claims and documents abound, and in their tolerated existence, challenge the legitimacy of the government. ENOUGH! The purpose of the Commission is to do what has not been done before: to document the actual totality of missing children each year (preliminary estimates yet to be documented are eight million a year, or 22,000 a day) to document what happens to these children once they are ingested into the local to global pedopredation network of networks The average lifespan of a child once in the pedopredation (pedophilia or paedophilia) system is estimated by some to be two years - those being groomed for 'leadership' roles that perpetuate pedosexuality at all levels live much longer. &amp;#x200B; Tribunal Censored by [the Corporate ""Mainstream"" Media](URL Public Largely Unaware of the Child Sex Trafficking Problem **David Seaman** &amp;#x200B; *Processing img x44mngfqreb41...* &amp;#x200B; The first meeting of the Judicial Commission happened in Westminster, London on April 16-18th 2018. Health Impact News stumbled upon the ITNJ website when investigative reporter **John P. Thomas** was researching material for his series of articles on [pedophilia in the Roman Catholic Church](URL Even though this event happened many months ago, it apparently has not been reported on in [the corporate ""mainstream"" media](URL as is to be expected, but the event apparently is not well-known to the alternative media either. The work of the Tribunal and the Judicial Commission continues here at the end of 2018, and it is our hope that our readership and others in the alternative media will share this information far and wide exposing what is the most evil enterprise in the world today. Chief Counsel Robert David Steele states that the Tribunal and Judicial Commission's purpose is to educate the public, not to try or convict criminals (see video above): This is a court of inquiry. It's not an adversarial court, it's a non-profit educational event. One of the most wonderful things that this court could achieve, now that we have had ""[pizzagate](URL for example, which opened people's minds, is we could achieve an opening of the public's mind. Governments are letting us all down. And I absolutely agree with the Commissioner who brings forward the need to the sovereignty of ""we the people."" Because governments have become not only bureaucratized, but they are now the servants of the deep state, of the banks. And while we are not a law enforcement commission, we can in fact turn information over to law enforcement. The center of gravity for taking down the deep state, pedophilia is both the induction glue, pedophilia is how the deep state recruits and controls people. It is also the *Achilles heel* of the deep state. I believe that once the public realizes that the government is not protecting their children, at a scale of vulnerability that we can articulate, then everything else about the government is called into question. So for me this is a truly righteous endeavor. I will end by saying that as much good as it might do to get the British angry, for me the center of gravity for change is the American public. Because if you can get the American public angry, we will stop supporting dictators overseas, and we will close all of our military bases overseas. I am on record as a former CIA operations officer saying that our thousand bases overseas are not there for national defense, they're there to serve as lily pads for the smuggling of, * guns * gold * cash * drugs * small children.. &amp;#x200B; Exposing Police Involvement and Cover-up of... Child Sex Trafficking [VIDEO](URL &amp;#x200B; One of the most revealing and compelling testimonies given to the Commission was from former Scotland Yard Police detective **Jon Wedger** who specialized in child abuse investigations. As a CID officer he discovered child sex trafficking networks reaching to highest levels of the police department, local government, and even the BBC, which led to an independent Police Complaints Commission delving into the depths of police involvement. Attempts to silence him failed, even after he was threatened by his superiors that he would lose his job, his children, and his home if he did not shut up. When asked by Chief Counsel Robert David Steele why he hadn't been killed, he replied: &gt;*Jesus* loves me. Hopefully I've got a few more years. I've got a job to do. One of my saving graces, and it didn't meant to happen... I actually did an interview with the UK column with a man called ***Brian Garish*** and he said it was too hot to handle and put it out online, and I thought, ""Oh my God, what's he done."" But it actually saved me. So the alternative media really did help me. Watch the entire testimony in the video above. &amp;#x200B; **Victim Testimonies** &gt;**Ronald Bernard** [VIDEO](URL &amp;#x200B; One of the most amazing victim testimonies given at the Judicial Commission was that of former Dutch Banker **Ronald Bernard**, who suffered through horrible sexual abuse as a child, and then became an abuser himself while working his way up into the elite sections of [the global banking industry](URL Bernard claims that there are about 8000 to 8500 leaders in the banking industry that control most of the affairs of this world. He was on his way to becoming one of them, until they asked him to sacrifice a live baby. His testimony, like other survivor testimonies, will disturb you. When I searched other information regarding Bernard, I found news reports stating he had been killed in Florida for exposing some of the inner workings of the secret society called [the ""Illuminati](URL Yet here he is in 2018 giving testimony at the Tribunal's Judicial Commission, no doubt at great risk to his life in bringing this information to the public. Watch the video above. **Jay Parker** [VIDEO](URL **Jay Parker** grew up in a multi-generational family involved in the Illuminati secret society, dating back to the 1700s. As a child he was a victim of Satanic ritual abuse. His mother taught him that 12% of America is generational satanic. &gt;When my mother in 63 told me that 12% of America is generational satanic, I really found it hard to believe. We went to regular church, and then of course in the afternoon we went to Church of the Marquee of Hell. But when you have a society where 800,000 children are disappearing a year, like here in America, and its not even in the media, its not discussed at all except among people who are researching the child trafficking and the horrific abuse that's going on from these dark occult... Can I say that we are in an insane position here? I mean, this is insanity. 17 and a half million people dying [of cancer because the cure is banned](URL by the corruption of the [pharmaceutical companies controlling the governments](URL This is genocide, and yet we're putting up with it. His expertise today is in healing modalities, and overcoming what he describes as the Satanic brainwashing that happens during the first six years of life. As an insider growing up in [the Illuminati](URL he has much information to share about mind control and how the elite in the Illuminati control culture through the media, academia, the entertainment industry, etc. He claims that this control over people's minds is what allows 800,000 children to go missing each year in the U.S. and no one even bothers to question this. However, Parker believes people are beginning to wake up to the truth. Watch the video above. &amp;#x200B; **Kristy Allen** [VIDEO](URL &amp;#x200B; &gt;The video of **Kristy Allen**'s testimony is probably the most-viewed video from the Westminster hearings. Kristy was a victim of Satanic ritual sexual abuse as a child. But for much of her life, she did not remember it. Her father was a member of the Mormon Church, and was recruited by the military. He himself was reportedly a victim of child abuse as well. Kristy reveals how their family was affected by mind control through the [MK Ultra program](URL which prevented her from remembering anything about the sexual abuse for years. She and her siblings were allegedly chosen for covert military operations as children. Kristy eventually began to remember some of her childhood memories where she was continually raped and abused, and is in the process of healing. Watch her testimony in the video above. **Why is 'Health Impact News' publishing this Information?** I started [Health Impact News](URL in 2011 to share with the public truths I was learning about health that are routinely censored in the corporate-sponsored ""mainstream"" media. My own spiritual awakening to the truth began in 1979 when I committed my life to Jesus Christ, and can be read here. In 1998 my family and I moved to the Philippines for several years, and it was there that I researched the truth about fats and oils, seeing first-hand how healthy the older generation of Filipinos in the rural areas were when consuming such large amounts of saturated fat through [coconut oil](URL which was virtually banned in the U.S. due to the Government's nutritional policies which condemned (and still do!) saturated fats. I quickly learned that powerful corporate forces controlled nutritional policies to promote the sale of certain foods and drugs worldwide where the U.S. dominated the world market. As I began to publish the truth about coconut oil and how healthy it was, while at the same time starting to export a natural form of virgin coconut oil to the U.S. produced by traditional methods, the public began to wake up to the truth about the health benefits of coconut oil and the lies being published about saturated fats in general. I was utilizing the power of the Internet, taking the truth directly to the public. Little did I know at that time that I was bumping into a mutli-billion dollar drug industry selling cholesterol-lowering *statin drugs* that depended on this false nutritional philosophy that condemned saturated fats. [The FDA](URL came after us for selling ""unapproved drugs"" as we were making health claims for coconut oil, publishing peer-reviewed studies and customer testimonials. We spent considerable resources on legal advice to learn how to market our products without violating FDA laws, which necessitated that we keep all of the information about the health benefits of coconut oil and any other natural, non-patentable product we were selling, off of the websites where those products were sold. This was the genesis of *Health Impact News*, which originally started out at CoconutOil.com where we publish the truth about coconut oil. I began to publish much about the pharmaceutical industry and its collusion with the U.S. government, particularly on the vaccine topics, which today are our most-read topics, particularly the [HPV Gardasil vaccine](URL and the scandals surrounding it. In 2014, we started MedicalKidnap.com, documenting how the government routinely takes children away from good homes and good parents for reasons other than true child abuse, and effectively trafficks those children through the current foster *care system* where the majority of them are abused and heavily drugged while under state care. What we learned at the end of 2014 and into 2015 truly shocked us, and destroyed much of my belief in the concepts of *freedom* and *liberty* in [the United States](URL I still believe that the Constitution of the United States is perhaps one of the greatest documents ever written in the history of mankind, but the values of human rights that it represents are routinely ignored or violated every day across this country - and maybe always have been. We began to investigate why so many children were being taken out of homes and put into foster care, and have documented those reasons at MedicalKidnap.com, along with scores of stories of terrible injustices done to children and parents. One of the reasons that we knew was behind children being taken away from good parents, was the child sex-trafficking problem and the growing problem of pedophilia. (Read our stories on that subject [here](URL Earlier this year as many U.S. State Attorney General offices began issuing indictments against [pedophile Catholic priests and leaders in the Catholic church abusing children](URL we decided to give more exposure to this problem. It was during this research that we came across *The International Tribunal for Natural Justice* and their *Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Human Trafficking and Child Sex Abuse* in London earlier this year. If this topic disturbs you, good! It should. The ITNJ has done the world a great service in exposing this, and we encourage you to share this information with as many people as you can. Because the first step in solving this horrific problem of child sex abuse trafficking and ritualistic murders is acknowledging that this problem actually exists, and that the truth will NOT be found in [the corporate-sponsored ""mainstream"" media](URL 800,000 children in U.S. go missing each year, and 8 million worldwide...! Now that you know **the truth**, you are either, &gt;part of the problem in allowing it to continue or you are part of the solution in exposing this to everyone you can, ...and risking the scorn you will have to endure as a ""conspiracy theorist,"" ""idiot,"" or whatever other name the brainwashed masses will call you for exposing this truth..."

My son's 3rd grade class was discussing [**Columbus**](URL in class this week. I pick him up each day to ""deprogram"" him from the public indoctrination system. When I asked him what he had learned about Mr. Columbus, he said that school taught that one of his ships had sunk off an island. I said, ""that's it?"" and he said ""yes"". I then looked at his homework and it included the Scholastic magazine which featured Columbus and sure enough, the article only said he had made it only to an island name Haiti. Over a dozen states no longer recognize Columbus Day, a creation of the Knights of Columbus back in 1934. Even edgy [Mainstream whorporate news](URL is revising history now as truths become known as to the barbaric history of our country's ""founding"" when we genocided *over 97% of the Indian population* in conquest and brought millions of slaves across the Atlantic to work in the cotton and tobacco fields of the wealthy with names like Jefferson, Washington, Adams, etc. This is 24/7 Wall St.'s list of the richest U.S. presidents: &gt;**George Washington**, first president from 1789 to 1797 \- Net worth: $525 million In office His Virginia plantation, Mount Vernon, consisted of five separate farms on 8,000 acres of prime farmland, run by more than 300 slaves. His wife, Martha Washington, inherited significant property from her father. Washington made well more than subsequent presidents: his salary was 2% of the total U.S. budget in 1789. **Thomas Jefferson**, third president from 1801 to 1809 \- Net worth: $212 million Jefferson was left 3,000 acres and several dozen slaves by his father. Monticello, his home on a 5,000-acre plantation in Virginia, was one of the architectural wonders of its time. He made considerable money in various political positions before becoming president, but was mired in debt towards the end of his life. **James Madison**, fourth president from 1809 to 1817 \- Net worth: $101 million Madison was the largest landowner in Orange County, Va. His land holding consisted of 5,000 acres and the Montpelier estate. He made significant wealth as Secretary of State and president. Madison lost money at the end of his life due to the steady financial collapse of his plantation.Additionally, all these men had slaves, even until death. In fact, Thomas Jefferson pledged his slaves as assets upon his death against the massive debt he had incurred. ([source](URL Now these richest of the new country land baron's of the time were really interested in freedom for all of We the People as they pushed natives into reservations on the worst land possible and took slaves willingly to run their business'? When they were done with the ""most important document in history"", the U.S. Constitution, they gave rights to only 7% of the population; White, Male and Puritan land owners. It took 75 years later for minorities to even get the right to vote and 120 years for women and now corporations of the wealthy run this country. The truth is the barbaric ways of old Europe just morphed into new overlords who broke away from the King and Church to form their own Kingdoms and used deception and fraud to sell it to the masses. My country 'tis of thee [VIDEO](URL **The Hidden History of the Promised Land** [**Source**](URL It may sound a little over the top but it's really no overstatement to say that much in our modern world is based on falsehood and fabrication. We are told, for example, that Columbus 'discovered' America in 1492, yet there is plenty of evidence to suggest that others had visited America before Columbus: &gt;including visitors from ancient Egypt, Phoenicia and medieval Europe. Despite this modern authorities continue to push the line that ""Columbus discovered America."" In point of fact *Columbus* *himself never even set eyes upon America*; the closest he got to the mainland of North America was Puerto Rico. However in the aftermath of Columbus's voyage John Cabot sailed from Bristol, England, which in turn opened the way for the first colony in Jamestown, Virginia and thus allowed the English to claim America as their own. Yet there is considerable evidence that suggests that others from different cultures preceded Cabot and Columbus. So one is forced to ask: &gt;Why, when there is much to suggest that others from different cultures preceded Columbus, don't we hear more about this possibility being investigated? Could it be that certain powers have a vested interest in keeping our real history under wraps? Whatever the answer the fact remains that a great deal has been unearthed which is completely at odds with conventional notions regarding the origins of what we know today as America. In fact according to some contemporary authorities, the Native Americans encountered by the early settlers from England were not what they appeared to be. They were indeed native to the Americas but they were not its original inhabitants, who according to various tribal legends, had disappeared eons before in a series of cataclysms. **Columbus** **Day? True Legacy - Cruelty and Slavery** Once again, it's time to celebrate Columbus Day. Yet, the stunning truth is: If [Christopher Columbus](URL were alive today, he would be put on trial for crimes against humanity. [Columbus' reign of terror](URL as documented by noted historians, was so bloody, his [legacy so unspeakably cruel](URL that Columbus makes a modern villain like Saddam Hussein look like a pale codfish. Question: Why do we honor a man who, if he were alive today, would almost certainly be sitting on Death Row awaiting execution? If you'd like to know [the true story](URL about Christopher Columbus, please read on. But I warn you, it's not for the faint of heart. Here's the basics. On the second Monday in October each year, we celebrate Columbus Day (this year, it's on October 11th). We teach our school kids a cute little song that goes: ""In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue."" It's an American tradition, as American as pizza pie. Or is it? Surprisingly, the true story of Christopher Columbus has very little in common with the myth we all learned in school. [Columbus Day](URL as we know it in the United States, was invented by the [Knights of Columbus](URL a Catholic fraternal service organization. Back in the 1930s, they were looking for a Catholic hero as a role-model their kids could look up to. In 1934, as a result of lobbying by the Knights of Columbus, Congress and President Franklin Roosevelt signed Columbus Day into law as a federal holiday to honor this courageous explorer. Or so we thought... There are several problems with this. First of all, Columbus wasn't the first European to discover America. As we all know, the Viking, [Leif Ericson](URL probably founded a Norse village on Newfoundland some 500 years earlier. So, hat's off to Leif. But if you think about it, the whole concept of discovering America is, well, arrogant. After all, the Native Americans discovered North America about 14,000 years before Columbus was even born! Surprisingly, DNA evidence now suggests that courageous [Polynesian adventurers](URL sailed dugout canoes across the Pacific and settled in South America long before the Vikings. Second, [Columbus wasn't a hero](URL When he set foot on that sandy beach in the Bahamas on October 12, 1492, Columbus discovered that the islands were inhabited by friendly, peaceful people called the Lucayans, Tanos and Arawaks. Writing in his diary, Columbus said they were a handsome, smart and kind people. He noted that the gentle Arawaks were [remarkable for their hospitality](URL &gt;""They offered to share with anyone and when you ask for something, they never say no,"" he said. The [Arawaks had no weapons](URL their society had neither criminals, prisons nor prisoners. They were so kind-hearted that Columbus noted in his diary that on the day the Santa Maria was shipwrecked, the Arawaks labored for hours to save his crew and cargo. The native people were so honest that not one thing was missing. Columbus was so impressed with the hard work of these gentle islanders, that he immediately seized their land for Spain and enslaved them to work in his brutal gold mines. Within only two years, 125,000 (half of the population) of the original natives on the island were dead. Shockingly, Columbus supervised the selling of native girls into [sexual slavery](URL Young girls of the ages 9 to 10 were the most desired by his men. In 1500, Columbus casually wrote about it in his log. He said: &gt;""A hundred castellanoes are as easily obtained for a woman as for a farm, and it is very general and there are plenty of dealers who go about [looking for girls](URL those [from nine to ten are now in demand](URL He forced these peaceful natives work in his gold mines until they died of exhaustion. If an ""Indian"" worker did not deliver his full quota of gold dust by Columbus' deadline, soldiers would [cut off the man's hands](URL and tie them around his neck to send a message. Slavery was so intolerable for these sweet, gentle island people that at one point, 100 of them committed [mass suicide](URL Catholic law forbade the enslavement of Christians, but Columbus solved this problem. He simply refused to baptize the native people of Hispaniola. On his second trip to the New World, Columbus brought [cannons and attack dogs](URL If a native resisted slavery, he would cut off a nose or an ear. If slaves tried to escape, Columbus had them burned alive. Other times, he sent attack dogs to hunt them down, and the [dogs would tear off the arms and legs](URL of the screaming natives while they were still alive. If the Spaniards ran short of meat to feed the dogs, Arawak babies were [killed for dog food](URL Columbus' acts of cruelty were so unspeakable and so legendary - even in his own day - that Governor [**Francisco De Bobadilla** arrested Columbus ](URL his two brothers, slapped them into chains, and shipped them off to Spain to answer for their crimes against the Arawaks. But the King and Queen of Spain, their treasury filling up with gold, pardoned Columbus and let him go free. **Christopher** **Columbus' Crimes Against Humanity** [**Source**](URL To be sure, the real annihilations did not start until the beginning of Columbus' second voyage to the Americas in 1493 (1). For while he had expressed admiration for the overall generosity of Indigenous People and considered the Tainos to be ""Very handsome, gentle, and friendly,"" he interpreted all these positive traits as signs of weakness and vulnerability, saying, &gt;""if devout religious persons knew the Indian Language well, all these people would soon become Christians."" As a consequence, he kidnapped some of the Tainos and took them back to Spain. &gt;On his second voyage, in December 1494, Columbus captured 1,500 Tainos on the island of Hispaniola and herded them to Isabela, where 550 of ""the best males and females"" were forced aboard ships bound for the slave markets of Seville. Under Columbus's leadership, the Spanish attacked the Taino, sparing neither men, women nor children. Warfare, forced labor, starvation and disease reduced Hispaniola's Taino population (estimated at one million to two million in 1492) to extinction within 30 years. [Furthermore, Columbus wrote a letter to the Spanish governor of the island, Hispaniola](URL Columbus asked the governor the cut off the ears and the noses of any of the slaves who resisted being subjugated to slavery. &gt;It is estimated that 100 million Indians from the Caribbean, Central, South, and North America perished at the hands of the European invaders. Sadly, unbelievably, really, much of that wholesale destruction was sanctioned and carried out by the Roman Catholic Church and various Protestant denominations. (1: p.37) One of Columbus' men, [**Bartolome De Las Casas**](URL was so mortified by Columbus' brutal atrocities against the native peoples, that he quit working for Columbus and became a Catholic priest. He described how the Spaniards under Columbus' command cut off the legs of children who ran from them, to test the sharpness of their blades. According to De Las Casas, [the men made bets](URL as to who, with one sweep of his sword, could cut a person in half. He says that Columbus' men poured people full of boiling soap. In a single day, De Las Casas was an eye witness as the Spanish soldiers dismembered, beheaded, or raped 3000 native people. &gt;""Such inhumanities and barbarisms were committed in my sight as no age can parallel,"" De Las Casas wrote. ""My eyes have seen these acts so foreign to human nature that now [I tremble as I write](URL De Las Casas spent the rest of his life trying to protect the helpless native people. But after a while, there were no more natives to protect. Experts generally agree that before 1492, the population on the island of Hispaniola probably numbered above [3 million](URL Within 20 years of Spanish arrival, it was reduced to only 60,000.

In 1792, New York City and other U.S. cities celebrated the 300th anniversary of his landing in the New World. President [**Benjamin Harrison**](URL called upon the people of the United States to celebrate Columbus Day on the 400th anniversary of the event. During the four hundredth anniversary in 1892, teachers, preachers, poets and politicians used Columbus Day rituals to teach ideals of patriotism. These *patriotic* rituals were framed around themes such as support for war, citizenship boundaries, the importance of loyalty to the nation, and celebrating social progress. [Catholic immigration in the mid-19th century](URL induced discrimination from anti-immigrant activists. Like many other immigrant communities, Catholics developed organizations to fight discrimination and provide insurance for the struggling immigrants. One such organization, the [Knights of Columbus](URL chose that name in part because it saw Christopher Columbus as a fitting symbol of Catholic immigrants' right to citizenship: one of their own, a fellow Catholic, had discovered America. Many [Italian-Americans](URL observe Columbus Day as a celebration of their heritage, the first occasion being in New York City on October 12, 1866. Columbus Day was first popularized as a holiday in the United States through the lobbying of Angelo Noce, a first generation Italian, in Denver. The first official, regular Columbus Day holiday was proclaimed by Colorado governor Jesse F. McDonald in 1905 and made a statutory holiday in 1907. In April 1934, as a result of lobbying by the Knights of Columbus, Congress and President [Franklin Delano Roosevelt](URL made October 12 a [federal holiday](URL under the name Columbus Day. &gt;A Significant movement is spreading to rename this day 'Indigenous People's Day'. It could/would begin the healing to right the wrongs done to so many by the Conquistador's of white European Man, of which most are of our ancestral heritages.**Petition** [**here**](URL Indigenous Natives lived with the land, air and waterways for thousands and thousands of years and never thought to own or despoil their Mother's and Father's who gave Life to all. Today, we are losing 200 species a day, globally, many waterways in the U.S., like the Navarro River where I live, no longer have salmon and trout come up the river or like the halibut, snapper, rock fish, salmon, etc. that are fished out along the West Coast. What a huge step it would be for this country if we could begin to ask forgiveness, make reparations and put these proud Natives in places of leadership to teach us how to be good stewards and hold deep reverence and respect for Nature so that she may heal and provide for the next seven generations to come. RECONSIDER COLUMBUS DAY AD Columbus Day, a day that our government has deemed worthy of remembrance. But with all due respect - with all due respect - with all due respect, there's an ugly truth that has been overlooked for way too long. Columbus committed heinous crimes against the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean and millions of natives throughout the Americas. And Columbus set the stage for the slave trade in the New World. So, please, please reconsider if this is a man you want to honor. Reconsider if you want to celebrate the crimes of Columbus. It's not your fault; it happened a long time ago. But remaining neutral and pretending like it didn't happen, or that it doesn't still impact us today? So, please, take the day to learn the whole story: [VIDEO](URL &amp;#x200B; **Righting the Great Wrong - Happy 'Native Indigenous People's Day'** [**Source**](URL For christsakes, the guy C.C. thought he was in INDIA or so the story goes! He then found the indigenous people so giving, he went back to get 14 more galleon ships to steal, pillage, rape and conquer the peaceful people throughout the Caribbean, South and North America's. For an excellent overview of the plight of the 'loser's' to American hegemony over the centuries read Howard Zinn's [A People's History of The United States](URL as told by those that suffered at the hands of the invaders.) As the nation commemorates the arrival of Christopher Columbus to the so-called ""New World"" in 1492, indigenous activists at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colorado, are pushing for schools to teach the ""real history of the Americas"" and to celebrate indigenous culture. ""Columbus Day"" has long evoked sadness and anger amongst people of color, especially Native Americans, who object to honoring a man who opened the door to European colonization, the exploitation of native peoples, and the slave trade. We're joined by three guests involved with the ""Real History of the Americas"" day: &gt;Esther Belin, a writing instructor at Fort Lewis College and a member of the Navajo Nation Shirena Trujillo Long, coordinator of El Centro de Muchos Colores at Fort Lewis College and chair of the the Real History of the Americas Committee student activist Noel Altaha, a member of the White Mountain Apache Tribe and Fort Lewis College senior &amp;#x200B; || ""We may fairly agree that the subject of history, as commonly taught, is one of the most boring of all subjects.

A few miles from Edinburgh in Scotland today still stands Rosslyn Chapel, that holy grail of the Brotherhood Elite. It was built in the shape of a Templar cross by the St Clair-Sinclair family and is a mass of esoteric symbolism. The foundations were laid in 1446 and it was completed in the 1480s. How remarkable then that the stonework at Rosslyn includes depictions of sweetcorn and cacti which were only found in America and Christopher Columbus did not 'discover' that continent until 1492! How could this be? There is, in fact, no mystery. Christopher Columbus was not even nearly the first white person to land in the Americas. The Phoenicians, Norse, Irish, Welsh, Bretons, Basques and Portuguese, all sailed to America before him and so did Prince Henry Sinclair of Rosslyn, as documented in a rare book by Frederick I. Pohl called Prince Henry Sinclair's Voyage To The New World 1398. Sinclair made the journey with another Brotherhood bloodline, the Zeno family, one of the most prominent [Black Nobility families](URL in Venice.

The people had died in their millions of being hacked apart with axes and swords, buried alive and trampled under horses, hunted as game and fed to dogs, shot, beaten, stabbed, scalped for bounty, hanged on meat-hooks and thrown over the sides of ships at sea, worked to death as slave laborers, intentionally starved and frozen to death during a multitude of forced marches and internments, and, in an unknown number of instances, deliberately infected with epidemic diseases. (p. 1) Later in the book he gives a staggering estimate of the total who were 'ethnically cleansed': &gt;'All told, it is probable that more than one hundred million native people were 'eliminated' in the course of Europe's ongoing 'civilization' of the western hemisphere.' (p. 86) Although Ward Churchill has not written fully on the genocide against the Palestinians, he does place it within the global context of the present book, A Little Matter of Genocide, a book which leapt out at me from a display of books by and about native Americans in City Lights Book Store. The author is an enrolled Keetoowah Cherokee and Professor of American Indian Studies in the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder and has been a leader of the Colorado Chapter of the American Indian Movement since 1972.

And, you know, the beatings began immediately, the - almost the de-Indianizing program. It was a terrible experience that the American government was experimenting with.

I stayed there three years - six years - **AMY GOODMAN:** And how - **DENNIS BANKS:** Go ahead. **AMY GOODMAN:** How did you communicate with your family? And how often did you get to see them? Did you get to talk to them? **DENNIS BANKS:** Never. Never. You know, they cut off all communication with your parents, and a lot of letters, which I found later in - I stayed there for six years without communicating to - with my parents at all. And finally, they let us go home for six years. Of course, we couldn't speak the language. We could speak only English and - what these young people were talking about. But there was severe punishment for running away from that kind of system. I ran away. I kept running away. Almost once a week, I'd run away from those schools. They'd catch me. They'd bring me back to the school, beat me. And it was - it was terrible. I mean, there was other kinds of punishment that we went through, as well. And it was - now that, it was a - that kind of experience, I still remember what it is like today. And I have a friend who has been - who had been my friend for over 70 years now, and we remember those days. There were - we stuck together. A lot of people stuck together. Just being together, that's what saved a lot of us from terrible consequences of speaking. But eventually, they - you know, they kept beating me down, and I kept - so I started learning English, and I started learning who the presidents were. I started learning all that stuff. And then they let me go home for 30 days. Six years. And I asked my mother, I said, ""Why didn't you write to me?"" And she - you know, and she says, ""I did."" But I never - I never questioned beyond that. And then there was - they sent me to another boarding school in North Dakota, another 200 miles away. I was there for three years. And then, after that, same thing: no - only English, you know, corporal punishment. And then I went home for another 30 days, asked my mother, ""Why is it you didn't write to me again?"" She says, ""I did, and I did."" Then they sent me to another boarding school in South Dakota further away, so another 400 miles. I kept running away from these schools. And I finally ran away from the last one, and I finally made it home. And it wasn't 'til almost just three years ago when my daughter was - they were doing a documentary on Dennis Banks, and they found - they went to - in the federal depository records in Kansas City. And she called me, and she says, ""Dad, we found"" - ""Dad,"" she said, ""we found your - we found your school records."" And I said, ""Bring them back."" So she brought them back, and I started looking at them. And she says, ""Dad, we also found something else."" She handed me a shoebox. And I opened up the shoebox, and those were letters, letters from my mother. And I started opening them up, and I started reading them. And in the second one, there was a letter to the superintendent of the school that said, &gt;""Here is $5. Please send my children - my son back home to me."" &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; || ""Make no mistake, we will close Guantanamo prison, which has damaged our national security interests and become a tremendous recruiting tool for al-Qaeda"" President [Barack Obama](URL |:-|:-|:-| |||| &amp;#x200B; Not much has changed since 1492...!"

US, unable to compete fairly due to its structural disadvantages and many other shortcomings, decided to go the biological attack route, which allows it to hide under the cover of ""plausible denialability"" (since it is more difficult to conclusively prove the attribution or source of a new mysterious virus than it would be to track the trajectory of an incoming thermnonuclear missile etc) to inflict maximum damage to China while minimizing the potential blow back. &amp;#x200B; Right after the signing of the so-called ""Trade Deal"" in which the US didn't get what it wanted (the US did not get the sort of Plaza Accord concessions that it was hoping XI/CCP would kowtow to etc) and immediately into the start of the new decade (marking the turn of the second decade in what the PNAC would called the ""new american century"") the US resorted to biological attacks in order to contain, isolate and attempt to cripple China/CCP internally and on the world stage at large. After its NED/CIA sponsored Hong Kong destablization/radicialization didn't spill over into the rest of mainland China, and right after its intense year long anti-China anti-Huawei campaigns have peaked in effectiveness, the US releases the evil demon virus into the heart of mainland China, at the absolutely worst possible location (Wuhan being one of the Chinese main Central hubs in terms of transportation and an important city for China's Belt and Road initiatives and estimated to have as high as 8% growth in GDP in 2020) and in also the absolute worse possible timing (right before the Chinese Lunar New year, otherwise known as the greatest annual human migration event, during a time in which shopping, spending and consumerisms activity would have been at a peak etc) in order to cripple China economically, to cut China off from the rest of the world and even force China to isolate its own cities from within, and to have the effect of smearing China's reputation on the world stage and invoking the escalation of fear, racisms and bigotry towards the Chinese people abroad. &amp;#x200B; All this comes right on top of the heels of the event last fall, African swine fever (ASF), which had never before seen in China but now mysteriously appeared with the onset of the US trade war, decimated half of China's pigs, which doubled pork prices and contributed to inflation causing pricy US pork exports to double in China. The odds for two such consequent anomalies, timing and location are exceedingly low. Yet both did occur  in almost perfect sequence. Particularly devasting is the very real possibility that this virus was intentionally engineered to have as long an incubation period as possible, and with the ability to hide within plain site, by being asymptomatic during its initial stages hence making it orders of magnitude more difficult to eradicate. Just recently, as recent as Feb 1st 2020, there has been yet a third mysterious outbreak in China, this time of the bird flu kind that is far more deadly to humans and wiping out Chinese chicken and poultry at the most dire of times. Indeed the coronavirus victims so far, both inside and outside of China, are only people with Chinese type of blood, Haplogroup O-M175, designed to attack that type of blood and specifically Chinese people. &amp;#x200B; Dr. Steven Hatfill Biological Weapons Expert says the Wuhan virus it will have to play it out and ""run its course"" not only in Wuhan but the greater mainland China. The host Steve Bannon (Trump chief campaign advisor) predicted this will crush China economically, and that its the end of the Xi/BRI/OBOR and will give US the chance to re-route trade of all countries to go-around and bypass China bringing the global supply chain back to US and its allies whilst isolating China economically, politically, etc. They are selling this to the American people and pitching it to the world as this Chinese Belt and Road connectivity is what is allowing this virus to spread so fastly to the rest of the world and that it would behoove mankind and all nations to reconsider the security and stability of their own supply chains and basically urging everyone to pull their companies, people, trade, businesses etc out of China. This is not unlike what Wilber Ross US Commerce Secretary already stated a few days ago... that this virus is good for America and will help bring lots of jobs back to the USA... seems like the goal is to use this event to pull the rug underneath China's development feets. &amp;#x200B; I suppose it could be a coincidence that China, the geopolitical adversary and economic enemy to the United States (according to the US itself), suddenly gets this mysterious virus seemingly more potent than SARS (which itself apparently only targeted Chinese ethnic DNA and left the white/Caucasin population untouched) at the worst possible timing and in the worst possible location. Wuhan being Chinese's central hub and this being the Chinese Lunar New Year, it has the highest ability to spread and go ""super viral"" whilst impacting the max amount of damage to the stability of the China, both in terms of having the max potential to cause political turmoil in the homeland (ruining people's new year, quarantinee and lockdowns of cities of unprecendeted porportion, causing many Chinese citizens to get angry etc) and doing the maximum amount of possible damaage to the Chinese economy, ruining the New Year in which consumerisms was supposed to be at its very highest points. &amp;#x200B; Even the SARS of 2003 had an negative impact on Chinese GDP by as much as 2%, and has already turned out to be far worse and at a much more accelerated speed of spread and deaths. Unsuprisingly without need for a single bullet fired or sanction imposed, it already managed to force China to self-impose the closure of its borders and cities, most nations have already stopped flights to China including the United States itself, on the world stage it is another ""ding"" for China's image and gives the propaganda mouthpieces of the West something else to gripe about, whilsts at the same time an attempt to cap Chinese One Belt One Road ambitions and sabotage China's growing economy and hegemonic rise. It comes right on the crisp of Trump signing the fake ""Trade Deal"" and the UK decided to go against the US and work with Huawei.... I say something else is going on behind the scenes, more than what we are being told. We could have transition from Trade War, to Tech War to now maybe bio-war, if that is the case, then very likely the US already fired the first, second, and third shots, so to speak. &amp;#x200B; China should at least stay vigilant and have a credible deterrence contingency plan in place... In the nuclear world in which China has DF-41, the ""MAD"" doctrine is still well in place. But a mystery virus affords far more ""plausible deniability"" for the US. Thus achieving the goal with less fear of attribution and thus retribution. Instead of directly confronting China in the SCS militaristically immediately, maybe they think a better way to take China down a notch or two would be the use of ""other means"" to an ends.. Science and technology in the world has come a long way since the days of Westerners giving Native Americans blankets laced with smallpox to ""thanksgiving"" them. It is the human condition to be risk/loss adverse. A nation that would stop at nothing to achieve Maniesft Destiny on the way up surely wouldn't have any qualms of preserving its hegemony at all costs on the way down. After all, the American way of life is nonnegotiable and Graham T. Allison predicted the likelyhood that this confrontation of a rising power with a declining power will inevitably lead to war, and history has shown that to be indeed the case. The US is applying its doctrine of maximum pressure to destroy China on all fronts, with Trade War, Tech and supply chain War, cyberwar, information and pysops war, and now biological warfare and most likely to be followed up with conventional or even nuclear war once US believes China is sufficently weakened. &amp;#x200B; Steve Bannon was hoping to ""break the back of the CCP"" by cutting off China's supply chain, and was hoping the HK roits was going to catch fire in the rest of the mainland and force the CCP to lose control making it easier to do an opportunistic regime change. &amp;#x200B; I'm sure both China and US have their own red lines. If the US had any involvement in this new virus, if China finds any credible evidence, then there are a number of things China can do besides retailiting with its own bioweapon... for example, we all know the Trade War is not about trade, but wanting China to slow down in terms of hegemonic rise... for example China could simply start building Huangyan Island in the SCS, making a move that would seal the US fate as the ""falling empire"". If China militarizes the island it would give China total control of the SCS region, so China can declare ADIZ over SCS, America would be pushed back to Guam, and it woulld be the beginning of the end of the petrodollar hegemony (which never could have lasted forever anyway but it would push it up along the timeline to make it collapse that much faster) &amp;#x200B; Some have said that well the virus is RNA single stranded which makes it harder to target any race specific without mutations losing the specificity over many infections cycles. And that if it were double stranded it would make it that much easier to create vaccines for and kill/contain. But I believe in this case it is about maintaining ""plausible deniability"" whilst not crossing any hard red lines in case attribution is established in the future. A virus outbreak that dings China's GDP by 2 to 5 % in 2020 is not comparable to an end of civilization event that wipes out 90% of the Chinese population, for example. Whatever blowback or collateral risk is considered acceptable levels since it was deployed to China's central Wuhan, naturally China has a self interest in containment, and the vast majority of the damage will be internal to China. It may have been engineerred as race specific single stranded RNA and knowingly by hostile forces that predicted by the time it lost its race specificity that China would have already contained it. Hence ""mission accomplished"" with little attribution and minimal blowback. What better way to undermine China/CCP than to have its population grow resentful of or turn against its very Government!? Already Western media is talking about how Chinese are filthy and if it wasn't for eating rats, bats, dogs, etc this wouldn't ever have befallen. Perfect cover for re-enforceing racists stereotypes for the ulterior motives of containing and isolating China, and that of Chinese culture, and Chinese ideology on the world stage. &amp;#x200B; All of this should be seen within the larger context and backdrop of the so called Thucydides's Trap. For various reason, biological warfare against mainland China gives America multiprong strategic and asymmetric advantages, hence why it has now become the method and weapon of choice for the US to use against China. At what point does China take action or else find itself too little and too late to be suffering same fate as Native Americans? History has shown that America is willing to wipe out entire Han civilization to maintain american hegemony and regain full spectrum dominance and supremacy. &amp;#x200B; Kissinger is credited for giving Nixon the idea to open up China. It appears as the 45 year rapprochement comes to a sudden close, the US has regretted the long term decision. When viewed threw the lens of optimization of entropy maximization and the 2nd law of thermodynamics it is all about the counterbalance needed to an unchallenged US uni-polar scheme that impedes the progress and destiny of a universe in evolution. &amp;#x200B; Steve Bannon was quoted to say that it is Ten times more important for the US to kill Huawei than it is for Trump to sign any trade deal. USA realizes that China will soon surpass them if status quo isn't changed. The true motive of the trade war is to decouple the US from China quickly enough to asymmetrically target and destroy any tip of the spear Chinese companies/projects/tech such as the Huawei, 5G, DJI, EV, trains, Cancer research, TikTok, SenseTime, etc etc to cripple China's plans to move up the value chain and hi-tech-ify its economy and to do so with enough force to set back China and permanently prevent it from successfully climbing the arch trajectory of replacing the US. For the US its not just about losing the top spot to China, if America were to ever lose its petrodollar hegemony it would collapse in much the same way as happened to the USSR. The whole US empire is built on house of cards, ever since Brentwood they got away with taxing/usurping the world using the dollar as economic weaponization through 'quantitative easing' and its military to control OPEC to sustain the petrodollar hegemony. In the 1980's Japan became a threat to the US so they forced Tokyo to acquiesce to the Plaza Accord resulting in the ""lost four decades"" and Japan never recovering. Nowadays Trump, Steve Bannon, Pompeo and other Hawks are trying to impose the same sort of colonization on China, but much harder to do since China doesn't entertain US troops/US bases unlike the Japanese vassal so the next best thing is to subvert Hong Kong by way of CIA/NED and other propaganda techniques. And which nation killed a million civilians in Iraq after a false flag event and a WMD pretext but now is banning Chinese AI startups ostensibly because they care about the human rights of Muslims in China's internal Xinjiang region? &amp;#x200B; This is all part of the bigger picture to contain China's continued rise, as we see that if the US ever lost its hegemony it would be game over... America views Chinese ambitions such as Made In China 2025, One Belt One Road, 5G, AI, etc as existential threats to its very lifestyle and way of life, hence the whole ""Huawei is a national security issue"" stance... Now even TikTok, a dancing video app, has become a ""national security"" threat and targeted and singled out by the US Congress. By ""national security"" they really mean China is offering the world a better deal and they are pissed that they are being undercut and view Chinese success as a direct threat to American hegemony. The West had its chance to help out Africa but did nothing, now China wants to help them develop and US is getting resentful, the supreme irony is accusing China of predatory lending. This will only get much worse, Xi predicted this will last a period of 30 years until which time China has become the undisputed Number One in the world economically, technologically, politically and militaristically. As the declining power the US isnt going to just go down without fighting..... Just like the Roma Empire, as the US declines on the way down the lip service of freedom, democracy, etc stops and the true colors of the ugly side all comes out, they just did another coup in Bolivia after China signed a lithium deal to secure development of batteries for EVs, and now US is even sanctioning its own ""allies"" like Germany for daring to buy energy from Russia (NordStream 2, etc)... &amp;#x200B; Like others have already brought to light and mentioned, with the multiple initial sources surrounding this Wuhan virus, it makes ""intentionally starting a pandemic with a bioweapon"" scenario much more likely. The virus failed to spread with the first group of targets, so they tried again with the market. &amp;#x200B; For those who refuse to believe the US could ever be morally capable of doing such a coordinated strike and biological attack on mainland China, even if you do not at all believe US had anything to do with it, and even if US in reality had nothing to do with it, it still doesn't change the fact that this virus has changed the power dynamic and upset the balance; and we already have evidence from US such as Wilber Ross etc willing to take full advantage of the situation. China must be prepared to adapt and adjust to this fluid situation as well, short term and as well as long term. This thing could very well politically isolate China (it is already having such an effect) and crater China's GDP, and most importantly strategically pressure China to give up its long term development aspirations and also to sign away certain concessions (give up on MIC2025 etc) right at the most critical moment in history. &amp;#x200B; Sure we understand that the flu killed already 10000 US person this year alone, I also know the numbers in terms of how many up to 80,000 die of flu alone last year. And yes some of the hysteria and panic of this Wuhan thing may cause more damage than good at this point, sometimes the fear is more than just the virus damage itself. &amp;#x200B; Having said that, on the other hand, the facts are this banning of all flights from China to the US, the enactment of the quarantine is described by the US CDC itself as the heaviest action it has taken in 50 years. Indeed when was the last time Russia closed its borders to China? When was the last time Disney shutdown, and all these hundreds of other things shutting down in China and all the countries closing their door to China? Precisely my point regardless of whether or not the real or percieved threat of this virus is overblown or not, the fact is the reaction to it has already greatly harmed China substantitively at what could be argued as the worst possible timing... so yes, this virus has changed the power dynamic and upset the balance. &amp;#x200B; The fact of the matter is the rest of the world isn't closing its flights and borders to the USA, despite the flu in the US killing way more people, but the world is closing its doors to China... This cannot be good no matter how it is spun. I'm concerned this will be the point of inflection in which the tide permanently turns and China regresses back to being closed, isolated country and America pulled the supply chain rung under China's feet while China is down/ill and then convinences the rest of the world to a new Brentwoods to basically maintain US hegemony for the next 100 years. Perhaps this is what Trump was secretly hinting at when he gleefully announced at Davos that ""now is the time for renewed and great optimism""... Maybe he was hinting at world events to come that will greatly benefit America at the direct expense of China, events that by the time he made the speech at Davos would have already been put in place by the CIA. &amp;#x200B; If America has declared war on China, --(first by economic decoupling via sanctions and tariffs then by trying to kill off Chinese technology ascension by attempting to cut off China's tech supply chain, and finally by covert biowarfare to destroy China's food supply and then poision the Chinese people with a sinister virus in hopes of destablizing the entire country,)-- etc and by all appearances it has, with Pompeo openly stating that the Chinese CCP was the ""central threat of our times"", and Bannon calling for Trump to ""takedown Xi"" and ""break the spirit and crack the back of the Chinese people"", then it behooves China to defend itself and its citizens and interests appropriately. &amp;#x200B; This information better be spread across Chinese media so that the average Chinese develops a healthy and warranted suspicion of certain nations that have taken it upon themselves to stop at nothing to destroy the Chinese way of life and to destroy China's development and progress. Making more mainland Chinese aware of the underlining truth that all of China is constantly being targeted with warfare of all categories and at all levels by everything American cannot possibly be a bad thing. America has been applying every kind of means of warfare that exists under the sun against China, against the Chinese government and against the Chinese people and their well-being; be it Trade War, Economic War, Proxy War (Taiwan, HK, etc), Tech War (Huawei/5G/AI/tiktok), Supply Chain War, CyberWar, Information propaganda Warfare (including the ""reverse conspiracy theory"" and other false flags), Biological Warfare and soon to be Conventional war and perhaps even someday Nuclear war. &amp;#x200B; The Chinese people for their own good should be more aware of the ideological war that America has inflicted upon the Chinese citizens both at home and abroad... The stark constrasting juxposition could not be more supremely ironic and hypocritical. Brain drain from the rest of the nations in the world to the US is called ""free market"" and labeled as ""freedom loving scientists going to work in open democractic Universities with higher pay and better quality of life"" and yet this same notion of ""brain drain"" from the US to the rest of the world is called ""intellectual property theft"", ""spying"", or ""sending spies to steal 'American technology'"". For when as China or Russia or India jailed their scientists for working with US universities and earning US research grants. If they did that, immediately the US media will instantly accuse them of being ""totalitarian communist police state with no academic freedom"" etc. &amp;#x200B; During China's moment of greatest need and vulnerability we see Westerners racism and xenophobia come out in full blossom from Universities that say it is normal to be xenophobia to so-called ""free speech"" newspapers that take delight in China's plight and openly incite hatred and racisms by publishing intentionally vile depictions of the Chinese people and the Chinese flag in order to kick China while it is down. &amp;#x200B; America knows that ""time is on China's side"" be it with regards to GDP PPP, or the situation in the South China Sea, or that of Hong Kong, and later Taiwan, as China's sphere of influence continues to grow in Eurasia; or even in the larger context of the digital blockchain Yuan and China's BRI/OBOR to replace or supplant the US petrodollar hegemony and so many other aspects... America knows that if status quo doesn't abruptly change that one day it will be too late to confront China. Trump, as their self-proclaimed ""Chosen One"" has openly stated from the beginning that he won't allow China to surpass America ""on his watch"" and that if his administration doesn't stop China right now that no future generation of administrations will ever be able to do so again. The US recognizes that the situation is quickly reaching an inflection point past which there is no point of return or going back. It is now or never. And since a direct nuclear confrontation is not going to help America achieve its goals or retaining its status, nor reversing its decline, and coming back on top in terms of once again being sole unipolar hyperpower with no contender or meaningful challenger, then only option left after a failed trade war and failed tech war was to attack China in the back by secretly using biological warfare against China, not once, not twice, but now for a third and potentially ever more devastating time as each attack is increased in boldness and exponential in unprovoked escalation. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; [URL [URL [URL &amp;#x200B; [URL"

In the nuclear world in which China has DF-41, the ""MAD"" doctrine is still well in place. But a mystery virus affords far more ""plausible deniability"" for the US. Thus achieving the goal with less fear of attribution and thus retribution. Instead of directly confronting China in the SCS militaristically immediately, maybe they think a better way to take China down a notch or two would be the use of ""other means"" to an ends.. Science and technology in the world has come a long way since the days of Westerners giving Native Americans blankets laced with smallpox to ""thanksgiving"" them. It is the human condition to be risk/loss adverse. A nation that would stop at nothing to achieve Maniesft Destiny on the way up surely wouldn't have any qualms of preserving its hegemony at all costs on the way down. After all, the American way of life is nonnegotiable and Graham T. Allison predicted the likelyhood that this confrontation of a rising power with a declining power will inevitably lead to war, and history has shown that to be indeed the case. The US is applying its doctrine of maximum pressure to destroy China on all fronts, with Trade War, Tech and supply chain War, cyberwar, information and pysops war, and now biological warfare and most likely to be followed up with conventional or even nuclear war once US believes China is sufficently weakened. &amp;nbsp; Steve Bannon was hoping to ""break the back of the CCP"" by cutting off China's supply chain, and was hoping the HK roits was going to catch fire in the rest of the mainland and force the CCP to lose control making it easier to do an opportunistic regime change. &amp;nbsp; I'm sure both China and US have their own red lines. If the US had any involvement in this new virus, if China finds any credible evidence, then there are a number of things China can do besides retailiting with its own bioweapon... for example, we all know the Trade War is not about trade, but wanting China to slow down in terms of hegemonic rise... for example China could simply start building Huangyan Island in the SCS, making a move that would seal the US fate as the ""falling empire"". If China militarizes the island it would give China total control of the SCS region, so China can declare ADIZ over SCS, America would be pushed back to Guam, and it woulld be the beginning of the end of the petrodollar hegemony (which never could have lasted forever anyway but it would push it up along the timeline to make it collapse that much faster) &amp;nbsp; Some have said that well the virus is RNA single stranded which makes it harder to target any race specific without mutations losing the specificity over many infections cycles. And that if it were double stranded it would make it that much easier to create vaccines for and kill/contain. But I believe in this case it is about maintaining ""plausible deniability"" whilst not crossing any hard red lines in case attribution is established in the future. A virus outbreak that dings China's GDP by 2 to 5 % in 2020 is not comparable to an end of civilization event that wipes out 90% of the Chinese population, for example. Whatever blowback or collateral risk is considered acceptable levels since it was deployed to China's central Wuhan, naturally China has a self interest in containment, and the vast majority of the damage will be internal to China. It may have been engineerred as race specific single stranded RNA and knowingly by hostile forces that predicted by the time it lost its race specificity that China would have already contained it. Hence ""mission accomplished"" with little attribution and minimal blowback. What better way to undermine China/CCP than to have its population grow resentful of or turn against its very Government!? Already Western media is talking about how Chinese are filthy and if it wasn't for eating rats, bats, dogs, etc this wouldn't ever have befallen. Perfect cover for re-enforceing racists stereotypes for the ulterior motives of containing and isolating China, and that of Chinese culture, and Chinese ideology on the world stage. &amp;nbsp; All of this should be seen within the larger context and backdrop of the so called Thucydides's Trap. For various reason, biological warfare against mainland China gives America multiprong strategic and asymmetric advantages, hence why it has now become the method and weapon of choice for the US to use against China. At what point does China take action or else find itself too little and too late to be suffering same fate as Native Americans? History has shown that America is willing to wipe out entire Han civilization to maintain american hegemony and regain full spectrum dominance and supremacy. &amp;nbsp; Kissinger is credited for giving Nixon the idea to open up China. It appears as the 45 year rapprochement comes to a sudden close, the US has regretted the long term decision. When viewed threw the lens of optimization of entropy maximization and the 2nd law of thermodynamics it is all about the counterbalance needed to an unchallenged US uni-polar scheme that impedes the progress and destiny of a universe in evolution. &amp;nbsp; Steve Bannon was quoted to say that it is Ten times more important for the US to kill Huawei than it is for Trump to sign any trade deal. USA realizes that China will soon surpass them if status quo isn't changed. The true motive of the trade war is to decouple the US from China quickly enough to asymmetrically target and destroy any tip of the spear Chinese companies/projects/tech such as the Huawei, 5G, DJI, EV, trains, Cancer research, TikTok, SenseTime, etc etc to cripple China's plans to move up the value chain and hi-tech-ify its economy and to do so with enough force to set back China and permanently prevent it from successfully climbing the arch trajectory of replacing the US. For the US its not just about losing the top spot to China, if America were to ever lose its petrodollar hegemony it would collapse in much the same way as happened to the USSR. The whole US empire is built on house of cards, ever since Brentwood they got away with taxing/usurping the world using the dollar as economic weaponization through 'quantitative easing' and its military to control OPEC to sustain the petrodollar hegemony. In the 1980's Japan became a threat to the US so they forced Tokyo to acquiesce to the Plaza Accord resulting in the ""lost four decades"" and Japan never recovering. Nowadays Trump, Steve Bannon, Pompeo and other Hawks are trying to impose the same sort of colonization on China, but much harder to do since China doesn't entertain US troops/US bases unlike the Japanese vassal so the next best thing is to subvert Hong Kong by way of CIA/NED and other propaganda techniques. And which nation killed a million civilians in Iraq after a false flag event and a WMD pretext but now is banning Chinese AI startups ostensibly because they care about the human rights of Muslims in China's internal Xinjiang region? &amp;nbsp; This is all part of the bigger picture to contain China's continued rise, as we see that if the US ever lost its hegemony it would be game over... America views Chinese ambitions such as Made In China 2025, One Belt One Road, 5G, AI, etc as existential threats to its very lifestyle and way of life, hence the whole ""Huawei is a national security issue"" stance... Now even TikTok, a dancing video app, has become a ""national security"" threat and targeted and singled out by the US Congress. By ""national security"" they really mean China is offering the world a better deal and they are pissed that they are being undercut and view Chinese success as a direct threat to American hegemony. The West had its chance to help out Africa but did nothing, now China wants to help them develop and US is getting resentful, the supreme irony is accusing China of predatory lending. This will only get much worse, Xi predicted this will last a period of 30 years until which time China has become the undisputed Number One in the world economically, technologically, politically and militaristically. As the declining power the US isnt going to just go down without fighting..... Just like the Roma Empire, as the US declines on the way down the lip service of freedom, democracy, etc stops and the true colors of the ugly side all comes out, they just did another coup in Bolivia after China signed a lithium deal to secure development of batteries for EVs, and now US is even sanctioning its own ""allies"" like Germany for daring to buy energy from Russia (NordStream 2, etc)... &amp;nbsp; Like others have already brought to light and mentioned, with the multiple initial sources surrounding this Wuhan virus, it makes ""intentionally starting a pandemic with a bioweapon"" scenario much more likely. The virus failed to spread with the first group of targets, so they tried again with the market. &amp;nbsp; For those who refuse to believe the US could ever be morally capable of doing such a coordinated strike and biological attack on mainland China, even if you do not at all believe US had anything to do with it, and even if US in reality had nothing to do with it, it still doesn't change the fact that this virus has changed the power dynamic and upset the balance; and we already have evidence from US such as Wilber Ross etc willing to take full advantage of the situation. China must be prepared to adapt and adjust to this fluid situation as well, short term and as well as long term. This thing could very well politically isolate China (it is already having such an effect) and crater China's GDP, and most importantly strategically pressure China to give up its long term development aspirations and also to sign away certain concessions (give up on MIC2025 etc) right at the most critical moment in history. &amp;nbsp; Sure we understand that the flu killed already 10000 US person this year alone, I also know the numbers in terms of how many up to 80,000 die of flu alone last year. And yes some of the hysteria and panic of this Wuhan thing may cause more damage than good at this point, sometimes the fear is more than just the virus damage itself. &amp;nbsp; Having said that, on the other hand, the facts are this banning of all flights from China to the US, the enactment of the quarantine is described by the US CDC itself as the heaviest action it has taken in 50 years. Indeed when was the last time Russia closed its borders to China? When was the last time Disney shutdown, and all these hundreds of other things shutting down in China and all the countries closing their door to China? Precisely my point regardless of whether or not the real or percieved threat of this virus is overblown or not, the fact is the reaction to it has already greatly harmed China substantitively at what could be argued as the worst possible timing... so yes, this virus has changed the power dynamic and upset the balance. &amp;nbsp; The fact of the matter is the rest of the world isn't closing its flights and borders to the USA, despite the flu in the US killing way more people, but the world is closing its doors to China... This cannot be good no matter how it is spun. I'm concerned this will be the point of inflection in which the tide permanently turns and China regresses back to being closed, isolated country and America pulled the supply chain rung under China's feet while China is down/ill and then convinences the rest of the world to a new Brentwoods to basically maintain US hegemony for the next 100 years. Perhaps this is what Trump was secretly hinting at when he gleefully announced at Davos that ""now is the time for renewed and great optimism""... Maybe he was hinting at world events to come that will greatly benefit America at the direct expense of China, events that by the time he made the speech at Davos would have already been put in place by the CIA. &amp;nbsp; If America has declared war on China, --(first by economic decoupling via sanctions and tariffs then by trying to kill off Chinese technology ascension by attempting to cut off China's tech supply chain, and finally by covert biowarfare to destroy China's food supply and then poision the Chinese people with a sinister virus in hopes of destablizing the entire country,)-- etc and by all appearances it has, with Pompeo openly stating that the Chinese CCP was the ""central threat of our times"", and Bannon calling for Trump to ""takedown Xi"" and ""break the spirit and crack the back of the Chinese people"", then it behooves China to defend itself and its citizens and interests appropriately. &amp;nbsp; This information better be spread across Chinese media so that the average Chinese develops a healthy and warranted suspicion of certain nations that have taken it upon themselves to stop at nothing to destroy the Chinese way of life and to destroy China's development and progress. Making more mainland Chinese aware of the underlining truth that all of China is constantly being targeted with warfare of all categories and at all levels by everything American cannot possibly be a bad thing. America has been applying every kind of means of warfare that exists under the sun against China, against the Chinese government and against the Chinese people and their well-being; be it Trade War, Economic War, Proxy War (Taiwan, HK, etc), Tech War (Huawei/5G/AI/tiktok), Supply Chain War, CyberWar, Information propaganda Warfare (including the ""reverse conspiracy theory"" and other false flags), Biological Warfare and soon to be Conventional war and perhaps even someday Nuclear war. &amp;nbsp; The Chinese people for their own good should be more aware of the ideological war that America has inflicted upon the Chinese citizens both at home and abroad... The stark constrasting juxposition could not be more supremely ironic and hypocritical. Brain drain from the rest of the nations in the world to the US is called ""free market"" and labeled as ""freedom loving scientists going to work in open democractic Universities with higher pay and better quality of life"" and yet this same notion of ""brain drain"" from the US to the rest of the world is called ""intellectual property theft"", ""spying"", or ""sending spies to steal 'American technology'"". For when as China or Russia or India jailed their scientists for working with US universities and earning US research grants. If they did that, immediately the US media will instantly accuse them of being ""totalitarian communist police state with no academic freedom"" etc. &amp;nbsp; During China's moment of greatest need and vulnerability we see Westerners racism and xenophobia come out in full blossom from Universities that say it is normal to be xenophobia to so-called ""free speech"" newspapers that take delight in China's plight and openly incite hatred and racisms by publishing intentionally vile depictions of the Chinese people and the Chinese flag in order to kick China while it is down. &amp;nbsp; America knows that ""time is on China's side"" be it with regards to GDP PPP, or the situation in the South China Sea, or that of Hong Kong, and later Taiwan, as China's sphere of influence continues to grow in Eurasia; or even in the larger context of the digital blockchain Yuan and China's BRI/OBOR to replace or supplant the US petrodollar hegemony and so many other aspects... America knows that if status quo doesn't abruptly change that one day it will be too late to confront China. Trump, as their self-proclaimed ""Chosen One"" has openly stated from the beginning that he won't allow China to surpass America ""on his watch"" and that if his administration doesn't stop China right now that no future generation of administrations will ever be able to do so again. The US recognizes that the situation is quickly reaching an inflection point past which there is no point of return or going back. It is now or never. And since a direct nuclear confrontation is not going to help America achieve its goals or retaining its status, nor reversing its decline, and coming back on top in terms of once again being sole unipolar hyperpower with no contender or meaningful challenger, then only option left after a failed trade war and failed tech war was to attack China in the back by secretly using biological warfare against China, not once, not twice, but now for a third and potentially ever more devastating time as each attack is increased in boldness and exponential in unprovoked escalation. &amp;nbsp; URL URL URL URL The end.

Then, on top of everything, bird flu happens in china too, and now chickens are going dead!

Even more, EU seems to be actively either importing China's tech and experience or \_developing\_ it along with China. Using citizens for mass surveillance, diversions and attacks is business as usual, these days. Whole countries have became open prisons, where some top of hierarchy monitors and effectively governs whole infrastructure, including the ""elected"" governments. These sorts of open prisons ( listed in second link) are nothing new here. What you should have in mind: \-these things are being tested here for global use. WE ARE BETA TESTERS FOR USA etc. They are doing it here, because they can get away with it - there is no public attention and governments are puppets anyway. Also, after made hell in Syria, they are trying to use mass exhodus of people to their advantage - monitoring and catching ""terrorists"" is perfect excuse. \- these things are done \_gradually\_. That's the key thing. When you notice them, it'll be too late. \- this isn't about China, Rusia, India, USA or any particular country. This is about covert groups and interests that misuse everything they touch and so they are using governments -as a front-end for their games. This is why governmental bodies of China, Israel, Germany, USA, France, Ukraine, China etc all seem to be working in tandem. They are either hijacked ( by extorted or planted etc individuals on key positions) and/or are going into this as frenemies - competing interests of competing or even adversarial groups that happened to resonate well on this interests and on this area. \- West shares most of the tech here. There are plenty of Israel and Ukraine here, along with many other vasal microstates. Since member abilities vary greatly, they share wide spectrum of tools, from simple ""street muscle"" through classic surveillance tools to advanced stuff, through international infrastructure for ""fighting terrorism"" ( data exchange, active help for attacks from the names like Google etc), through specifically manufactured stuff ( cameras in monitors and other equipment, purposefully made keyboards and mices so that they can be monitored and driven etcetc.), through access to ANY computer through Ethernet network and SMM etc. And, as it seems, NFC ""mind reading"" - contactless reading surface EEG signals. Couple of more interesting ""tricks"": \- Usage of bigger wavelength IR instead of NIR. Such cameras seem to be able to see ( to some degree) through cardboard and similar stuff and could be mounted within the walls, below the thin surface paint, wooden parts etc. \- usage of software defined radio to catch covert emmisions from surveiling sensors, so that they can stay covert. Such equipment wouldn't be suspicious even after opened, as it wouldn't contain anything meant for communication ( like Bluetooth or Wifi module). It could encode its information in, say work of the transformer within PSU or something similar ( perhaps switching audio amplifier etc) and SDR could catch and decode stray near field. \- mass of the off the shelf stuff ( computer motherboards etc) has hidden NFC receiver that can be triggered remotely through the pulse in the power network. There is no need for anyone o be present on the spot. One can generate such pulse in vicinity and let the greatz along with input elko cap block it ( that is in every PSU nowadays anyway). Resulting sudden short current spikes could be all that is needed. Such pulse train could be encoded so that it triggers just the desired target. \- many keyboards, mices on USB have hidden additions, so that they can save and generate keyclicks on demand. \- even without being hacked, most of this equipment can be misused through NFC/EMI effects anyway. Signal can be read AND generated so that it creates right transition in the cable for desired effect. Double shielded cables don't seem to be enough. Ones with ferrite ring are probably better, but it possibly wouldn't be a bad idea to use something heftier. If that's enough, I have no idea, but it certainly should be better. \- computer displays can not only capture and transmit the frame that is shown at some moment, they can also contain cameras within backlight and transmit the particular frame, photo from the camera or video (along with audio), if there is bandwidth available. Method of communication can be stray field/RF or HDMI/DisplayPort if there is ""support"" for this within a graphic card. Such equipment is if not within each piece of equipment, then at least serially available for all off-the-shelf merchandise so that practically anything can be delivered to customers door as a versiion with an originally added ""surveillance option"". Once one is flagged as a ""suspect"", EVERYTHING one buys anywhere within the region can have this option automatically built\_in and activated. \- ""anti terror"" network. As said, once one is ""suspect"" for whatever reason, \_EVERYTHING\_ one comes in contact has automatically activated surveillance option. EVEN IF S/HE CHANGES COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE - this network seems to cover most of the globe. \- this is of the global nature. If you think it's local problem, you are fatally mistaken. It is just being tested here, before it is used on you. \- All that democracy crap showelled on China is just that - crap, meant as a tool of misdirection. If you didn't know, Israel and China seem to work like hand in glove here. You've read that right- ISRAEL AND CHINA seem to be primary ALLIES on this front. Along with rest of the NATO crew. Israel and China cooperation seems to be, amongst other things, mass surveillance tech. Israel seems co contribute know-how, while China is bringing in manufacturing capabilities. Stuff gets Israel's ""covert touch"" so that it is vulnerable just the right way and China gets to make it, sell it and use it itself. By ""stuff"" I mean EVERYTHING. From obvious examples, like networking tech, to everyday crap one buys on Aliexpress. And, less obviously, most of everything else. Everything is either already vulnerable or has such ""enriched"" component, circuitry or deliberate vulnerability. \-local ISPs and Telecoms were acquired, without good, obvious reason. Which leaves less obvious one - as a mass surveillance network. \- presence of quite a few microwave link solutions providers, many of them with roots in or near Israel, offering their services. Obvious customers for microwave links are banks etc. Less obvious are such hijacked governments for mass surveillance traffic that is best kept out of channels that could be eavesdropped on and that need ""patriotic protection"" of some kind or another. All of these areas are ""dual books"" states. One sets of official books with democracy ornaments etc crap and another set of working real, entirely different books ( usually far out of borders of each such ""democratic"" state)."

(This valuable information is being scrubbed from the Internet.) COINTELPRO Techniques for dilution, misdirection and control of a internet forum. There are several techniques for the control and manipulation of a internet forum no matter what, or who is on it. We will go over each technique and demonstrate that only a minimal number of operatives can be used to eventually and effectively gain a control of a uncontrolled forum. Technique #1  FORUM SLIDING If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum  it can be quickly removed from public view by forum sliding. In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to age. Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a forum slide. The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a forum slide and flush the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then replying to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting slides down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items. Technique #2  CONSENSUS CRACKING A second highly effective technique (which you can see in operation all the time at URL is consensus cracking. To develop a consensus crack, the following technique is used. Under the guise of a fake account a posting is made which looks legitimate and is towards the truth is made  but the critical point is that it has a VERY WEAK PREMISE without substantive proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under alternative fake accounts a very strong position in your favour is slowly introduced over the life of the posting. It is IMPERATIVE that both sides are initially presented, so the uninformed reader cannot determine which side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger evidence or disinformation in your favour is slowly seeded in. Thus the uninformed reader will most like develop the same position as you, and if their position is against you their opposition to your posting will be most likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings, you can then abort the consensus cracking by initiating a forum slide. Technique #3  TOPIC DILUTION Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a RESOURCE BURN. By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a gossip mode. In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to drive in the wedge. By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator. Technique #4  INFORMATION COLLECTION Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a show you mine so me yours posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered. An example is to post your favourite weapon and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favourite technique of operation. From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities. Technique #5  ANGER TROLLING Statistically, there is always a percentage of the forum posters who are more inclined to violence. In order to determine who these individuals are, it is a requirement to present a image to the forum to deliberately incite a strong psychological reaction. From this the most violent in the group can be effectively singled out for reverse IP location and possibly local enforcement tracking. To accomplish this only requires posting a link to a video depicting a local police officer massively abusing his power against a very innocent individual. Statistically of the million or so police officers in America there is always one or two being caught abusing there powers and the taping of the activity can be then used for intelligence gathering purposes  without the requirement to stage a fake abuse video. This method is extremely effective, and the more so the more abusive the video can be made to look. Sometimes it is useful to lead the forum by replying to your own posting with your own statement of violent intent, and that you do not care what the authorities think!! inflammation. By doing this and showing no fear it may be more effective in getting the more silent and self-disciplined violent intent members of the forum to slip and post their real intentions. This can be used later in a court of law during prosecution. Technique #6  GAINING FULL CONTROL It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings  and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the ultimate victory as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a honey pot gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes. CONCLUSION Remember these techniques are only effective if the forum participants DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THEM. Once they are aware of these techniques the operation can completely fail, and the forum can become uncontrolled. At this point other avenues must be considered such as initiating a false legal precidence to simply have the forum shut down and taken offline. This is not desirable as it then leaves the enforcement agencies unable to track the percentage of those in the population who always resist attempts for control against them. Many other techniques can be utilized and developed by the individual and as you develop further techniques of infiltration and control it is imperative to share then with HQ. Twenty-Five Rules of Disinformation. Note: The first rule and last five (or six, depending on situation) rules are generally not directly within the ability of the traditional disinfo artist to apply. These rules are generally used more directly by those at the leadership, key players, or planning level of the criminal conspiracy or conspiracy to cover up. Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. Regardless of what you know, dont discuss it  especially if you are a public figure, news anchor, etc. If its not reported, it didnt happen, and you never have to deal with the issues. Become incredulous and indignant. Avoid discussing key issues and instead focus on side issues which can be used show the topic as being critical of some otherwise sacrosanct group or theme. This is also known as the How dare you! gambit. Create rumor mongers. Avoid discussing issues by describing all charges, regardless of venue or evidence, as mere rumors and wild accusations. Other derogatory terms mutually exclusive of truth may work as well. This method which works especially well with a silent press, because the only way the public can learn of the facts are through such arguable rumors. If you can associate the material with the Internet, use this fact to certify it a wild rumor from a bunch of kids on the Internet which can have no basis in fact. Use a straw man. Find or create a seeming element of your opponents argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues. Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary attack the messenger ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as kooks, right-wing, liberal, left-wing, terrorists, conspiracy buffs, radicals, militia, racists, religious fanatics, sexual deviates, and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues. Hit and Run. In any public forum, make a brief attack of your opponent or the opponent position and then scamper off before an answer can be fielded, or simply ignore any answer. This works extremely well in Internet and letters-to-the-editor environments where a steady stream of new identities can be called upon without having to explain criticism, reasoning  simply make an accusation or other attack, never discussing issues, and never answering any subsequent response, for that would dignify the opponents viewpoint. Question motives. Twist or amplify any fact which could be taken to imply that the opponent operates out of a hidden personal agenda or other bias. This avoids discussing issues and forces the accuser on the defensive. Invoke authority. Claim for yourself or associate yourself with authority and present your argument with enough jargon and minutia to illustrate you are one who knows, and simply say it isnt so without discussing issues or demonstrating concretely why or citing sources. Play Dumb. No matter what evidence or logical argument is offered, avoid discussing issues except with denials they have any credibility, make any sense, provide any proof, contain or make a point, have logic, or support a conclusion. Mix well for maximum effect. Associate opponent charges with old news. A derivative of the straw man  usually, in any large-scale matter of high visibility, someone will make charges early on which can be or were already easily dealt with  a kind of investment for the future should the matter not be so easily contained.) Where it can be foreseen, have your own side raise a straw man issue and have it dealt with early on as part of the initial contingency plans. Subsequent charges, regardless of validity or new ground uncovered, can usually then be associated with the original charge and dismissed as simply being a rehash without need to address current issues  so much the better where the opponent is or was involved with the original source. Establish and rely upon fall-back positions. Using a minor matter or element of the facts, take the high road and confess with candor that some innocent mistake, in hindsight, was made  but that opponents have seized on the opportunity to blow it all out of proportion and imply greater criminalities which, just isnt so. Others can reinforce this on your behalf, later, and even publicly call for an end to the nonsense because you have already done the right thing. Done properly, this can garner sympathy and respect for coming clean and owning up to your mistakes without addressing more serious issues. Enigmas have no solution. Drawing upon the overall umbrella of events surrounding the crime and the multitude of players and events, paint the entire affair as too complex to solve. This causes those otherwise following the matter to begin to lose interest more quickly without having to address the actual issues. Alice in Wonderland Logic. Avoid discussion of the issues by reasoning backwards or with an apparent deductive logic which forbears any actual material fact. Demand complete solutions. Avoid the issues by requiring opponents to solve the crime at hand completely, a ploy which works best with issues qualifying for rule 10. Fit the facts to alternate conclusions. This requires creative thinking unless the crime was planned with contingency conclusions in place. Vanish evidence and witnesses. If it does not exist, it is not fact, and you wont have to address the issue. Change the subject. Usually in connection with one of the other ploys listed here, find a way to side-track the discussion with abrasive or controversial comments in hopes of turning attention to a new, more manageable topic. This works especially well with companions who can argue with you over the new topic and polarize the discussion arena in order to avoid discussing more key issues. Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents. If you cant do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how sensitive they are to criticism. Ignore proof presented, demand impossible proofs. This is perhaps a variant of the play dumb rule. Regardless of what material may be presented by an opponent in public forums, claim the material irrelevant and demand proof that is impossible for the opponent to come by (it may exist, but not be at his disposal, or it may be something which is known to be safely destroyed or withheld, such as a murder weapon.) In order to completely avoid discussing issues, it may be required that you to categorically deny and be critical of media or books as valid sources, deny that witnesses are acceptable, or even deny that statements made by government or other authorities have any meaning or relevance. False evidence. Whenever possible, introduce new facts or clues designed and manufactured to conflict with opponent presentations  as useful tools to neutralize sensitive issues or impede resolution. This works best when the crime was designed with contingencies for the purpose, and the facts cannot be easily separated from the fabrications. Call a Grand Jury, Special Prosecutor, or other empowered investigative body. Subvert the (process) to your benefit and effectively neutralize all sensitive issues without open discussion. Once convened, the evidence and testimony are required to be secret when properly handled. For instance, if you own the prosecuting attorney, it can insure a Grand Jury hears no useful evidence and that the evidence is sealed and unavailable to subsequent investigators. Once a favorable verdict is achieved, the matter can be considered officially closed. Usually, this technique is applied to find the guilty innocent, but it can also be used to obtain charges when seeking to frame a victim. Manufacture a new truth. Create your own expert(s), group(s), author(s), leader(s) or influence existing ones willing to forge new ground via scientific, investigative, or social research or testimony which concludes favorably. In this way, if you must actually address issues, you can do so authoritatively. Create bigger distractions. If the above does not seem to be working to distract from sensitive issues, or to prevent unwanted media coverage of unstoppable events such as trials, create bigger news stories (or treat them as such) to distract the multitudes. Silence critics. If the above methods do not prevail, consider removing opponents from circulation by some definitive solution so that the need to address issues is removed entirely. This can be by their death, arrest and detention, blackmail or destruction of their character by release of blackmail information, or merely by destroying them financially, emotionally, or severely damaging their health. Vanish. If you are a key holder of secrets or otherwise overly illuminated and you think the heat is getting too hot, to avoid the issues, vacate the kitchen. Eight Traits of the Disinformationalist 1) Avoidance. They never actually discuss issues head-on or provide constructive input, generally avoiding citation of references or credentials. Rather, they merely imply this, that, and the other. Virtually everything about their presentation implies their authority and expert knowledge in the matter without any further justification for credibility. 2) Selectivity. They tend to pick and choose opponents carefully, either applying the hit-and-run approach against mere commentators supportive of opponents, or focusing heavier attacks on key opponents who are known to directly address issues. Should a commentator become argumentative with any success, the focus will shift to include the commentator as well. 3) Coincidental. They tend to surface suddenly and somewhat coincidentally with a new controversial topic with no clear prior record of participation in general discussions in the particular public arena involved. They likewise tend to vanish once the topic is no longer of general concern. They were likely directed or elected to be there for a reason, and vanish with the reason. 4) Teamwork. They tend to operate in self-congratulatory and complementary packs or teams. Of course, this can happen naturally in any public forum, but there will likely be an ongoing pattern of frequent exchanges of this sort where professionals are involved. Sometimes one of the players will infiltrate the opponent camp to become a source for straw man or other tactics designed to dilute opponent presentation strength. 5) Anti-conspiratorial. They almost always have disdain for conspiracy theorists and, usually, for those who in any way believe JFK was not killed by LHO. Ask yourself why, if they hold such disdain for conspiracy theorists, do they focus on defending a single topic discussed in a NG focusing on conspiracies? One might think they would either be trying to make fools of everyone on every topic, or simply ignore the group they hold in such disdain.Or, one might more rightly conclude they have an ulterior motive for their actions in going out of their way to focus as they do. 6) Artificial Emotions. An odd kind of artificial emotionalism and an unusually thick skin  an ability to persevere and persist even in the face of overwhelming criticism and unacceptance. This likely stems from intelligence community training that, no matter how condemning the evidence, deny everything, and never become emotionally involved or reactive. The net result for a disinfo artist is that emotions can seem artificial. Most people, if responding in anger, for instance, will express their animosity throughout their rebuttal. But disinfo types usually have trouble maintaining the image and are hot and cold with respect to pretended emotions and their usually more calm or unemotional communications style. Its just a job, and they often seem unable to act their role in character as well in a communications medium as they might be able in a real face-to-face conversation/confrontation. You might have outright rage and indignation one moment, ho-hum the next, and more anger later  an emotional yo-yo. With respect to being thick-skinned, no amount of criticism will deter them from doing their job, and they will generally continue their old disinfo patterns without any adjustments to criticisms of how obvious it is that they play that game  where a more rational individual who truly cares what others think might seek to improve their communications style, substance, and so forth, or simply give up. 7) Inconsistent. There is also a tendency to make mistakes which betray their true self/motives. This may stem from not really knowing their topic, or it may be somewhat freudian, so to speak, in that perhaps they really root for the side of truth deep within. I have noted that often, they will simply cite contradictory information which neutralizes itself and the author. For instance, one such player claimed to be a Navy pilot, but blamed his poor communicating skills (spelling, grammar, incoherent style) on having only a grade-school education. Im not aware of too many Navy pilots who dont have a college degree. Another claimed no knowledge of a particular topic/situation but later claimed first-hand knowledge of it. 8) Time Constant. Recently discovered, with respect to News Groups, is the response time factor. There are three ways this can be seen to work, especially when the government or other empowered player is involved in a cover up operation: a) ANY NG posting by a targeted proponent for truth can result in an IMMEDIATE response. The government and other empowered players can afford to pay people to sit there and watch for an opportunity to do some damage. SINCE DISINFO IN A NG ONLY WORKS IF THE READER SEES IT  FAST RESPONSE IS CALLED FOR, or the visitor may be swayed towards truth. b) When dealing in more direct ways with a disinformationalist, such as email, DELAY IS CALLED FOR  there will usually be a minimum of a 48-72 hour delay. This allows a sit-down team discussion on response strategy for best effect, and even enough time to get permission or instruction from a formal chain of command. c) In the NG example 1) above, it will often ALSO be seen that bigger guns are drawn and fired after the same 48-72 hours delay  the team approach in play. This is especially true when the targeted truth seeker or their comments are considered more important with respect to potential to reveal truth. Thus, a serious truth sayer will be attacked twice for the same sin. How to Spot a Spy (Cointelpro Agent) One way to neutralize a potential activist is to get them to be in a group that does all the wrong things. Why? The message doesnt get out. A lot of time is wasted The activist is frustrated and discouraged Nothing good is accomplished. FBI and Police Informers and Infiltrators will infest any group and they have phoney activist organizations established. Their purpose is to prevent any real movement for justice or eco-peace from developing in this country. Agents come in small, medium or large. They can be of any ethnic background. They can be male or female. The actual size of the group or movement being infiltrated is irrelevant. It is the potential the movement has for becoming large which brings on the spies and saboteurs. This booklet lists tactics agents use to slow things down, foul things up, destroy the movement and keep tabs on activists. It is the agents job to keep the activist from quitting such a group, thus keeping him/her under control. In some situations, to get control, the agent will tell the activist: Youre dividing the movement. \[Here, I have added the psychological reasons as to WHY this maneuver works to control people\] This invites guilty feelings. Many people can be controlled by guilt. The agents begin relationships with activists behind a well-developed mask of dedication to the cause. Because of their often declared dedication, (and actions designed to prove this), when they criticize the activist, he or she  being truly dedicated to the movement  becomes convinced that somehow, any issues are THEIR fault. This is because a truly dedicated person tends to believe that everyone has a conscience and that nobody would dissimulate and lie like that on purpose. Its amazing how far agents can go in manipulating an activist because the activist will constantly make excuses for the agent who regularly declares their dedication to the cause. Even if they do, occasionally, suspect the agent, they will pull the wool over their own eyes by rationalizing: they did that unconsciously they didnt really mean it I can help them by being forgiving and accepting  and so on and so forth. The agent will tell the activist: Youre a leader! This is designed to enhance the activists self-esteem. His or her narcissistic admiration of his/her own activist/altruistic intentions increase as he or she identifies with and consciously admires the altruistic declarations of the agent which are deliberately set up to mirror those of the activist. This is malignant pseudoidentification. It is the process by which the agent consciously imitates or simulates a certain behavior to foster the activists identification with him/her, thus increasing the activists vulnerability to exploitation. The agent will simulate the more subtle self-concepts of the activist. Activists and those who have altruistic self-concepts are most vulnerable to malignant pseudoidentification especially during work with the agent when the interaction includes matter relating to their competency, autonomy, or knowledge. The goal of the agent is to increase the activists general empathy for the agent through pseudo-identification with the activists self-concepts. The most common example of this is the agent who will compliment the activist for his competency or knowledge or value to the movement. On a more subtle level, the agent will simulate affects and mannerisms of the activist which promotes identification via mirroring and feelings of twinship. It is not unheard of for activists, enamored by the perceived helpfulness and competence of a good agent, to find themselves considering ethical violations and perhaps, even illegal behavior, in the service of their agent/handler. The activists felt quality of perfection \[self-concept\] is enhanced, and a strong empathic bond is developed with the agent through his/her imitation and simulation of the victims own narcissistic investments. \[self-concepts\] That is, if the activist knows, deep inside, their own dedication to the cause, they will project that onto the agent who is mirroring them. The activist will be deluded into thinking that the agent shares this feeling of identification and bonding. In an activist/social movement setting, the adversarial roles that activists naturally play vis a vis the establishment/government, fosters ongoing processes of intrapsychic splitting so that twinship alliances between activist and agent may render whole sectors or reality testing unavailable to the activist. They literally lose touch with reality. Activists who deny their own narcissistic investments \[do not have a good idea of their own self-concepts and that they ARE concepts\] and consciously perceive themselves (accurately, as it were) to be helpers endowed with a special amount of altruism are exceedingly vulnerable to the affective (emotional) simulation of the accomplished agent. Empathy is fostered in the activist through the expression of quite visible affects. The presentation of tearfulness, sadness, longing, fear, remorse, and guilt, may induce in the helper-oriented activist a strong sense of compassion, while unconsciously enhancing the activists narcissistic investment in self as the embodiment of goodness. The agents expresssion of such simulated affects may be quite compelling to the observer and difficult to distinguish from deep emotion. It can usually be identified by two events, however: First, the activist who has analyzed his/her own narcissistic roots and is aware of his/her own potential for being emotionally hooked, will be able to remain cool and unaffected by such emotional outpourings by the agent. As a result of this unaffected, cool, attitude, the Second event will occur: The agent will recompensate much too quickly following such an affective expression leaving the activist with the impression that the play has ended, the curtain has fallen, and the imposture, for the moment, has finished. The agent will then move quickly to another activist/victim. The fact is, the movement doesnt need leaders, it needs MOVERS. Follow the leader is a waste of time. A good agent will want to meet as often as possible. He or she will talk a lot and say little. One can expect an onslaught of long, unresolved discussions. Some agents take on a pushy, arrogant, or defensive manner: To disrupt the agenda To side-track the discussion To interrupt repeatedly To feign ignorance To make an unfounded accusation against a person. Calling someone a racist, for example. This tactic is used to discredit a person in the eyes of all other group members. Saboteurs Some saboteurs pretend to be activists. She or he will . Write encyclopedic flyers (in the present day, websites) Print flyers in English only. Have demonstrations in places where no one cares. Solicit funding from rich people instead of grass roots support Display banners with too many words that are confusing. Confuse issues. Make the wrong demands. Cool Compromise the goal. Have endless discussions that waste everyones time. The agent may accompany the endless discussions with drinking, pot smoking or other amusement to slow down the activists work. Provocateurs Want to establish leaders to set them up for a fall in order to stop the movement. Suggest doing foolish, illegal things to get the activists in trouble. Encourage militancy. Want to taunt the authorities. Attempt to make the activist compromise their values. Attempt to instigate violence. Activisim ought to always be non-violent. Attempt to provoke revolt among people who are ill-prepared to deal with the reaction of the authorities to such violence. Informants Want everyone to sign up and sing in and sign everything. Ask a lot of questions (gathering data). Want to know what events the activist is planning to attend. Attempt to make the activist defend him or herself to identify his or her beliefs, goals, and level of committment. Recruiting Legitimate activists do not subject people to hours of persuasive dialog. Their actions, beliefs, and goals speak for themselves. Groups that DO recruit are missionaries, military, and fake political parties or movements set up by agents. Surveillance ALWAYS assume that you are under surveillance. At this point, if you are NOT under surveillance, you are not a very good activist! Scare Tactics They use them. Such tactics include slander, defamation, threats, getting close to disaffected or minimally committed fellow activists to persuade them (via psychological tactics described above) to turn against the movement and give false testimony against their former compatriots. They will plant illegal substances on the activist and set up an arrest; they will plant false information and set up exposure, they will send incriminating letters \[emails\] in the name of the activist; and more; they will do whatever society will allow. This booklet in no way covers all the ways agents use to sabotage the lives of sincere an dedicated activists. If an agent is exposed, he or she will be transferred or replaced. COINTELPRO is still in operation today under a different code name. It is no longer placed on paper where it can be discovered through the freedom of information act. The FBI counterintelligence programs stated purpose: To expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, and otherwise neutralize individuals who the FBI categorize as opposed to the National Interests. National Security means the FBIs security from the people ever finding out the vicious things it does in violation of peoples civil liberties. Seventeen Techniques for Truth Suppression Strong, credible allegations of high-level criminal activity can bring down a government. When the government lacks an effective, fact-based defense, other techniques must be employed. The success of these techniques depends heavily upon a cooperative, compliant press and a mere token opposition party. Dummy up. If its not reported, if its not news, it didnt happen. Wax indignant. This is also known as the How dare you? gambit. Characterize the charges as rumors or, better yet, wild rumors. If, in spite of the news blackout, the public is still able to learn about the suspicious facts, it can only be through rumors. (If they tend to believe the rumors it must be because they are simply paranoid or hysterical.) Knock down straw men. Deal only with the weakest aspects of the weakest charges. Even better, create your own straw men. Make up wild rumors (or plant false stories) and give them lead play when you appear to debunk all the charges, real and fanciful alike. Call the skeptics names like conspiracy theorist, nutcase, ranter, kook, crackpot, and, of course, rumor monger. Be sure, too, to use heavily loaded verbs and adjectives when characterizing their charges and defending the more reasonable government and its defenders. You must then carefully avoid fair and open debate with any of the people you have thus maligned. For insurance, set up your own skeptics to shoot down. Impugn motives. Attempt to marginalize the critics by suggesting strongly that they are not really interested in the truth but are simply pursuing a partisan political agenda or are out to make money (compared to over-compensated adherents to the government line who, presumably, are not). Invoke authority. Here the controlled press and the sham opposition can be very useful. Dismiss the charges as old news. Come half-clean. This is also known as confession and avoidance or taking the limited hangout route. This way, you create the impression of candor and honesty while you admit only to relatively harmless, less-than-criminal mistakes. This stratagem often requires the embrace of a fall-back position quite different from the one originally taken. With effective damage control, the fall-back position need only be peddled by stooge skeptics to carefully limited markets. Characterize the crimes as impossibly complex and the truth as ultimately unknowable. Reason backward, using the deductive method with a vengeance. With thoroughly rigorous deduction, troublesome evidence is irrelevant. E.g. We have a completely free press. If evidence exists that the Vince Foster suicide note was forged, they would have reported it. They havent reported it so there is no such evidence. Another variation on this theme involves the likelihood of a conspiracy leaker and a press who would report the leak. Require the skeptics to solve the crime completely. E.g. If Foster was murdered, who did it and why? Change the subject. This technique includes creating and/or publicizing distractions. Lightly report incriminating facts, and then make nothing of them. This is sometimes referred to as bump and run reporting. Baldly and brazenly lie. A favorite way of doing this is to attribute the facts furnished the public to a plausible-sounding, but anonymous, source. Expanding further on numbers 4 and 5, have your own stooges expose scandals and champion popular causes. Their job is to pre-empt real opponents and to play 99-yard football. A variation is to pay rich people for the job who will pretend to spend their own money. Flood the Internet with agents. This is the answer to the question, What could possibly motivate a person to spend hour upon hour on Internet news groups defending the government and/or the press and harassing genuine critics? Don t the authorities have defenders enough in all the newspapers, magazines, radio, and television? One would think refusing to print critical letters and screening out serious callers or dumping them from radio talk shows would be control enough, but, obviously, it is not."
46,vulnerability,conspiracy,Emotions are the key,1,e4g1x3,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/e4g1x3/emotions_are_the_key/,2019-12-01 22:17:03,"As human beings. each of us is unique. But there are remarkable *patterns* that can be found. 1. Each is born 2. Each must eat and grow to survive 3. Each must position themselves as a member of a family or other group to survive (to my knowledge, barring the extremely rare hermit and prophet, for limited spans of time). 4. Each must become themselves; they *must* self identify to survive (mentally)this is not a choice 5. Each must adapt to the circumstances of their surroundings to survive 6. Each must address the unrequested physical transformations within ones own body to survive 7. Each must die, taken alone into a shroud, far from the sight of those still alive. These are *absolutes* There are other patterns too and this is what Id like to get into. We are creatures driven by emotion. Do dogs feel emotion, independently? Or is it that, when a dog is confronted with the *unearned, unconfirmed, and unexplained* **love** of a human being, they are shown this new development. Perhaps it is a revolution of sorts for themanimal life, if that makes sense. My roommates have a dog and for the last 6 months of living here Ive played with her more and more, to the point where she just sleeps with me, not them. Luckily this has caused no tension between us, but thats not the point. The point is: I would *lay down my life* for that little wonderand vice versawithout any hesitation. Two *different species.* One of them eats is own shit and lacks sentience.. How is this possible, that I have so quickly come to this state of vulnerability with someone elses dog? Im not looking for a history lesson about the transitioning of wolves to dogs, domestication, Stone Age, etc. Pretty sure I grasp the basic concept,, What Im saying is that the ability to transcend entire branches of life through loveand perhaps other emotionsis truly overlooked, in educated circles, in impoverished regions, in white neighborhoods, in black neighborhoods, in every nook and crannyyoull find human filth. There are human beings who I would kill to protect my new pup. Think about that.. how crazy that is, and yet most people if pressed would admit this is the conclusion. Think about it metaphysically, if you will. And Ill segue through this into my main point. ***Emotions are the source of a lot of **other things**** For instance.. politics. You and I and they and he and her over there in backwoods Tennessee dont USUALLY actually *do* anything to operate, contribute, to construct, revolutionize, to create, to *stand*, to protect, to fortify, reinforce, *to balance the equation.* We cant. Theyve made it that way. Instead, we vote. We *cast* a vote, *our* vote, and our vote matters. You see how we do it to ourselves? But they taught us this way. There wasnt a real choice. So, knowing this, I would say I have an exceptionally high level of both A) compassion AND B) **objectivity** and that ones real real important, especially if were trying to utilize / handle...emotions. Like, if I found out tomorrow that the Matrix was a documentary and I was actually in some dream world so that my actual existence in agony could be hidden from me, to further exploit me...Id honestly be okay. Because as much as that shatters my understanding of the world, it also puts it in perspective. Now, this is an absurd scenario, but in the little things in life, this is actually *more* important. They way you talk to people. The way you handle yourself. Your presence. Your aura. Your willingness to sacrifice for others. Your making an attempt, trying. Being in the moment, but not just living in the momentjust living my best life bullshit. Simply, avoid worrying. This is about finesse, and dignity. Dignity belongs to us. Gratitude and honor to those who came before, the many billions of homo-sapiens and trillions of other life forms that once lived and breathed as we do now. We have not lost you, not yet. And see, here I get emotional. And I think I have correctly equipped myself with these emotions, and this is a rather new development. It took time. It took pain and suffering. Repetition. Strength of will. Openness and courage."

48,vulnerability,conspiracy,"Inventing enemies or dehumanizing people is a requisite for war or mass murder. From ""Humanizing our Neighbours"", a pacifist group.",38,d465s0,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/d465s0/inventing_enemies_or_dehumanizing_people_is_a/,2019-09-15 00:52:23,"&amp;#x200B; Inventing enemies or dehumanizing people is a requisite for war or mass murder. So the Goering type propaganda, i.e. ""just tell them they are being attacked, it works in any country, even a democracy"" is key to turning otherwise good people into mass murderers, even, incredibly enough, normalizing the murder of the children of the dehumanized group. War propaganda is always going to be based on pressing people's emotional buttons, their vulnerability to fear, hate, greed, false pride and blind loyalty. This is how--actually it's the easy way how a psychopathically-gifted, i.e. charismatic ""leader"" can coalesce and bond his own country or members of his/her own identity group. It's been demonstrated over and over by social psychologists that at least 2/3's of all humans are extremely vulnerable to emotional manipulation. And as Leni Riefenstahl and her ilk demonstrated, group superiority type pride and blind loyalty are just as powerful as fear and hate. Throughout history, the positing of ""God is on our side"" or a divinely ordered group superiority will almost always inspire and motivate otherwise good people to condone murder. That is the ""banality of evil"" that Hannah Arendt discovered. So our anti-torture group has come up with this ""Humanizing Our Neighbors"" project to counter such dehumanizing war propaganda. It's so very easy to participate! Please consider taking photos or short videos of foreign human beings (if they give their consent)---especially the foreign citizens that your own ""leaders"" are bent on dehumanizing---and then submit them to the Humanizing Our Neighbors site. Actually our ""Tackling Torture at the Top!"" group did not originate this idea as it was something that was done during the Cold War by citizen diplomat type tourists in the USSR. ""Humanizing Our Neighbors"" is a corollary and in furtherance of good citizen diplomacy. In theory it should also be very easy to debunk the inherent ruse involved in the ""Right to Protect Humanitarian Imperialism"" type propaganda begun by Madeleine Albright, Samantha Power, Hillary Clinton et al since it's on the same level as the ridiculous Vietnam War mantra ""We have to bomb the village to save it."" What would Americans think of any foreign country that claimed it was liberating us from Donald Trump by bombing us to smithereens or starving us to death or by blockading us from obtaining medicine and hospital equipment?! But in practice the claim of a noble purpose of humanitarian regime change to advance human rights or democracy that ""justifies"" the killing and murder of millions of civilians has effectively worked on most Americans, and most especially, quite sadly on many liberal Americans who were previously against war before the humanitarian R2P propaganda was advanced. Again it needs to be recognized that the bulk of emotionally vulnerable Americans are very susceptible of embracing the notion that their killing of millions of foreigners--and all the easier when the foreigners are dehumanized---is all for a good cause. Truth is the first casualty of war which is another way of saying that facts no longer matter when emotional manipulation has reached such extremes of turning otherwise good people to condone mass murder. And as Cicero said, ""In time of war, the law falls silent"" which means people are so easily brought to the point of lawlessness (as happened when US embarked on mass round-up indefinite detention, torture and murder in its ""global war on terrorism."") The best and most effective war propaganda can normalize such illegality and even normalize the ""supreme crime"" of the use of perpetual wars of aggression, turning otherwise good people into monsters. So please help us try to counter the war propaganda! And please comment or let us know if your peace or human rights group will endorse and participate in our (Women Against Military Madness') ""Humanizing Our Neighbors"" Project."

50,vulnerability,conspiracy,Causes of Mass Shooting / Spree Killings,1,coinef,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/coinef/causes_of_mass_shooting_spree_killings/,2019-08-11 00:23:02," Obviously this is a topical subject at present and causing concern, so I have spent some time looking into possible causes, such as the roles of antidepressants. Firstly, not all AD's are the same. Some may have the opposite effects. We have very clear data that shows that the heavy metal, lead, is virtually perfectly correlated to homicide and other violence. Lead levels have been falling and with it the violent crime and homicide rate. The correlation shows up over time, but also geographically to create a very clear relationship from countries all over the world. This is what makes the apparent recent spike in mass shootings and young-people spree killers so strange. Studies that show overall homicide rates falling or stable with increased AD use, are potentially confounded with lower blood lead levels, which means an aggravating effect of SSRI's, which have been introduced roughly around the peak of lead blood levels, may not be detectable in the data when treated in bulk. There are also qualitative differences in these homicides. What effect specific SSRI's/AD's have in terms of the type of homicide, and who is committing it may be a more important question. **Some Clues** The average age of spree killers / shooters The gender distribution The targets The choice of weapon The High Degree of Planning Violence is Both Destructive to others and Intentionally destructive to themselves, with no obvious gain Psychosis and schizophrenia in males tends to start in mid to late adolescence, which means many SSRI takers may be misdiagnosed yet have a pre-psychotic illness caused by a brain abnormality that is not corrected by AD's, or in some, paradoxically aggravates or alters the psychosis that results. Homicide previously was often connected to personal disputes, and to crime. School shootings and other spree killings have a different, almost obsessional quality, as if the individual is possessed. The homicides are not selfish, as with crime, since the ultimate outcome is always the destruction of the spree killer themselves. So this is a rare phenomena, it is exceedingly significant and strange, and it being so rare, it is not possible to learn anything about it from general homicide rates given the many other causes for homicide will swamp the particular type of homicide we are observing. The gender of spree killers that use guns is overwhelmingly male. If we are to take it as fact that there are more mass shootings perpetrated by young males than before, that is the first big clue. As I mentioned, schizophrenia develops based on a pre-existing vulnerability, and with certain triggers, tends to transition into schizophrenia typically at around 16 years of age. The average age of onset is earlier in males than in females,and overlaps with school age spree killers in males. Schizophrenia can be used as a marker for other things, so I am not saying that schizophrenia itself is dangerous, but modified by certain factors, it may provide insight into this phenomena. An interesting study showed that schizophrenia presents differently in males and females. In females, disorganisation and lack of planning and anticipating outcomes is characteristic. In males, over organising and planning can be a characteristic. The two conditions may share an underlying contributing problem, but manifest in different brain regions in males and females, effecting particularly executive functioning. I think this is an important point - women are not committing these spree shootings, but the underlying pathology of psychosis would predict they wouldn't, because this subset of homicide is clearly related to planning and organisation which is excessively impaired in female brain dysfunction. Sigma 1, DHEA and Pregnanolone are Central - Do they act as 'Pivots' that create Unpredictable Effects of SSRIS/SNRI's? Neurosteroids are altered by both schizophrenia and by antidepressants. They are also known to influence aggression. These pathways are also connected to endocannibinoid signalling. They may be the pivots that lead to a subset of vulnerable people developing psychosis after using cannibis - [URL Neurosteroids like DHEA and Pregnanolone are sex steroid precursors, that modulate many brain functions, affect GABA and serotonin, and can affect aggression. They seem to have context specific effects, both inceasing and reducing a particular affect in different people. The production and effects of these neurosteroids seems to be effected by gender, and by the resulting androgens like testosterone and estrogen. [URL [URL In women, DHEA seems to reduce the effect of pregnanolone, which in turn increases GABA and lowers aggresion, so it is thought. Yet we also see SSRI's can increase self harm and aggression in middle aged women. So, again, it's logical to look at these molecular pathways to understand what may be going on. So, these are logical targets to examine since there are large changes in adolescence in these neurosteroids, they act on common pathways as SSRI's, they modulate GABA which reduces aggression, we know that GABA is disturbed in schizophenia. If a paradoxical effect of SSRI's would occur in some individuals, such as those with altered Sigma 1, and who have a pre-psychotic abnormality, the effect of SSRI's could act like a neurosteroid that in some individuals increases plan-orientated behaviour, obsessiveness and agitation. If that centres around thoughts of harming others, the addition of a neuro-steroidal chemical could term it into an obsessive compulsion. The Autism Connection Autism also involves abnormalities in these pathways, particularly GABA. Whilst autism is not normally very violent, under certain circumstances very high violent actions can be provoked. Although most mass shootings are not by diagnosed ASD people, they are represented several time higher than they should be as a fraction of the population. [URL Again, ASD affects men more, so we have all these clues that seem to tie into neurosteroids. [URL Antidepressants linked to autism - when consumed during pregnancy. Again, if an impact from SSRI's acts on neurosteroids and brain growth, it is reasonable to expect altered brains. This is interesting and also it shows this increased high function autism, and aspergers, but did not increase intellectually impaired autism. Autism, schizophrenia and depression, and many other conditions may all be largely the same illness, but manifest different as a result of the neurodevelopmental window of brain growth (infancy vs adolescence vs adult hood) and by degree. In conclusion, neurosteroids are the primary modulator of Sigma 1 in the body. SSRI's are known to modulate Sigma 1, generally as an agonist. Some neurosteroids inhibit Sigma 1 and others agonise it. DHEA and Pregnanolone agonise Sigma 1, and progesterone is an agonist. Sigma-1 plays a pivotal role in the antidepressant effect of SSRI's, and in schizophrenia and in the action and effectiveness of anti-psychotics. The complex interactions of these pathways and feedbacks could be expected to be quite unpredictable, and to potentially act differently in different individuals, at different ages, different gender, and with different underlying pathology. There are known interactions with behavior and aggression, and with cannabinoid signalling."

After 3 mass shootings in just over a month, to the Epstein debacle, people are waking up to the manufactured culture war, while elites find the gall to rub our noses in their crimes publicly. Above reproach, above justice, above considering you and me to be no more than convenient idiots that fall back on our political biases and prejudices and on cue, are willing to fight over table scraps in the information war. What worries me is that this may ultimately lead to asymmetrical *WAR* war, not just the one maintained using words/simmering long-term resentment on the internet. **I made a similar post to this one 24 hours before El Paso. Call it a hunch, a feeling, or a premonition, but something is about to happen in the next 72 hours.** I deleted previous posts about this issue today because they were understandably buried in the news of the day regarding Epstein (and I hadn't fully collected/refined my thoughts), but I encourage you to consider this post and reserve a corner of your mind if it comes true. I will not be deleting this post and I will live with the reasonable consequences of a false prediction. The upcoming event in Oregon this week (aside: in an interesting coincidence, the Ohio shooter was eliminated in the ""Oregon zone"" of the Ohio Town last weekend that has already been memory-holed/suppressed) will effectively remove Epstein from discussion/consideration (and if reports are to be believed post-hasty sea burial of his body, they already feel comfortable about calls for investigation/curiosity/justice to go away as if they have control over it!). **SOURCES*** [AUDIO: Joe Biggs InfoWars.com Guest Appearance on 8/9 where he describes his alliance with the Proud Boys and his present plan to travel to Portland. Note the heightened rhetoric and vaguely-aggressive ""call to arms"" found within. Wholly politically motivated/ideological.

Interesting example of programming nonetheless. 2 Minutes Long](URL [""Mixed messages, mounting tensions as Proud Boys and antifa prepare to face off in Portland"" - OREGONLIVE.COM](URL [""Portland Braces for Another Round of Proud Boys, Antifa Fights - THEDAILYBEAST""](URL Now, these two factions have faced-off multiple times to very little tangible effect on either side. In a sick irony, there are A LOT of more attention-grabbing events that have taken place over a month now (3 mass shootings, 1 dead Epstein + **A LOT** of questions even if one has been only following Epstein casually) It's only a matter of time before bombs/guns enter the scene among American factions claiming righteousness and/or there are dead bodies in the streets. **I truly think it will happen this week.** When a movement does not reach desired results, an escalation of tactics are necessary to control headlines and the conversation. This news cycle could not possibly be more dense/busy, so in a sick twist, one would need to go ""above and beyond"" to demand attention. I legitimately fear for the lives of my fellow Americans. So many are prone to tunnel-vision spoon-fed truth from their masters, and many online have been stewing, steadily, for YEARS over their mutual outrage, and I think a massive event is about to take place that will encourage folks to **act** upon what was once was internet rants dedicated to their like-minded circle. There is a feeling of hopelessness, of helplessness, that I feel very deeply at the moment this will be made tangible in the world. Nevertheless, please remember: The most dangerous person in the world is one who denies one's spoon-fed programming, looks at all the factors with even a small modicum of mental generosity, and is curious about the possibilities. Those that have an acute sense of pattern recognition and understand the who/what/when/why's of other events placed in similar cultural climates/contexts is a dangerous skill to have now as every effort in our culture has been made to make us as lazy/dumb/complacent as possible. We're through the looking glass at an important crossroads, people. **Do your duty.** They want you to forget Epstein, because there's enough ammunition there to spray in all directions. Because it is not in a tidy/neat package that sullies a specific side, it will naturally inspire questioning. To them, Questions are bad. It is one of the most brazen, open, ridiculous scenarios in recent memory and they're hoping to give you a new carrot-on-a-stick shortly to take your mind off of it and find something new to attack (if its not your tribe) or defend (if it makes your tribe look bad). Don't take the bait. Please be safe. ----------------------------- On a previous post, I don't want to forsake the contributions of /u/hoaxie_awards, who had an elegant, brilliant way of describing things that I wanted to highlight and didn't want to get lost to time. &gt; One way to look at these things is to take it like entertainment. I am convinced these events are staged and not authentic. I don't care what people call those of us that do believe this. We are immersed in theater. I do not understand how they are getting away with this, but they are. &gt; Nobody is demanding video/picture proof of anything and taking everything these known liars say as truth. If the president doesn't verify any of this shit as fake/real, and taking these stories (told by the media who ""hates"" him) as 100% real, then he's a dumb shit, and is in on the joke against us all. &gt; It's so fucking weird and foreign to me, that I really don't consider it as my personal real world, so I dismiss it. Despite Bldg 7, they were able to snow the entire world, without any consequences, forever. And now they are pulling off these fake events and snowing everybody with absolutely zero proof shit even happened at all. &gt; Normal life doesn't work this way. Everything I deal with is based in reality. Things I can see and touch, with 100% verifiable proof. All actions I take are based on my ability to see things as they exist in a real sense. So, if I am given information that I cannot verify as true, then I have to assume that I may be getting lied to, and it must be taken into consideration. &gt; If the US constitution is amended based on fake farts in the wind, then that's the value I place on it all. The whole apparatus is a giant joke lie, and I have much more important things to do in my real life I can see in front of me. Fuck the liars, let them rot in their own fake world of bullshit. --------------------------- -WS"

These attacks threaten to invalidate the security ECC aims to provide to private keys. &gt; &gt;Side-channel attacks generally occur when measurements are made on the physical implementation of a cryptosystem, resulting in leaks of information. Side-channel analysis includes a variety of attacks, such as simple timing attacks, simple power attacks, differential power attacks and fault analysis. &gt; &gt;Another category of attacks on elliptic curves is known as twist-security (fault) attacks.

From [Wikipedia](URL quoting the NSA: &gt;\[the NSA\] planned to transition ""in the not distant future"" to a new cipher suite that is resistant to quantum attacks.

54,vulnerability,conspiracy,"COINTELPRO Techniques for dilution, misdirection and control of a internet forum. (This valuable information is being scrubbed from the Internet.)",44,ctudv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ctudv8/cointelpro_techniques_for_dilution_misdirection/,2019-08-22 18:17:47," ### COINTELPRO Techniques for dilution, misdirection and control of a internet forum. There are several techniques for the control and manipulation of a internet forum no matter what, or who is on it. We will go over each technique and demonstrate that only a minimal number of operatives can be used to eventually and effectively gain a control of a uncontrolled forum. **Technique #1  FORUM SLIDING** If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum  it can be quickly removed from public view by forum sliding. In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to age. Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a forum slide. The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a forum slide and flush the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then replying to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting slides down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items. **Technique #2  CONSENSUS CRACKING** A second highly effective technique (which you can see in operation all the time at URL is consensus cracking. To develop a consensus crack, the following technique is used. Under the guise of a fake account a posting is made which looks legitimate and is towards the truth is made  but the critical point is that it has a VERY WEAK PREMISE without substantive proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under alternative fake accounts a very strong position in your favour is slowly introduced over the life of the posting. It is IMPERATIVE that both sides are initially presented, so the uninformed reader cannot determine which side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger evidence or disinformation in your favour is slowly seeded in. Thus the uninformed reader will most like develop the same position as you, and if their position is against you their opposition to your posting will be most likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings, you can then abort the consensus cracking by initiating a forum slide. **Technique #3  TOPIC DILUTION** Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a RESOURCE BURN. By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a gossip mode. In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to drive in the wedge. By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator. **Technique #4  INFORMATION COLLECTION** Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a show you mine so me yours posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered. An example is to post your favourite weapon and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favourite technique of operation. From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities. **Technique #5  ANGER TROLLING** Statistically, there is always a percentage of the forum posters who are more inclined to violence. In order to determine who these individuals are, it is a requirement to present a image to the forum to deliberately incite a strong psychological reaction. From this the most violent in the group can be effectively singled out for reverse IP location and possibly local enforcement tracking. To accomplish this only requires posting a link to a video depicting a local police officer massively abusing his power against a very innocent individual. Statistically of the million or so police officers in America there is always one or two being caught abusing there powers and the taping of the activity can be then used for intelligence gathering purposes  without the requirement to stage a fake abuse video. This method is extremely effective, and the more so the more abusive the video can be made to look. Sometimes it is useful to lead the forum by replying to your own posting with your own statement of violent intent, and that you do not care what the authorities think!! inflammation. By doing this and showing no fear it may be more effective in getting the more silent and self-disciplined violent intent members of the forum to slip and post their real intentions. This can be used later in a court of law during prosecution. **Technique #6  GAINING FULL CONTROL** It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings  and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the ultimate victory as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a honey pot gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes. **CONCLUSION** Remember these techniques are only effective if the forum participants DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THEM. Once they are aware of these techniques the operation can completely fail, and the forum can become uncontrolled. At this point other avenues must be considered such as initiating a false legal precidence to simply have the forum shut down and taken offline. This is not desirable as it then leaves the enforcement agencies unable to track the percentage of those in the population who always resist attempts for control against them. Many other techniques can be utilized and developed by the individual and as you develop further techniques of infiltration and control it is imperative to share then with HQ. ### Twenty-Five Rules of Disinformation. Note: The first rule and last five (or six, depending on situation) rules are generally not directly within the ability of the traditional disinfo artist to apply. These rules are generally used more directly by those at the leadership, key players, or planning level of the criminal conspiracy or conspiracy to cover up. 1. **Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil.** Regardless of what you know, dont discuss it  especially if you are a public figure, news anchor, etc. If its not reported, it didnt happen, and you never have to deal with the issues. 2. **Become incredulous and indignant.** Avoid discussing key issues and instead focus on side issues which can be used show the topic as being critical of some otherwise sacrosanct group or theme. This is also known as the How dare you! gambit. 3. **Create rumor mongers.** Avoid discussing issues by describing all charges, regardless of venue or evidence, as mere rumors and wild accusations. Other derogatory terms mutually exclusive of truth may work as well. This method which works especially well with a silent press, because the only way the public can learn of the facts are through such arguable rumors. If you can associate the material with the Internet, use this fact to certify it a wild rumor from a bunch of kids on the Internet which can have no basis in fact. 4. **Use a straw man.** Find or create a seeming element of your opponents argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues. 5. **Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule**. This is also known as the primary attack the messenger ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as kooks, right-wing, liberal, left-wing, terrorists, conspiracy buffs, radicals, militia, racists, religious fanatics, sexual deviates, and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues. 6. **Hit and Run.** In any public forum, make a brief attack of your opponent or the opponent position and then scamper off before an answer can be fielded, or simply ignore any answer. This works extremely well in Internet and letters-to-the-editor environments where a steady stream of new identities can be called upon without having to explain criticism, reasoning  simply make an accusation or other attack, never discussing issues, and never answering any subsequent response, for that would dignify the opponents viewpoint. 7. **Question motives.** Twist or amplify any fact which could be taken to imply that the opponent operates out of a hidden personal agenda or other bias. This avoids discussing issues and forces the accuser on the defensive. 8. **Invoke authority.** Claim for yourself or associate yourself with authority and present your argument with enough jargon and minutia to illustrate you are one who knows, and simply say it isnt so without discussing issues or demonstrating concretely why or citing sources. 9. **Play Dumb.** No matter what evidence or logical argument is offered, avoid discussing issues except with denials they have any credibility, make any sense, provide any proof, contain or make a point, have logic, or support a conclusion. Mix well for maximum effect. 10. **Associate opponent charges with old news**. A derivative of the straw man  usually, in any large-scale matter of high visibility, someone will make charges early on which can be or were already easily dealt with  a kind of investment for the future should the matter not be so easily contained.) Where it can be foreseen, have your own side raise a straw man issue and have it dealt with early on as part of the initial contingency plans. Subsequent charges, regardless of validity or new ground uncovered, can usually then be associated with the original charge and dismissed as simply being a rehash without need to address current issues  so much the better where the opponent is or was involved with the original source. 11. **Establish and rely upon fall-back positions.** Using a minor matter or element of the facts, take the high road and confess with candor that some innocent mistake, in hindsight, was made  but that opponents have seized on the opportunity to blow it all out of proportion and imply greater criminalities which, just isnt so. Others can reinforce this on your behalf, later, and even publicly call for an end to the nonsense because you have already done the right thing. Done properly, this can garner sympathy and respect for coming clean and owning up to your mistakes without addressing more serious issues. 12. **Enigmas have no solution**. Drawing upon the overall umbrella of events surrounding the crime and the multitude of players and events, paint the entire affair as too complex to solve. This causes those otherwise following the matter to begin to lose interest more quickly without having to address the actual issues. 13. **Alice in Wonderland Logic.** Avoid discussion of the issues by reasoning backwards or with an apparent deductive logic which forbears any actual material fact. 14. **Demand complete solutions.** Avoid the issues by requiring opponents to solve the crime at hand completely, a ploy which works best with issues qualifying for rule 10. 15. **Fit the facts to alternate conclusions.** This requires creative thinking unless the crime was planned with contingency conclusions in place. 16. **Vanish evidence and witnesses.** If it does not exist, it is not fact, and you wont have to address the issue. 17. **Change the subject.** Usually in connection with one of the other ploys listed here, find a way to side-track the discussion with abrasive or controversial comments in hopes of turning attention to a new, more manageable topic. This works especially well with companions who can argue with you over the new topic and polarize the discussion arena in order to avoid discussing more key issues. 18. **Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents.** If you cant do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how sensitive they are to criticism. 19. **Ignore proof presented, demand impossible proofs.** This is perhaps a variant of the play dumb rule. Regardless of what material may be presented by an opponent in public forums, claim the material irrelevant and demand proof that is impossible for the opponent to come by (it may exist, but not be at his disposal, or it may be something which is known to be safely destroyed or withheld, such as a murder weapon.) In order to completely avoid discussing issues, it may be required that you to categorically deny and be critical of media or books as valid sources, deny that witnesses are acceptable, or even deny that statements made by government or other authorities have any meaning or relevance. 20. **False evidence.** Whenever possible, introduce new facts or clues designed and manufactured to conflict with opponent presentations  as useful tools to neutralize sensitive issues or impede resolution. This works best when the crime was designed with contingencies for the purpose, and the facts cannot be easily separated from the fabrications. 21. **Call a Grand Jury, Special Prosecutor, or other empowered investigative body.** Subvert the (process) to your benefit and effectively neutralize all sensitive issues without open discussion. Once convened, the evidence and testimony are required to be secret when properly handled. For instance, if you own the prosecuting attorney, it can insure a Grand Jury hears no useful evidence and that the evidence is sealed and unavailable to subsequent investigators. Once a favorable verdict is achieved, the matter can be considered officially closed. Usually, this technique is applied to find the guilty innocent, but it can also be used to obtain charges when seeking to frame a victim. 22. **Manufacture a new truth.** Create your own expert(s), group(s), author(s), leader(s) or influence existing ones willing to forge new ground via scientific, investigative, or social research or testimony which concludes favorably. In this way, if you must actually address issues, you can do so authoritatively. 23. **Create bigger distractions.** If the above does not seem to be working to distract from sensitive issues, or to prevent unwanted media coverage of unstoppable events such as trials, create bigger news stories (or treat them as such) to distract the multitudes. 24. **Silence critics.** If the above methods do not prevail, consider removing opponents from circulation by some definitive solution so that the need to address issues is removed entirely. This can be by their death, arrest and detention, blackmail or destruction of their character by release of blackmail information, or merely by destroying them financially, emotionally, or severely damaging their health. 25. **Vanish.** If you are a key holder of secrets or otherwise overly illuminated and you think the heat is getting too hot, to avoid the issues, vacate the kitchen. ### Eight Traits of the Disinformationalist **1) Avoidance**. They never actually discuss issues head-on or provide constructive input, generally avoiding citation of references or credentials. Rather, they merely imply this, that, and the other. Virtually everything about their presentation implies their authority and expert knowledge in the matter without any further justification for credibility. **2) Selectivity.** They tend to pick and choose opponents carefully, either applying the hit-and-run approach against mere commentators supportive of opponents, or focusing heavier attacks on key opponents who are known to directly address issues. Should a commentator become argumentative with any success, the focus will shift to include the commentator as well. **3) Coincidental.** They tend to surface suddenly and somewhat coincidentally with a new controversial topic with no clear prior record of participation in general discussions in the particular public arena involved. They likewise tend to vanish once the topic is no longer of general concern. They were likely directed or elected to be there for a reason, and vanish with the reason. **4) Teamwork.** They tend to operate in self-congratulatory and complementary packs or teams. Of course, this can happen naturally in any public forum, but there will likely be an ongoing pattern of frequent exchanges of this sort where professionals are involved. Sometimes one of the players will infiltrate the opponent camp to become a source for straw man or other tactics designed to dilute opponent presentation strength. **5) Anti-conspiratorial.** They almost always have disdain for conspiracy theorists and, usually, for those who in any way believe JFK was not killed by LHO. Ask yourself why, if they hold such disdain for conspiracy theorists, do they focus on defending a single topic discussed in a NG focusing on conspiracies? One might think they would either be trying to make fools of everyone on every topic, or simply ignore the group they hold in such disdain.Or, one might more rightly conclude they have an ulterior motive for their actions in going out of their way to focus as they do. **6) Artificial Emotions.** An odd kind of artificial emotionalism and an unusually thick skin  an ability to persevere and persist even in the face of overwhelming criticism and unacceptance. This likely stems from intelligence community training that, no matter how condemning the evidence, deny everything, and never become emotionally involved or reactive. The net result for a disinfo artist is that emotions can seem artificial. Most people, if responding in anger, for instance, will express their animosity throughout their rebuttal. But disinfo types usually have trouble maintaining the image and are hot and cold with respect to pretended emotions and their usually more calm or unemotional communications style. Its just a job, and they often seem unable to act their role in character as well in a communications medium as they might be able in a real face-to-face conversation/confrontation. You might have outright rage and indignation one moment, ho-hum the next, and more anger later  an emotional yo-yo. With respect to being thick-skinned, no amount of criticism will deter them from doing their job, and they will generally continue their old disinfo patterns without any adjustments to criticisms of how obvious it is that they play that game  where a more rational individual who truly cares what others think might seek to improve their communications style, substance, and so forth, or simply give up. **7) Inconsistent.** There is also a tendency to make mistakes which betray their true self/motives. This may stem from not really knowing their topic, or it may be somewhat freudian, so to speak, in that perhaps they really root for the side of truth deep within. I have noted that often, they will simply cite contradictory information which neutralizes itself and the author. For instance, one such player claimed to be a Navy pilot, but blamed his poor communicating skills (spelling, grammar, incoherent style) on having only a grade-school education. Im not aware of too many Navy pilots who dont have a college degree. Another claimed no knowledge of a particular topic/situation but later claimed first-hand knowledge of it. **8) Time Constant.** Recently discovered, with respect to News Groups, is the response time factor. There are three ways this can be seen to work, especially when the government or other empowered player is involved in a cover up operation: a) ANY NG posting by a targeted proponent for truth can result in an IMMEDIATE response. The government and other empowered players can afford to pay people to sit there and watch for an opportunity to do some damage. SINCE DISINFO IN A NG ONLY WORKS IF THE READER SEES IT  FAST RESPONSE IS CALLED FOR, or the visitor may be swayed towards truth. b) When dealing in more direct ways with a disinformationalist, such as email, DELAY IS CALLED FOR  there will usually be a minimum of a 48-72 hour delay. This allows a sit-down team discussion on response strategy for best effect, and even enough time to get permission or instruction from a formal chain of command. c) In the NG example 1) above, it will often ALSO be seen that bigger guns are drawn and fired after the same 48-72 hours delay  the team approach in play. This is especially true when the targeted truth seeker or their comments are considered more important with respect to potential to reveal truth. Thus, a serious truth sayer will be attacked twice for the same sin. ### How to Spot a Spy (Cointelpro Agent) One way to neutralize a potential activist is to get them to be in a group that does all the wrong things. Why? 1. The message doesnt get out. 2. A lot of time is wasted 3. The activist is frustrated and discouraged 4. Nothing good is accomplished. FBI and Police Informers and Infiltrators will infest any group and they have phoney activist organizations established. Their purpose is to prevent any real movement for justice or eco-peace from developing in this country. Agents come in small, medium or large. They can be of any ethnic background. They can be male or female. The actual size of the group or movement being infiltrated is irrelevant. It is the potential the movement has for becoming large which brings on the spies and saboteurs. This booklet lists tactics agents use to slow things down, foul things up, destroy the movement and keep tabs on activists. It is the agents job to keep the activist from quitting such a group, thus keeping him/her under control. In some situations, to get control, the agent will tell the activist: Youre dividing the movement. \[Here, I have added the psychological reasons as to WHY this maneuver works to control people\] This invites guilty feelings. Many people can be controlled by guilt. The agents begin relationships with activists behind a well-developed mask of dedication to the cause. Because of their often declared dedication, (and actions designed to prove this), when they criticize the activist, he or she  being truly dedicated to the movement  becomes convinced that somehow, any issues are THEIR fault. This is because a truly dedicated person tends to believe that everyone has a conscience and that nobody would dissimulate and lie like that on purpose. Its amazing how far agents can go in manipulating an activist because the activist will constantly make excuses for the agent who regularly declares their dedication to the cause. Even if they do, occasionally, suspect the agent, they will pull the wool over their own eyes by rationalizing: they did that unconsciously they didnt really mean it I can help them by being forgiving and accepting  and so on and so forth. The agent will tell the activist: Youre a leader! This is designed to enhance the activists self-esteem. His or her narcissistic admiration of his/her own activist/altruistic intentions increase as he or she identifies with and consciously admires the altruistic declarations of the agent which are deliberately set up to mirror those of the activist. This is malignant pseudoidentification. It is the process by which the agent consciously imitates or simulates a certain behavior to foster the activists identification with him/her, thus increasing the activists vulnerability to exploitation. The agent will simulate the more subtle self-concepts of the activist. Activists and those who have altruistic self-concepts are most vulnerable to malignant pseudoidentification especially during work with the agent when the interaction includes matter relating to their competency, autonomy, or knowledge. The goal of the agent is to increase the activists general empathy for the agent through pseudo-identification with the activists self-concepts. The most common example of this is the agent who will compliment the activist for his competency or knowledge or value to the movement. On a more subtle level, the agent will simulate affects and mannerisms of the activist which promotes identification via mirroring and feelings of twinship. It is not unheard of for activists, enamored by the perceived helpfulness and competence of a good agent, to find themselves considering ethical violations and perhaps, even illegal behavior, in the service of their agent/handler. The activists felt quality of perfection \[self-concept\] is enhanced, and a strong empathic bond is developed with the agent through his/her imitation and simulation of the victims own narcissistic investments. \[self-concepts\] That is, if the activist knows, deep inside, their own dedication to the cause, they will project that onto the agent who is mirroring them. The activist will be deluded into thinking that the agent shares this feeling of identification and bonding. In an activist/social movement setting, the adversarial roles that activists naturally play vis a vis the establishment/government, fosters ongoing processes of intrapsychic splitting so that twinship alliances between activist and agent may render whole sectors or reality testing unavailable to the activist. They literally lose touch with reality. Activists who deny their own narcissistic investments \[do not have a good idea of their own self-concepts and that they ARE concepts\] and consciously perceive themselves (accurately, as it were) to be helpers endowed with a special amount of altruism are exceedingly vulnerable to the affective (emotional) simulation of the accomplished agent. Empathy is fostered in the activist through the expression of quite visible affects. The presentation of tearfulness, sadness, longing, fear, remorse, and guilt, may induce in the helper-oriented activist a strong sense of compassion, while unconsciously enhancing the activists narcissistic investment in self as the embodiment of goodness. The agents expresssion of such simulated affects may be quite compelling to the observer and difficult to distinguish from deep emotion. It can usually be identified by two events, however: First, the activist who has analyzed his/her own narcissistic roots and is aware of his/her own potential for being emotionally hooked, will be able to remain cool and unaffected by such emotional outpourings by the agent. As a result of this unaffected, cool, attitude, the Second event will occur: The agent will recompensate much too quickly following such an affective expression leaving the activist with the impression that the play has ended, the curtain has fallen, and the imposture, for the moment, has finished. The agent will then move quickly to another activist/victim. The fact is, the movement doesnt need leaders, it needs MOVERS. Follow the leader is a waste of time. A good agent will want to meet as often as possible. He or she will talk a lot and say little. One can expect an onslaught of long, unresolved discussions. Some agents take on a pushy, arrogant, or defensive manner: 1. To disrupt the agenda 2. To side-track the discussion 3. To interrupt repeatedly 4. To feign ignorance 5. To make an unfounded accusation against a person. Calling someone a racist, for example. This tactic is used to discredit a person in the eyes of all other group members. **Saboteurs** Some saboteurs pretend to be activists. She or he will . 1. Write encyclopedic flyers (in the present day, websites) 2. Print flyers in English only. 3. Have demonstrations in places where no one cares. 4. Solicit funding from rich people instead of grass roots support 5. Display banners with too many words that are confusing. 6. Confuse issues. 7. Make the wrong demands. 8. Cool Compromise the goal. 9. Have endless discussions that waste everyones time. The agent may accompany the endless discussions with drinking, pot smoking or other amusement to slow down the activists work. **Provocateurs** 1. Want to establish leaders to set them up for a fall in order to stop the movement. 2. Suggest doing foolish, illegal things to get the activists in trouble. 3. Encourage militancy. 4. Want to taunt the authorities. 5. Attempt to make the activist compromise their values. 6. Attempt to instigate violence. Activisim ought to always be non-violent. 7. Attempt to provoke revolt among people who are ill-prepared to deal with the reaction of the authorities to such violence. **Informants** 1. Want everyone to sign up and sing in and sign everything. 2. Ask a lot of questions (gathering data). 3. Want to know what events the activist is planning to attend. 4. Attempt to make the activist defend him or herself to identify his or her beliefs, goals, and level of committment. **Recruiting** Legitimate activists do not subject people to hours of persuasive dialog. Their actions, beliefs, and goals speak for themselves. Groups that DO recruit are missionaries, military, and fake political parties or movements set up by agents. **Surveillance** ALWAYS assume that you are under surveillance. At this point, if you are NOT under surveillance, you are not a very good activist! **Scare Tactics** They use them. Such tactics include slander, defamation, threats, getting close to disaffected or minimally committed fellow activists to persuade them (via psychological tactics described above) to turn against the movement and give false testimony against their former compatriots. They will plant illegal substances on the activist and set up an arrest; they will plant false information and set up exposure, they will send incriminating letters \[emails\] in the name of the activist; and more; they will do whatever society will allow. This booklet in no way covers all the ways agents use to sabotage the lives of sincere an dedicated activists. If an agent is exposed, he or she will be transferred or replaced. COINTELPRO is still in operation today under a different code name. It is no longer placed on paper where it can be discovered through the freedom of information act. The FBI counterintelligence programs stated purpose: To expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, and otherwise neutralize individuals who the FBI categorize as opposed to the National Interests. National Security means the FBIs security from the people ever finding out the vicious things it does in violation of peoples civil liberties. ### Seventeen Techniques for Truth Suppression 1. Strong, credible allegations of high-level criminal activity can bring down a government. When the government lacks an effective, fact-based defense, other techniques must be employed. The success of these techniques depends heavily upon a cooperative, compliant press and a mere token opposition party. 2. Dummy up. If its not reported, if its not news, it didnt happen. 3. Wax indignant. This is also known as the How dare you? gambit. 4. Characterize the charges as rumors or, better yet, wild rumors. If, in spite of the news blackout, the public is still able to learn about the suspicious facts, it can only be through rumors. (If they tend to believe the rumors it must be because they are simply paranoid or hysterical.) 5. Knock down straw men. Deal only with the weakest aspects of the weakest charges. Even better, create your own straw men. Make up wild rumors (or plant false stories) and give them lead play when you appear to debunk all the charges, real and fanciful alike. 6. Call the skeptics names like conspiracy theorist, nutcase, ranter, kook, crackpot, and, of course, rumor monger. Be sure, too, to use heavily loaded verbs and adjectives when characterizing their charges and defending the more reasonable government and its defenders. You must then carefully avoid fair and open debate with any of the people you have thus maligned. For insurance, set up your own skeptics to shoot down. 7. Impugn motives. Attempt to marginalize the critics by suggesting strongly that they are not really interested in the truth but are simply pursuing a partisan political agenda or are out to make money (compared to over-compensated adherents to the government line who, presumably, are not). 8. Invoke authority. Here the controlled press and the sham opposition can be very useful. 9. Dismiss the charges as old news. 10. Come half-clean. This is also known as confession and avoidance or taking the limited hangout route. This way, you create the impression of candor and honesty while you admit only to relatively harmless, less-than-criminal mistakes. This stratagem often requires the embrace of a fall-back position quite different from the one originally taken. With effective damage control, the fall-back position need only be peddled by stooge skeptics to carefully limited markets. 11. Characterize the crimes as impossibly complex and the truth as ultimately unknowable. 12. Reason backward, using the deductive method with a vengeance. With thoroughly rigorous deduction, troublesome evidence is irrelevant. E.g. We have a completely free press. If evidence exists that the Vince Foster suicide note was forged, they would have reported it. They havent reported it so there is no such evidence. Another variation on this theme involves the likelihood of a conspiracy leaker and a press who would report the leak. 13. Require the skeptics to solve the crime completely. E.g. If Foster was murdered, who did it and why? 14. Change the subject. This technique includes creating and/or publicizing distractions. 15. Lightly report incriminating facts, and then make nothing of them. This is sometimes referred to as bump and run reporting. 16. Baldly and brazenly lie. A favorite way of doing this is to attribute the facts furnished the public to a plausible-sounding, but anonymous, source. 17. Expanding further on numbers 4 and 5, have your own stooges expose scandals and champion popular causes. Their job is to pre-empt real opponents and to play 99-yard football. A variation is to pay rich people for the job who will pretend to spend their own money. 18. Flood the Internet with agents. This is the answer to the question, What could possibly motivate a person to spend hour upon hour on Internet news groups defending the government and/or the press and harassing genuine critics? Don t the authorities have defenders enough in all the newspapers, magazines, radio, and television? One would think refusing to print critical letters and screening out serious callers or dumping them from radio talk shows would be control enough, but, obviously, it is not."

It shows how fragile and interesting the times we live in are; if you'll remember one of the keynote panels in this years Bilderberg gathering was ""The Post Truth World."" With alleged Fake News to outright Fake News coming out of our newsgathering institutions, this short clip gave me pause. In this video Aziz asks the audience about this FAKE news story, using appeals to authority (The New York Times, The Washington Post, and himself as a celebrity/public figure) to give a quick poll about how people reacted when they saw this FAKE story. What's interesting is people actually reacted to both sides of his question and many more looked nervously at their neighbors and abstained from participating. Some Ideas of what's at play in the post-truth world: - Appeals to authority and exploitation of that surrendered authority. In the terms of Twitter/YouTube/Facebook control, a desperate ploy to maintain that status. - Every story can become a Rorshach test that pulls nearly anything into whatever narrative one has (tying a pizza to inferred racism or ideology) - An ever connected world that heightens anxiety about ""missing out"" when one is confronted with something they don't know about (i.e. what happens when you talk to your families/friends about conspiracies and is met with vague derision, though I'd venture to guess some may look into it later in private--so they don't ""miss out""). - I don't know if I'm alone, but I feel some of this technology has given myself a sort of ""know-it-all"" syndrome that transfers into my relationships, which really actually heightens narrative-driven impulses as in these moments of vulnerability one falls back on statements that is usually coming from an outside source, not myself. - We find acceptability in the those we admire/find more well-versed in a topic, so we download that data and try to give it relevance/power in public by repeating and perpetuating it. - Until we are self-aware to the point of understanding our impulses and default emotional reactions to things, we can start to chip away at the programming. TLDR; I think this is a humorous example as to why it's important to think and explore and reject narratives until they're supported with your own eyes and brain, simple skits like this show how easy it is to fall into traps and narratives when you aren't putting in work yourself to find a more objective and rational explanation of events (or at the very least, caring enough to know if they exist or not!) :)"
57,vulnerability,conspiracy,The Truth About Dentistry,22,bfw0tu,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/bfw0tu/the_truth_about_dentistry/,2019-04-22 11:02:12,"We have a fraught relationship with dentists as authority figures. In casual conversation we often dismiss them as not real doctors, regarding them more as mechanics for the mouth. But that disdain is tempered by fear. For more than a century, dentistry has been half-jokingly compared to torture. Surveys suggest that up to 61 percent of people are apprehensive about seeing the dentist, perhaps 15 percent are so anxious that they avoid the dentist almost entirely, and a smaller percentage have a genuine phobia requiring psychiatric intervention. When youre in the dentists chair, the power imbalance between practitioner and patient becomes palpable. A masked figure looms over your recumbent body, wielding power tools and sharp metal instruments, doing things to your mouth you cannot see, asking you questions you cannot properly answer, and judging you all the while. The experience simultaneously invokes physical danger, emotional vulnerability, and mental limpness. A cavity or receding gum line can suddenly feel like a personal failure. When a dentist declares that there is a problem, that something must be done before its too late, who has the courage or expertise to disagree? When he points at spectral smudges on an X-ray, how are we to know whats true? In other medical contexts, such as a visit to a general practitioner or a cardiologist, we are fairly accustomed to seeking a second opinion before agreeing to surgery or an expensive regimen of pills with harsh side effects. But in the dentists officeperhaps because we both dread dental procedures and belittle their medical significancethe impulse is to comply without much consideration, to get the whole thing over with as quickly as possible. The uneasy relationship between dentist and patient is further complicated by an unfortunate reality: Common dental procedures are not always as safe, effective, or durable as we are meant to believe. As a profession, dentistry has not yet applied the same level of self-scrutiny as medicine, or embraced as sweeping an emphasis on scientific evidence. We are isolated from the larger health-care system. So when evidence-based policies are being made, dentistry is often left out of the equation, says Jane Gillette, a dentist in Bozeman, Montana, who works closely with the American Dental Associations Center for Evidence-Based Dentistry, which was established in 2007. Were kind of behind the times, but increasingly we are trying to move the needle forward. Consider the maxim that everyone should visit the dentist twice a year for cleanings. We hear it so often, and from such a young age, that weve internalized it as truth. But this supposed commandment of oral health has no scientific grounding. Scholars have traced its origins to a few potential sources, including a toothpaste advertisement from the 1930s and an illustrated pamphlet from 1849 that follows the travails of a man with a severe toothache. Today, an increasing number of dentists acknowledge that adults with good oral hygiene need to see a dentist only once every 12 to 16 months. Many standard dental treatmentsto say nothing of all the recent innovations and cosmetic extravagancesare likewise not well substantiated by research. Many have never been tested in meticulous clinical trials. And the data that are available are not always reassuring. The Cochrane organization, a highly respected arbiter of evidence-based medicine, has conducted systematic reviews of oral-health studies since 1999. In these reviews, researchers analyze the scientific literature on a particular dental intervention, focusing on the most rigorous and well-designed studies. In some cases, the findings clearly justify a given procedure. For example, dental sealantsliquid plastics painted onto the pits and grooves of teeth like nail polishreduce tooth decay in children and have no known risks. (Despite this, they are not widely used, possibly because they are too simple and inexpensive to earn dentists much money.) But most of the Cochrane reviews reach one of two disheartening conclusions: Either the available evidence fails to confirm the purported benefits of a given dental intervention, or there is simply not enough research to say anything substantive one way or another. Fluoridation of drinking water seems to help reduce tooth decay in children, but there is insufficient evidence that it does the same for adults. Some data suggest that regular flossing, in addition to brushing, mitigates gum disease, but there is only weak, very unreliable evidence that it combats plaque. As for common but invasive dental procedures, an increasing number of dentists question the tradition of prophylactic wisdom-teeth removal; often, the safer choice is to monitor unproblematic teeth for any worrying developments. Little medical evidence justifies the substitution of tooth-colored resins for typical metal amalgams to fill cavities. And what limited data we have dont clearly indicate whether its better to repair a root-canaled tooth with a crown or a filling. When Cochrane researchers tried to determine whether faulty metal fillings should be repaired or replaced, they could not find a single study that met their standards. URL"
58,vulnerability,conspiracy,"They are poisoning us, 20 reasons to oppose water fluoridation",47,bjicga,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/bjicga/they_are_poisoning_us_20_reasons_to_oppose_water/,2019-05-02 01:21:52," **1) Fluoride is the only chemical added to water for the purpose of medical treatment**. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies fluoride as a [drug](URL used to prevent or mitigate disease (FDA 2000). As a matter of basic logic, adding fluoride to water for the sole purpose of preventing tooth decay (a non-waterborne disease) is a form of medical treatment. All other water treatment chemicals are added to improve the waters quality or safety, which fluoride does not do. **2) Fluoridation is unethical**. [Informed consent](URL is standard practice for all medication, and one of the key reasons why most of Western Europe has ruled against fluoridation. With water fluoridation we are allowing governments to do to whole communities (forcing people to take a medicine irrespective of their consent) what individual doctors cannot do to individual patients. Put another way: Does a voter have the right to require that their neighbor ingest a certain medication (even if it is against that neighbors will)? **3) The dose cannot be controlled**. Once fluoride is put in the water it is impossible to control the dose each individual receives because people drink different amounts of water. Being able to control the dose a patient receives is critical. Some people (e.g., manual laborers, athletes, diabetics, and people with kidney disease) drink substantially more water than others. **4) The fluoride goes to everyone regardless of age, health or vulnerability.** According to Dr. Arvid Carlsson, the 2000 Nobel Laureate in Medicine and Physiology and one of the scientists who helped keep fluoridation out of Sweden: Water fluoridation goes against leading principles of pharmacotherapy, which is progressing from a stereotyped medication  of the type 1 tablet 3 times a day  to a much more individualized therapy as regards both dosage and selection of drugs. The addition of drugs to the drinking water means exactly the opposite of an individualized therapy (Carlsson 1978). **5) People now receive fluoride from many other sources besides water.** Fluoridated water is not the only way people are exposed to fluoride. [Other sources](URL of fluoride include food and beverages processed with fluoridated water (Kiritsy 1996; Heilman 1999), fluoridated dental products (Bentley 1999; Levy 1999), mechanically deboned meat (Fein 2001), tea (Levy 1999), and pesticide residues (e.g., from cryolite) on food (Stannard 1991; Burgstahler 1997). It is now widely acknowledged that exposure to non-water sources of fluoride has significantly increased since the water fluoridation program first began (NRC 2006). **6) Fluoride is not an essential nutrient**. No disease, not even tooth decay, is caused by a [fluoride deficiency](URL 1993; Institute of Medicine 1997, NRC 2006). Not a single biological process has been shown to require fluoride. On the contrary there is extensive evidence that fluoride can interfere with many important biological processes. Fluoride interferes with numerous enzymes (Waldbott 1978). In combination with aluminum, fluoride interferes with G-proteins (Bigay 1985, 1987). Such interactions give aluminum-fluoride complexes the potential to interfere with signals from growth factors, hormones and neurotransmitters (Strunecka &amp; Patocka 1999; Li 2003). More and more studies indicate that fluoride can interfere with [biochemistry](URL in fundamental ways (Barbier 2010). **7) The level in mothers milk is very low**. Considering reason #6 it is perhaps not surprising that the level of fluoride in [mothers milk](URL is remarkably low (0.004 ppm, NRC, 2006). This means that a bottle-fed baby consuming fluoridated water (0.6  1.2 ppm) can get up to 300 times more fluoride than a breast-fed baby. There are no benefits (see reasons #11-19), only risks (see reasons #21-36), for infants ingesting this heightened level of fluoride at such an early age (an age where susceptibility to environmental toxins is particularly high). **8 ) Fluoride accumulates in the body**. Healthy adult kidneys excrete 50 to 60% of the fluoride ingested each day (Marier &amp; Rose 1971). The remainder accumulates in the body, largely in calcifying tissues such as the bones and [pineal gland](URL (Luke 1997, 2001). Infants and children [excrete less](URL fluoride from their kidneys and take up to 80% of ingested fluoride into their bones (Ekstrand 1994). The fluoride concentration in bone steadily increases over a lifetime (NRC 2006). **9) No health agency in fluoridated countries is monitoring fluoride exposure or side effects**. No regular measurements are being made of the levels of fluoride in urine, blood, bones, hair, or nails of either the general population or sensitive subparts of the population (e.g., individuals with [kidney disease](URL **10) There has never been a single randomized controlled trial to demonstrate fluoridations effectiveness or safety**. Despite the fact that fluoride has been added to community water supplies for over 60 years, there have been no randomized trials of water fluoridation (Cheng 2007). [Randomized trials](URL are the standard method for determining the safety and effectiveness of any purportedly beneficial medical treatment. In 2000, the British Governments York Review could not give a single fluoridation trial a Grade A classification  despite 50 years of research (McDonagh 2000). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues to classify fluoride as an [unapproved new drug](URL ## Swallowing fluoride provides no (or very little) benefit **11) Benefit is topical not systemic.** The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 1999, 2001) has now acknowledged that the mechanism of fluorides benefits are mainly [topical](URL not systemic. There is no need whatsoever, therefore, to swallow fluoride to protect teeth. Since the purported benefit of fluoride is topical, and the risks are systemic, it makes more sense to deliver the fluoride directly to the tooth in the form of toothpaste. Since swallowing fluoride is unnecessary, and potentially dangerous, there is no justification for forcing people (against their will) to ingest fluoride through their water supply. **12) Fluoridation is not necessary.** Most western, industrialized countries have [rejected](URL fluoridation, but have nevertheless experienced the [same decline](URL in childhood dental decay as fluoridated countries. (See data from World Health Organization presented graphically in Figure). &amp;#x200B; **13) Fluoridations role in the decline of tooth decay is in serious doubt.** The [largest survey](URL ever conducted in the US (over 39,000 children from 84 communities) by the National Institute of Dental Research showed [little difference](URL in tooth decay among children in fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities (Hileman 1989). According to NIDR researchers, the study found an average difference of only 0.6 DMFS (Decayed, Missing, and Filled Surfaces) in the permanent teeth of children aged 5-17 residing their entire lives in either fluoridated or unfluoridated areas (Brunelle &amp; Carlos, 1990). This difference is less than one tooth surface, and less than 1% of the 100+ tooth surfaces available in a childs mouth. Large surveys from three Australian states have found even less of a benefit, with decay reductions ranging from 0 to 0.3 of one permanent tooth surface (Spencer 1996; Armfield &amp; Spencer 2004). None of these studies have allowed for the possible delayed eruption of the teeth that may be caused by exposure to fluoride, for which there is some evidence (Komarek 2005). A one-year delay in eruption of the permanent teeth would eliminate the very small benefit recorded in these modern studies. **14) NIH-funded study on individual fluoride ingestion and tooth decay found no significant correlation**. A multi-million dollar, U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded [study](URL found no significant relationship between tooth decay and [fluoride intake](URL children. (Warren 2009) This is the first time tooth decay has been investigated as a function of individual exposure (as opposed to mere residence in a fluoridated community). **15) Tooth decay is high in low-income communities that have been fluoridated for years**. Despite some claims to the contrary, water fluoridation cannot prevent the [oral health crises](URL that result from rampant poverty, inadequate nutrition, and lack of access to dental care. There have been numerous reports of severe dental crises in low-income neighborhoods of US cities that have been fluoridated for over 20 years (e.g., Boston, Cincinnati, New York City, and Pittsburgh). In addition, research has repeatedly found fluoridation to be ineffective at preventing the most serious oral health problem facing poor children, namely [baby bottle tooth decay](URL otherwise known as early childhood caries (Barnes 1992; Shiboski 2003). **16) Tooth decay does not go up when fluoridation is stopped.** Where fluoridation has been [discontinued](URL in communities from Canada, the former East Germany, Cuba and Finland, dental decay has not increased but has generally continued to decrease (Maupom 2001; Kunzel &amp; Fischer, 1997, 2000; Kunzel 2000; Seppa 2000). **17) Tooth decay was coming down before fluoridation started.** Modern research shows that decay rates were coming down before fluoridation was introduced in Australia and New Zealand and have continued to decline even after its benefits would have been maximized. (Colquhoun 1997; Diesendorf 1986). As the following figure indicates, many other factors are responsible for the decline of tooth decay that has been universally reported throughout the western world. &amp;#x200B; **18) The studies that launched fluoridation were methodologically flawed.** The early trials conducted between 1945 and 1955 in North America that helped to launch fluoridation, have been heavily criticized for their poor methodology and poor choice of control communities (De Stefano 1954; Sutton 1959, 1960, 1996; Ziegelbecker 1970). According to Dr. Hubert Arnold, a statistician from the University of California at Davis, the early fluoridation trials are especially rich in fallacies, improper design, invalid use of statistical methods, omissions of contrary data, and just plain muddleheadedness and hebetude. Serious questions have also been raised about Trendley Deans (the father of fluoridation) famous 21-city study from 1942 (Ziegelbecker 1981). ## Children are being over-exposed to fluoride **19) Children are being over-exposed to fluoride.** The fluoridation program has massively failed to achieve one of its key objectives, i.e., to lower dental decay rates while limiting the occurrence of [dental fluorosis](URL (a discoloring of tooth enamel caused by too much fluoride. The goal of the early promoters of fluoridation was to limit dental fluorosis (in its very mild form) to10% of children (NRC 1993, pp. 6-7). In 2010, however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 41% of American adolescents had dental fluorosis, with 8.6% having mild fluorosis and 3.6% having either moderate or severe dental fluorosis (Beltran-Aguilar 2010). As the 41% prevalence figure is a national average and includes children living in fluoridated and unfluoridated areas, the fluorosis rate in fluoridated communities will obviously be higher. The British Governments York Review estimated that up to 48% of children in fluoridated areas worldwide have dental fluorosis in all forms, with 12.5% having fluorosis of [aesthetic concern](URL (McDonagh, 2000). &amp;#x200B; **20) The highest doses of fluoride are going to bottle-fed babies.** Because of their sole reliance on liquids for their food intake, [infants](URL consuming formula made with fluoridated water have the highest exposure to fluoride, by bodyweight, in the population. Because infant exposure to fluoridated water has been repeatedly found to be a [major risk factor](URL for developing dental fluorosis later in life (Marshall 2004; Hong 2006; Levy 2010), a number of [dental researchers](URL have recommended that parents of newborns not use fluoridated water when reconstituting formula (Ekstrand 1996; Pendrys 1998; Fomon 2000; Brothwell 2003; Marshall 2004). Even the American Dental Association (ADA), the most ardent institutional proponent of fluoridation, distributed a November 6, 2006 email alert to its members recommending that parents be advised that formula should be made with low or no-fluoride water. Unfortunately, the ADA has done little to get this information into the hands of parents. As a result, many parents remain unaware of the fluorosis risk from infant exposure to fluoridated water.

Facebook ads linked to a Russian effort to disrupt the US political process are displayed as Facebook executives appear before the House Intelligence Committee on November 1, 2017. (Reuters / Aaron Bernstein) The release of two Senate-commissioned reports has sparked a new round of panic about Russia manipulating a vulnerable American public on social media. Headlines warn that Russian trolls have tried to [suppress the African-American vote](URL [promote Green Party candidate Jill Stein](URL [recruit assets,](URL and sow discord or hack the 2016 election via [sex-toy ads](URL and [Pokmon Go](URL The studies, [writes David Ignatius of *The Washington Post*](URL describe a sophisticated, multilevel Russian effort to use every available tool of our open society to create resentment, mistrust and social disorder, demonstrating that the Russians, thanks to the Internetseem to be perfecting these dark arts. [According to Michelle Goldberg of *The New York Times*](URL it looks increasingly as though Russian disinformation changed the direction of American history in the narrowly decided 2016 election, when Russian trolling easily could have made the difference. The reports, from the University of Oxfords [Computational Propaganda Research Project](URL and the firm [New Knowledge](URL do provide the most thorough look at Russian social-media activity to date. With an abundance of data, charts, graphs, and tables, coupled with extensive qualitative analysis, the authors scrutinize the output of the Internet Research Agency (IRA) the Russian clickbait firm [indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller](URL in February 2018. On every significant metric, it is difficult to square the data with the dramatic conclusions that have been drawn. ** 2016 Election Content:** The most glaring data point is how minimally Russian social-media activity pertained to the 2016 campaign. The New Knowledge report acknowledges that evaluating IRA content purely based on whether it definitively swung the election is too narrow a focus, as the explicitly political content was a small percentage. To be exact, just 11% of the total content attributed to the IRA and 33 percent of user engagement with it was related to the election. **The IRAs posts were minimally about the candidates, with roughly 6% of tweets, 18% of Instagram posts, and 7% of Facebook posts having mentioned Trump or Clinton by name.** ** Scale:** The researchers claim that the scale of \[the Russian\] operation was unprecedented, but they base that conclusion on dubious figures. They repeat the widespread claim that Russian posts reached 126 million people on Facebook, which is in fact a spin on Facebooks own guess. Our best estimate, [Facebooks Colin Stretch testified to Congress in October 2017](URL is that approximately 126 million people may have been served one of these \[IRA\] stories at some time during the two year period between 2015 and 2017. According to Stretch, **posts generated by suspected Russian accounts showing up in Facebooks News Feed amounted to approximately 1 out of 23,000 pieces of content.** &amp;#x200B; ** Spending:** Also hurting the case that the Russians reached a large number of Americans is that they spent such a microscopic amount of money to do it. Oxford puts the IRAs Facebook spending between 2015 and 2017 at just $73,711. As was previously known, **about $46,000 was spent on Russian-linked Facebook ads before the 2016 election.** **That amounts to about 0.05 percent of the $81 million spent on Facebook ads by the Clinton and Trump campaigns combined.** A [recent disclosure by Google](URL that Russian-linked accounts spent $4,700 on platforms in 2016 only underscores how miniscule that spending was. The researchers also claim that the IRAs manipulation of American political discourse had a budget that exceeded $25 million USD. But that number is based on a widely repeated error that mistakes the [IRAs spending on US-related activities](URL for [its parent projects overall global budget](URL including domestic social-media activity in Russia. ** Sophistication**: Another reason to question the operations sophistication can be found by simply looking at its offerings. **The IRAs most shared pre-election Facebook post was a cartoon of a** [**gun-wielding Yosemite Sam**](URL Over on Instagram, the best-received image [urged](URL users to give it a Like if they believe in Jesus. The top IRA post on Facebook before the election to mention Hillary Clinton was a [conspiratorial screed about voter fraud](URL Its telling that those who are so certain Russian social-media posts affected the 2016 election never cite the posts that they think actually helped achieve that end. The actual content of those posts might explain why. ** Covert or Clickbait Operation**? Far from exposing a sophisticated propaganda campaign, the reports provide more evidence that the **Russians were actually engaging in clickbait capitalism: targeting unique demographics like African Americans or evangelicals in a bid to attract large audiences for commercial purposes.** Reporters who have profiled the IRA have commonly described it as [a social media marketing campaign](URL Muellers indictment of the IRA disclosed that it sold promotions and advertisements on its pages that generally sold in the $25-$50 range. **This strategy, Oxford observes, is not an invention for politics and foreign intrigue, it is consistent with techniques used in digital marketing.** New Knowledge notes that the IRA even sold merchandise that perhaps provided the IRA with a source of revenue, hawking goods such as T-shirts, LGBT-positive sex toys and many variants of triptych and 5-panel artwork featuring traditionally conservative, patriotic themes. &amp;#x200B; ** Asset Development**: Lest one wonder how promoting sex toys might factor into a sophisticated influence campaign, the New Knowledge report claims that exploiting sexual behavior was a key component of the IRAs expansive human asset recruitment strategy in the United States. Recruiting an asset by exploiting a personal vulnerability, the report explains, is a timeless espionage practice. **The first example of this timeless espionage practice is of** [**an ad featuring Jesus**](URL **consoling a dejected young man by telling him: Struggling with the addiction to masturbation? Reach out to me and we will beat it together.** It is unknown if this particular tactic brought any assets into the fold.

That is correct: **The IRAs online trolls apparently succeeded in sparking protests in 2016, like several in Florida where **[**its unclear if anyone attended**](URL [**no people showed up to at least one, and ragtag groups showed up at others**](URL including one where video footage captured** [**a crowd of eight people**](URL The most successful effort appears to have been in Houston, where [Russian trolls allegedly organized dueling rallies pitting a dozen white supremacists against several dozen counter-protesters](URL outside an Islamic center. &amp;#x200B; # Based on all of this data, we can draw this picture of Russian social-media activity: It was mostly unrelated to the 2016 election; microscopic in reach, engagement, and spending; and juvenile or absurd in its content. &amp;#x200B; [URL"

Once in a while there will be a crazy person on the train and all of us normal passengers can smile at each other and sigh. At least were not crazy. The subway tunnels are the arteries and veins of the city, the passageways of the busy hive. If you close your eyes the movement through the tunnels feels organic, alive. A buzz of worker bees on our way. Where are we going? I dont want be a part of the hive. But Im a human being. I need other human beings. Something is broken in me. I hate myself. I dont feel connection in any aspect of my life. friendships, family, romance, work. Ennui and alienation are my reality. A city of 8 million people. A hive of loneliness. My life is no tragedy. I dont have any real reasons to be sad but Im sad. I wasnt abused. My parents love me. I went to college. I had all the benefits of a middle class upbringing.

The president offered his condolences. We had an all-staff call at work to discuss how we felt. Its important for us to remember that terrorists are evil. When terrible things happen on our TV screens its important to show solidarity. Weve never had an all-staff call at work to discuss our solidarity with the homeless people that we walk by each day between the subway station and our office. The woman who stands by the subway entrance shaking her cup of change every day. The couple that sleep in sleeping bags each night under the awning of the bodega.

The economy is doing well. I talked to my sister a few weeks ago, she lives in Colorado. She used to live in Arizona, and before that North Carolina. I miss my sister. Like most young people she goes wherever her or her boyfriend can find work. She complained about her job, about how all her coworkers seem so fake. No one really seems to care about what theyre doing. Its more important to make it seem like you care than it is to actually care. The other day I saw a picture she posted with her co-workers - So happy to work with these great people and this awesome company #workfriends. The global economy is great. Even as it rips apart the connections that we need for our emotional health, it comes up with ever more products and services and gadgets for us to substitute for those connections and soothe our loneliness. One day we will all be starting at screens all the time and well never have to interact with humans in the real world ever again. Life will be good. I know some people who find meaning in their work. They work long hours. They go out drinking with co-workers. Mostly they work in advertising or tech or finance. These industries are important because they help our economy grow. Growing the economy is important. We may live on a finite planet, but were committed to an economy that can grow forever. An economy is not the only type of organic system that can commit to a cycle of endless growth. Sometimes it happens with cells in the human body for instance. This is called cancer. Most of my time at work I sit at my desk pretending to work hard. Wondering what the other cubicle bees are doing with their time as they pretend to be working hard. Sometimes I do spread sheets that people tell me are useful. Measuring. Counting. Once in a while Ill grab lunch at the bodega or at #mcdonalds and Ill notice how the employees there work so much harder than I do. Most of them are bi-lingual. They probably work harder in an hour than I do in a day. I sit at a desk in front of a computer, so my job is really important. Smart phone. Smart TV. Smart car. Smart house. We are smart. When I get out of work I walk to the subway with all the other worker bees leaving their jobs. The sidewalks are buzzing with people heading this way and that. Its important to walk fast to wherever it is youre going. Its important to go where youre going and for everyone else to go where theyre going. Thinking about where youre going is time wasted when you could be getting to where youre going. Be careful if you smile at other people, they may see it as a threat. At rush hour there is always a man on the corner near the subway with a sign that says Jesus Loves You. His eyes are intense. He doesnt seem to be in a rush to get anywhere. I love to learn. I love to read. I mostly hated school. Some of the most intelligent, interesting, and creative people I knew were dropouts. School was useful for teaching us that life is about measurement and performance and specialization and commodification. Your peers are your competition. Things like empathy and imagination and cooperation are hard to measure. Theyre non-linear. School doesnt like them. Prison population is something we can measure. There are more black men in prison today than there were enslaved at the time the Civil War began. There are 2.3 million Americans in Prison. America is the home of the Free and the Brave. There was a pretty young woman at the register at the bookstore. She told me that she was a huge fan of the Nabokov stories I was buying. Said she loved the way he plays with language and meaning. She reached to give me a bag for the book and I told her I didn't really need one. She apologized and smiled and said that she must have asked me about a bag already. I told her that she hadn't. She blushed. I asked her her name. I asked her for her number. Later I sent her a message. Maybe I could take her out for a drink sometime. Smiley face emoji. I never got a response. Connecting with people is hard. Social media. Social. Media. We are social. We connect with our screens. Social media connects us to what is important. Likes, upvotes, retweets, friend requests, updates, notifications. That friendly buzzzzzz from your smart phone. It feels good to be social. Dopamine. Remember - Your brand matters. Everyone is watching. Technology makes the world better. Technology solves problems, especially problems created by other technology. If new technologies create problems, the solution is to develop newer technologies to solve those problems. Technology and progress are the same thing. Technology helps the economy grow. When technology makes human beings obsolete, that is progress. Sometimes it seems that we relate to our machines better than we relate to each other. One in sixty-eight children in America is diagnosed with autism. Autism is characterized by impaired social interaction, impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. I feel like my job isnt actually about doing anything. Success is really about making it look like what you do is important. Lying to yourself to tell yourself that what you do is important. Teamwork and cooperation are actively discouraged at work. No one knows what anyone else does, but supposedly what everyone does is important. Stare into your computer screen. Do we live in a world where success is about manipulating our fellow human beings? #winning One day after work I saw an old woman on the subway with a young girl sleeping at her side. The woman was sewing a scarf. Sometimes people are good to each other. Sometimes the small things in life can be incredibly beautiful. Once in a while happiness will come when Im not searching for it. I wish I had a girlfriend. Someone I could talk to without feeling like Im lying to myself. People around me are growing up. Getting married. Having kids. Settling into life. My conscience is at war with my culture. One day I took a train out of the city. I took some molly. I was hoping to escape the traps of language. I needed nature. I needed art. I was looking for something that wasnt for sale. Our culture destroys connection. Alienation is endemic to the system. Nobody knows anybody, nobody knows themselves. We blame and ridicule anyone who reflects the fear that is hidden within ourselves. Those who are suffering the most  the poor, the homeless, the drug addicts, the crazy, the uneducated. Anyone with a political ideology different from our own. Organic human interaction doesnt exist, all that matters is your ability to sell and your ability to consume. Smile for #instagram, smile for #facebook. Image is everything. Human beings are commodities. We stare into screens, selling ourselves to each other. We desperately hang on for a sense of meaning and purpose to a culture which is destroying the ecosystems that we depend on for life. A culture which transforms our deep emotional need for meaning and connection into a deep emotional need for products. In 2015 there were 33,000 deaths in America from heroin and prescription opioids. These drugs are pain killers. Pain. Killers. What pain are we trying to kill? Some of the best people I know are chronic drug users, some of them functional, some of them not so much. What does it mean to be a human being? Once I got so lonely that I was no longer myself. I was the hive. The people moving to and fro, the traffic, the ambulances, the delivery boys on their bicycles, the junkies, the couples hand in hand on the sidewalks, the children and dogs playing in the park, the street festivals, the subway cars rumbling through their tunnels. It was all me. The sounds of the city are music. Everything is frequency. Its buzzing. Rather than acknowledging and sharing our pain and fear, using vulnerability to connect, we project onto each other. We revert to tribalism. Tribalism and hatred increase when our communities are our screens. Morality and empathy function differently in this environment. There is only the tribe and the Other. The safe space and the enemy. Stronger Together. Im With Her. Make America Great Again. #BackLivesMatter #BlueLivesMatter Advertising is our culture. #hastag your tribe. I miss my sister. I miss my whole family. Including my extended family that I dont really know. Sometimes I think that humans arent really supposed to behave like bees in a hive and that we are actually designed to live close to our families and our friends and work close to where we live. Maybe work and life and culture and happiness arent supposed to be separate things. Commute is a silly word. Theres a hope somewhere deep down that we actually need each otherthat people are worth it. As a straight, college educated, white male, I sometimes feel that Im not allowed to be upset about the world we live in, Im not allowed to be hurt by it. I need to #checkmyprivilege. Maybe I just need more drugs. Its important for us to be living in a state of constant consumption. After all, what are we if were not consumers? What does it mean to be a human being? Sex sells. Sex is a good product. Orgasms can be counted. How many people have you fucked? I dont know how to have a genuinely vulnerable emotional connection with another human being. What happens after the orgasm? Connecting with someone who you hope to have an intimate and beautiful relationship with is about selling yourself. Always remember: You Are A PRODUCT. Make sure you have a great profile pic. Its important to start out with a clever user name. Never start with your real name. This is advertising, people dont want to know the real you. Make sure you look sexy at all times. Ugliness doesnt sell. Swipe your way to happiness. True love is a click away. Everyones there. An entire city. A busy hive. Drugs are Good drugs when society says theyre Good drugs. Good drugs are legal, Bad drugs are illegal. Good people Hate president Trump. Its important to have socially acceptable outlets for channeling negative emotions when living in an oppressive culture. Ridiculing and making fun of Trump and his supporters is something we can all do together and share in the fun. Is it possible that Trump supporters might be human beings too? Is it possible that hatred is just fear and pain turned outward? Hows your social media presence? What does it mean to have presence? where am I when I have #presence? Presence; noun; The state or fact of being present; current existence or occurrence. Science and technology allow us to track and influence the behavior of massive numbers of human beings. The entire hive. How does the swarm function? Humans can be tracked by consumption habits and behavior predicted and influenced using algorithms. The more data there is the more accurate the predictions. Eventually feedback loops from past behavior can be used to influence future behavior. What we consume tells us who we are and who we will be. #hashtag it. Humans are just numbers after all. Numbers that can be measured, counted, commodified. Tech and big data are amazing. Its really great they way the tech industry helps our economy. Why judge people by the content of their character when there are statistics and algorithms? More products to help the economy grow. What does it mean to be a human being? After the Civil War, the former slaves were free to make their way in this home of the Free and the Brave. In Florida and other parts of the south, during the reconstruction period, it was common for freed slaves to be thrown in jail for no other reason than the fact that they didnt have work. Once there, they were forced into chain gangs to build railroads and other infrastructure projects. Many of them died due to terrible conditions and over-work. Railroads were important because they brought industry and technology and economic growth. Economic progress makes the world better. Every once in a while the screens get turned off. I get the rare chance to talk with friends or co-workers away from the screens and outside of the office environment and I have the impression that they are genuinely interested in having a positive impact in the world and in their community. Why do I feel so alienated at work, and in life? Why are we so disconnected in a world of constant connection? It has something to do with the system, the wider culture. Culture is powerful. Worker bees working, the rhythms of the hive. A beautiful fall day in Central Park. An oasis amidst the concrete. The wind blows through the trees, leaves shimmering in the sun. Fractals. The individual elements reflect structural patterns of the whole. A beehive is an amazing thing. We cant understand the hive by looking at the behavior of an individual bee, yet the combined behavior of the bees create a new phenomenon that is more than the sum of its parts  the hive. Swarming is like a cultural phenomenon of the hive. It is a pattern of the hive reflected in the bees. The heroin addict reflects our culture of addiction. The cancer patient reflects our pathological attachment to endless growth. The autistic child reflects a society in which we have lost the ability to empathize, lost the ability to feel. We relate more to machines than to each other and to the earth. A black man murdered in the street reflects a culture in which human life is a just a number. Humans are products. A salesman for president is a reflection of us. It shows us who we are. The art of the deal. President. Salesman. Dont forget that youre for sale. Everyones watching. I dont have a single person that I feel I can talk to about things that matter to me. I dont have a single relationship where I feel I can be comfortable being myself, where I feel understood. Attempts that I make to connect are met with rejection. I fail over and over and over again. The relationships I do have are superficial. Why am I so broken? Sometimes I think that I might have something positive to offer. The personalities that thrive in the modern world are those that embody the traits of psychopathy. Rapid turnover in interpersonal relationships. Lack of any real need for a sense of community or place. Focus on the superficial and image based forms of communication as opposed to depth and nuance. Lack of empathy. Commoditized, fragmented, specialized and depersonalized interactions with others and with the planet. We are all engulfed in this culture. There arent any good guys or bad guys. Causality is non-linear. Were all guilty. We are a society in which the ability to consume is our highest virtue and being poor is a moral failure. Poor people hate themselves and each other for being poor and worship rich people for being rich. Rich people hate themselves just as much as poor people, if not more so. Can you ever consume enough to create an identity? What does it mean to be a human being? Technology, screens and financial capital. Fossil fuels. Endless War. Drone Strikes. 150 to 200 of the species that make up the biosphere of planet earth go extinct every single day. 2,220,300 people incarcerated in the United States of America. Home of the Free and the Brave. Does the bee comprehend the nature of the hive? There are 7.442 billion human beings on planet earth. The individual human brain does not work with those kinds of numbers. We cant relate to 7,442,000,000. 7,442,000,000 are not faces that we know. 7,442,000,000 is not connected to place. The way we make sense of 7,442,000,000is as a product. A product to be exploited and used for all that its worth and then discarded a long with the rest of the natural world. Success in our culture, in the industrial juggernaut that we call our economy, comes from the ability to manipulate the largest number of human beings, from figuring out and implementing the most efficient ways of turning human beings and the planet into a #commodity. # hashtag#hastag#hashtag#meme#meme#meme#imageiseverything#cultureisadvertisement#artisproduct#loveisproduct Shorten your thoughts so your mind doesnt wander into the darkness beyond tomorrow. # iamreallyhappy # productsmakemhappy"
66,vulnerability,conspiracy,The 8 Steps of Ritual Defamation executed perfectly on Judge K by the Demoncrats,1,9krv55,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9krv55/the_8_steps_of_ritual_defamation_executed/,2018-10-03 01:59:18,"Yes, there is something called Ritual Defamation and It has 8 distinct features that the Democrats very effectively applied to Brett Kavanaugh. It is generally used by totalitarian regimes to deter any type of opposition to the ruling elite. The method of attack in a ritual defamation is to assail the character of the victim. . . Character assassination is its primary tool. In 1990, a Kansan civil liberties advocate named [Laird Wilcox](URL wrote an excellent and cogent essay entitled [The Practice of Ritual Defamation](URL The essay provides a major public service. It clarifies the mechanics of ritual defamation and lists its eight primary features. Its a short must-read for any citizen with a shred of goodwill. Please read [the whole thing](URL and check out the Kansas University Librarys [free speech collectio](URL named after him. We should all learn to detect the features of ritual defamation and call foul whenever we see them. If you dont know what they are, learn them now. Its a matter of self-defense. It will put much of what youve seen over the past few weeks in a new and deeply disturbing light, because ritual defamation by whim will only spread if not stopped. Lets begin. Wilcoxs definition of defamation is as follows: \*\*\*\****Defamation*** **is the destruction or attempted destruction of the reputation, status, character or standing in the community of a person or group of persons by unfair, wrongful, or malicious speech or publication. For the purposes of this essay, the central element is defamation in retaliation for the real or imagined attitudes, opinions or beliefs of the victim, with the intention of silencing or neutralizing his or her influence, and/or making an example of them so as to discourage similar independence and insensitivity or non-observance of taboos.** The idea is not only to prevent Kavanaughs influence, but to prevent anybody qualified and like-minded from serving. Next, a condensed explanation of the qualifier ritual: **Ritual defamationis ritualistic because it follows a predictable, stereotyped pattern which embraces a number of elements, as in a ritual.** 1. **In a** ***ritual defamation*** **the victim must have violated a particular taboo in some way, usually by expressing or identifying with a forbidden attitude, opinion or belief.** No question about it, Democrats have taboos. You and I and everyone must hold certain attitudes, opinions, and beliefs in strict accordance with theirs. In their minds, Judge Kavanaugh has violated these taboos. His potential stance on abortion and reversing *Roe v. Wade* is really just the tip of the iceberg for them. Yes, abortion is a sacred cow to the Dems, but they know that even if *Roe* is reversed, abortion would remain legal in practically all of the states. (Footnote: Kavanaugh seems to have also violated their taboo on sexual abstinence, a highly punishable offense in their eyes.) But mostly they consider Kavanaugh guilty because he reveres the U.S. Constitution as the law of the land and the protections it guarantees to individuals. As a federalist, he would believe that unbridled centralized government power goes against the letter and spirit of the Constitution. That is *the* forbidden attitude that the Democrats seem to believe justifies their ritual defamation of Kavanaugh. 2. **The method of attack in a** ***ritual defamation*** **is to assail the character of the victim. . .** ***Character assassination*** **is its primary tool.** Indeed. The character assassination has been non-stop. Kavanaugh went from Boy Scout to serial rapist literally overnight. 3. **An important rule in** ***ritual defamation*** **is to avoid engaging in any kind of debate over the truthfulness or reasonableness of what has been expressed, only condemn it. .. . . The primary goal of a** ***ritual defamation*** **is** ***censorship*** **and** ***repression***\*\*.\*\* Yes, the last thing totalitarians are interested in is arriving at the truth. Lost in the muck is any reasoned debate about Kavanaughs views. Indeed, the purpose of assassinating his character is to associate these views with sexual perversion and hypocrisy, i.e., to censor and repress him and those with similar views. No one is permitted to express doubt or ask for any evidence. If you do, well, youre a vicious woman-hating, right-wing, good for nothing, blah blah blah. 4. **The victim is often somebody in the public eye  someone who is vulnerable to public opinion  although perhaps in a very modest way. It could be a schoolteacher, writer, businessman, minor official, or merely an outspoken citizen. Visibility enhances vulnerability to** ***ritual defamation***\*\*.\*\* So you dont need to be a nominee to the Supreme Court to suffer from ritual defamation. At root, the treatment of Judge Kavanaugh is meant to be an example of how youyes, youwill be crucified too if you ever express a taboo opinion. Many will choose to lay low to avoid such treatment. But thats the whole idea, because it means giving in to the bullying, and thereby allowing repression and censorship to grow. This enhances the trickle-down effect of ritual defamation, so that any unknown can get victimized for expressing an opinion considered tabooi.e., politically incorrectby bullies. 5. **An attempt, often successful, is made to involve others in the** ***defamation***\*\*. In the case of a public official, other public officials will be urged to denounce the offender. In the case of a student, other students will be called upon, and so on.\*\* Any nay vote on Kavanaugh from Republicans would suffice here as involving them in the defamation. Weak Republican senators such as Jeff Flake, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins were always ripe for the picking, and having the show trial, complete with the optics of a soft-spoken victim who needs no evidence, certainly helps to pull such Republicans into the defamation process. And we all know that bully-like swarming is the order of the day, whether in person or on social media. By the way, doesnt this September 26 photo taken in a basement corridor of the U.S. Capitol look like Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein applying pressure to Republican Murkowski, who was said to be wavering on voting for Kavanaugh? Anyway, the Dems have also been quite effective in stirring up the mob during the early confirmation hearings, orchestrating many loud and circus-like disruptions while Kavanaugh spoke. 6. **In order for a** ***ritual defamation*** **to be effective, the victim must be** ***dehumanized*** **to the extent that he becomes identical with the offending attitude, opinion or belief, and in a manner which distorts it to the point where it appears at its most extreme.** Id say that just calling someone a rapist on whim is a pretty good example of this. Or suggesting hes a killer, in order to cast him as a monster. Its all meant to dehumanize. 7. **Also to be successful, a** ***ritual defamation*** **must bring pressure and humiliation on the victim from every quarter, including family and friends. If the victim has school children, they may be taunted and ridiculed as a consequence of adverse publicity. If they are employed, they may be fired from their job. If the victim belongs to clubs or associations, other members may be urged to expel them.** No question, this is happening as part of the smear job being inflicted on Kavanaugh. We dont know what his children may have suffered, but the adverse publicity certainly creates pressure on the family. Even though his family remains loyal to him, those running the smear machine have been tirelessly trying to dig up any of his associates or friends who might join in the smears to add to the demoralization. Political correctness already had the ball rolling on such tactics. Consider the hit job on Brendan Eich of Mozilla. Or Googles hit job on its employee James Damore. Or the firing of Kevin Williamson from The Atlantic. All were basically mob hits meant to publicly punish with adverse publicity, in order to intimidate all people from expressing their opinions. 8. **Any explanation the victim may offer, including the claim of being misunderstood, is considered irrelevant. To claim truth as a defense for a politically incorrect value, opinion or belief is interpreted as defiance and only compounds the problem.** ***Ritual defamation*** **is often not necessarily an issue of being wrong or incorrect but rather of insensitivity and failing to observe social taboos.** In the smearing of Kavanaugh we can identify all of these elements of ritual defamation. Lets not forget this fact: Judge Kavanaugh is being defamed primarily because he really believes in the U.S. Constitution. If he was willing to kowtow to Dems and rewrite the Constitution consistent with leftist views, Democrats would have no problem whatsoever confirming him to the Supreme Court. The previous ritual defamation of Justice Clarence Thomas involves another layer of taboo in the eyes of the Democrat elite: independent thought. Thomas provided the best description of the Democrats real reason for defaming him during his 1991 confirmation hearings: It is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas, and it is a message that unless you kowtow to an old order, this is what will happen to you. You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the U.S. Senate rather than hung from a tree. Of course, Kavanaugh also deigns to think for himself, and conservative so-called white males have been out of fashion for some time now. [URL"
67,vulnerability,conspiracy,Facebook and the Leipzig Connection,1,9mp4wf,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9mp4wf/facebook_and_the_leipzig_connection/,2018-10-10 00:27:39,"Sean Parker, the founding president of Facebook, gave [interviewers](URL a very honest inside look at how FB purposely seeks out to hook and potentially hurt our brains. The technique they use is something out of U. Leipzig. A process of training humans to perform predictive tasks. Not unlike training monkey's and dogs. This process of educating children is systematic, very through and very dangerous. William Wundt, professor of philosophy at University of Leipzig, Germany, 1875 was the founder of experimental psychology. Wundt was convinced that perception and experiences could be understood through measurable physiological reactions. Soon after his arrival at Leipzig Wundt established the worlds first psychological laboratory. His approach was to gather data concerning physiological responses in order to understand how the individual experienced feeling and sensation. Wundt believed that man was devoid of spirit and self-determinism. He set out to prove that man was the summation of the experiences which intrude upon his consciousness and unconsciousness. Quite simply put, a young child in early development had a blank mind that could be programmed easily by outside stimuli. Sean Parker says this about the intention of the FB platform. ""When Facebook was getting going, I had these people who would come up to me and they would say, 'I'm not on social media.' And I would say, 'OK. You know, you will be.' And then they would say, 'No, no, no. I value my real-life interactions. I value the moment. I value presence. I value intimacy.' And I would say, ... 'We'll get you eventually.'"" ""I don't know if I really understood the consequences of what I was saying, because \[of\] the unintended consequences of a network when it grows to a billion or 2 billion people and ... it literally changes your relationship with society, with each other ... It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways. God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains."" ""The thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook being the first of them, ... was all about: 'How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?'"" ""And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever.

68,vulnerability,conspiracy,"The Subjugation of Evil - In the esoteric Japanese tradition, subduing the external evils of the world as well as the inner evils of ones own mind is a central element of practice.",32,9boa0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9boa0o/the_subjugation_of_evil_in_the_esoteric_japanese/,2018-08-31 08:57:36,"URL The esoterica of Buddhism. Secret society's philosophies are often discussed in the conspiracy realm. &gt;In the Summer 2005 issue of Tricycle, the eminent scholar of religion Elaine Pagels spoke of how historical study can enrich spiritual life in the present: Historical study should have the effect of making what is very familiar look different or even in some ways strange. . . . The idea of historical contingency can be very threatening. But it is important, because it fosters a broader, less sectarian view. Since then, Professor Pagelss observations have influenced Tricycles editorial approach in more ways and on more occasions than we could ever have imagined. They have certainly factored significantly in our series of essays on esoteric Buddhism in Japan. This essay is the third and final piece in the series, and it does not shy away from challenging some popular and familiar notions about Buddhism. &gt;Right off the bat, the very topic of Eric Swansons essaythe subjugation of obstructionsmay strike a jarring note to Buddhist ears. The highly aggressive language can sound just so un-Buddhist, appearing as it does to contradict commonly held attitudes associated with Buddhist practice. Furthermore, subjugation practices, which can apply to obstructions both inner and outer, are not merely incidental; rather, they lie at the core of one of East Asian Buddhisms most influential traditions. Did our East Asian ancestors simply lose their way? Did they succumb to delusions presented under the banner of an authentic buddhadharma? Did they, in taking up subjugation practices, mark the dharmas decline? &gt;But as the following essay shows, there is more to it than cursory observations would tell us. In the below article, the Buddhist scholar Eric Swanson asserts that foundational principles of Mahayana Buddhism laid the groundwork for esoteric practices, which are simply upaya (skillful means) for applying those principles to greatest effect. Swanson argues that, however unfamiliar subjugation practices may appear to modern Western eyes, they constitute, in their proper framework, a potent (though admittedly not unproblematic) means for realizing Mahayana values on which they are based and with which they are, in their specific way, interwoven. &gt;*It is our hope that in Swansons exploration of the practice and the inner logic of esoteric subjugation practices the reader will find, as Professor Pagels encourages, that some of what was familiar is made strange. And in turn, perhaps one will find that some things that at first appear strange may in the end be unexpectedly familiar. &gt;*Andrew Cooper, Features Editor* &gt;From 2008 to 2010, I lived on Mount Koya at the temple complex founded in the 9th century by Japans most venerated master of esoteric Buddhism, Kukai, or as he is known honorifically, Kobo Daishi. Mount Koya is a revered pilgrimage site as well as the spiritual and administrative home of the Shingon school, which developed largely out of the tantric secret teachings that Kukai brought back to Japan from China. One day I had occasion to engage in a most intriguing conversation with a monk with whom I had come to be good friends and who had impressed me with the seriousness of his practice as well as his knowledge of the esoteric tradition. &gt;In the course of our discussion, I asked my monk friend what he considered to be the most definitive characteristics of the esoteric Buddhist teachings. I thought I knew, in a general way, what he would say. I expected that he would talk about such core principles as attaining enlightenment in this very body or the practice of mastering the three mysteries of a buddhas body, speech, and mind or the preaching of the dharmakaya, the ultimate reality that is free of all form. To my surprise, his response did not touch on any of these or other such ideas. More surprising still was what he did say. My friend explained, with rather ardent enthusiasm, that what differentiated the esoteric Buddhist tradition from other Buddhist denominations in Japan was that it was the best equipped with the ritual mechanisms to destroy evil and all enemies that obstruct the Buddhist lawthat is, the buddhadharma. &gt;This response was disconcerting, to say the least, and it has stuck with me ever since. The monks words and demeanor attuned me to an apparently violent rhetoric that is found not infrequently within the esoteric Buddhist tradition, and I wanted to better understand the role and the meaning of the traditions notion of the subjugation of evil. As I pursued the matter, in fact, it became evident that teachings on subjugation factored quite prominently within the esoteric tradition and were a driving force in its development throughout its long history in Japan. &gt;Esoteric Buddhist subjugation rituals are best understood as upaya, expedient means that can, through the subduing of internal and external obstructions, guide the practitioner to awakening. Essential to this, however, is a clear and sustained contemplation of bodhicitta, the practitioners aspiration to attain enlightenment in order to save all sentient beings from the suffering of samsara. The cultivation of bodhicitta complements rituals of subjugation and is to be practiced simultaneously with them: the goal is realization of the Mahayana idea of the equality of all mindsthat is, that all beings, including oneself, are fundamentally of the same nature as the Buddha. The rituals that were performed for the subjugation and forceful conversion of political enemies, criminal enterprises such as piracy, and vengeful spirits also operated under this framework, in that these rituals were not performed simply for the sake of conquest. Rather, they were seen as falling under the Buddhist ideal of actualizing peaceboth internally in the mind of the practitioner and externally in the social-political realmto support the awakening of oneself along with the awakening of all beings. &gt;Subjugation practice is admittedly a thorny and complex matter, one that has long been a source of confusion and even condemnation. One consequence of this is that study of the esoteric traditions teachings and rituals associated with subjugation is frequently neglected both by scholars and by practitioners of other Buddhist schools. I have found, however, that upon close examination the esoteric practice of subjugation is solidly grounded in the fundamental principles of Mahayana Buddhism and that it is, to its adherents, a valid and effective means of realizing Mahayanas highest values and goals. &gt;To adequately understand subjugation in esoteric Buddhism we need to view it not merely as a sign of a decline into superstition or an aberration of Buddhist thought, though it often is dismissed in just that way. Neither can it be reduced to a means of pandering to patrons, gaining worldly power, or gratifying harmful impulses. From the perspective of the sincere and dedicated ritual practitioner, the subjugation of evil is a central element of esoteric Buddhist practice that is directly connected to the goal of achieving enlightenment in this very body. This does not absolve subjugation practice from the potentially dangerous implications of its violent rhetoric and the risk that it could be manipulated to justify very real forms of violence. Indeed, it is worth recognizing that the esoteric Buddhist tradition conceptualized subjugation in a manner that resists any simple or unambiguous explanation. We live in a time of all sorts of ambiguity, and it can be tempting to shrink from the discomfiting uncertainty that ambiguity often calls forth. Furthermore, it is easy to condemn or even demonize what may be nothing more than difference, and it is difficult to discern the limited understanding or self-interest one may hold that informs such judgments. &gt;A look at the early years of Japans esoteric traditions shows that rituals of subjugation were employed to help appease various forms of social and political anxieties held by patrons of Buddhist institutions. It is perhaps no coincidence that we start to see the proliferation of subjugation in the 10th century, a time replete with natural disasters of drought and famine, vulnerability to piracy at the island nations shores, growing concern about political tensions in the neighboring Korean peninsula, and renewed historical memory of the fall of Chinas Tang empire. Historical records and diaries composed around this time indicate the establishment of various ritual forms aimed at dispelling malevolent forces and retaining social order. Perhaps the best-known example of this use of ritual concerns the response to the rebellion of Taira no Masakado. &gt;In 939, Masakado, a powerful landlord in the eastern regions of Japan, led a rebellion against the imperial family in the Heian capital (modern-day Kyoto). Tales of Masakados life describe him as an evil demon whose selfish, malicious deeds were a direct threat to the peace of the realm. According to some accounts, the Shingon monk Kancho was sent eastward from the capital to deal with the unrest caused by Masakado. On Narita mountain, Kancho established a small goma (fire ritual) hall, where he performed a subjugation ritual using an auspicious statue of the wrathful protector Fudo Myoo, carved by Kukai himself. It is said that subsequently Masakado was successfully subdued and killed in battle. While the story is not reliable as accurate history, it does illustrate how subjugation rituals would have been employed to provide protection from enemies that threatened social disorder. The depiction of those who stood up against the central authority as evil beings that needed to be eliminated through the use of esoteric Buddhist rituals became a recurring theme in various forms of Japanese literature. &gt;From more reliable historical records, we learn that another protective figure, Daigensui Myoo, was employed in response to news of the Masakado rebellion. Ritual manuals and images of Daigensui Myoo were imported from China by the Shingon monk Jogyo (d. 867), and subjugation rituals were performed multiple times until the rebellion was subdued in 940. In the Catalogue of Imported Items that was submitted to the court upon his return from China, Jogyo claimed that if the ruler and his ministers would revere Daigensui Myoo in particular, there would be no further threats from evil thieves; they would be victorious against enemies of the state; and the land would be at peace. In other words, the allure of subjugation effectively drew patrons to support esoteric Buddhist institutions, helping it flourish in its early years. &gt;Scholarly skepticism of the important role of subjugation rituals is often supported with the idea that these rituals represented a decline in the progress of Japanese Buddhist thought and that they were, in the main, forms of magic designed to exploit Buddhist patrons by promising worldly benefits. Although it is undeniable that the anticipated subjugation of perceived external evils often did elicit patronage, we should not readily assume that practitioners of these esoteric Buddhist rituals were involved in corrupting or devaluing what are widely accepted as the true core teachings of the buddhadharma. In fact, in most cases subjugation rituals were developed based on close study of authoritative texts within the tradition, including the Mahavairocana Sutra, the Sarvatathagata-tattvasamgraha Sutra, and the Susiddhikara Sutra, as well as various ritual texts that were then being imported to Japan from China. Engaging their traditions important treatises allowed practitioners to find ways of applying notions of subjugation as an effective response to rising social and political anxieties while simultaneously providing a doctrinal basis that helped frame these ritual forms within Buddhist notions of salvation and enlightenment. &gt;It would, of course, be naive to suggest that subjugation rituals were immune to misuse. Placing subjugation practice in a context of Buddhist values does not free it from ethical or moral issues. Indeed, these esoteric practices were actively presented as a tool to eliminate ones enemies, and the allure of power to subdue or even destroy those who stood in opposition to ones worldly goals undoubtedly had much appeal to potential patrons and drew their support. &gt;Subjugation has long been held as a hallmark feature of esoteric Buddhism. But it does not stand by itself. Rather, it was incumbent on practitioners of these rituals to clarify the ways in which subjugation related to the fundamental Buddhist issues of awakening and compassion. In this sense, one could say that ritual subjugation was negotiated within the esoteric tradition and continued to evolve as its teachings were put into practice, responding to the ever-changing social and political climate. The process of integrating the appeal of subjugation with foundational Buddhist values is complex and precarious, and the ways it has been worked at and articulated comprise an important aspect of Japanese religious history. The importance of the process of grounding esoteric rituals with primary Buddhist values should not be taken lightly; neither should it be dismissed as something belonging only in the past. As suggested by the words of my monk friend, the allure of subjugation remains strong in the minds of monks in the esoteric Buddhist tradition to this day. &gt;In the esoteric Buddhist tradition, the functioning of the subjugation of evil is personified by the wrathful figures in the pantheon called myoo, or in Sanskrit vidyaraja (wisdom king). The myoo are manifestations of cosmic buddhas or bodhisattvas and are endowed with the ability to subdue and eliminate obstructions, whether internal or external, in order to bring beings to awakening and to recover and maintain harmony in the social realm. Like mantras, subjugation rituals invoking myoo figures function as skillful means to dispel the darkness of ignorance. &gt;Among the various forms of the myoo figure, Fudo Myoo (immovable wisdom king) has long been of central importance. The Commentary of the Mahavairocana Sutra, composed by the Chinese master Yixing (683727), is one of the most influential treatises in the development of Japanese esoteric Buddhism. The treatise gives particular emphasis to Fudo, the wrathful manifestation of the cosmic buddha Mahavairocana, the primordial buddha in the esoteric traditions of East Asia. Fudo is said to be the personification of the power of mantra to subjugate rebellious beings. Fudo Myoo is also the main figure invoked in the fire ritual, or goma, a core element of Shingon, which is performed to destroy negative energies and bring benefit to individuals, the realm, and all sentient beings. The goma is frequently practiced at Buddhist temples to this day. &gt;In Japan, Fudo Myoo is depicted either sitting or standing on a rock base, holding a noose in his left hand and a sword in his right hand. Such iconographic elements serve to represent his function as a subjugator not only of mental obstructions but also of malicious beings who oppose the Buddhist teachings. Through Fudos wrathful stare obstructers of the buddhadharma are subdued, tied down with the noose, and struck with the sword of wisdom, forcing the subjugated being into a state of enlightenment. &gt;Although this use of violent force may appear to be contrary to the dharma, Yixings Commentary explains that these acts of subjugation are undertaken out of compassion. Whereas buddhas and bodhisattvas are usually positioned on a lotus flower as a sign of their enlightenment, Fudo is positioned on a rock base, a visual expression of his unwavering determination to postpone his own enlightenment until after he successfully directs all other sentient beings to enlightenment. Fudos use of force is justified by his vow to save even the most malicious of beings and is thus understood as the most profound expression of Buddhist compassion. &gt;A ritual treatise attributed to the 9th-century Tendai monk Annen, the Definitive Secret Teachings of the Holy Immovable One, offers a sense of how the rituals associated with the Fudo Myoo were conceptualized in 10th century Japan, the time when subjugation rituals began to proliferate. The Definitive Secret clearly states that the ritual practice associated with Fudo Myoo can be, or rather should be, employed both for the self-cultivation of the practitioner and to deal with various forms of obstructions in the mundane world. Examples of the latter include a rulers loss of rank, disloyalty on the part of ministers and officials, and the causing of social disruption mundane obstructions that would certainly have resonated in the anxious political and social climate of the time. &gt;While the Definitive Secret advocates the application of Fudo Myoo rites as a remedy for social ills, it equally stresses that the purpose of the practices associated with Fudo is to enable practitioners to protect and preserve bodhicitta by cutting away the practitioners various internal vexations. The treatise claims that through the practice of the three secret activities of body (forming mudras, or symbolic hand gestures), speech (recitation of mantras), and mind (contemplation of Fudo Myoo) one is able to attain union with him and thus remove obstacles and achieve immediate enlightenment. &gt;Yixings Commentary further explains that a practitioner should, through the employment of mantras and mudras, contemplate oneself as none other than Fudo, enacting subjugation wrathfully by stepping down on the head of the source of obstruction. By embodying Fudo, one can, through affective engagement, dispel all obstructions. At the same time, however, the Commentary teaches that these obstacles are caused by ones own mind, and specifically that it is the mental afflictions of stinginess and greed accumulated over infinite previous lifetimes that are the root cause of the arising of obstructions. &gt;The Commentary describes the enlightenment experience as the realization that all mindsones own mind, the mind of the Buddha, and the mind of all sentient beingsare equal. Perhaps this is why the removal of obstructions is not confined to the internal realm of ones own negative karma but also includes the negative karma shared by all sentient beings. The Commentary also speaks of the dynamic activity of the cosmic buddha Maha-vairocana, in which all beings are seen as none other than the extension of Mahavairocana. In a sense, these two perspectives are complementary: to understand all beings as being equal is to see all beings as part of the cosmic buddhas activity. The one who is engaged in the act of saving (the practitioner) is the same as the one who needs to be saved (another being). They are one and the same. Internally things work much the same. In the context of esoteric Buddhist ritual, there is ultimately no distinction between self (the practitioner who is engaged in the act of subjugation) and other (the obstacles that must be subjugated). &gt;In the Commentary, Fudo is an expression of a view of bodhicitta that is much like the notion of the radical interconnectedness of all beings put forth in the Avatamsaka Sutra. Bodhicitta is also described as formless and like space. Embodying bodhicitta in the esoteric sense allows the practitioner to realize the nondiscriminatory naturethe equalityof all beings. Without the understanding of equality, subjugation is in danger of simply being a violent act aimed at destruction of the other. Only when subjugation is predicated on understanding the equality of all beings and sustained by the aspiration to lead all beings to liberation is it authenticated as a true Mahayana Buddhist practice."

Russias guilt is such an article of faith among our political class, that a Republican-controlled Congress imposed [sanctions](URL and President Trump signed on, substantially worsening relations with an important and potentially dangerous nation. &gt;Outside the Acela Corridor, however, one finds more skepticism. &gt;A lot of ordinary folks wonder why the DNC wouldnt let any outside parties examine their server. Instead, the FBI accepted the word of CrowdStrike, a private contractor hired by the DNC, without any independent confirmation. &gt;And a bunch of not so ordinary folks who know a thing or two about computers thinks there may be a simple explanation for the DNCs unwillingness to let outsiders have a peek at the evidence: There isnt any. The Russian hacking thats caused so much division and turmoil at home and abroad never really happened.

Much, but by no means all, of Carters evidence is technical. And hes unquestionably found an inconsistency in the Russia narrative that ought to raise doubts in even the most computer illiterate congressmans mind. &gt;**Julian Assanges Threat** &gt;But first, why on earth would a private contractor hired by the DNC engage in such tactics? For motive, we need to go back to June 12, 2016, when Wikileaks founder Julian Assange made an announcement that was sure to worry Hillary Clinton and her closest advisers: &gt;*We have upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton . . . We have emails pending publication.* &gt;A little less than three months earlier, on March 19, hostile actors had gotten ahold of all the emails in campaign chairman John Podestas main Gmail account. You may have heard that Podestas emails were hacked, but they werent. There were no faraway cyber-nerds searching for some vulnerability in the DNC network. He fell for a common spear phishing scam. A fake email from Google arrived, saying he needed to change his password and providing a link. The link was also fake. Instead of changing his password, Podesta gave it awayalong with all of his campaign emails. &gt;Whoops! &gt;The Clinton campaign learned of Podestas blunder almost immediately and must have suspected that the emails Assange was threatening to release were his. Moreover, on that date, a lot of the revelations contained therein would have been salientand not in a good way. &gt;Just six days before, with Clinton still 570 delegates short of the 2,382 needed to win the Democratic nomination, the [Associated Press](URL angered Bernie Sanders and his supporters by claiming that shed already won. [The New York Times](URL [CNN](URL [NBC](URL News, [USA Today](URL and The Washington Post all followed suit, declaring Sanders loss a fait accompli. &gt;But it wasnt. &gt;The AP arrived at its numbers by polling unpledged superdelegates, who couldnt vote until the convention and were free to change their minds or even to deceive the AP. &gt;Sanders supporters had been angry about the role superdelegates played in the nominating process for [months](URL [Sanders](URL himself complained about it just one week before Assanges announcement and a day before the media began writing his campaigns obituary: &gt;*My problem is that the process today has allowed Secretary Clinton to get the support of over 400 superdelegates before any other Democratic candidate was in the race.* &gt;The next days headlines prematurely declaring Clintons victory brought Sanders supporters long-simmering anger to a boil. His spokesman blasted the corporate medias rush to judgement: &gt;*Secretary Clinton does not have and will not have the requisite number of pledged delegates to secure the nomination. She will be dependent on superdelegates who do not vote until July 25 and who can change their minds between now and then.* &gt;For the rest of the week, the big election story was whether Sanders would exit the race gracefully and encourage his followers to forgive, forget, and rally round Hillary Clinton. But just 12 hours after Assanges announcement, [Sanders](URL emerged from a meeting with his top advisors, refusing to concede and reiterating his determination not to let the media gaslight his candidacy into a lost cause: &gt;*[W]e are going to take our campaign to the convention with the full understanding that were very good in arithmetic and that we know who has received the most votes up until now* &gt;**The Immensity of Podestas Blunder** &gt;Podestas blunder had the potential to damage Hillary Clintons already precarious reputation with voters regardless of their feelings about Bernie Sanders. In some of his pilfered emails, top Clinton advisors, including [Podesta](URL himself, insulted [her](URL [abilities](URL [and](URL her [ethics](URL commented on her [poor health](URL made disparaging remarks about [Catholics](tldrify.com/qw2), [Muslims, blacks](URL and [Latinos](tldrify.com/qw3), and complained that Clinton wanted [unaware and compliant voters.](tldrify.com/qw1) &gt;Many of Podestas emails also [contradict](URL claims made in defense of the private email server Clinton used as Secretary of State. Others reveal that the FBI investigation into the matter was [anything](tldrify.com/qw7) [but](URL [unbiased](tldrify.com/qw9). At a minimum, the emails prove the Clinton campaign [knew](URL from the beginning that she was breaking the law. &gt;Its easy to forget how serious an issue Clintons private server was on June 12, 2016, three weeks before FBI Director James Comey publicly exonerated her. A few weeks earlier, the State Department had sharply rebuked Clinton for violating department rules, generating unpleasant headlines like, [Hillary Clintons email problems just got much worse.](URL &gt;A June 1 Morning Consult [poll](URL found that about half of voters thought her private email server was illegal, unethical and a major problem, with a quarter of Democrats agreeing. Theres little question that Assanges threat would have made the poll disturbingly salient to Clinton and her top advisers. &gt;But, given Sanders supporters anger and Clintons need for their enthusiastic support to prevail against Trump, her team would have been more concerned about emails revealing her disdain for Sanders supporters and some of their most beloved progressive policies. &gt;For example, Clinton secretly opposed [gay marriage](URL and supported [fracking](tldrify.com/qwf). She and other top campaign officials regularly [insulted](URL Sanders and his supporters. Making matters worse, Podestas emails also revealed that CNN contributor [Donna Brazile](URL gave Clinton at least three questions in advance for her debates with Sanders. And an extraordinary number of emails confirm Sanders supporters suspicions that the [DNC](URL and the mainstream [media](URL were colluding with Clinton to torpedo his candidacy from its inception. &gt;But perhaps the most troubling of Podestas emails would have been those containing passages from speeches Clinton gave to Goldman Sachs and other big money outfits at $225,000 a pop. In these speeches, Clinton [downplayed](URL Wall Streets role in the 2008 recession and [said](URL big money bankers themselves are best equipped to write any necessary legislation. &gt;Clinton in those speeches also [conceded](URL that her economic fortunes put her obviously out of touch with the struggles middle-class voters face. She further [admitted](URL that she has distinct public and private positions on political issues, and [revealed](URL that she secretly favors open borders. &gt;Like the controversy over her private server, Clinton weathered this storm so well that its hard to remember how much her unreleased speeches alarmed Sanders supporters, to whom she was little more than a corporate shill. Sanders had been using Clintons speeches as a [laugh line](URL in his own [stump](URL speeches for [months:](URL &gt;*If youre going to give a speech for $225,000 its gotta be really, dont you think an extraordinarily brilliant speech, I mean why else would they pay that kind of money? . . . Must be a speech written in Shakespearean prose. So I think, if it is such a fantastic speech, the secretary should make it available to all of us.* &gt;To make matters worse, three weeks before Assanges announcement, Clinton released a mandatory financial statement that brought her Wall Street speeches to the forefront of campaign news, yielding headlines like, [How corporate America bought Hillary Clinton for $21M](URL and [The massive scale of the Clintons speech-making industry.](URL &gt;A few days later, reporters even annoyed [President Obama](URL at a G7 summit in Japan by asking him whether she ought to release her speeches. On June 1, just 11 days before Assanges announcement, a [Morning Consult](URL poll had 64 percent of voters saying she should, including two-thirds of independents and almost half of Democrats. &gt;Some readers have likely forgotten the many serious political headaches Hillary Clinton suffered in the week preceding Assanges June 12 announcement and how desperately she needed to placate Sanders angry supporters. If you werent too distracted by the Russia narrative, however, you probably remember some of the above revelations from Podestas emails that would have made doing so impossible had Assange not given Clintons camp so much time to prepare. &gt;By October 7, when Wikileaks finally began releasing Podestas emails, Democrats had been taught to tune them out by angrily reciting the mantras Putin and Russia. CNN told viewers it would be illegal for folks who didnt work for [CNN](URL or some other CNN-approved corporation to so much as look at the emails. Trump couldnt push Wikileaks because doing so immediately rebounded back at him, raising worries he might be Putins puppet, rather than reflecting poorly on Clinton. &gt;**Clinton Uses the Russia Narrative to Great Effect** &gt;Whether Adam Carter is right that the DNC hack was a ruse designed to deflect the damaging Podesta emails, there is no question Clinton and her surrogates were instantly prepared to use it for that purpose. &gt;Within hours of Assanges October 7 release, Podesta made a transparent attempt on [Twitter](URL to tie anything damaging in his emails to insidious Russian interference: &gt;*2. Im not happy about being hacked by the Russians in their quest to throw the election to Donald Trump. John Podesta (@johnpodesta)* &gt;Clinton first publicly addressed Podestas emails 12 days later in her third [debate](URL with Trump: &gt;*But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks. What is really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans. They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions. Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the internet. This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government. Clearly from Putin himself in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election. So, I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this, and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in this election.* &gt;A more transparent attempt to tie Wikileaks, espionage against Americans, Russian government, and Donald Trump to any damaging disclosures that might surface from Podestas emails would be impossible. &gt;So, by October 7 tainting Podestas emails with a Russian provenance was demonstrably the Clinton campaigns go-to strategy. But a Washington Post story about the DNC hack published two days after June 12 Assanges threat on June 12 shows the strategy was prepared much earlier. &gt;**CrowdStrikes Remarkable Announcement and Guccifer 2.0s Debut** &gt;The June 14 Washington Post article is the first time the DNC went public about the alleged Russian hack. It includes the detail that the hackers stole a file of Trump opposition research; which, though no ordinary readers could have known it at the time, would turn up [months later](URL when Wikileaks released Podestas emails. &gt;Indeed, this detail is also the articles big takeaway, as its mentioned in both the lead sentence and the headline: [Russian government hackers penetrated DNC, stole opposition research on Trump.](URL &gt;The story extensively quotes CrowdStrike President Shawn Henry, who previously headed the FBIs cybersecurity division, and Chief Technology Officer Dmitri Alperovitch; all information was provided voluntarily by CrowdStrike and the DNC. According to [Alperovitch](URL they decide[d] to go public with information about their incident and give us permission to share our knowledge. &gt;So, why did the DNC want the world to know on June 14 the embarrassing fact that the Russians had hacked their server and the content of one pilfered file? &gt;[Alperovitch](URL says they wanted to help protect even those who do not happen to be [CrowdStrike] customers. But they must have had a more self-interested motive to justify again publicly connecting Hillary Clintons name to lost emails and unsecure servers while Comeys investigation was still a very serious campaign issue. &gt;Clintons team had to suspect Assange had Podestas emails and knew the Trump opposition-research file was among them. So announcing that the Russians had stolen the file two days after Assanges threat is, in hindsight, either an incredible coincidence or the first step in a strategy to taint the damaging information in Podestas emails with Russian perfidy. &gt;But CrowdStrike and the DNC werent the only ones calling attention to the stolen Trump opposition file. The very next day, a new actor appeared, calling himself Guccifer 2.0, and claiming to be the very hacker mentioned by Alperovitch in the Washington Post story. &gt;And, to prove it, he [posted](URL 230 pages of Trump opposition research on his newly minted [blog](URL and emailed copies to [Gawker](URL and [The Smoking Gun](URL &gt;We are now supposed to think that Guccifer 2.0 was a Russian spy passing documents he hacked from the DNC server to Wikileaks. In fact, this is the only evidence that Russia hacked the DNC besides CrowdStrikes unverified examination of their server. &gt;But if G2 really is a Russian spy, Russia ought to be pitied rather than sanctioned. &gt;When he debuted taking credit for the hack mentioned in the previous days Post, G2 made no attempt to deny he was a Russian spy. Anyone reading his blog post who was also familiar with the Poststory would assume that he must be a Russian spy as it claims. Would a real Russian spy pretending to be something else connect himself to a report outing him as a Russian spy without denying it? Why would he connect himself to such a report at all? &gt;Would a real Russian spy trying to hide his identity end the second sentence in his first blog post with ))), the [symbol](URL that Russians use in place of our lol. G2 [did](URL &gt;And, would a Russian spy working with Wikileaks to discredit Hillary Clinton announce to the world that hes working with Wikileaks? G2s advertising that connection, not denying hes a Russian spy, and using Russian emoticons had the completely predictable effect of tying Assange to Putin and thus discrediting any Wikileaks releases that might otherwise have harmed Clinton. &gt;G2 denied being Russian only after it emerged that he left Russian fingerprints all over the documents he released. Odd enough by itself, given the superb operational tradecraft, [attributed](URL to him by Alperovitch. &gt;But Carter and his intrepid virtual friends examination of the fingerprints revealed that, rather than accidentally leaving them, G2 went out of his way to [plant](tldrify.com/qys) them. &gt;The first evidence of Russian involvement was found within hours of G2s June 15 debut. Someone at Gawker looked at the metadata in the files he sent and discovered the name of the founder of the Soviet secret police written in the Russian [alphabet!](URL No real Russian spy would be so careless. And if we werent so desperate for sensational news, a Gawker reporter finding evidence connecting G2 with Russian intel mere hours after his debut by itself would have raised red flags about the Russia narrative. &gt;G2 also [chose](tldrify.com/qye) to use a company based in Russia to cloak his IP address. Even then, there are plenty of email providers that would conceal the Russian IP. Yet G2, who Hillary Clinton suggested clearly took orders directly from KGB prodigy Vladimir Putin, somehow chose one that didnt. &gt;If G2 had simply done nothing, there would have been nothing connecting Wikileaks to Russia. Instead of doing nothing, he went out of his way to connect Wikileaks Clinton releases to Russian intelligence. Yet, somehow, were supposed to think he was out to hurt Clinton. And, despite [claiming](URL to be Clintons enemy, neither the Trump opposition file nor any of the other files he released with it contained anything [damaging](URL to her. &gt;So a Russian spy intent on getting Trump elected released 230 pages of damaging information on Trump but nothing negative about Hillary Clinton? &gt;Viewed in quick and haphazard slices, G2s debut may look like a collaboration with Putin and Assange. But Russian spies trying to hide their identity dont openly confess to crimes the Washington Post has attributed to Russian spies the day before. &gt;Nor do they use Russian emoticons. &gt;Nor do they reveal their connections to organizations secretly shilling for them. &gt;Nor do they intentionally plant evidence of their identity. &gt;And when Russian spies release 230 pages of negative information about Donald Trump, its Trump, and not his enemies, they are trying to harm. &gt;When we widen our view, the suggestion that G2 is a Russian spy is revealed as a naked insult to the nations intelligence. &gt;**Where Did Guccifer 2.0 Get the Trump File?** &gt;Hindsight together with Carter and crews hard work shows that G2, rather than trying to harm Clinton, worked to manufacture a fake connection between Assange and Russian intel. This fake connection would later be used by Clinton to deflect the avalanche of damaging information in Podestas emails when Assange released them. &gt;The Washington Post headline that the Russians hacked a Trump opposition document from the DNC set the stage. But the article made no mention of Assange or Wikileaks. So, considered alone, it had zero potential to discredit any damaging Wikileaks releases. &gt;G2 forged the crucial link to Assange the next day; by taking credit for the hack and claiming to have turned over the spoils to Wikileaks. His release of the Trump opposition file, which would later turn up when Wikileaks finally released Podestas emails, would also then provide confirmation for his story about being the hacker; and, as a result, strengthen the links between Putin and Assange he was creating. &gt;Absent G2 bringing Wikileaks into the picture, the Washington Post story would have informed voters of an embarrassing Russian DNC hack of some Trump opposition research, without any mitigating way to connect those Russians to Julian Assange, and thereby discrediting him. &gt;So the information released to the Post serves no purpose and, indeed, would harm Clinton, unless CrowdStrike knew G2 would immediately enter the fray and shift attention away from Russian intels breach of the DNC server and towards speculation about Russian intels connection to Wikileaks. &gt;But theres another more conclusive reason to think that G2 had to be working with CrowdStrike and Hillary Clinton. &gt;Remember, on June 15, Guccifer 2.0 emailed a Trump opposition file to [Gawker](URL and [The Smoking Gun](URL and posted it on his [blog](URL But we now know, apart from the Russian fingerprints he planted, the very same Trump opposition file was among Podestas emails when Assange released them four months later. &gt;So, how did G2 get ahold of a file from John Podestas emails? Thats what Adam Carter wants everyone to start asking. &gt;Since G2 manifestly isnt the implacable enemy of Hillary Clinton he pretended to be, its unlikely that he hacked the DNC server as claimed. And, Carter and other experts [say](URL his claims arent technically credible, anyway. &gt;Given how hard G2 worked to discredit Wikileaks, neither is it credible that he got the file through them. &gt;Without the Trump file, G2 might have just been some unconnected third-party trolling Julian Assange. But the fact that G2 possessed a file from Podestas emails seems inexplicable, given everything else we now know, unless G2 is part of a CrowdStrike disinformation campaign to protect Hillary Clinton from the consequences of John Podestas blunder. &gt;The foundations of both Robert Muellers investigation and the sanctions placed on Russia appear to have crumbled into dust. &gt;Lets hope our political class notices.

Poor health is another factor. According to a 2017 [Princeton University report](URL **about half of prime age men who are not in the labor forcemay have a serious \[physical, mental or emotional\] health condition that is a barrier to work.** A national survey cited by the Princeton researchers found that 43&amp;#37; of prime age out-of-work men perceived their health as fair or poor, compared to only 12&amp;#37; of employed men.

And it was. Footage from the announcement showed that it was basically hooked up to a refrigerator (more or less), and consumers would never be able to reach those speeds by conventional methods. This is like saying your honda civic will do 0-60 in 2s because it has a rocket strapped to it. Sure, it's that fast, but it's nowhere near practical enough for the average person to use, or even professionals who would know what to do with it. Now, I know that there are people stupid enough that shit like this happens in the business world. However, it's so blatant and amateurish. It stinks of fallout control. The bigger story is that Spectre and Meltdown continue to provide new exploits. It's an industry wide vulnerability that just gets worse and worse. Other cpu manufacturers are vulnerable as well, but Intel has been hit the hardest by far. Furthermore, it's a problem that can only solved by designing a totally new cpu architecture, which can take the better part of a decade, and they don't have one waiting in the wings to fix this. Cpu manufacturers generally design an architecture, then keep tweaking it over a decade to have more products to sell. You can get a lot of lifespan out of one design just by refining and trimming the fat. They'll add and remove things, maybe even shrink it, but it's the same basic design. Now imagine that the architecture you were going to milk for 10 years just turned into a security disaster. In order to survive as a company, intel has to basically sell vulnerable chips for years to come. There are security patches, but they come with a huge performance penalty. Class action lawsuits are coming, and coming hard, because Intel knew about these vulnerabilities for a year and stayed quiet. Think of how many millions of devices are sold with an intel chip over a year. They knowingly sold those chips without warning anyone. Not just consumers, but enterprise as well. **TL;DR** Intel played the clumsy retard to cover up an Equifax level shitshow."

WAKE UP!!!  First Preface: I tried my best to both proofread and use proper punctuation and eloquence in writing this, and also to avoid all redundancies, so I apologize for any and all difficulties in reading it.  Second Preface: Over the decades, starting as an admittedly precocious youth (absolutely unattested to by my grades in school, but thats for another time), Ive studied with zeal, and eventually with learned objectivity, a lot of weird stuff, and have experienced a lot of weird stuff, both by accident and on purpose, ranging from the quixotic, though utterly mundane, to the luminous and at other times horrific, supernatural; so I say a lot of weird things, and at times probably sound at least ignorant, and as most, ludicrous. But that popular myth, promoted even in academia and by educated professionals, that states that crazy people dont know that theyre crazy, is just not true. Believe me, Ive spent enough time over the last four years both living and interacting with crazy people at the most intimate level and experiencing craziness myself in varying degrees, both by drug use (OTC, prescription, and illegal)at times taken as prescribed and at other times flagrantly abused by alternative ROI and reckless overdosingand by the unrestrained entertainment of unhealthy, immoraland at other times mysterious and overwhelmingthoughts and feelings derived from said studies, experiences, and interactions. Eventually, in moments of shared confidence (trust, vulnerability, secrecy, catharsis) we would admit to ourselves and to others that we knew that we were crazy, and were cognitively dissident because our thoughts and feelings did not appropriately correspond with reality. This myth persists due to the sometimes irrational and at other times well-deserved fear these individuals have of the standard, Western model of perception of these individuals as being diseased, and the subsequent treatment of these individuals with mind-numbing, mood-altering, soul-inhibiting, and often brain-damaging medications, which are at timesas a lesser evilnecessary for symptom relief, but in the long-term ineffective at treating the underlying cause(s) of their problems, which are often spiritual in nature and result from some form of trauma. So these individuals often lie and learn to suffer in silence, not knowing of any spiritual solutions to their suffering. Anyway, heres an observation I want to share, and you can just ignore it if you want, and think Im crazy, because that really doesnt bother me. I know Im not, but Im compelled to help those who are, and are suffering in silence. Here we go!  - In the alchemical Great Work, and in general, the occult, which has been a Biblically forbidden field of study since the dawn of creation, there is a fundamental belief and practice known as the reconciliation of opposites, otherwise known as coincidencia oppositorum. This is the belief that to achieve gnosis or liberation; enlightenment one must reconcile all opposites within the microcosm (oneself) and the macrocosm (the universe; creation). This is based on the heretical notion that there is both an absolute evil and an absolute good inherent within all things. Many religions and ancient teachings are founded on this principle, but a modern day example is that of the Force in Star Wars, which consists of both a dark side and a light side. The goal of the Jedi is to both study, cultivate, master, and utilize the light side of the Force, and they do this by practicing such virtues such as altruism, sacrifice, temperance, celibacy, and charity, and willing the good of themselves and others; whereas the Sith, and others like themselves, bent on a kind of Faustian pursuit of power through the study, cultivation, mastery, and utilization of the dangerous, manipulative, and ultimately possessive dark side of the Force, have but one goal, that of godhood and dominion, and foster qualities such as hatred, fear, selfishness, and curiosity to gain insight, understanding, and what they half-heartedly believe to be control of the dark side of the Force. At times, however, there is suggestion by the Jedi that true mastery of the Force is sought by finding a balance between the dark side and the light. This is not an endeavor sought by individual Jedi or their Sith counterparts, but more of a prophetic nature of the Force itself, which is seen as being morally ambivalent, yet possessing a will of its own. The Jedi obey this will so far is it benefits them, but reserve a certain fear of the overall agenda of the Force itself, seemingly indicating that the Force is not to be trusted in its entirety, but only so far as its benevolence is made manifest in their application of it. The Sith, however, fear not the seemingly diabolical nature of the Force but only their ability not to be entirely destroyed by itgoing so far as to welcome total possession of themselves by the dark side of the Force in the hope of gaining absolute power, all the while embracing absolute corruption to the point of murdering their lord in order to inherit lordship themselves until being murdered by a future successor. There is no parallel to this practice among the Jedi. The Jedi believe and look forward to the fulfillment of the prophecy of the Force to find absolute balance, whereas their Sith counterparts only acknowledge that there is such a prophecy, and loathe the very idea of such a balance occurring, due to their abhorrence to the light based on their belief in its fundamental weakness in delivering unlimited amounts of power and pleasure. Now, what point am I trying to make by writing all of this? Here it is. The Force, as described above, is not a work of fiction. George Lucas, a life-long student of both Eastern religion and Joseph Campbell (a prominent, twentieth-century expert on world mythology, most notably known for his writings on what he called the Heros Journey, a summation of the overarching theme he saw in all religions and myths throughout the world), learned about the Force from his study of the occult power known in China as Chi, Japan as Ki, and India as Prana. It is studied, cultivated, and used in occult activities such as Reiki, Yoga, and various martial arts such as Tai Chi. Many Westerners are taught that these activities are simply art forms, or exercises. Others, such as natives of these countries who are ACTUALLY initiated by occult adepts into the mysteries of these dark arts, hold no qualms in admitting to the direct participation of demonic spirits in these activities/art forms/exercises/etc. Yoga, Tai Chi and Reiki: A Guide for Christians URL URL Its no small wonder that Disney has purchased the rights to Star Wars, and is now propagating its occult themes through clothing and other, various forms of media.

Heres a video documenting Walt Disneys high involvement in the occult, being a 33rd degree Freemason and pedophile obsessed by sex, the Devil, and the Illuminati.

Genesis 3:5  A promise made to mankind a long, long time ago that is still being believed today, except with more power and propaganda than EVER before. The sudden explosion of LGBTQ propaganda, which is nothing more than the Satanic obsession to reconcile all opposites, is indicative of the fact that we are living in the End Times, and that both Satan, his angels, and his followers among men, women, and children are fighting harder and faster than ever before because theyre running out of time. Satan and his followers have more power and influence today than they ever have before, and were witnessing the final success of the Great Work of the Alchemists that was dreamed of so long, long ago in their desire for godhood.

Aleister Crowley Satanist Regarding the Occult Mysteries (Remember what I said about Yoga, Reiki, Tai Chi, etc. Youre being LIED to.) Rejecting man-conceived dialects as inadequate and unworthy to perpetuate divine ideas, the Mysteries thus chose symbolism as a far more ingenious and ideal method of preserving their transcendental knowledge. In a single figure a symbol may both reveal and conceal, for to the wise the subject of the symbol is obvious, while to the ignorant the figure remains inscrutable. Hence, he who seeks to unveil the secret doctrine of antiquity must search for that doctrine not upon the open pages of books which might fall into the hands of the unworthy but in the place where it was originally concealed. Secret Teachings of All Ages p. 38 Manly P. Hall 33rd Degree Mason Occultist More information in this article: URL The Baphomet is a mystical figure known in many esoteric and occult circles. A creature with a goats head, androgynous human body and a phallus that is actually the caduceus often linked with the symbol for the medical profession. This figure is claimed to have several different purposes, dating back to the times of the Knights Templar and the Crusades in the 11th century, all the way to the Church of Satan today. The LGBTQ movement is all about turning us all into Baphomet. The Baphomet is said to symbolize the union of opposites. As represented in the image above, drawn by black magic practitioner Eliphas Levi (whose name is on the bottom), there is the image of a light moon and a dark moon. The positioning of its hands are also in opposite directions representing the motto as above, so below. All these sayings and symbols point to the what is known as the Secret doctrine which is the union of the gods with humanity. The fusion of the sacred feminine and the masculine is nothing more than the desire on the part of occultists for the return of the gods to Earth to once again mate with human women, a topic covered in great detail in our article on the Nephilim of Genesis Chapter 6 of the Bible. This ancient secret could not be discussed and has been passed on through symbols for centuries. The Baphomet thus became seen as a Father of wisdom and liberator of the spirit to those who were initiated. Anton LaVey, founder of the church of Satan, provides a very succinct explanation (as cited on an excellent blog explaining Baphomet in detail): The symbol of Baphomet was used by the Knights Templar to represent Satan. Through the ages this symbol has been called by many different names. Among these are: The Goat of Mendes, The Goat of a Thousand Young, The Black Goat, The Judas Goat, and perhaps the most appropriately, The Scapegoat. Baphomet represents the Powers of Darkness combined with the generative fertility of the goat. In its pure form the pentagram is shown encompassing the figure of a man in the five points of the star  three points up, two pointing down  symbolizing mans spiritual nature. In Satanism the pentagram is also used, but since Satanism represents the carnal instincts of man, or the opposite of spiritual nature, the pentagram is inverted to perfectly accommodate the head of the goat  its horns, representing duality, thrust upwards in defiance; the other three points inverted, or the trinity denied. What is the meaning of this? It holds several meanings but in it are the keys to the divine work or great mystery of many esoteric pursuits: man becoming god. By the fusion of opposites (dark and light, male and female, etc.) man can seek godhood. This was the true goal of alchemy practitioners centuries ago. The idea of changing lead to gold was just a metaphor for the pursuit of godhood and immortality. Hence Baphomet having the phrases solve and coagula on its arms, which is the motto of alchemy  namely, dissolving and reforming into a new, greater being. And that is done by the return of the ancient gods or fallen angelic beings, to Earth. All of these references of opposites are really alluding to the desire for the occultist to join with spirit beings from the angelic realm. And that union is the secret teaching.  Heres another article about the Satanic agenda of the LGBTQ movement. The article isnt Catholic, but a lot of it is still true: URL Anyway, you can do your own research if you want to learn more. Conclusion: The occult agenda to reconcile all opposites and ascend to godhood through magick and science is the direct work of Satan. It is being promoted by Hollywood, the Music Industry, governments all over the world, all forms of media, modern science, schools from K-12 and beyond, and has even infiltrated the Bride of Christ, the Catholic Church.

78,vulnerability,conspiracy,The Conspiracy of Loneliness,263,8009pl,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8009pl/the_conspiracy_of_loneliness/,2018-02-25 09:56:48,"**The Conspiracy of Loneliness** Ah, look at all the lonely people. Chronic loneliness is literally a modern day epidemic: URL Further, did you know that suicide rates are generally higher in rural areas than in urban areas? URL Why? According to many sociologists, like Emilie Durkheim, isolation is the answer. As someone who lives in an isolated area, I can relate to this. Still, I do not feel this is just a physical sense of isolation. Social isolation plays a huge role, too. Loneliness can result in suicide, which is a dark topic that most do not really explore. When one thinks of suicide, one thinks of hopelessness, but what brings someone to such hopelessness? Sociologist Emile Durkheim found that were three types of suicide: egotistic, altruistic, and anomie. For the purpose of this post, I want to focus on anomie, or a sense of disconnection from society and a feeling of not belonging that result from weakened social cohesion. Anomie occurs during period of serious social, economic, or political upheaval, which results in quick and extreme changes to society and everyday life. In such circumstances a person might feel so confused and disconnected that they choose to commit suicide. URL Further, according to Durkheim, it is simply not true that there are only individuals in society. URL Moreover, Large-scale societal crises may result in heightened suicide rates because the existing social order is challenged. An economic depression, for example, may be accompanied by an increased suicide rate. This is not due, however, to poverty or unemployment specifically but rather a result of a rapid change of conditions, expectations, and individuals' self-regard. URL Whether we like it or not, 99% of us exist within a society, with sociological ramifications. That does not mean that individuality does not exist; rather, there seems to be some type of paradox in thinking that ones individuality can exist without influence of society. With that being said, people today still like to think that they function on some sort of individuality where society has no influence on their thoughts or paradigms. This concept is simply ridiculous  for the majority of us, we function due to societal influences, unless we are aware of those influences. Think about how much our society has changed in the past ten or twenty years. Many of us are experiencing ""anomie."" So, for the purpose of this post, I want to focus on the social influences that create loneliness, and even contribute to suicide. Further, I want to discuss that this is all purposeful, and as always, there is a conspiracy behind this. They want people to feel and be lonely because, ultimately, it breaks down society and cohesion. There is, finally, an inversion of loneliness that they try to equate with oneness. Quite simply, people need other people, and technology can not replace real-life human interaction. **Solitude vs. Isolation** For the purpose of this post, I want to ensure to differentiate between solitude vs. isolation, or aloneness vs. loneliness. Solitude is the state or situation of being alone  many like to be alone at times, and there is nothing wrong with that. Being alone can be good for you: URL We all need alone time, and this post is not in contradiction with that fact. On the other hand, isolation is defined as being separate from others, and loneliness is defined as sadness because of lack of company. All of these definitions can be found on google, so I am not going to link, but the point is that we are living in a society that does not value solitude, and at the same time, there is increased isolation. What I mean is that we have very little time to actually be alone when we want to be, especially because of the increase of our hectic schedules. People are just too busy: URL When people do finally get that alone time, though, they may ultimately feel lonely or isolated. Today, one of the only ways to feel connected is through social media, and that is making us more lonely than ever. In fact, too much time on social media is directly correlated with loneliness: URL So, our society promotes this feeling of isolation, but how, and why? So, our society promotes this feeling of isolation, but how, and why? **Maslows Hierarchy of Needs** Before I write any of these posts, I always call a few of my friends and make sure my arguments hold up. One of my friends had a good argument  he said we do not actually need friends. Hes right, to an extent. When looking at Maslows hierarchy of needs, we really only need air, water, food, rest, and health for survival. But, one could argue that friends are needed for our emotional health, which goes into security, social, and ego. URL Even an evolutionary biologist can explain why we need others in our lives, Friends are important. So important, in fact, that its been proven that friendship can extend life expectancy and lower chances of heart disease. Friendship helps us survive. Part of why that is has to do with what happens in our brains when we interact with other humans: a 2011 study detailed the role of the neurobiological endogenous opioid system (the stuff in our brains that make us feel good) in positive social relationships; in 2016, researchers found evidence of the release of oxytocin in primate brains during social interactions; and later that year, psychologists conducted a study that suggested levels of pain tolerance can predict how many friends someone has. URL Yet, it is almost like we are trained to hate people in todays society, in some sort of divide and conquer tactic, which I will go into more later. **The Breakdown of Society** In the past century, specifically due to technology, there has been a breakdown of society, or social interaction. For the purpose this post, I am using Googles definition of society, which is the aggregate of people living together in a more or less ordered community. While most of us live among others, we are feeling more isolated than ever. Why? I know the last time somebody rang my doorbell, I freaked out. Was this type of isolation always normal? Absolutely not. *Friendships*: As noted earlier, we really do need others to feel healthy. Yet, today more than other, people are feeling isolated. Technology has created fake friends, and there is an actual study about this: URL *Family* For many, family is the foundation for which they exist, but the nuclear family is in decline: URL There is no such thing as a typical' family anymore. I am not, however, arguing that atypical families are bad but there is also the rise of dysfunctional families: URL No matter what the media tells you, there are findings that children fare better in traditional, nuclear homes: URL From a teachers perspective, my students long for both mom and dad, and Im willing to share those anecdotes if anybody is interested. *Relationships* Further, more are having casual sex, and less are willing to be committed in relationships: URL And less are getting married, and according to this article, that is a good thing: URL Media often glorifies casual relationships full of sex, with popular TV shows like Sex in the City, but are peoples needs really fulfilled just through just sex? URL This article explains how bonding works, and yes, people need to feel an intimate bond with people they have sex with. From the article, The problem described here also has much deeper and long-lasting effect. The authors report: Further, there is evidence that when this sex/bonding/breaking-up cycle is repeated a few or many timeseven when the bonding was short-liveddamage is done to the important, built-in ability to develop significant and meaningful connection to other human beings. Humans crave connection to others, not just physical pleasure. *Communication* It is a beautiful thing, the destruction of words.  1984 My students now say I want to kill myself as a 'trendy' statement  it has literally lost its meaning and effect. Language is how we connect, and in a controlled society, it loses its value and meaning. Moreover, while we seem more connected than ever, our level of communication has faced some degradation. For one, people are speaking to each other less: URL URL And even when we do talk, we are not really hearing what the other person says. Echo chambers have been confirmed by science: URL According to the article, Users tended to seek out information that strengthened their preferred narratives and to reject information that undermined it. So, we are now living in a world where it is so much easier to close off people that may not worship the ground we walk on, as if we are not Gods after all. *Free Time* Unfortunately, when we do have free time, most of us are too tired to even spend it with others. Deep down we may actually want to be with others, but we are almost forced to be alone because we need to emotionally recover from the day. I know as a teacher it is hard for me to want to hang out with anybody after work simply because I am emotionally exhausted. But, burnout at work is not just about this emotional exhaustion, it is also about loneliness: URL Well, it is probably a mixture of both. Emotional exhaustion contributes to isolation, which probably causes loneliness. From the article, Loneliness, whether it results from social isolation or exhaustion, has serious consequences for individuals. John Cacioppo, a leading expert on loneliness and coauthor of Loneliness: Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection, emphasizes its tremendous impact on psychological and physical health and longevity.In the meantime, experts and companies have struggled to figure out how to counter growing levels of burnout. Many recommendations focus on relieving stress, teaching mindfulness, or reducing workload  all of which treat burnout as an individual condition. But its link to loneliness suggests that greater human connection at work may also be key to solving the burnout problem. Most of us spend the majority of our day at our jobs, and when we do communicate, it is either forced or fake with people we probably do not like much anyway. At the same time, we may come home and sincerely want to hang out with others, but we are just too emotionally drained. This is just another contribution to loneliness. Our free time is spent on recovery from work  not on the social interaction we need. **But I hate people!** You might be reading this and be thinking, Well, I hate people anyway, so who cares? The question is, were you programmed to hate people? Before modern technology, our society was different. If you grew up with a smart phone out of your moms womb, this may be hard to imagine, but community used to be a valued part of society. Quite frankly, technology is destroying the quality of human interaction: URL But, even beyond that, even the most introverted need a sense of community: URL And really, social communication is, in some ways, as important as food and shelter: URL The thing is, we may feel this sense of social communication with technology, but it cannot duplicate real, human interaction: URL Besides, are you sure your hatred for others is not simply a purposeful divide and conquer technique? We fear connecting because it requires us to reveal something about ourselves. We are taught to hate the enemy  meaning anyone different than us  which leaves little room for vulnerability and an exploration of hate through empathic discourse and understanding. In our current society, one is more ready to fight than to resolve conflict. Peace is seldom the option. URL Today, we are being trained to hate connecting with others who do not fall into our thoughts and paradigms. **Anomie** So, in our society, there is this purposeful breakdown that increases loneliness. Not only are people lonelier than ever, but there is a stark rise in suicides, especially among the youth: URL But why? Besides all of the factors I have noted, there is still more to this  there is this breakdown of society, but it goes deeper. There are many reasons why people kill themselves, as noted earlier, but one reason rarely talked about is anomie. According to Wikipedia, Anomie (/nmi/) is a ""condition in which society provides little moral guidance to individuals"". URL I have written so much about the moral relativism or our modern society, so feel free to check out my post history, that way I do not repeat much here. The article notes, For Durkheim, anomie arises more generally from a mismatch between personal or group standards and wider social standards, or from the lack of a social ethic, which produces moral deregulation and an absence of legitimate aspirations. We are living in a society where nearly anything goes. Fuck who you want, eat what you want, and do whatever you want, and do not worry about any sense of standards. Why? Standards are bad, according to modern society. But people need standard and direction. People need morals. People are on the pursuit of happiness, without realizing happiness may not even be the goal they are seeking. I call this Oprah morality where people do what makes them happy with no further, philosophical thought on the effects on society. You can read more about do what thou wilt and Oprah Morality in my post history, but I need to move on: URL The other factor is that many are simply disillusioned with a society they cannot fit in with, and I know I feel that way at times. We are all here, on a conspiracy forum because we feel there is something wrong with the world, even if we disagree with the reasons as to why it feels wrong. Many of us feel like outcasts because we cannot speak about what we really believe. We may not worship the culture of materialism, celebrities, social media, sports, and so on, and we may speak out against the major narratives. Quite simply, many of us feel like outcasts who still have to function in a society we ultimately disagree with  what is the alternative? Is there even an alternative? Today, it is so expensive and nearly impossible to buy your own land and live without society, yet some people are living off the grid: URL Still, the question is, why is society this way? Was there a time when depression was not normalized? Was there a time when people liked other people? Was there a time when people did not feel lonely, but they felt fulfilled by their communities? I think there was. Today, we have things to fulfill us, whether those be drugs, alcohol, video games, sex, buying stuff, working constantly, beauty products, social media, pets, money, power, porn, etc., but we do not have each other. I used to think Amish societies were ridiculous, but, now, I am not so sure because they seemingly are happier: URL The point is that many are feeling disillusioned in a society that feels disconnected with no set of standards. Anything goes, and nobody really cares. **Why?** So, what would be the point of all of this? Why would they want us to feel lonely and empty? Well, quite simply, it makes us easier to control. We want to fit and belong, and that is just basic human evolution, sociology, and psychology. Most of us will do what it takes to fit in. From 1984, It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away. A nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself  anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide. In any case, to wear an improper expression on your face (to look incredulous when a victory was announced, for example) was itself a punishable offense. There was even a word for it in Newspeak: facecrime, it was called. As somebody who has been targeted pretty severely online, I understand this quote. Fitting in is about survival, but that does not make us feel any less lonely. We do not want to commit facecrimes and the elite know this. So, we show a certain face to the world. We live in duplicity, or two worlds. But even darker, loneliness makes us more likely to kill ourselves and less likely to reproduce. Loneliness make us depressed, and less likely to contribute to society or change. And they convince us that we will be just fine being alone! **Inversion of Loneliness to Oneness** Right now, they are somehow convincing us that all of our problems, specifically with loneliness, will be solved through technology. Through artificial intelligence and virtual reality, we can have anything we want. We can create our own realities. Our future is with augmented reality: URL But the problem is, it is all fake. We can create family, friendship, community, communication, fun, entertainment, and whatever in this virtual reality, but it can never replace real-life interactions. With modern new age religion, we are told we can be one with all so that we are not alone, but to me that is deceiving. Yes, we need other people to function in society, but we are still individuals, and loneliness is defeated when we value people for who they really are  not who we want them to be. Loneliness today is a product of trying to fit into a society where many of us simply do not agree with its main tenets. To conquer loneliness, we seek people that like us for we really are, but can we do that today? I mean, most cannot even post a picture without a million filters, and most cannot really speak their mind for fear of backlash and the eternity of the internet. But there is this illusion that people like us just the way we are, and the more likes we get, the more we feel that claim is validated. With all of these interconnections, we feel like nothing. The more technology connects us, the more disconnected we feel because our uniqueness loses meaning. It loses meaning because we cannot find real people that value us anymore for who we are, and quiet simply, t is not really real. In real life, many friends like me because of who I am in, but on social media, my friends like me because who I am perceived to be, which is not the real me. Loneliness makes us believe we are insignificant, and if we truly feel that, then our lives lose meaning. We stop living. **Lets end with some quotes** Technological progress has merely provided us with more efficient means for going backwards.  Aldous Huxley, Ends and Means We cant jump off bridges anymore because our iPhones will get ruined. We cant take skinny dips in the ocean because theres no service on the beach and adventures arent real unless theyre on Instagram. Technology has doomed the spontaneity of adventure and were helping destroy it every time we Google, check-in, and hashtag.  Jeremy Glass Even the technology that promises to unite us, divides us. Each of us is now electronically connected to the globe, and yet we feel utterly alone.  Dan Brown, Angels &amp; Demons The conspiracy is that if we feel we have no value, then we feel life has no value, and larger society loses it purpose and value. We live our lives waiting for the next 'high' and we have this belief that, eventually, all our problems will be solves with some type of technological 'oneness' or interface. That does not seem to be the case. ""It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity."" Albert Einstein "

This reactionary agenda is not, however, the focus of the Democratic Party. It is concentrating instead on increasingly hysterical claims that Russia is ""sowing divisions"" within the United States. In the media, one report follows another, each more ludicrous than the last. The claim that Russia shifted the US election by means of $100,000 in advertisements on Facebook and Twitter has been followed by breathless reports of the Putin government's manipulation of other forms of communication. An ""exclusive"" report from CNN last week proclaimed that one organization, ""Don't Shoot Us,"" which it alleges without substantiation is connected to Russia, sought to ""exploit racial tensions and sow discord"" on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Tumblr and even Pokmon Go, a reality game played on cell phones. Another report in CNN on Monday asserted that a Russian ""troll factory"" was involved in posting comments critical of Hillary Clinton as ""part of President Vladimir Putin's campaign to influence the 2016 election."" All of the negative commentary in news media and other publications directed at Clinton, it implied, were the product of Russian agents or people duped by Russian agents. As during the period of Cold War McCarthyism, the absurdity of the charges goes unchallenged. They are picked up and repeated by other media outlets and by politicians to demonstrate just how far-reaching the actions of the nefarious ""foreign enemy"" really are. While one aim has been to continue and escalate an anti-Russia foreign policy, the more basic purpose is emerging ever more clearly: to criminalize political dissent within the United States. The most direct expression to date of this conspiracy against free speech was given by the anticommunist ideologue Anne Applebaum in a column published Monday in the Washington Pos t, ""If Russia can create fake 'Black Lives Matter' accounts, who will next?"" Her answer: the American people. ""I can imagine multiple groups, many of them proudly American, who might well want to manipulate a range of fake accounts during a riot or disaster to increase anxiety or fear,"" she writes. She warns that ""political groups--on the left, the right, you name it--will quickly figure out"" how to use social media to spread ""disinformation"" and ""demoralization."" Applebaum rails against all those who seek to hide their identity online. ""There is a better case than ever against anonymity, at least against anonymity in the public forums of social media and comment sections,"" she writes. She continues: ""The right to free speech is something that is granted to humans, not bits of computer code."" Her target, however, is not ""bots"" operating ""fake accounts,"" but anyone who seeks, fearing state repression or unjust punishment by his or her employer, to make an anonymous statement online. And that is only the opening shot in a drive to silence political dissent. Applebaum is closely connected to the highest echelons of the capitalist state. She is a member of key foreign policy think tanks and sits on the board of directors of the CIA-linked National Endowment for Democracy. Married to the former foreign minister of Poland, she is a ferocious war hawk. Following the Russian annexation of Crimea, she authored a column in the Washington Post in which she called for ""total war"" against nuclear-armed Russia. She embodies the connection between militarism and political repression. The implications of Applebaum's arguments are made clear in an extraordinary article published on the front page of Tuesday's New York Times, ""As US Confronts Internet's Disruptions, China Feels Vindicated,"" which takes a favorable view of China's aggressive censorship of the Internet and implies that the United States is moving toward just such a regime. ""For years, the United States and others saw"" China's ""heavy-handed censorship as a sign of political vulnerability and a barrier to China's economic development,"" the Times writes. ""But as countries in the West discuss potential Internet restrictions and wring their hands over fake news, hacking and foreign meddling, some in China see a powerful affirmation of the country's vision for the internet."" The article goes on to assert that while ""few would argue that China's Internet control serves as a model for democratic societies... At the same time, China anticipated many of the questions now flummoxing governments from the United States to Germany to Indonesia."" Glaringly absent from the Times article, Applebaum's commentary and all of the endless demands for a crackdown on social media is any reference to democratic rights, free speech or the First Amendment. The First Amendment, which asserts that ""Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech,"" is the broadest amendment in the US Constitution. Contrary to Applebaum, there is no caveat exempting anonymous speech from Constitutional protection. It is a historical fact that leaders of the American Revolution and drafters of the Constitution wrote articles under pseudonyms to avoid repression by the British authorities. The Constitution does not give the government or powerful corporations the right to proclaim what is ""fake"" and what is not, what is a ""conspiracy theory"" and what is ""authoritative."" The same arguments now being employed to crack down on social media could just as well have been used to suppress books and mass circulation newspapers that emerged with the development of the printing press. The drive toward Internet censorship in the United States is already far advanced. Since Google announced plans to bury ""alternative viewpoints"" in search results earlier this year, leading left-wing sites have seen their search traffic plunge by more than 50 percent. The World Socialist Web Site's search traffic from Google has fallen by 75 percent. Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms have introduced similar measures. The campaign being whipped up over Russian online activity will be used to justify even more far-reaching measures. This is taking place as universities implement policies to give police the authority to vet campus events. There are ongoing efforts to abolish ""net neutrality"" so as to give giant corporations the ability to regulate Internet traffic. The intelligence agencies have demanded the ability to circumvent encryption after having been exposed for illegally monitoring the phone communications and Internet activity of the entire population. In one ""democratic"" country after another governments are turning to police-state forms of rule, from France, with its permanent state of emergency, to Germany, which last month shut down a subsidiary of the left-wing political site Indymedia, to Spain, with its violent crackdown on the separatist referendum in Catalonia and arrest of separatist leaders. The destruction of democratic rights is the political response of the corporate and financial aristocracy to the growth of working-class discontent bound up with record levels of social inequality. It is intimately linked to preparations for a major escalation of imperialist violence around the world. The greatest concern of the ruling elite is the emergence of an independent movement of the working class, and the state is taking actions to prevent it.

This scene might have inspired subsequent copycat musical effects. Although the Satanic backmasking controversy involved mainly classic rock songs, whose authors denied any intent to promote Satanism, backmasking has been used by heavy metal bands to deliberately insert messages in their lyrics or imagery. Bands have utilized Satanic imagery for commercial reasons.[37] For example, thrash metal band Slayer included at the start of the band's 1985 album Hell Awaits a deep backmasked voice chanting ""Join Us"" over and over. (About this sound listen).[38] However, Slayer vocalist Tom Araya states that the band's use of Satanic imagery was ""solely for effect"".[39] Cradle of Filth, another band that has employed Satanic imagery, released a song entitled ""Dinner at Deviant's Palace"", consisting almost entirely of unusual sounds and a reversed reading of the Lord's Prayer[40] (a backwards reading of the Lord's Prayer is reportedly a major part of the Black Mass).[19][41] Seattle-based grunge band Soundgarden parodied the phenomenon of Satanic backmasking on their 1989 album Ultramega OK. When played backwards, the songs ""665"" and ""667"" reveal a song about Santa Claus. Marilyn Manson used this technique. For example, in the beginning of his song ""Tourniquet"" when played backwards, his voice is heard saying ""This is my lowest point of vulnerability"" as explained in his book The Long Hard Road Out of Hell."
86,vulnerability,conspiracy,The Atlantic Council Needs to Stop Interfering in Our Elections,5,75mava,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/75mava/the_atlantic_council_needs_to_stop_interfering_in/,2017-10-11 14:01:00,"From USA TODAY - SAN FRANCISCO  A bipartisan group of federal election officials, national security advisors and a retired U.S. general have formed a coalition to fight election hacking with the aim of establishing protocols that would keep Russians and other state entities from interfering with the voting process. At a Tuesday news conference at the headquarters of the foreign policy think-tank Atlantic Council in Washington, D.C., the group plans to announce it's working on a list of necessary procedures and standards that state and local election officials must do, such as implementing digital firewalls around election data and making sure there are paper ballots to allow for auditing of all election tallies. It has given itself a 60-day deadline to produce the guidelines. The group also plans to pressure Congress to fund the election officials' activities ""because if the states and local election officials have one gripe we have to concede to them, its that theyre broke,"" said Jake Braun, a former senior consultant on cybersecurity at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in the Obama Administration who is helping organize the coalition. ""If we have a nation state attempting to influence the U.S. electoral process, then its the federal governments job to pay for the defensive response."" The goal is to have the strongest, most unhackable system possible in place by the 2020 presidential election, he said. Concerns over foreign interference in last year's presidential election were heightened by last month's Department of Homeland Security announcement that election systems in 21 states had been targeted by Russian government hackers during the 2016 election campaign. It's ringing alarm bells, said Frederick Kempe, chief executive officer of the Atlantic Council, which is leading the effort. If we want to defend our democracy, then we need to protect our elections, he said. In July, hackers at the DefCon cybersecurity conference were able to break into five voting machine types in less than a day, underscoring the vulnerability of the U.S. election system. The group also plans to release a report on how the hackers were able to so swiftly hack the machines, a feat that raised red flags because the industry that operates voting systems had always said they were more protected from intrusions because they required such specialized knowledge to run. The voting machine hacks destroyed that argument, said Jeff Moss, president of DefCon and a commissioner on the The Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace. The interior of a Diebold Election Systems voting machine. It was taken apart by at the DefCon computer security conference in Las Vegas as part of an event aimed at raising awareness about vulnerabilities to the U.S. election system. (Photo: Elizabeth Weise) The Atlantic Council is chaired by Jon Huntsman, the newly appointed U.S. ambassador to Russia. In his statement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month during his nomination hearing, he said there was no question that the Russian government interfered in the U.S. election last year and that he would ""not hesitate to remind government officials that they are accountable for their actions."" Russia has consistently denied any interference in the U.S. election. Also in the coalition is the Center of Internet Security, a non-governmental organization that is funded by the Department of Homeland Security to fund cybersecurity for states and cities. While Russian attempts to insert itself into the U.S. political process were a surprise here, they were not news to those who have worked in the military and diplomatic corps. Many of our European allies have already seen this  years of Russian interference and Russian attempts to erode the credibility of the political process in Central and Eastern Europe, said Ambassador Douglas Lute, a retired three-star general who served under both Obama and George W. Bush and was most recently the former United States Permanent Representative to the North Atlantic Council, NATOs standing political body. He's part of the coalition. And if what Russia did in 2016 was bad, what it might do in 2018 or 2020 with the knowledge it gained the first time around is worse, Lute said. By law, states must maintain statewide voter registration databases, many of which were probed in 2016. You can imagine a hacker could get into these databases, then do something as simple as misspelling names or transposing numbers in the address. Then when the voter goes to the polling place and shows his ID, he doesnt even get a ballot, Lute said.

91,vulnerability,conspiracy,The Suppression of Vaccination Dissent,10,6qw37o,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6qw37o/the_suppression_of_vaccination_dissent/,2017-08-01 23:07:20,"I don't see a lot of posts questioning vaccination - lots on Geo-engineering and other hot topics. I thought I'd share some information that had previously been shared with me. Edited for clarity *Please let me know if this is not appropriate.* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dissenters from the dominant views about vaccination sometimes are subject to adverse actions, including abusive comment, threats, formal complaints, censorship, and deregistration, a phenomenon that can be called suppression of dissent. Three types of cases are examined: scientists and physicians; a high-profile researcher; and a citizen campaigner. Comparing the methods used in these different types of cases provides a preliminary framework for understanding the dynamics of suppression in terms of vulnerabilities. Keywords: vaccination; dissent; reputation; free speech; controversy **Introduction** Vaccination has long been a contentious topic (Colgrove, 2006; Johnston, 2004). The orthodox position, adopted by most physicians and government health departments, is that vaccination is vital in reducing illness and death from infectious disease (Andre et al., 2008; Offit and Bell, 2003). Health authorities specify a recommended schedule of vaccinations for babies and children. As new vaccines are developed and tested, they are added to the schedule to reduce morbidity and death from additional diseases. The orthodox position is that adverse reactions to vaccines are rare, and insignificant compared to the benefits. In the face of this dominant position, a number of physicians, scientists, and citizens argue that vaccination has significant shortcomings. They question the scale of the benefits, noting how death rates from infectious diseases declined dramatically before the introduction of mass vaccination. They maintain that the adverse effects of vaccination have been underestimated (Habakus and Holland, 2011; Halvorsen, 2007). The vaccination debate is not just a disagreement about evidence concerning benefits and risks: values are involved too. For infectious disease to spread, there need to be susceptible individuals. Mass vaccination, according to proponents, reduces the likelihood of spread, because most people are immune. The result is what is called ""herd immunity,"" causing an additional decline in disease even beyond vaccine-induced individual immunity. Because of this collective benefit, including the protection of those unable to be immunized, proponents see widespread vaccination as a moral imperative. Critics, on the other hand, support parental choice in vaccination decisions. They oppose penalties for not vaccinating, such as requirements that children be fully vaccinated in order to attend school. The vaccination debate can be incredibly emotional on both sides. Partly this seems to be because children's health is involved: parents react to their children becoming ill from infectious disease or suffering reactions to vaccines. The clash between collective benefits (herd immunity) and freedom of choice adds to the mix. Because vaccination is a signifier for the benefits of modern medicine, some proponents see any questioning of vaccination as a rejection of enlightened thinking. When physicians and health authorities support vaccination based on careful assessments of benefits and risks, they may dismiss citizen critics as ill-informed. Because nearly all experts endorse vaccination, there may seem to be no rational basis for opposition. In this context, any physician or scientist who questions vaccination is a potential threat to the public perception that credentialed experts unanimously endorse vaccination. This sets the stage for suppression of dissent. Suppression of dissent is action taken against dissenting individuals, or the research supporting their positions, that goes beyond fair debate. Methods of suppressing individuals include spreading of rumors, vilification, harassment, reprimands, demotions, deregistration, and dismissal (Martin, 1999a). Methods of suppressing research data include censorship, denial of funding, and denial of access to research materials (Martin, 1999b). There is an overlap between these modes of suppression. For example, a scientist's grant applications might be rejected, thereby denying opportunities for research. Debate is a normal and desirable feature of the scientific enterprise. Suppression is different from debate in that individuals, and their capacity to do research and engage in debate, are targeted. Suppression is important because it skews research agendas and public discussions. The focus here is on suppression of vaccination critics. In principle, it is possible for vaccination supporters to be suppressed, though in practice this is unlikely because critics do not have any significant capacity to impose sanctions. It is worth mentioning that the existence of suppression of dissent does not necessarily mean dissenters are correct, nor that researchers deserve funding merely for dissenting. However, even if dissenters are completely wrong, suppressing them can be damaging in several ways (Sunstein, 2003). It sets up a pattern of unfair behavior that can hinder open discussion of issues even within the dominant viewpoint. It discourages supporters from thinking for themselves about the evidence and arguments, because they encounter contrary views less frequently. Critics can keep advocates honest and alert, with their arguments well formulated. Finally, suppression can aid the cause of critics by making them feel unfairly treated: some observers may wonder why proponents cannot rely on the arguments. When the struggle is open and honest, the outcome will seem more legitimate. My own involvement in the vaccination debate is primarily as a defender of fair and open debate on contentious issues, given my long-term interest in dissent (Martin, 1981; Martin et al., 1986). Personally, I do not hold strong views about vaccination. The next section provides additional background about suppression of dissent, including triggers, methods, patterns, and tests. The following sections outline several cases, falling into three main types: scientists and physicians; a high-profile researcher; and a citizen campaigner. Following this is a comparison of the suppression methods used in the three types of cases. The conclusion spells out the implications of suppression for the vaccination issue. **Suppression of dissent** Dissent is a disagreement with or challenge to standard views. Historically, the most familiar type is political dissent, especially any questioning of an authoritarian government. Struggles for political freedom have included, as a central feature, struggles for free speech, most famously articulated in the first amendment to the US Constitution. Free speech remains contested even in countries where it is rhetorically supported and legally protected, with many examples of attacks on those who speak out (Boykoff, 2006; Curry, 1988; Ewing and Gearty, 1990; Goldstein, 1978; Hamilton and Maddison, 2007; Jones, 2001; Soley, 2002). In many countries, especially those with repressive governments, criticism of the government remains a subversive activity, sometimes met with harsh measures. Political speech is only one type of dissent. Others include challenges to corporations, professions, churches, and indeed any group with the capacity to influence opinions and exact reprisals. A major gap in free speech protection is speech within organizations. Employees are seldom granted the same protections as citizens (Barry, 2007; Ewing, 1977; Kassing, 2011). Whistleblowers, who are often employees, are often met with reprisals (Alford, 2001; Glazer and Glazer, 1989; Miceli et al., 2008). Dissent in science can be understood within this wider context. In principle, scientists can speak out, challenging orthodoxy or powerholders. Indeed, within science, being able to question and challenge ideas is widely seen as essential for scientific advance. When governments impose a view about a scientific matter, as in the case of Lysenkoism in the former Soviet Union (Joravsky, 1970), this is seen as an outrageous denial of scientific freedom. In practice, scientific dissent remains risky (Deyo et al., 1997; Martin, 1999a, b; Moran, 2004; Sommer, 2001). A typical scenario goes like this. A scientist does research, or speaks out, in a way that threatens a powerful group and, as a result, comes under attack. The form of the attack depends on the circumstances, in particular on the scientist's vulnerabilities and on the resources available to attackers. The scientist's reputation can be harmed by the spreading of rumors, open denunciations, and formal proceedings with attached stigma. The scientist's opportunity to express views can be hindered by direct censorship (such as refusing permission to give talks or make public comments) and by rejecting articles. The scientist's opportunity to do research can be hindered by refusing access to data or research facilities, and by rejecting research grant applications. Finally, a scientist's livelihood can be threatened by dismissal. The four areas of reputation, speech, research, and employment often interact. For example, a formal investigation into a scientist's alleged misdemeanors serves to harm the scientist's reputation and, by requiring large amounts of time and effort to defend, limits the scientist's opportunity to do research. It is reasonable to ask, how can anyone know whether suppression of dissent is involved? After all, many of the actions involved, such as rejecting articles, rejecting grant applications, and dismissal, can be taken for quite legitimate reasons. The rumors might well be true, and public denunciations warranted. A scientist subject to such adverse actions might just be a poor researcher or, even worse, a cheat. To determine whether actions are taken for legitimate reasons or can be characterized as suppression of dissent, there is ultimately no substitute for a detailed analysis of claims and actions. This can be a major undertaking, because many cases involve incredible detail, with claims and counter-claims and a complex set of circumstances (e.g., Delborne, 2008). However, there are a few convenient tests that can be used to make a preliminary judgment (Martin, 2013). In the following, for convenience I refer to a scientist; the same sorts of processes apply to physicians and others with specialist training and credentials. First is the timing of actions. If a scientist speaks out and shortly afterwards is subject to adverse actions, this increases the chance that the adverse actions were reprisals. Reprisals against whistleblowers often display this timing correlation. Second is the question of who receives criticism and complaints. When criticisms are made directly to a scientist, this usually can be understood as part of a process of dialogue and debate. When complaints are initially made to a scientist's boss, a government agency, or professional association, this often indicates an attempt to suppress dissent, aside from those situations in which mandatory reporting procedures are applicable. Third is the double standard test. The scientist who is the target of adverse actions can be compared to other scientists who are not, in terms of publications, reputation, rank, seniority, and prior work evaluations. If the targeted scientist is equal to or superior to others in terms of performance, this raises suspicion that suppression is involved. Fourth is the relationship to vested interests. If the scientist's research or public statements are threatening to a government, powerful corporation, profession or dominant orthodoxy, this is a plausible reason for suppression to occur. Fifth is a pattern of similar adverse actions. In some fields, there are many examples of critics who experienced adverse actions. For example, quite a number of scientists who are critics of nuclear power, pesticides, and fluoridation have been targets of attack (Martin, 1999a). When several of these criteria are satisfied, this is a strong indication that suppression could be involved. Consider a scientist who speaks out critically about an issue and threatens a group with vested interests. Shortly afterwards, the scientist is denounced for poor work, whereas colleagues of lesser standing are left untouched. This combination of events provides strong prima facie evidence that suppression is involved. Note that the analysis of suppression is largely independent of an assessment of the scientific validity of the claims made. The index of suppression is whether norms of fair treatment are followed, including for assessing publications, allowing free speech and allowing investigation of unfashionable topics. It is quite possible for a researcher to be completely wrong scientifically and yet be suppressed; likewise, it is quite possible for a researcher to be vindicated scientifically and yet to have been the recipient of favoritism in violation of norms of fairness. A classic case is the response to the astronomical and geological theories of Immanuel Velikovsky when first publicized in the 1950s: mainstream scientists, in rejecting Velikovsky's ideas, violated norms of fair play, for example in condemning Velikovsky by appealing to their own authority as scientists rather than examining the evidence, and by seeking to censor publication (de Grazia, 1966). Nearly all scientists believe Velikovsky was wrong, but aspects of his treatment can still be classified as suppression. The consequences of suppression can be severe: harm to reputation, hindrance of research, and even destruction of a career. Although the individual who is targeted suffers the most, the wider impact can be greater. Suppression of dissent can send a powerful signal to other scientists that it is risky to do research or speak out on certain topics. This chilling effect on research and speech can lead to entire research areas being neglected or distorted. Suppression thus operates as a tool in struggles over research agendas. Suppression cases Here, several cases are described that seem to fit the criteria for suppression of dissent. The accounts here are brief and intended only to introduce material relevant to the possibility of suppression being involved, not to provide comprehensive treatments. Further information about the cases, from different perspectives, can be found in the references cited, and additional references cited in them. The accounts here do not address the validity of the dissent; rather, they invoke the tests, outlined in the previous section, for making a preliminary judgment. First are two cases, involving a researcher and a physician, that are typical of suppression cases in other fields. Next is a high-profile case involving a researcher. The final case involves a citizen critic of vaccination. **A researcher and a physician** From 1995 to 2002, Gary Goldman served as the research/epidemiology analyst on a project studying chickenpox funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The project was run in cooperation with the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS). Goldman discovered an increase in shingles among un vaccinated children and adults and hypothesized that this was associated with the universal varicella (chickenpox) vaccination program, with the idea that prior to widespread vaccinations, most people through interpersonal interactions were repeatedly exposed to varicella, thereby preventing shingles. Apparently because the co-principal investigators on the project wanted to protect the varicella vaccination program, Goldman's collaboration with a CDC modeler was terminated and Goldman was instructed not to continue his investigations into the incidence of shingles. When Goldman sent copies of papers to his superiors, he received no feedback for months, even years; in contrast, their own paper, not challenging vaccination orthodoxy, was reviewed within a day. Goldman was formally required to have all his e-mails pre-screened by his superiors. He asked to interview ten shingles patients to gain extra information; his request was not answered. He resigned in 2002, feeling he did not have proper support to undertake objective research. After Goldman independently submitted papers to peer-reviewed journals and contacted the CDC about appropriate co-authorship credits, he received a letter from the Los Angeles County Legal Department to ""cease and desist"" publication in a medical journal. This letter was initiated by Dr Laurene Mascola, head of the Acute Communicable Disease Control Unit of LACDHS. Goldman's lawyer said this order had no legal merit and that if it was pursued, he would file a legal action under state and federal false claims acts. The LA County Legal Department did not follow up with any action. Goldman's opponents also contacted editors to try to prevent or postpone publication of his papers (Goldman and King, 2013; Orrin, 2010). Goldman's claims about varicella have been challenged in print (Myers, 2013) but not his claims about his treatment. Jayne Donegan, a British general practitioner, was initially supportive of vaccination. Years into her practice, she had doubts and undertook a comprehensive study drawing on the medical literature. She later agreed to testify on behalf of two mothers who opposed vaccinating their children: the children's absent fathers had gone to court to mandate vaccinations. The General Medical Council, hearing comments about the case in the mass media, accused Donegan of professional misconduct. More than two years later, in 2006, the GMC produced its charges that Donegan had misrepresented the scientific evidence she had quoted in the court case (Dyer, 2006). The GMC lost the case and Donegan was completely exonerated (Dyer, 2007; GMC, 2007). However, the bringing of charges stigmatized her, and the necessity to prepare lengthy rebuttals to the GMC's chosen experts took an enormous amount of time and effort. Donegan was only able to afford to contest the GMC's charges because of Medical Indemnity Insurance, which covered the more than 100,000 cost of legal fees, but not the considerable costs of accommodation and lost income. In the conclusion of Donegan's account of the experience, she states, ""Pleased as I am with the successful conclusion of my hearing, it has taken an inevitable and heavy toll on my children, our family and my professional life."" (Donegan, 2008) **A high-profile researcher** Andrew Wakefield was a gastroenterologist at Royal Free Hospital in Britain. He was lead author in a study of 12 children who developed gastrointestinal symptoms linked to regressive autism. The paper, published in 1998 in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet, was a case review study: it presented evidence suggestive of a new disease syndrome, with a possible but unproven link to the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) triple vaccine (Wakefield et al., 1998). On publication, and with the approval of the hospital administration, Wakefield took part in a press conference. Wakefield suggested it might be safer for the measles vaccine to be taken separately - he did not argue against vaccination - and many parents opted for single vaccines. Six months later, the British government withdrew the availability of single measles, mumps and rubella vaccines on the National Health Service, and vaccination rates declined. The Lancet study became a major media event, with the possible link between MMR and autism turned into a giant scare. Much of the blame for the decline in vaccination rates was attributed to Wakefield; Goldacre (2009: 290-331) instead blames the media. Journalist Brian Deer (2004) made allegations about Wakefield, leading to a lengthy case before the General Medical Council (GMC), which found Wakefield guilty of dishonesty and abuse of children who were subjects in the research, and stripped him of his license to practice medicine (GMC, 2010). The Lancet then retracted the paper as flawed, a rare event in scientific publishing. Wakefield left the country and started a new career in the US. Later, Deer (2011) made new allegations against Wakefield. John Walker-Smith, a co-author with Wakefield of the paper in The Lancet, who was found guilty by the GMC along with Wakefield, was later cleared in a court action. Critics of Wakefield say the sanctions taken against him and his work were justified by the seriousness of his transgressions. Wakefield (2010) contests the claims made by Deer, the General Medical Council, and others. The issues in the Wakefield saga have been analyzed at great length, and it is impossible to do justice to all the arguments in a short account. The modest aim here is determine whether the treatment of Wakefield fits into the category of suppression of dissent. The key criterion used here is the double standard test: have others guilty of transgressions similar to those alleged of Wakefield been treated in a similar way? There is evidence of extensive bias in biomedical research, including undeclared conflicts of interest, withholding evidence, manipulating statistics, using bioactive placebos, ghostwriting, and much else (Abraham, 1995; Angell, 2005; Braithwaite, 1984; Goldacre, 2012; Kassirer, 2005; Krimsky, 2003; Smyth et al., 2010; Stamatakis et al., 2013). These serious violations of research ethics seldom result in any penalties for the violators, much less the sort of banner treatment suffered by Wakefield. Plagiarism by students, for example, is treated as a serious violation; ghostwriting is a form of plagiarism, but is seldom penalized: ""... to the best of my knowledge, no academic anywhere in the world has ever been punished for putting their name on a ghostwritten academic paper."" (Goldacre, 2012: 298). Thus, even if Wakefield is guilty as charged, his treatment might be considered excessive by the norms in the field. If he is not guilty, as he argues (Wakefield, 2010), then his treatment is even more obviously excessive. The key difference between Wakefield and others in the field is that the others are working for or funded by pharmaceutical companies and/or not challenging biomedical orthodoxy. Some critics of Wakefield refer to the further claims by Brian Deer (2011) of fraud in clinical practice. There is a double standard here in the level of scrutiny to which Wakefield has been subjected. Few other scientists have had their research put through such an intense interrogation. Given the prevalence of bias and poor-quality research in biomedicine, it is quite possible that others subject to the same level of scrutiny would come up wanting. Unlike most of his peers, Wakefield has been subject to a degradation ceremony, a ritualistic denunciation casting him out of the company of honest researchers (Thrse and Martin, 2010). By degrading Wakefield's reputation, vaccination is symbolically vindicated and the credibility of any criticism undermined. Supporters of vaccination have repeatedly used the example of Wakefield to suggest that criticism of vaccination is misguided (e.g., Grant, 2011: 105-124; Offit, 2010). The logic of using Wakefield's ignominy as an argument in defense of vaccination is not replicated in the case of a single biomedical scientist who supports standard views. Considering that bias and conflict of interest are endemic to pharmaceutical-company-sponsored research, it is striking that no supporter of orthodoxy concludes that this discredits support for pharmaceutical drugs generally. (Some critics draw this conclusion.) Wakefield's extended degradation ceremony has served as a warning to others not to follow in his footsteps. In contrast, no pharmaceutical company scientist has been subject to an equivalent investigation and denunciation. There seems to be relatively little career risk in accepting corporate funding and participating in biased research, undeclared conflicts of interest, or ghostwriting. The public signal then is to avoid challenging orthodoxy. This assessment of the Wakefield saga has had a limited objective: to determine whether he has been dealt with in the same way as other scientists with similar records but who have not challenged orthodox views on vaccination. If the case presented by Wakefield and his supporters (CryShame, 2014; Wakefield, 2010; Walker, 2012) is accepted, then suppression of dissent definitely has been involved. If, on the other hand, the case presented by Wakefield's critics (Deer, 2011; GMC, 2010) is accepted, it is not feasible to make an informed assessment about suppression on present evidence: because the scrutiny of Wakefield has few comparators, it is not possible to do a simple double-standard comparison. This assessment does not address the question of whether Wakefield's research was valid or whether he violated medical ethics by not declaring a conflict of interest, much less whether his views about the measles vaccine are valid. Wakefield may have been suppressed, or he may have been treated fairly in light of his transgressions, but it is difficult to say for sure given that none of his orthodox peers have had their work investigated to the same level. **A citizen campaigner** Meryl Dorey is an Australian campaigner critical of government vaccination policy. After her son suffered adverse reactions to vaccines, in 1994 she set up a citizens' group, the Australian Vaccination Network (AVN), which presented the negative aspects of vaccination and argued for parental choice in vaccination choices for their children. The AVN is similar to other vaccine-critical groups in various countries (Hobson-West, 2007). Although Dorey lacks any training or credentials relevant to the vaccination issue, through years of personal study she became a formidable commentator and debater. This was significant in the Australian context, because there has been only one Australian scientist or physician - namely, scientist Dr Viera Scheibner - who has been an outspoken critic of vaccination (Scheibner, 1993). Dorey, through her strenuous efforts, became the highest profile figure able to muster facts and figures critical of vaccination. In 2009, a group called Stop the Australian Vaccination Network (SAVN) was set up with the stated aim of shutting down the AVN. SAVN's main presence was a Facebook page with thousands of friends. Those linked to SAVN - called here SAVNers - included some physicians, nurses, and other professionals, but there were no apparent links to professional organizations, such as the Australian Medical Association. SAVNers and others used various techniques to attack the AVN. Dorey was singled out as a key target (AVN, 2014; Martin, 2011, 2012a; SAVN, 2014). SAVN made unsupported claims that the AVN believed in a global conspiracy to implant mind-control chips via vaccination. SAVNers made abusive comments about Dorey and vaccine critics, and created derogatory images. SAVNers made dozens of complaints about the AVN to government agencies, serving as a form of harassment on those occasions when the AVN had to respond. When Dorey was scheduled to give a talk, SAVNers wrote to the venues criticizing her and seeking to prevent her speaking. After Dorey was interviewed or reported in the media, SAVNers complained to the media companies, seeking to discourage them from giving her any visibility. When Dorey commented on blogs of other vaccine-critical groups, SAVNers joined the blogs and disrupted the conversations through hostile comments about Dorey and the beliefs of the bloggers. Another group, Vaccine Information and Awareness Society, posted a ""Hall of Shame"" with names and addresses of critics of vaccination and of individuals and businesses who had advertised in the AVN's magazine Living Wisdom, opening them to harassment. Anonymous individuals sent pornographic images to Dorey and others in the AVN. Anonymous individuals made threatening calls to Dorey's phone. Two such calls were recorded and traced to the home of a founder of SAVN. Discussion Each of the individuals discussed here was critical, to some degree, of vaccination orthodoxy, and each was subject to adverse actions. The question, in each case, is whether the adverse actions were linked to their dissent on vaccination. Their antagonists, in every instance, justified their actions by the shortcomings of the individual. What is distinctive is they never use the double standard test: in no case have the vaccine critic's performance and behavior been carefully compared to others who are pro-vaccination. Adverse actions are always justified on a case-by-case basis, with the standards essentially created for the occasion. The analysis here is preliminary. Each of these cases could be investigated in more detail, and other cases examined. However, even with this limited data set, it seems plausible to conclude that a key factor in the actions taken against these individuals was their criticism of vaccination. Additional support for this conclusion comes from the pattern in this area. The best counter-evidence to this conclusion would be a set of examples in which individuals supportive of vaccination suffered reprisals. Many more cases would be needed to provide convincing counter-evidence, given that there are many more supporters than critics of vaccination, especially among scientists and physicians. One argument for the actions against critics is that it is not credible to criticize vaccination. Sometimes the label ""anti-vaccination"" is used, though seldom defined. For supporters of the orthodoxy, it seems that anyone who criticizes the orthodoxy in any way is labeled ""anti-vaccination,"" though many of the critics have concerns only about some vaccines or about vaccination schedules. Sometimes the label ""anti-science"" is applied to critics, implying that there can be no legitimate scientific concerns about vaccination. Although the number of cases is small, they can be used to illustrate the different sorts of vulnerabilities of individuals in different situations. It is useful to consider the four key areas of reputations, speech, research opportunities, and employment. Reputation In all cases, the individual's credibility was a key target for attack. Credibility can be damaged in several ways. The most direct is through derogatory comments, for example through abusive blogs or hostile media stories. However, probably more important is the reputation damage caused by official actions, such as deregistration hearings and adverse findings, such as The Lancet 's retraction of Wakefield's paper and the public warning about the Australian Vaccination Network issued by the Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC). Official bodies are seen by many in the public as being fair-minded, namely as dispensing justice, even when they are running an agenda, so when they take action it can be highly damaging to reputations. This is true even when the actions are later exposed as invalid, as was the HCCC's legal authority to issue a warning about the AVN. The impact of official actions is augmented by the efforts of pro-vaccination campaigners, who repeatedly highlight the official actions, and by journalists, who treat the statements of official bodies as newsworthy. Speech Communication opportunities include publication of scientific articles, papers given at scientific conferences, interviews in the mass media, and public talks. Different forums offer differing levels of credibility and different sorts of audiences. Attempts were made to prevent Goldman from submitting scientific papers and having them published. This sort of censorship was aimed at limiting his access to a highly credible forum, namely the scientific literature. In contrast, a citizen campaigner like Dorey seeks primarily to address wider audiences. Attempts were made to block her access to speaking venues and to news media. Research opportunities For scientists, doing research may require laboratory facilities, access to research subjects, and funding to hire staff and pay for materials. Withdrawing or preventing research opportunities is a means for suppressing dissent. For example, Goldman was not given permission to interview parents about shingles, thereby blocking his capacity to deepen his studies. Research opportunities are less relevant to those not undertaking research, such as physicians and citizen campaigners. Employment Having a job provides income and sometimes may offer professional opportunities and enhance one's reputation. The threat of losing one's job or even one's career can be enough to discourage dissent. Scientists and physicians alike are vulnerable to threats to their employment. Deregistration can serve to bar a physician from their career, at least without making a huge upheaval. Donegan was threatened with deregistration; Wakefield was deregistered and left Britain to continue his career. In contrast, some citizen campaigners, such as Dorey, are less dependent on career employment. They may need to a job for purposes of income, but are not tied to a particular profession: they can obtain a job in an area unrelated to their dissent. **Conclusion** The cases described here provide evidence for a pattern - not a conspiracy - of suppression of vaccination dissent. A more comprehensive analysis would look at a larger number of cases and do a more systematic comparison between dissenters and non-dissenters. However, even the limited number of cases treated here is enough to suggest that suppression of dissent occurs and to give some preliminary indications of methods used in different circumstances. It is predictable that attacks on dissent will target the specific vulnerabilities of individual dissenters. Four main areas of potential vulnerability are apparent from the case studies: reputation, speech, research opportunities, and employment. Researchers can be targeted in all four areas, whereas physicians and citizen campaigners do not need to do research. Citizen campaigners are especially difficult to suppress, as suggested by the scale and diversity of the attack on Meryl Dorey and the Australian Vaccination Network. Researchers are especially significant because of their status as scientists. In an area where health departments, prestigious scientists and physicians all support a position, even a few dissenting scientists can make a huge difference to public perceptions: they change the issue from apparent unanimity into one involving credible debate. This is why, in such circumstances, suppression of dissent is so important. If dissenters can be silenced or discredited, then it seems as if all experts agree. All that remain are citizen activists. In an arena where citizens are the main critics of orthodoxy, a slightly different process can occur. Citizen campaigners who develop a profile remain a threat to orthodoxy, though not so potent as dissident scientists and physicians. Dorey developed considerable knowledge and skills, and few supporters of vaccination were willing to debate her. By silencing and discrediting her and her organization, visible dissent would be greatly reduced. The consequences of suppressing dissent can be quite significant. Most obviously, the careers of those targeted can be disrupted or destroyed. Probably more important is the chilling effect: when others see what happens to dissenters, many will become less likely to do anything that risks triggering the same sort of reaction. Most of Wakefield's collaborators signed a retraction of an interpretation of their findings, something unlikely without the storm of protest against the paper. Because of the abuse experienced by Dorey, other members of the committee of the AVN preferred that their identity not be known so they would not be subject to similar treatment. When researchers are reluctant to undertake studies in particular fields, and governments and corporations do not want to fund studies, the result can be a gap in knowledge: particular topics are understudied, even though resources are available to study them and some people would like them investigated. Such gaps in research due to the influence of vested interests are called ""undone science"" (Frickel et al., 2010; Hess, 2006, 2009). The primary cause of undone science is the unwillingness of funding organizations to support research in the area, because the findings might be unwelcome. Suppression of dissent operates as a supplementary mechanism to prevent and discourage researchers from studying these topics. Suppression of dissent, through its chilling effect, can skew public debates, by discouraging participation. In Australia, critics of vaccination have become aware that if they become visible, they are potentially subject to denigration and complaints. Because of the level of personal abuse by pro-vaccinationists, many of those who might take a middle-of-the-road perspective, perhaps being slightly critical of some aspects of vaccine policy, are discouraged from expressing their views. The result is a highly polarized public discourse that is not conducive to the sort of careful deliberation desirable for addressing complex issues. According to the highest ideals of science, ideas should be judged on their merits, and addressed through mustering evidence and logic. Suppression of dissent is a violation of these ideals. Challenging suppression is part of the struggle to push science towards its own stated principles. URL"

Executive summary &amp; link to the report.",6,6lmc70,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6lmc70/hacking_uk_trident_report_on_the_hacking_of_the/,2017-07-07 01:06:57,"**Executive Summary** * *This paper reviews the growing potential for cyber-attack on the UKs operational fleet of Vanguard-class submarines armed with nuclear-tipped Trident II D-5 ballistic missiles, and some of the implications for strategic stability.* A successful attack could neutralise operations, lead to loss of life, defeat or perhaps even the catastrophic exchange of nuclear warheads (directly or indirectly). But the very possibility of cyber-attack and the growing capability to launch them against SSBNs, could have a severe impact upon the confidence of maintaining an assured secondstrike capability and therefore on strategic stability between states. Recent suggestions that the fleet is vulnerable have sometimes been met with complacency and claims that the isolated airgapped systems cannot be penetrated. Whilst we recognise that it is important not to be alarmist, these claims are false. In a time of global interconnectivity and enhanced accessibility to cyber tools, cyber warfare has already become a vital component of conventional warfare, a new military domain in its own right. We are not talking about a lone wolf teenager in a basement hacking into the controls of a missile and warhead and starting a nuclear war. Rather, we consider the most significant threat by some margin originates from the expanding investments by leading states in their offensive cyber capabilities, alongside their exiting intelligence networks. The exponential growth in the complexity of cyber-attack techniques outmatches the defensive capabilities, a trend that can only continue partly because any defensive operations have to anticipate all possible attack vectors before they are mounted, and partly because the most effective form of defensive cyber operation involves offensive cyber intelligence (hacking into ones opponents systems to glean information on what it is they are attempting to penetrate and why). This has a transformative impact upon all forms of warfare. But there is a particular danger associated with nuclear weapons by virtue of their destructiveness that demands policy makers and those responsible for managing the systems to consider more seriously the dangers involved when deploying nuclear weapon systems in an ever-changing technical and strategic environment. Malware injection during manufacturing, mid-life refurbishment or software updates and data transmission interception allow potential adversaries to conduct long-term cyber operations. BASIC has already highlighted the future potential for emerging technologies to deliver high confidence in global detection of submarines. Future weaponized underwater drones may facilitate close proximity kinetic and cyber-attacks on ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs). Advanced nano and bionic technologies such as implantable and subdermal data storage and communication devices may be smuggled into the vessel and activated autonomously, manually or remotely. This report considers the major electronic network and communication systems associated with the UK Trident system to identify its level of exposure to modern and future cyber-attacks. It reviews the submarine systems architecture and its *modus operandi*, and identifies potentially applicable cyber-attack techniques and scenarios. As it is based upon publicly available sources, its conclusions cannot be considered final or definitive. The report provides illustrative attack vectors aimed at disrupting, destroying or endangering operations. On the other hand, it also confirms that it takes sophisticated, well-resourced and sustained cyber- attacks to exploit the vulnerabilities in remote submarine subsystems. These attacks are beyond the scope of all but the most well-resourced and extensive nonstate groups. Essentially, the principal threat comes from other states cyber operations alongside extensive and highly sophisticated intelligence activities. The overall submarine network architecture is physically isolated from the internet and any civilian network, thus severely limiting the possibility of real time external access into the command network by remote hackers. This does not prevent attacks from inside the submarine or the prior injection of malware into submarines, missiles, warheads or other infrastructure at the manufacturing, construction and maintenance stages. Regular radio-transmissions from ashore could be used for limited bandwidth cyberattacks, spoofing or activating preinstalled malware programmes. Such highly covert, adaptive and targeted programmes could be designed to trigger in response to particular events. This was the case in the advanced malware used in the so-called Stuxnet or Olympic Games attack on Irans centrifuge systems, a cyber-physical attack that was delivered into Natanz by unsuspecting subcontractors. The report concludes that the vulnerability to cyber- attacks is real. It can be reduced by significant, vigilant and continuous cyber protection, but cannot be eliminated. It is therefore essential that in addition to significant investment in cyber defence, those responsible also need to consider strategies that build resilience within the systems, and to incorporate this threat into broader assessments relevant to the choice of weapon systems, platforms and broader defence and security strategies. The challenge of maintaining covert and secure patrols under reliable operational control is of utmost importance to an effective nuclear deterrence posture based upon submarines. The continuous and rapid development of new cyber technologies will inevitably result in some loss of confidence in future patrols, with negative results on strategic stability. It is crystal clear that the highest level of priority must be given to cyber protection at every stage in the construction of the UKs Dreadnought class, across the whole supply chain, if the UK is to contain this hit on confidence. This will inevitably have major implications for the programme budget, with uncertain success. complete report: URL "
94,vulnerability,conspiracy,Vaccines and autism,22,6nd58l,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6nd58l/vaccines_and_autism/,2017-07-15 11:01:34,"Okay. I give up. Vaccines do not cause autism. Autism is a behavioral diagnosis. In order to receive the diagnosis of Autism a child must exhibit a certain number of behaviors over a certain time frame. If he or she does not do so, the diagnosis of autism is not warranted. There is no blood test for autism. Autism cant be confirmed or ruled-out by laboratory analysis. Its strictly a behavioral diagnosis. Therefore, anything that causes physiological damage cannot directly cause autism. Ergo vaccines cannot cause autism. Vaccines cause other stuff. Vaccines cause encephalitis. Vaccines cause seizures. Vaccines cause immune system deficiencies. Vaccines cause gastrointestinal problems. Encephalitis causes mood swings. Encephalitis causes extreme pain. Encephalitis causes inattention and impulsivity. Encephalitis causes aggression. Encephalitis causes balance problems and difficulty relating to ones environment. Seizures cause mood swings. Seizures cause inattention and impulsivity. Seizures cause alterations in conciousness. Immune system deficiencies cause children to have more frequent bacterial infections, such as ear infections, upper respiratory infections (URIs), sinusutis, and strep infections. Immune system deficiencies cause children to have more frequent viral infections, such as stomatitis, fevers of unknown origin, viral rashes, hives, conjunctivitis, and gastrointestinal viruses that cause vomiting and diarrhea. Immune system deficiencies cause children to be more vulnerable to everything thats going around and to have a tougher time getting over things than their peers. Gastrointestinal damage from vaccines causes diarrhea. Gastrointestinal damage from vaccines causes nausea, reflux, vomiting, and the recently discovered disease now known as GERD (Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease). Gatrointestinal damage from vaccines causes increased vulnerability to viruses and bacteria, which leads to increased administration of antibiotics, which leads to overgrowth of pathogenic yeast. Pathogenic yeast overgrowth leads to intestinal hyperpermeability (leaky gut syndrome). Pathogenic yeast overgrowth leads to constipation. Pathogenic yeast overgrowth leads to food allergies. Pathogenic yeast overgrowth leads to skin eruptions, drunken, silly behavior, inattention and impulsivity, and cravings for bread, sugar, ice cream, milk, and carbohydrates. Technically, vaccines do not cause autism because techincally there is no such thing as autism. Vaccines cause the underlying physical conditions that result in the pain, neurological damage, immune system disorders, gastrointestinal damage, and yeast overgrowth  all of which combine to produce the behavioral symptoms that result in the autism diagnosis. Gastrointestinal damage is the most obvious result of vaccine damage. When a previously healthy child suddenly starts having multiple episodes of watery and extremely stinky diarrhea every day, and this happens shortly after receiving vaccinations, it is notable as a vaccine injury. What is not so obvious is that when the childs gut is permanently damaged, he or she is no longer able to absorb nutrients necessary to produce neurotransmitters necessary for proper brain function. So when the child develops mood swings, sleep difficulties, and learning disabilities several months later, these issues are not recognized as being related to the vaccine injury because the initial damage occurred many months earlier. Please re-read the previous paragraph. This is why Dr. Andrew Wakefield is such a threat to the pharmaceutical industry. Dr. Wakefield NEVER said vaccines cause autism. Dr. Wakefield is a gastroenterologist. He saw a number of children with gastrointestinal problems who also happened to be diagnosed with autism. Dr. Wakefield reported his observations. He never claimed that the MMR caused autism. He merely reported that a number of children he had seen had BOTH gastrointestinal problems AND autism, and according to parental report, these issues developed within a short time of when the children received the MMR vaccine. Again Why is Dr. Wakefield such a threat to the pharmaceutical industry? Hint: Not because vaccines cause autism  they dont. Vaccines cause gastrointestinal damage. Gastrointestinal damage causes malabsorption of nutrients necessary for proper brain function. Malabsorption of essential nutrients causes immune system disorders, seizures, encephalopathy, etc and THATs what leads to the ultimate diagnosis of autism. If Dr. Wakefields observations are correct, SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE will eventually draw the connection between vaccines and the domino-effect that leads to the autism diagnosis. From the perspective of the pharmaceutical industry, better to nip it in the bud now, which means discrediting Dr. Wakefield to the extent that no one will look further into the science. Has this ploy worked? Not for me. And not for many of the very intelligent parents I know. Only time will tell if there are enough of us to make a difference. -Marcella Piper-Terry Founder of vaxtruth.org"

Just to summarize for anyone who doesn't know, there's a piece of malware out there right now called WannaCry doing all kinds of damage, thanks to an elite new NSA intrusion method which allows it to **pass unchecked between networked computers and automatically execute itself on any version of Windows.** It's pretty savage and you can Google it or whatever to learn more about it. There's a patch, but I figure maybe some of you guys might be paranoid and sketched out like I am. I don't like the idea of a mandatory patch everyone suddenly needs on his computer immediately, I mean, I don't trust any of these guys, who knows what the hell bullshit they're trying to get me to install with these scare tactics.

Anyone else who also wants to do this, you can follow the simple instructions on this page: [right here.](URL You specifically want to disable the **SMBv1 protocol** and it's likely that your computer is an ""SMB client"". So just scroll down to the section about the SMB client and do what the instructions tell you to disable the SMBv1 protocol.

EDIT: oh ya by the way. Just to be clear, this fix will not make you immune to having the malware execute on your computer. You can still be infected by the malware if you do stupid shit like download mystery attachments from your email, or run the wrong exe file. However this fix will specifically keep you safe from the malware transferring itself to your computer through another networked computer and automatically running itself, which is BY FAR the most dangerous thing about it."

If this blog is to be Trusted URL (and I believe it is), the new URL is interesting. **ayylmao**tjhsstasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf.com Now, they suggest: &gt; the fact it contains lmao would mean, if the above attribution is correct, that the attacker is purposely sending multiple messages. Now, here's where my ""Internet Culture"" logic kicks up a fuss. I *live* on the internet.... something just screams to me.... There's only two details, that are jumping out at me, and its grasping for straws, but both of them are way less 'far reaching' than a lot of past theories that have lead to success. 1. I doubt whether North Korea is up to date on its 'Dank Memes', What the blogger missed is that 'AyyLMAO' is the message, not just LMAO. (google the meme if you're not aware of this alien) 2. There is only one other part of that URL that isn't adsf keyboard smashing, and the letters don't fall anywhere near each other, nor near finger resting points after typing 'LMAO'; **tjhsst**. There is only one google result for this acronym; ""Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology"" Now, this sounds like stabbing in the dark, and it most likely is! However, we now have a virus, based on a 'known patched vulnerability', using tools that were popular on the dark-web, using current 'Memes', and a *VERY LONG STRETCH* that MIGHT link it to a high school. * Possible Target? * Possible Source? * Pure Coincidence? To top this all off, *they* know, that *we* know, that there is a 'kill switch'. They're simply changing it, they don't remove it. Which means one of two things. 1. They're scared it'll get TOO out of control, and they need to shut it down. 2. It's designed to send messages over the course of it's life. 'North Korean Hackers' out to destabilize the world don't leave a known kill method in place with each revision. Its literally like terrorists having a big 'Abort!' button on their chests as they run into a building.... **My money, is still on kids who released some code based on some easily available back door software.** I think any of this 'North Korea' link comes form stealing any of the publicly available 'Crypto suite' code, which could easily be from Lazarus to begin with in an earlier more simple suite, and re coding it with EternalBlue as a delivery method. As a last point, this 'virus' is missing one crucial sign that it's from somewhere other than western; Bad grammar. Yeah that's a little racist, but even 10yo mass mailing worms that have been 'revised' can't get natural english 'flow' to their wording. This one? Perfect..... Well, that's all, I have no real leads, just a theory I wanted to share."

Their strategy was set from the beginning, the only way they could win over the power of capitalism was by gaining control of the USA somehow, so after rising to power and establishing a very successful dictatorship, he should patiently look for an entry. He was even trained to identify those entries, and they could be in any form, call it a diplomatic incident, or a generalized sense of gloom in the US, or even a person, a very influential person that could be easily manipulated to hand in the power later on by some mechanism. Putin found that man, and he dazzled him with prospects of power an wealth. The means had been perfection-ed, internet had achieved a peaking point of fragility and vulnerability, Facebook had released a bottom-line changing algorithm that gave out many loopholes to exploit. The weather could not be more favorable, the divide was so huge in the country, the loud fake news took it all to a point-of-no-return that positively fed itself back. Now we are living an illegitimate presidency in which absurd policies that might change the course of many years to come are being passed. Seems like these policies serve a bigger purpose, nevertheless. They seem to be designed to create more divide, to create more awe and become more viral, much like Trump's campaign. The objective is not to reshape policies in the US, the objective is to create an unanimous environment of aversion towards the establishment and specially conservative republican values. This would then open space for the entrance of a much stronger leftist counterpart with overall approval and hand picked by Putin. That is the moment when the finalize the objective of the plan. "

100,vulnerability,conspiracy,Internet Troll Tactics,7,5wslia,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5wslia/internet_troll_tactics/,2017-03-01 13:55:49,"1. COINTELPRO Techniques for dilution, misdirection and control of a internet forum 2. Twenty-Five Rules of Disinformation 3. Eight Traits of the Disinformationalist 4. How to Spot a Spy (Cointelpro Agent) 5. Seventeen Techniques for Truth Suppression ______________________________________________________________________________________ COINTELPRO Techniques for dilution, misdirection and control of a internet forum.. There are several techniques for the control and manipulation of a internet forum no matter what, or who is on it. We will go over each technique and demonstrate that only a minimal number of operatives can be used to eventually and effectively gain a control of a 'uncontrolled forum.' Technique #1 - 'FORUM SLIDING' If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by 'forum sliding.' In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to 'age.' Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a 'forum slide.' The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a 'forum slide' and 'flush' the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then 'replying' to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting 'slides' down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items. Technique #2 - 'CONSENSUS CRACKING' A second highly effective technique (which you can see in operation all the time at URL is 'consensus cracking.' To develop a consensus crack, the following technique is used. Under the guise of a fake account a posting is made which looks legitimate and is towards the truth is made - but the critical point is that it has a VERY WEAK PREMISE without substantive proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under alternative fake accounts a very strong position in your favour is slowly introduced over the life of the posting. It is IMPERATIVE that both sides are initially presented, so the uninformed reader cannot determine which side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger 'evidence' or disinformation in your favour is slowly 'seeded in.' Thus the uninformed reader will most like develop the same position as you, and if their position is against you their opposition to your posting will be most likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings, you can then 'abort' the consensus cracking by initiating a 'forum slide.' Technique #3 - 'TOPIC DILUTION' Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a 'RESOURCE BURN.' By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a 'gossip mode.' In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to 'drive in the wedge.' By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator. Technique #4 - 'INFORMATION COLLECTION' Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a 'show you mine so me yours' posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered. An example is to post your 'favourite weapon' and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favourite 'technique of operation.' From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities. Technique #5 - 'ANGER TROLLING' Statistically, there is always a percentage of the forum posters who are more inclined to violence. In order to determine who these individuals are, it is a requirement to present a image to the forum to deliberately incite a strong psychological reaction. From this the most violent in the group can be effectively singled out for reverse IP location and possibly local enforcement tracking. To accomplish this only requires posting a link to a video depicting a local police officer massively abusing his power against a very innocent individual. Statistically of the million or so police officers in America there is always one or two being caught abusing there powers and the taping of the activity can be then used for intelligence gathering purposes - without the requirement to 'stage' a fake abuse video. This method is extremely effective, and the more so the more abusive the video can be made to look. Sometimes it is useful to 'lead' the forum by replying to your own posting with your own statement of violent intent, and that you 'do not care what the authorities think!!' inflammation. By doing this and showing no fear it may be more effective in getting the more silent and self-disciplined violent intent members of the forum to slip and post their real intentions. This can be used later in a court of law during prosecution. Technique #6 - 'GAINING FULL CONTROL' It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the 'ultimate victory' as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a 'honey pot' gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes. CONCLUSION Remember these techniques are only effective if the forum participants DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THEM. Once they are aware of these techniques the operation can completely fail, and the forum can become uncontrolled. At this point other avenues must be considered such as initiating a false legal precidence to simply have the forum shut down and taken offline. This is not desirable as it then leaves the enforcement agencies unable to track the percentage of those in the population who always resist attempts for control against them. Many other techniques can be utilized and developed by the individual and as you develop further techniques of infiltration and control it is imperative to share then with HQ. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Twenty-Five Rules of Disinformation Note: The first rule and last five (or six, depending on situation) rules are generally not directly within the ability of the traditional disinfo artist to apply. These rules are generally used more directly by those at the leadership, key players, or planning level of the criminal conspiracy or conspiracy to cover up. 1. Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. Regardless of what you know, don't discuss it -- especially if you are a public figure, news anchor, etc. If it's not reported, it didn't happen, and you never have to deal with the issues. 2. Become incredulous and indignant. Avoid discussing key issues and instead focus on side issues which can be used show the topic as being critical of some otherwise sacrosanct group or theme. This is also known as the 'How dare you!' gambit. 3. Create rumor mongers. Avoid discussing issues by describing all charges, regardless of venue or evidence, as mere rumors and wild accusations. Other derogatory terms mutually exclusive of truth may work as well. This method which works especially well with a silent press, because the only way the public can learn of the facts are through such 'arguable rumors'. If you can associate the material with the Internet, use this fact to certify it a 'wild rumor' from a 'bunch of kids on the Internet' which can have no basis in fact. 4. Use a straw man. Find or create a seeming element of your opponent's argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues. 5. Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary 'attack the messenger' ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as 'kooks', 'right-wing', 'liberal', 'left-wing', 'terrorists', 'conspiracy buffs', 'radicals', 'militia', 'racists', 'religious fanatics', 'sexual deviates', and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues. 6. Hit and Run. In any public forum, make a brief attack of your opponent or the opponent position and then scamper off before an answer can be fielded, or simply ignore any answer. This works extremely well in Internet and letters-to-the-editor environments where a steady stream of new identities can be called upon without having to explain criticism, reasoning -- simply make an accusation or other attack, never discussing issues, and never answering any subsequent response, for that would dignify the opponent's viewpoint. 7. Question motives. Twist or amplify any fact which could be taken to imply that the opponent operates out of a hidden personal agenda or other bias. This avoids discussing issues and forces the accuser on the defensive. 8. Invoke authority. Claim for yourself or associate yourself with authority and present your argument with enough 'jargon' and 'minutia' to illustrate you are 'one who knows', and simply say it isn't so without discussing issues or demonstrating concretely why or citing sources. 9. Play Dumb. No matter what evidence or logical argument is offered, avoid discussing issues except with denials they have any credibility, make any sense, provide any proof, contain or make a point, have logic, or support a conclusion. Mix well for maximum effect. 10. Associate opponent charges with old news. A derivative of the straw man -- usually, in any large-scale matter of high visibility, someone will make charges early on which can be or were already easily dealt with - a kind of investment for the future should the matter not be so easily contained.) Where it can be foreseen, have your own side raise a straw man issue and have it dealt with early on as part of the initial contingency plans. Subsequent charges, regardless of validity or new ground uncovered, can usually then be associated with the original charge and dismissed as simply being a rehash without need to address current issues -- so much the better where the opponent is or was involved with the original source. 11. Establish and rely upon fall-back positions. Using a minor matter or element of the facts, take the 'high road' and 'confess' with candor that some innocent mistake, in hindsight, was made -- but that opponents have seized on the opportunity to blow it all out of proportion and imply greater criminalities which, 'just isn't so.' Others can reinforce this on your behalf, later, and even publicly 'call for an end to the nonsense' because you have already 'done the right thing.' Done properly, this can garner sympathy and respect for 'coming clean' and 'owning up' to your mistakes without addressing more serious issues. 12. Enigmas have no solution. Drawing upon the overall umbrella of events surrounding the crime and the multitude of players and events, paint the entire affair as too complex to solve. This causes those otherwise following the matter to begin to lose interest more quickly without having to address the actual issues. 13. Alice in Wonderland Logic. Avoid discussion of the issues by reasoning backwards or with an apparent deductive logic which forbears any actual material fact. 14. Demand complete solutions. Avoid the issues by requiring opponents to solve the crime at hand completely, a ploy which works best with issues qualifying for rule 10. 15. Fit the facts to alternate conclusions. This requires creative thinking unless the crime was planned with contingency conclusions in place. 16. Vanish evidence and witnesses. If it does not exist, it is not fact, and you won't have to address the issue. 17. Change the subject. Usually in connection with one of the other ploys listed here, find a way to side-track the discussion with abrasive or controversial comments in hopes of turning attention to a new, more manageable topic. This works especially well with companions who can 'argue' with you over the new topic and polarize the discussion arena in order to avoid discussing more key issues. 18. Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents. If you can't do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how 'sensitive they are to criticism.' 19. Ignore proof presented, demand impossible proofs. This is perhaps a variant of the 'play dumb' rule. Regardless of what material may be presented by an opponent in public forums, claim the material irrelevant and demand proof that is impossible for the opponent to come by (it may exist, but not be at his disposal, or it may be something which is known to be safely destroyed or withheld, such as a murder weapon.) In order to completely avoid discussing issues, it may be required that you to categorically deny and be critical of media or books as valid sources, deny that witnesses are acceptable, or even deny that statements made by government or other authorities have any meaning or relevance. 20. False evidence. Whenever possible, introduce new facts or clues designed and manufactured to conflict with opponent presentations -- as useful tools to neutralize sensitive issues or impede resolution. This works best when the crime was designed with contingencies for the purpose, and the facts cannot be easily separated from the fabrications. 21. Call a Grand Jury, Special Prosecutor, or other empowered investigative body. Subvert the (process) to your benefit and effectively neutralize all sensitive issues without open discussion. Once convened, the evidence and testimony are required to be secret when properly handled. For instance, if you own the prosecuting attorney, it can insure a Grand Jury hears no useful evidence and that the evidence is sealed and unavailable to subsequent investigators. Once a favorable verdict is achieved, the matter can be considered officially closed. Usually, this technique is applied to find the guilty innocent, but it can also be used to obtain charges when seeking to frame a victim. 22. Manufacture a new truth. Create your own expert(s), group(s), author(s), leader(s) or influence existing ones willing to forge new ground via scientific, investigative, or social research or testimony which concludes favorably. In this way, if you must actually address issues, you can do so authoritatively. 23. Create bigger distractions. If the above does not seem to be working to distract from sensitive issues, or to prevent unwanted media coverage of unstoppable events such as trials, create bigger news stories (or treat them as such) to distract the multitudes. 24. Silence critics. If the above methods do not prevail, consider removing opponents from circulation by some definitive solution so that the need to address issues is removed entirely. This can be by their death, arrest and detention, blackmail or destruction of their character by release of blackmail information, or merely by destroying them financially, emotionally, or severely damaging their health. 25. Vanish. If you are a key holder of secrets or otherwise overly illuminated and you think the heat is getting too hot, to avoid the issues, vacate the kitchen. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Eight Traits of the Disinformationalist 1) Avoidance. They never actually discuss issues head-on or provide constructive input, generally avoiding citation of references or credentials. Rather, they merely imply this, that, and the other. Virtually everything about their presentation implies their authority and expert knowledge in the matter without any further justification for credibility. 2) Selectivity. They tend to pick and choose opponents carefully, either applying the hit-and-run approach against mere commentators supportive of opponents, or focusing heavier attacks on key opponents who are known to directly address issues. Should a commentator become argumentative with any success, the focus will shift to include the commentator as well. 3) Coincidental. They tend to surface suddenly and somewhat coincidentally with a new controversial topic with no clear prior record of participation in general discussions in the particular public arena involved. They likewise tend to vanish once the topic is no longer of general concern. They were likely directed or elected to be there for a reason, and vanish with the reason. 4) Teamwork. They tend to operate in self-congratulatory and complementary packs or teams. Of course, this can happen naturally in any public forum, but there will likely be an ongoing pattern of frequent exchanges of this sort where professionals are involved. Sometimes one of the players will infiltrate the opponent camp to become a source for straw man or other tactics designed to dilute opponent presentation strength. 5) Anti-conspiratorial. They almost always have disdain for 'conspiracy theorists' and, usually, for those who in any way believe JFK was not killed by LHO. Ask yourself why, if they hold such disdain for conspiracy theorists, do they focus on defending a single topic discussed in a NG focusing on conspiracies? One might think they would either be trying to make fools of everyone on every topic, or simply ignore the group they hold in such disdain.Or, one might more rightly conclude they have an ulterior motive for their actions in going out of their way to focus as they do. 6) Artificial Emotions. An odd kind of 'artificial' emotionalism and an unusually thick skin -- an ability to persevere and persist even in the face of overwhelming criticism and unacceptance. This likely stems from intelligence community training that, no matter how condemning the evidence, deny everything, and never become emotionally involved or reactive. The net result for a disinfo artist is that emotions can seem artificial. Most people, if responding in anger, for instance, will express their animosity throughout their rebuttal. But disinfo types usually have trouble maintaining the 'image' and are hot and cold with respect to pretended emotions and their usually more calm or unemotional communications style. It's just a job, and they often seem unable to 'act their role in character' as well in a communications medium as they might be able in a real face-to-face conversation/confrontation. You might have outright rage and indignation one moment, ho-hum the next, and more anger later -- an emotional yo-yo. With respect to being thick-skinned, no amount of criticism will deter them from doing their job, and they will generally continue their old disinfo patterns without any adjustments to criticisms of how obvious it is that they play that game -- where a more rational individual who truly cares what others think might seek to improve their communications style, substance, and so forth, or simply give up. 7) Inconsistent. There is also a tendency to make mistakes which betray their true self/motives. This may stem from not really knowing their topic, or it may be somewhat 'freudian', so to speak, in that perhaps they really root for the side of truth deep within. I have noted that often, they will simply cite contradictory information which neutralizes itself and the author. For instance, one such player claimed to be a Navy pilot, but blamed his poor communicating skills (spelling, grammar, incoherent style) on having only a grade-school education. I'm not aware of too many Navy pilots who don't have a college degree. Another claimed no knowledge of a particular topic/situation but later claimed first-hand knowledge of it. 8) Time Constant. Recently discovered, with respect to News Groups, is the response time factor. There are three ways this can be seen to work, especially when the government or other empowered player is involved in a cover up operation: a) ANY NG posting by a targeted proponent for truth can result in an IMMEDIATE response. The government and other empowered players can afford to pay people to sit there and watch for an opportunity to do some damage. SINCE DISINFO IN A NG ONLY WORKS IF THE READER SEES IT - FAST RESPONSE IS CALLED FOR, or the visitor may be swayed towards truth. b) When dealing in more direct ways with a disinformationalist, such as email, DELAY IS CALLED FOR - there will usually be a minimum of a 48-72 hour delay. This allows a sit-down team discussion on response strategy for best effect, and even enough time to 'get permission' or instruction from a formal chain of command. c) In the NG example 1) above, it will often ALSO be seen that bigger guns are drawn and fired after the same 48-72 hours delay - the team approach in play. This is especially true when the targeted truth seeker or their comments are considered more important with respect to potential to reveal truth. Thus, a serious truth sayer will be attacked twice for the same sin. ______________________________________________________________________________________ How to Spot a Spy (Cointelpro Agent) One way to neutralize a potential activist is to get them to be in a group that does all the wrong things. Why? 1) The message doesn't get out. 2) A lot of time is wasted 3) The activist is frustrated and discouraged 4) Nothing good is accomplished. FBI and Police Informers and Infiltrators will infest any group and they have phoney activist organizations established. Their purpose is to prevent any real movement for justice or eco-peace from developing in this country. Agents come in small, medium or large. They can be of any ethnic background. They can be male or female. The actual size of the group or movement being infiltrated is irrelevant. It is the potential the movement has for becoming large which brings on the spies and saboteurs. This booklet lists tactics agents use to slow things down, foul things up, destroy the movement and keep tabs on activists. It is the agent's job to keep the activist from quitting such a group, thus keeping him/her under control. In some situations, to get control, the agent will tell the activist: ""You're dividing the movement."" [Here, I have added the psychological reasons as to WHY this maneuver works to control people] This invites guilty feelings. Many people can be controlled by guilt. The agents begin relationships with activists behind a well-developed mask of ""dedication to the cause."" Because of their often declared dedication, (and actions designed to prove this), when they criticize the activist, he or she - being truly dedicated to the movement - becomes convinced that somehow, any issues are THEIR fault. This is because a truly dedicated person tends to believe that everyone has a conscience and that nobody would dissimulate and lie like that ""on purpose."" It's amazing how far agents can go in manipulating an activist because the activist will constantly make excuses for the agent who regularly declares their dedication to the cause. Even if they do, occasionally, suspect the agent, they will pull the wool over their own eyes by rationalizing: ""they did that unconsciously... they didn't really mean it... I can help them by being forgiving and accepting "" and so on and so forth. The agent will tell the activist: ""You're a leader!"" This is designed to enhance the activist's self-esteem. His or her narcissistic admiration of his/her own activist/altruistic intentions increase as he or she identifies with and consciously admires the altruistic declarations of the agent which are deliberately set up to mirror those of the activist. This is ""malignant pseudoidentification."" It is the process by which the agent consciously imitates or simulates a certain behavior to foster the activist's identification with him/her, thus increasing the activist's vulnerability to exploitation. The agent will simulate the more subtle self-concepts of the activist. Activists and those who have altruistic self-concepts are most vulnerable to malignant pseudoidentification especially during work with the agent when the interaction includes matter relating to their competency, autonomy, or knowledge. The goal of the agent is to increase the activist's general empathy for the agent through pseudo-identification with the activist's self-concepts. The most common example of this is the agent who will compliment the activist for his competency or knowledge or value to the movement. On a more subtle level, the agent will simulate affects and mannerisms of the activist which promotes identification via mirroring and feelings of ""twinship"". It is not unheard of for activists, enamored by the perceived helpfulness and competence of a good agent, to find themselves considering ethical violations and perhaps, even illegal behavior, in the service of their agent/handler. The activist's ""felt quality of perfection"" [self-concept] is enhanced, and a strong empathic bond is developed with the agent through his/her imitation and simulation of the victim's own narcissistic investments. [self-concepts] That is, if the activist knows, deep inside, their own dedication to the cause, they will project that onto the agent who is ""mirroring"" them. The activist will be deluded into thinking that the agent shares this feeling of identification and bonding. In an activist/social movement setting, the adversarial roles that activists naturally play vis a vis the establishment/government, fosters ongoing processes of intrapsychic splitting so that ""twinship alliances"" between activist and agent may render whole sectors or reality testing unavailable to the activist. They literally ""lose touch with reality."" Activists who deny their own narcissistic investments [do not have a good idea of their own self-concepts and that they ARE concepts] and consciously perceive themselves (accurately, as it were) to be ""helpers"" endowed with a special amount of altruism are exceedingly vulnerable to the affective (emotional) simulation of the accomplished agent. Empathy is fostered in the activist through the expression of quite visible affects. The presentation of tearfulness, sadness, longing, fear, remorse, and guilt, may induce in the helper-oriented activist a strong sense of compassion, while unconsciously enhancing the activist's narcissistic investment in self as the embodiment of goodness. The agent's expresssion of such simulated affects may be quite compelling to the observer and difficult to distinguish from deep emotion. It can usually be identified by two events, however: First, the activist who has analyzed his/her own narcissistic roots and is aware of his/her own potential for being ""emotionally hooked,"" will be able to remain cool and unaffected by such emotional outpourings by the agent. As a result of this unaffected, cool, attitude, the Second event will occur: The agent will recompensate much too quickly following such an affective expression leaving the activist with the impression that ""the play has ended, the curtain has fallen,"" and the imposture, for the moment, has finished. The agent will then move quickly to another activist/victim. The fact is, the movement doesn't need leaders, it needs MOVERS. ""Follow the leader"" is a waste of time. A good agent will want to meet as often as possible. He or she will talk a lot and say little. One can expect an onslaught of long, unresolved discussions. Some agents take on a pushy, arrogant, or defensive manner: 1) To disrupt the agenda 2) To side-track the discussion 3) To interrupt repeatedly 4) To feign ignorance 5) To make an unfounded accusation against a person. Calling someone a racist, for example. This tactic is used to discredit a person in the eyes of all other group members. Saboteurs Some saboteurs pretend to be activists. She or he will .... 1) Write encyclopedic flyers (in the present day, websites) 2) Print flyers in English only. 3) Have demonstrations in places where no one cares. 4) Solicit funding from rich people instead of grass roots support 5) Display banners with too many words that are confusing. 6) Confuse issues. 7) Make the wrong demands. Cool Compromise the goal. 9) Have endless discussions that waste everyone's time. The agent may accompany the endless discussions with drinking, pot smoking or other amusement to slow down the activist's work. Provocateurs 1) Want to establish ""leaders"" to set them up for a fall in order to stop the movement. 2) Suggest doing foolish, illegal things to get the activists in trouble. 3) Encourage militancy. 4) Want to taunt the authorities. 5) Attempt to make the activist compromise their values. 6) Attempt to instigate violence. Activisim ought to always be non-violent. 7) Attempt to provoke revolt among people who are ill-prepared to deal with the reaction of the authorities to such violence. Informants 1) Want everyone to sign up and sing in and sign everything. 2) Ask a lot of questions (gathering data). 3) Want to know what events the activist is planning to attend. 4) Attempt to make the activist defend him or herself to identify his or her beliefs, goals, and level of committment. Recruiting Legitimate activists do not subject people to hours of persuasive dialog. Their actions, beliefs, and goals speak for themselves. Groups that DO recruit are missionaries, military, and fake political parties or movements set up by agents. Surveillance ALWAYS assume that you are under surveillance. At this point, if you are NOT under surveillance, you are not a very good activist! Scare Tactics They use them. Such tactics include slander, defamation, threats, getting close to disaffected or minimally committed fellow activists to persuade them (via psychological tactics described above) to turn against the movement and give false testimony against their former compatriots. They will plant illegal substances on the activist and set up an arrest; they will plant false information and set up ""exposure,"" they will send incriminating letters [emails] in the name of the activist; and more; they will do whatever society will allow. This booklet in no way covers all the ways agents use to sabotage the lives of sincere an dedicated activists. If an agent is ""exposed,"" he or she will be transferred or replaced. COINTELPRO is still in operation today under a different code name. It is no longer placed on paper where it can be discovered through the freedom of information act. The FBI counterintelligence program's stated purpose: To expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, and otherwise neutralize individuals who the FBI categorize as opposed to the National Interests. ""National Security"" means the FBI's security from the people ever finding out the vicious things it does in violation of people's civil liberties. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Seventeen Techniques for Truth Suppression Strong, credible allegations of high-level criminal activity can bring down a government. When the government lacks an effective, fact-based defense, other techniques must be employed. The success of these techniques depends heavily upon a cooperative, compliant press and a mere token opposition party. 1. Dummy up. If it's not reported, if it's not news, it didn't happen. 2. Wax indignant. This is also known as the ""How dare you?"" gambit. 3. Characterize the charges as ""rumors"" or, better yet, ""wild rumors."" If, in spite of the news blackout, the public is still able to learn about the suspicious facts, it can only be through ""rumors."" (If they tend to believe the ""rumors"" it must be because they are simply ""paranoid"" or ""hysterical."") 4. Knock down straw men. Deal only with the weakest aspects of the weakest charges. Even better, create your own straw men. Make up wild rumors (or plant false stories) and give them lead play when you appear to debunk all the charges, real and fanciful alike. 5. Call the skeptics names like ""conspiracy theorist,"" ""nutcase,"" ""ranter,"" ""kook,"" ""crackpot,"" and, of course, ""rumor monger."" Be sure, too, to use heavily loaded verbs and adjectives when characterizing their charges and defending the ""more reasonable"" government and its defenders. You must then carefully avoid fair and open debate with any of the people you have thus maligned. For insurance, set up your own ""skeptics"" to shoot down. 6. Impugn motives. Attempt to marginalize the critics by suggesting strongly that they are not really interested in the truth but are simply pursuing a partisan political agenda or are out to make money (compared to over-compensated adherents to the government line who, presumably, are not). 7. Invoke authority. Here the controlled press and the sham opposition can be very useful. 8. Dismiss the charges as ""old news."" 9. Come half-clean. This is also known as ""confession and avoidance"" or ""taking the limited hangout route."" This way, you create the impression of candor and honesty while you admit only to relatively harmless, less-than-criminal ""mistakes."" This stratagem often requires the embrace of a fall-back position quite different from the one originally taken. With effective damage control, the fall-back position need only be peddled by stooge skeptics to carefully limited markets. 10. Characterize the crimes as impossibly complex and the truth as ultimately unknowable. 11. Reason backward, using the deductive method with a vengeance. With thoroughly rigorous deduction, troublesome evidence is irrelevant. E.g. We have a completely free press. If evidence exists that the Vince Foster ""suicide"" note was forged, they would have reported it. They haven't reported it so there is no such evidence. Another variation on this theme involves the likelihood of a conspiracy leaker and a press who would report the leak. 12. Require the skeptics to solve the crime completely. E.g. If Foster was murdered, who did it and why? 13. Change the subject. This technique includes creating and/or publicizing distractions. 14. Lightly report incriminating facts, and then make nothing of them. This is sometimes referred to as ""bump and run"" reporting. 15. Baldly and brazenly lie. A favorite way of doing this is to attribute the ""facts"" furnished the public to a plausible-sounding, but anonymous, source. 16. Expanding further on numbers 4 and 5, have your own stooges ""expose"" scandals and champion popular causes. Their job is to pre-empt real opponents and to play 99-yard football. A variation is to pay rich people for the job who will pretend to spend their own money. 17. Flood the Internet with agents. This is the answer to the question, ""What could possibly motivate a person to spend hour upon hour on Internet news groups defending the government and/or the press and harassing genuine critics?"" Don t the authorities have defenders enough in all the newspapers, magazines, radio, and television? One would think refusing to print critical letters and screening out serious callers or dumping them from radio talk shows would be control enough, but, obviously, it is not."

It can be hacked/manipulated to obscure or delete data. Its reliance on the electrical grid is even more troubling. Think about it, it would just take one event and *POOF!* it's all gone. I decided, due to this vulnerability, to begin recording every conspiracy that will be relevant for the historians of tomorrow. Eventually there will come a power who will seek to sweep this history under the rug and I refuse to let that happen so easily. When that day comes, and it will, I want there to be so many personal accounts of our current time that history can no longer be suppressed. I don't know about you but I don't want the historians of tomorrow thinking we were all blindly following like sheep to the slaughter. Some of us saw *it* coming, and we weren't quiet about it.

COINTELPRO Techniques for dilution, misdirection and control of a internet forum 2. Twenty-Five Rules of Disinformation 3. Eight Traits of the Disinformationalist 4. How to Spot a Spy (Cointelpro Agent) 5. Seventeen Techniques for Truth Suppression ______________________________________________________________________________________ COINTELPRO Techniques for dilution, misdirection and control of a internet forum.. There are several techniques for the control and manipulation of a internet forum no matter what, or who is on it. We will go over each technique and demonstrate that only a minimal number of operatives can be used to eventually and effectively gain a control of a 'uncontrolled forum.' Technique #1 - 'FORUM SLIDING' If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by 'forum sliding.' In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to 'age.' Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a 'forum slide.' The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a 'forum slide' and 'flush' the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then 'replying' to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting 'slides' down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items. Technique #2 - 'CONSENSUS CRACKING' A second highly effective technique (which you can see in operation all the time at URL is 'consensus cracking.' To develop a consensus crack, the following technique is used. Under the guise of a fake account a posting is made which looks legitimate and is towards the truth is made - but the critical point is that it has a VERY WEAK PREMISE without substantive proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under alternative fake accounts a very strong position in your favour is slowly introduced over the life of the posting. It is IMPERATIVE that both sides are initially presented, so the uninformed reader cannot determine which side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger 'evidence' or disinformation in your favour is slowly 'seeded in.' Thus the uninformed reader will most like develop the same position as you, and if their position is against you their opposition to your posting will be most likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings, you can then 'abort' the consensus cracking by initiating a 'forum slide.' Technique #3 - 'TOPIC DILUTION' Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a 'RESOURCE BURN.' By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a 'gossip mode.' In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to 'drive in the wedge.' By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator. Technique #4 - 'INFORMATION COLLECTION' Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a 'show you mine so me yours' posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered. An example is to post your 'favourite weapon' and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favourite 'technique of operation.' From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities. Technique #5 - 'ANGER TROLLING' Statistically, there is always a percentage of the forum posters who are more inclined to violence. In order to determine who these individuals are, it is a requirement to present a image to the forum to deliberately incite a strong psychological reaction. From this the most violent in the group can be effectively singled out for reverse IP location and possibly local enforcement tracking. To accomplish this only requires posting a link to a video depicting a local police officer massively abusing his power against a very innocent individual. Statistically of the million or so police officers in America there is always one or two being caught abusing there powers and the taping of the activity can be then used for intelligence gathering purposes - without the requirement to 'stage' a fake abuse video. This method is extremely effective, and the more so the more abusive the video can be made to look. Sometimes it is useful to 'lead' the forum by replying to your own posting with your own statement of violent intent, and that you 'do not care what the authorities think!!' inflammation. By doing this and showing no fear it may be more effective in getting the more silent and self-disciplined violent intent members of the forum to slip and post their real intentions. This can be used later in a court of law during prosecution. Technique #6 - 'GAINING FULL CONTROL' It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the 'ultimate victory' as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a 'honey pot' gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes. CONCLUSION Remember these techniques are only effective if the forum participants DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THEM. Once they are aware of these techniques the operation can completely fail, and the forum can become uncontrolled. At this point other avenues must be considered such as initiating a false legal precidence to simply have the forum shut down and taken offline. This is not desirable as it then leaves the enforcement agencies unable to track the percentage of those in the population who always resist attempts for control against them. Many other techniques can be utilized and developed by the individual and as you develop further techniques of infiltration and control it is imperative to share then with HQ. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Twenty-Five Rules of Disinformation Note: The first rule and last five (or six, depending on situation) rules are generally not directly within the ability of the traditional disinfo artist to apply. These rules are generally used more directly by those at the leadership, key players, or planning level of the criminal conspiracy or conspiracy to cover up. 1. Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. Regardless of what you know, don't discuss it -- especially if you are a public figure, news anchor, etc. If it's not reported, it didn't happen, and you never have to deal with the issues. 2. Become incredulous and indignant. Avoid discussing key issues and instead focus on side issues which can be used show the topic as being critical of some otherwise sacrosanct group or theme. This is also known as the 'How dare you!' gambit. 3. Create rumor mongers. Avoid discussing issues by describing all charges, regardless of venue or evidence, as mere rumors and wild accusations. Other derogatory terms mutually exclusive of truth may work as well. This method which works especially well with a silent press, because the only way the public can learn of the facts are through such 'arguable rumors'. If you can associate the material with the Internet, use this fact to certify it a 'wild rumor' from a 'bunch of kids on the Internet' which can have no basis in fact. 4. Use a straw man. Find or create a seeming element of your opponent's argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues. 5. Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary 'attack the messenger' ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as 'kooks', 'right-wing', 'liberal', 'left-wing', 'terrorists', 'conspiracy buffs', 'radicals', 'militia', 'racists', 'religious fanatics', 'sexual deviates', and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues. 6. Hit and Run. In any public forum, make a brief attack of your opponent or the opponent position and then scamper off before an answer can be fielded, or simply ignore any answer. This works extremely well in Internet and letters-to-the-editor environments where a steady stream of new identities can be called upon without having to explain criticism, reasoning -- simply make an accusation or other attack, never discussing issues, and never answering any subsequent response, for that would dignify the opponent's viewpoint. 7. Question motives. Twist or amplify any fact which could be taken to imply that the opponent operates out of a hidden personal agenda or other bias. This avoids discussing issues and forces the accuser on the defensive. 8. Invoke authority. Claim for yourself or associate yourself with authority and present your argument with enough 'jargon' and 'minutia' to illustrate you are 'one who knows', and simply say it isn't so without discussing issues or demonstrating concretely why or citing sources. 9. Play Dumb. No matter what evidence or logical argument is offered, avoid discussing issues except with denials they have any credibility, make any sense, provide any proof, contain or make a point, have logic, or support a conclusion. Mix well for maximum effect. 10. Associate opponent charges with old news. A derivative of the straw man -- usually, in any large-scale matter of high visibility, someone will make charges early on which can be or were already easily dealt with - a kind of investment for the future should the matter not be so easily contained.) Where it can be foreseen, have your own side raise a straw man issue and have it dealt with early on as part of the initial contingency plans. Subsequent charges, regardless of validity or new ground uncovered, can usually then be associated with the original charge and dismissed as simply being a rehash without need to address current issues -- so much the better where the opponent is or was involved with the original source. 11. Establish and rely upon fall-back positions. Using a minor matter or element of the facts, take the 'high road' and 'confess' with candor that some innocent mistake, in hindsight, was made -- but that opponents have seized on the opportunity to blow it all out of proportion and imply greater criminalities which, 'just isn't so.' Others can reinforce this on your behalf, later, and even publicly 'call for an end to the nonsense' because you have already 'done the right thing.' Done properly, this can garner sympathy and respect for 'coming clean' and 'owning up' to your mistakes without addressing more serious issues. 12. Enigmas have no solution. Drawing upon the overall umbrella of events surrounding the crime and the multitude of players and events, paint the entire affair as too complex to solve. This causes those otherwise following the matter to begin to lose interest more quickly without having to address the actual issues. 13. Alice in Wonderland Logic. Avoid discussion of the issues by reasoning backwards or with an apparent deductive logic which forbears any actual material fact. 14. Demand complete solutions. Avoid the issues by requiring opponents to solve the crime at hand completely, a ploy which works best with issues qualifying for rule 10. 15. Fit the facts to alternate conclusions. This requires creative thinking unless the crime was planned with contingency conclusions in place. 16. Vanish evidence and witnesses. If it does not exist, it is not fact, and you won't have to address the issue. 17. Change the subject. Usually in connection with one of the other ploys listed here, find a way to side-track the discussion with abrasive or controversial comments in hopes of turning attention to a new, more manageable topic. This works especially well with companions who can 'argue' with you over the new topic and polarize the discussion arena in order to avoid discussing more key issues. 18. Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents. If you can't do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how 'sensitive they are to criticism.' 19. Ignore proof presented, demand impossible proofs. This is perhaps a variant of the 'play dumb' rule. Regardless of what material may be presented by an opponent in public forums, claim the material irrelevant and demand proof that is impossible for the opponent to come by (it may exist, but not be at his disposal, or it may be something which is known to be safely destroyed or withheld, such as a murder weapon.) In order to completely avoid discussing issues, it may be required that you to categorically deny and be critical of media or books as valid sources, deny that witnesses are acceptable, or even deny that statements made by government or other authorities have any meaning or relevance. 20. False evidence. Whenever possible, introduce new facts or clues designed and manufactured to conflict with opponent presentations -- as useful tools to neutralize sensitive issues or impede resolution. This works best when the crime was designed with contingencies for the purpose, and the facts cannot be easily separated from the fabrications. 21. Call a Grand Jury, Special Prosecutor, or other empowered investigative body. Subvert the (process) to your benefit and effectively neutralize all sensitive issues without open discussion. Once convened, the evidence and testimony are required to be secret when properly handled. For instance, if you own the prosecuting attorney, it can insure a Grand Jury hears no useful evidence and that the evidence is sealed and unavailable to subsequent investigators. Once a favorable verdict is achieved, the matter can be considered officially closed. Usually, this technique is applied to find the guilty innocent, but it can also be used to obtain charges when seeking to frame a victim. 22. Manufacture a new truth. Create your own expert(s), group(s), author(s), leader(s) or influence existing ones willing to forge new ground via scientific, investigative, or social research or testimony which concludes favorably. In this way, if you must actually address issues, you can do so authoritatively. 23. Create bigger distractions. If the above does not seem to be working to distract from sensitive issues, or to prevent unwanted media coverage of unstoppable events such as trials, create bigger news stories (or treat them as such) to distract the multitudes. 24. Silence critics. If the above methods do not prevail, consider removing opponents from circulation by some definitive solution so that the need to address issues is removed entirely. This can be by their death, arrest and detention, blackmail or destruction of their character by release of blackmail information, or merely by destroying them financially, emotionally, or severely damaging their health. 25. Vanish. If you are a key holder of secrets or otherwise overly illuminated and you think the heat is getting too hot, to avoid the issues, vacate the kitchen. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Eight Traits of the Disinformationalist 1) Avoidance. They never actually discuss issues head-on or provide constructive input, generally avoiding citation of references or credentials. Rather, they merely imply this, that, and the other. Virtually everything about their presentation implies their authority and expert knowledge in the matter without any further justification for credibility. 2) Selectivity. They tend to pick and choose opponents carefully, either applying the hit-and-run approach against mere commentators supportive of opponents, or focusing heavier attacks on key opponents who are known to directly address issues. Should a commentator become argumentative with any success, the focus will shift to include the commentator as well. 3) Coincidental. They tend to surface suddenly and somewhat coincidentally with a new controversial topic with no clear prior record of participation in general discussions in the particular public arena involved. They likewise tend to vanish once the topic is no longer of general concern. They were likely directed or elected to be there for a reason, and vanish with the reason. 4) Teamwork. They tend to operate in self-congratulatory and complementary packs or teams. Of course, this can happen naturally in any public forum, but there will likely be an ongoing pattern of frequent exchanges of this sort where professionals are involved. Sometimes one of the players will infiltrate the opponent camp to become a source for straw man or other tactics designed to dilute opponent presentation strength. 5) Anti-conspiratorial. They almost always have disdain for 'conspiracy theorists' and, usually, for those who in any way believe JFK was not killed by LHO. Ask yourself why, if they hold such disdain for conspiracy theorists, do they focus on defending a single topic discussed in a NG focusing on conspiracies? One might think they would either be trying to make fools of everyone on every topic, or simply ignore the group they hold in such disdain.Or, one might more rightly conclude they have an ulterior motive for their actions in going out of their way to focus as they do. 6) Artificial Emotions. An odd kind of 'artificial' emotionalism and an unusually thick skin -- an ability to persevere and persist even in the face of overwhelming criticism and unacceptance. This likely stems from intelligence community training that, no matter how condemning the evidence, deny everything, and never become emotionally involved or reactive. The net result for a disinfo artist is that emotions can seem artificial. Most people, if responding in anger, for instance, will express their animosity throughout their rebuttal. But disinfo types usually have trouble maintaining the 'image' and are hot and cold with respect to pretended emotions and their usually more calm or unemotional communications style. It's just a job, and they often seem unable to 'act their role in character' as well in a communications medium as they might be able in a real face-to-face conversation/confrontation. You might have outright rage and indignation one moment, ho-hum the next, and more anger later -- an emotional yo-yo. With respect to being thick-skinned, no amount of criticism will deter them from doing their job, and they will generally continue their old disinfo patterns without any adjustments to criticisms of how obvious it is that they play that game -- where a more rational individual who truly cares what others think might seek to improve their communications style, substance, and so forth, or simply give up. 7) Inconsistent. There is also a tendency to make mistakes which betray their true self/motives. This may stem from not really knowing their topic, or it may be somewhat 'freudian', so to speak, in that perhaps they really root for the side of truth deep within. I have noted that often, they will simply cite contradictory information which neutralizes itself and the author. For instance, one such player claimed to be a Navy pilot, but blamed his poor communicating skills (spelling, grammar, incoherent style) on having only a grade-school education. I'm not aware of too many Navy pilots who don't have a college degree. Another claimed no knowledge of a particular topic/situation but later claimed first-hand knowledge of it. 8) Time Constant. Recently discovered, with respect to News Groups, is the response time factor. There are three ways this can be seen to work, especially when the government or other empowered player is involved in a cover up operation: a) ANY NG posting by a targeted proponent for truth can result in an IMMEDIATE response. The government and other empowered players can afford to pay people to sit there and watch for an opportunity to do some damage. SINCE DISINFO IN A NG ONLY WORKS IF THE READER SEES IT - FAST RESPONSE IS CALLED FOR, or the visitor may be swayed towards truth. b) When dealing in more direct ways with a disinformationalist, such as email, DELAY IS CALLED FOR - there will usually be a minimum of a 48-72 hour delay. This allows a sit-down team discussion on response strategy for best effect, and even enough time to 'get permission' or instruction from a formal chain of command. c) In the NG example 1) above, it will often ALSO be seen that bigger guns are drawn and fired after the same 48-72 hours delay - the team approach in play. This is especially true when the targeted truth seeker or their comments are considered more important with respect to potential to reveal truth. Thus, a serious truth sayer will be attacked twice for the same sin. ______________________________________________________________________________________ How to Spot a Spy (Cointelpro Agent) One way to neutralize a potential activist is to get them to be in a group that does all the wrong things. Why? 1) The message doesn't get out. 2) A lot of time is wasted 3) The activist is frustrated and discouraged 4) Nothing good is accomplished. FBI and Police Informers and Infiltrators will infest any group and they have phoney activist organizations established. Their purpose is to prevent any real movement for justice or eco-peace from developing in this country. Agents come in small, medium or large. They can be of any ethnic background. They can be male or female. The actual size of the group or movement being infiltrated is irrelevant. It is the potential the movement has for becoming large which brings on the spies and saboteurs. This booklet lists tactics agents use to slow things down, foul things up, destroy the movement and keep tabs on activists. It is the agent's job to keep the activist from quitting such a group, thus keeping him/her under control. In some situations, to get control, the agent will tell the activist: ""You're dividing the movement."" [Here, I have added the psychological reasons as to WHY this maneuver works to control people] This invites guilty feelings. Many people can be controlled by guilt. The agents begin relationships with activists behind a well-developed mask of ""dedication to the cause."" Because of their often declared dedication, (and actions designed to prove this), when they criticize the activist, he or she - being truly dedicated to the movement - becomes convinced that somehow, any issues are THEIR fault. This is because a truly dedicated person tends to believe that everyone has a conscience and that nobody would dissimulate and lie like that ""on purpose."" It's amazing how far agents can go in manipulating an activist because the activist will constantly make excuses for the agent who regularly declares their dedication to the cause. Even if they do, occasionally, suspect the agent, they will pull the wool over their own eyes by rationalizing: ""they did that unconsciously... they didn't really mean it... I can help them by being forgiving and accepting "" and so on and so forth. The agent will tell the activist: ""You're a leader!"" This is designed to enhance the activist's self-esteem. His or her narcissistic admiration of his/her own activist/altruistic intentions increase as he or she identifies with and consciously admires the altruistic declarations of the agent which are deliberately set up to mirror those of the activist. This is ""malignant pseudoidentification."" It is the process by which the agent consciously imitates or simulates a certain behavior to foster the activist's identification with him/her, thus increasing the activist's vulnerability to exploitation. The agent will simulate the more subtle self-concepts of the activist. Activists and those who have altruistic self-concepts are most vulnerable to malignant pseudoidentification especially during work with the agent when the interaction includes matter relating to their competency, autonomy, or knowledge. The goal of the agent is to increase the activist's general empathy for the agent through pseudo-identification with the activist's self-concepts. The most common example of this is the agent who will compliment the activist for his competency or knowledge or value to the movement. On a more subtle level, the agent will simulate affects and mannerisms of the activist which promotes identification via mirroring and feelings of ""twinship"". It is not unheard of for activists, enamored by the perceived helpfulness and competence of a good agent, to find themselves considering ethical violations and perhaps, even illegal behavior, in the service of their agent/handler. The activist's ""felt quality of perfection"" [self-concept] is enhanced, and a strong empathic bond is developed with the agent through his/her imitation and simulation of the victim's own narcissistic investments. [self-concepts] That is, if the activist knows, deep inside, their own dedication to the cause, they will project that onto the agent who is ""mirroring"" them. The activist will be deluded into thinking that the agent shares this feeling of identification and bonding. In an activist/social movement setting, the adversarial roles that activists naturally play vis a vis the establishment/government, fosters ongoing processes of intrapsychic splitting so that ""twinship alliances"" between activist and agent may render whole sectors or reality testing unavailable to the activist. They literally ""lose touch with reality."" Activists who deny their own narcissistic investments [do not have a good idea of their own self-concepts and that they ARE concepts] and consciously perceive themselves (accurately, as it were) to be ""helpers"" endowed with a special amount of altruism are exceedingly vulnerable to the affective (emotional) simulation of the accomplished agent. Empathy is fostered in the activist through the expression of quite visible affects. The presentation of tearfulness, sadness, longing, fear, remorse, and guilt, may induce in the helper-oriented activist a strong sense of compassion, while unconsciously enhancing the activist's narcissistic investment in self as the embodiment of goodness. The agent's expresssion of such simulated affects may be quite compelling to the observer and difficult to distinguish from deep emotion. It can usually be identified by two events, however: First, the activist who has analyzed his/her own narcissistic roots and is aware of his/her own potential for being ""emotionally hooked,"" will be able to remain cool and unaffected by such emotional outpourings by the agent. As a result of this unaffected, cool, attitude, the Second event will occur: The agent will recompensate much too quickly following such an affective expression leaving the activist with the impression that ""the play has ended, the curtain has fallen,"" and the imposture, for the moment, has finished. The agent will then move quickly to another activist/victim. The fact is, the movement doesn't need leaders, it needs MOVERS. ""Follow the leader"" is a waste of time. A good agent will want to meet as often as possible. He or she will talk a lot and say little. One can expect an onslaught of long, unresolved discussions. Some agents take on a pushy, arrogant, or defensive manner: 1) To disrupt the agenda 2) To side-track the discussion 3) To interrupt repeatedly 4) To feign ignorance 5) To make an unfounded accusation against a person. Calling someone a racist, for example. This tactic is used to discredit a person in the eyes of all other group members. Saboteurs Some saboteurs pretend to be activists. She or he will .... 1) Write encyclopedic flyers (in the present day, websites) 2) Print flyers in English only. 3) Have demonstrations in places where no one cares. 4) Solicit funding from rich people instead of grass roots support 5) Display banners with too many words that are confusing. 6) Confuse issues. 7) Make the wrong demands. Cool Compromise the goal. 9) Have endless discussions that waste everyone's time. The agent may accompany the endless discussions with drinking, pot smoking or other amusement to slow down the activist's work. Provocateurs 1) Want to establish ""leaders"" to set them up for a fall in order to stop the movement. 2) Suggest doing foolish, illegal things to get the activists in trouble. 3) Encourage militancy. 4) Want to taunt the authorities. 5) Attempt to make the activist compromise their values. 6) Attempt to instigate violence. Activisim ought to always be non-violent. 7) Attempt to provoke revolt among people who are ill-prepared to deal with the reaction of the authorities to such violence. Informants 1) Want everyone to sign up and sing in and sign everything. 2) Ask a lot of questions (gathering data). 3) Want to know what events the activist is planning to attend. 4) Attempt to make the activist defend him or herself to identify his or her beliefs, goals, and level of committment. Recruiting Legitimate activists do not subject people to hours of persuasive dialog. Their actions, beliefs, and goals speak for themselves. Groups that DO recruit are missionaries, military, and fake political parties or movements set up by agents. Surveillance ALWAYS assume that you are under surveillance. At this point, if you are NOT under surveillance, you are not a very good activist! Scare Tactics They use them. Such tactics include slander, defamation, threats, getting close to disaffected or minimally committed fellow activists to persuade them (via psychological tactics described above) to turn against the movement and give false testimony against their former compatriots. They will plant illegal substances on the activist and set up an arrest; they will plant false information and set up ""exposure,"" they will send incriminating letters [emails] in the name of the activist; and more; they will do whatever society will allow. This booklet in no way covers all the ways agents use to sabotage the lives of sincere an dedicated activists. If an agent is ""exposed,"" he or she will be transferred or replaced. COINTELPRO is still in operation today under a different code name. It is no longer placed on paper where it can be discovered through the freedom of information act. The FBI counterintelligence program's stated purpose: To expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, and otherwise neutralize individuals who the FBI categorize as opposed to the National Interests. ""National Security"" means the FBI's security from the people ever finding out the vicious things it does in violation of people's civil liberties. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Seventeen Techniques for Truth Suppression Strong, credible allegations of high-level criminal activity can bring down a government. When the government lacks an effective, fact-based defense, other techniques must be employed. The success of these techniques depends heavily upon a cooperative, compliant press and a mere token opposition party. 1. Dummy up. If it's not reported, if it's not news, it didn't happen. 2. Wax indignant. This is also known as the ""How dare you?"" gambit. 3. Characterize the charges as ""rumors"" or, better yet, ""wild rumors."" If, in spite of the news blackout, the public is still able to learn about the suspicious facts, it can only be through ""rumors."" (If they tend to believe the ""rumors"" it must be because they are simply ""paranoid"" or ""hysterical."") 4. Knock down straw men. Deal only with the weakest aspects of the weakest charges. Even better, create your own straw men. Make up wild rumors (or plant false stories) and give them lead play when you appear to debunk all the charges, real and fanciful alike. 5. Call the skeptics names like ""conspiracy theorist,"" ""nutcase,"" ""ranter,"" ""kook,"" ""crackpot,"" and, of course, ""rumor monger."" Be sure, too, to use heavily loaded verbs and adjectives when characterizing their charges and defending the ""more reasonable"" government and its defenders. You must then carefully avoid fair and open debate with any of the people you have thus maligned. For insurance, set up your own ""skeptics"" to shoot down. 6. Impugn motives. Attempt to marginalize the critics by suggesting strongly that they are not really interested in the truth but are simply pursuing a partisan political agenda or are out to make money (compared to over-compensated adherents to the government line who, presumably, are not). 7. Invoke authority. Here the controlled press and the sham opposition can be very useful. 8. Dismiss the charges as ""old news."" 9. Come half-clean. This is also known as ""confession and avoidance"" or ""taking the limited hangout route."" This way, you create the impression of candor and honesty while you admit only to relatively harmless, less-than-criminal ""mistakes."" This stratagem often requires the embrace of a fall-back position quite different from the one originally taken. With effective damage control, the fall-back position need only be peddled by stooge skeptics to carefully limited markets. 10. Characterize the crimes as impossibly complex and the truth as ultimately unknowable. 11. Reason backward, using the deductive method with a vengeance. With thoroughly rigorous deduction, troublesome evidence is irrelevant. E.g. We have a completely free press. If evidence exists that the Vince Foster ""suicide"" note was forged, they would have reported it. They haven't reported it so there is no such evidence. Another variation on this theme involves the likelihood of a conspiracy leaker and a press who would report the leak. 12. Require the skeptics to solve the crime completely. E.g. If Foster was murdered, who did it and why? 13. Change the subject. This technique includes creating and/or publicizing distractions. 14. Lightly report incriminating facts, and then make nothing of them. This is sometimes referred to as ""bump and run"" reporting. 15. Baldly and brazenly lie. A favorite way of doing this is to attribute the ""facts"" furnished the public to a plausible-sounding, but anonymous, source. 16. Expanding further on numbers 4 and 5, have your own stooges ""expose"" scandals and champion popular causes. Their job is to pre-empt real opponents and to play 99-yard football. A variation is to pay rich people for the job who will pretend to spend their own money. 17. Flood the Internet with agents. This is the answer to the question, ""What could possibly motivate a person to spend hour upon hour on Internet news groups defending the government and/or the press and harassing genuine critics?"" Don t the authorities have defenders enough in all the newspapers, magazines, radio, and television? One would think refusing to print critical letters and screening out serious callers or dumping them from radio talk shows would be control enough, but, obviously, it is not. URL"
103,vulnerability,conspiracy,Vault 7 release info from actual files,30,5y0drf,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5y0drf/vault_7_release_info_from_actual_files/,2017-03-08 00:42:44,"sorry for the mess. copy paste.... Press Release Today, Tuesday 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks begins its new series of leaks on the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Code-named ""Vault 7"" by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency. The first full part of the series, ""Year Zero"", comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election. Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized ""zero day"" exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive. ""Year Zero"" introduces the scope and direction of the CIA's global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of ""zero day"" weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple's iPhone, Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones. Since 2001 the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force  its own substantial fleet of hackers. The agency's hacking division freed it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA (its primary bureaucratic rival) in order to draw on the NSA's hacking capacities. By the end of 2016, the CIA's hacking division, which formally falls under the agency's Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI), had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other ""weaponized"" malware. Such is the scale of the CIA's undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in effect, its ""own NSA"" with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified. In a statement to WikiLeaks the source details policy questions that they say urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the CIA's hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency. The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons. Once a single cyber 'weapon' is 'loose' it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike. Julian Assange, WikiLeaks editor stated that ""There is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber 'weapons'. Comparisons can be drawn between the uncontrolled proliferation of such 'weapons', which results from the inability to contain them combined with their high market value, and the global arms trade. But the significance of ""Year Zero"" goes well beyond the choice between cyberwar and cyberpeace. The disclosure is also exceptional from a political, legal and forensic perspective."" Wikileaks has carefully reviewed the ""Year Zero"" disclosure and published substantive CIA documentation while avoiding the distribution of 'armed' cyberweapons until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA's program and how such 'weapons' should analyzed, disarmed and published. Wikileaks has also decided to redact and anonymise some identifying information in ""Year Zero"" for in depth analysis. These redactions include ten of thousands of CIA targets and attack machines throughout Latin America, Europe and the United States. While we are aware of the imperfect results of any approach chosen, we remain committed to our publishing model and note that the quantity of published pages in ""Vault 7"" part one (Year Zero) already eclipses the total number of pages published over the first three years of the Edward Snowden NSA leaks. Analysis CIA malware targets iPhone, Android, smart TVs CIA malware and hacking tools are built by EDG (Engineering Development Group), a software development group within CCI (Center for Cyber Intelligence), a department belonging to the CIA's DDI (Directorate for Digital Innovation). The DDI is one of the five major directorates of the CIA (see this organizational chart of the CIA for more details). The EDG is responsible for the development, testing and operational support of all backdoors, exploits, malicious payloads, trojans, viruses and any other kind of malware used by the CIA in its covert operations world-wide. The increasing sophistication of surveillance techniques has drawn comparisons with George Orwell's 1984, but ""Weeping Angel"", developed by the CIA's Embedded Devices Branch (EDB), which infests smart TVs, transforming them into covert microphones, is surely its most emblematic realization. The attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation with the United Kingdom's MI5/BTSS. After infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a 'Fake-Off' mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In 'Fake-Off' mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server. As of October 2014 the CIA was also looking at infecting the vehicle control systems used by modern cars and trucks. The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations. The CIA's Mobile Devices Branch (MDB) developed numerous attacks to remotely hack and control popular smart phones. Infected phones can be instructed to send the CIA the user's geolocation, audio and text communications as well as covertly activate the phone's camera and microphone. Despite iPhone's minority share (14.5%) of the global smart phone market in 2016, a specialized unit in the CIA's Mobile Development Branch produces malware to infest, control and exfiltrate data from iPhones and other Apple products running iOS, such as iPads. CIA's arsenal includes numerous local and remote ""zero days"" developed by CIA or obtained from GCHQ, NSA, FBI or purchased from cyber arms contractors such as Baitshop. The disproportionate focus on iOS may be explained by the popularity of the iPhone among social, political, diplomatic and business elites. A similar unit targets Google's Android which is used to run the majority of the world's smart phones (~85%) including Samsung, HTC and Sony. 1.15 billion Android powered phones were sold last year. ""Year Zero"" shows that as of 2016 the CIA had 24 ""weaponized"" Android ""zero days"" which it has developed itself and obtained from GCHQ, NSA and cyber arms contractors. These techniques permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Wiebo, Confide and Cloackman by hacking the ""smart"" phones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied. CIA malware targets Windows, OSx, Linux, routers The CIA also runs a very substantial effort to infect and control Microsoft Windows users with its malware. This includes multiple local and remote weaponized ""zero days"", air gap jumping viruses such as ""Hammer Drill"" which infects software distributed on CD/DVDs, infectors for removable media such as USBs, systems to hide data in images or in covert disk areas ( ""Brutal Kangaroo"") and to keep its malware infestations going. Many of these infection efforts are pulled together by the CIA's Automated Implant Branch (AIB), which has developed several attack systems for automated infestation and control of CIA malware, such as ""Assassin"" and ""Medusa"". Attacks against Internet infrastructure and webservers are developed by the CIA's Network Devices Branch (NDB). The CIA has developed automated multi-platform malware attack and control systems covering Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris, Linux and more, such as EDB's ""HIVE"" and the related ""Cutthroat"" and ""Swindle"" tools, which are described in the examples section below. CIA 'hoarded' vulnerabilities (""zero days"") In the wake of Edward Snowden's leaks about the NSA, the U.S. technology industry secured a commitment from the Obama administration that the executive would disclose on an ongoing basis  rather than hoard  serious vulnerabilities, exploits, bugs or ""zero days"" to Apple, Google, Microsoft, and other US-based manufacturers. Serious vulnerabilities not disclosed to the manufacturers places huge swathes of the population and critical infrastructure at risk to foreign intelligence or cyber criminals who independently discover or hear rumors of the vulnerability. If the CIA can discover such vulnerabilities so can others. The U.S. government's commitment to the Vulnerabilities Equities Process came after significant lobbying by US technology companies, who risk losing their share of the global market over real and perceived hidden vulnerabilities. The government stated that it would disclose all pervasive vulnerabilities discovered after 2010 on an ongoing basis. ""Year Zero"" documents show that the CIA breached the Obama administration's commitments. Many of the vulnerabilities used in the CIA's cyber arsenal are pervasive and some may already have been found by rival intelligence agencies or cyber criminals. As an example, specific CIA malware revealed in ""Year Zero"" is able to penetrate, infest and control both the Android phone and iPhone software that runs or has run presidential Twitter accounts. The CIA attacks this software by using undisclosed security vulnerabilities (""zero days"") possessed by the CIA but if the CIA can hack these phones then so can everyone else who has obtained or discovered the vulnerability. As long as the CIA keeps these vulnerabilities concealed from Apple and Google (who make the phones) they will not be fixed, and the phones will remain hackable. The same vulnerabilities exist for the population at large, including the U.S. Cabinet, Congress, top CEOs, system administrators, security officers and engineers. By hiding these security flaws from manufacturers like Apple and Google the CIA ensures that it can hack everyone &amp;mdsh; at the expense of leaving everyone hackable. 'Cyberwar' programs are a serious proliferation risk Cyber 'weapons' are not possible to keep under effective control. While nuclear proliferation has been restrained by the enormous costs and visible infrastructure involved in assembling enough fissile material to produce a critical nuclear mass, cyber 'weapons', once developed, are very hard to retain. Cyber 'weapons' are in fact just computer programs which can be pirated like any other. Since they are entirely comprised of information they can be copied quickly with no marginal cost. Securing such 'weapons' is particularly difficult since the same people who develop and use them have the skills to exfiltrate copies without leaving traces  sometimes by using the very same 'weapons' against the organizations that contain them. There are substantial price incentives for government hackers and consultants to obtain copies since there is a global ""vulnerability market"" that will pay hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars for copies of such 'weapons'. Similarly, contractors and companies who obtain such 'weapons' sometimes use them for their own purposes, obtaining advantage over their competitors in selling 'hacking' services. Over the last three years the United States intelligence sector, which consists of government agencies such as the CIA and NSA and their contractors, such as Booze Allan Hamilton, has been subject to unprecedented series of data exfiltrations by its own workers. A number of intelligence community members not yet publicly named have been arrested or subject to federal criminal investigations in separate incidents. Most visibly, on February 8, 2017 a U.S. federal grand jury indicted Harold T. Martin III with 20 counts of mishandling classified information. The Department of Justice alleged that it seized some 50,000 gigabytes of information from Harold T. Martin III that he had obtained from classified programs at NSA and CIA, including the source code for numerous hacking tools. Once a single cyber 'weapon' is 'loose' it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by peer states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike. U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt is a covert CIA hacker base In addition to its operations in Langley, Virginia the CIA also uses the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt as a covert base for its hackers covering Europe, the Middle East and Africa. CIA hackers operating out of the Frankfurt consulate ( ""Center for Cyber Intelligence Europe"" or CCIE) are given diplomatic (""black"") passports and State Department cover. The instructions for incoming CIA hackers make Germany's counter-intelligence efforts appear inconsequential: ""Breeze through German Customs because you have your cover-for-action story down pat, and all they did was stamp your passport"" Your Cover Story (for this trip) Q: Why are you here? A: Supporting technical consultations at the Consulate. Two earlier WikiLeaks publications give further detail on CIA approaches to customs and secondary screening procedures. Once in Frankfurt CIA hackers can travel without further border checks to the 25 European countries that are part of the Shengen open border area  including France, Italy and Switzerland. A number of the CIA's electronic attack methods are designed for physical proximity. These attack methods are able to penetrate high security networks that are disconnected from the internet, such as police record database. In these cases, a CIA officer, agent or allied intelligence officer acting under instructions, physically infiltrates the targeted workplace. The attacker is provided with a USB containing malware developed for the CIA for this purpose, which is inserted into the targeted computer. The attacker then infects and exfiltrates data to removable media. For example, the CIA attack system Fine Dining, provides 24 decoy applications for CIA spies to use. To witnesses, the spy appears to be running a program showing videos (e.g VLC), presenting slides (Prezi), playing a computer game (Breakout2, 2048) or even running a fake virus scanner (Kaspersky, McAfee, Sophos). But while the decoy application is on the screen, the underlaying system is automatically infected and ransacked. How the CIA dramatically increased proliferation risks In what is surely one of the most astounding intelligence own goals in living memory, the CIA structured its classification regime such that for the most market valuable part of ""Vault 7""  the CIA's weaponized malware (implants + zero days), Listening Posts (LP), and Command and Control (C2) systems  the agency has little legal recourse. The CIA made these systems unclassified. Why the CIA chose to make its cyberarsenal unclassified reveals how concepts developed for military use do not easily crossover to the 'battlefield' of cyber 'war'. To attack its targets, the CIA usually requires that its implants communicate with their control programs over the internet. If CIA implants, Command &amp; Control and Listening Post software were classified, then CIA officers could be prosecuted or dismissed for violating rules that prohibit placing classified information onto the Internet. Consequently the CIA has secretly made most of its cyber spying/war code unclassified. The U.S. government is not able to assert copyright either, due to restrictions in the U.S. Constitution. This means that cyber 'arms' manufactures and computer hackers can freely ""pirate"" these 'weapons' if they are obtained. The CIA has primarily had to rely on obfuscation to protect its malware secrets. Conventional weapons such as missiles may be fired at the enemy (i.e into an unsecured area). Proximity to or impact with the target detonates the ordnance including its classified parts. Hence military personnel do not violate classification rules by firing ordnance with classified parts. Ordnance will likely explode. If it does not, that is not the operator's intent. Over the last decade U.S. hacking operations have been increasingly dressed up in military jargon to tap into Department of Defense funding streams. For instance, attempted ""malware injections"" (commercial jargon) or ""implant drops"" (NSA jargon) are being called ""fires"" as if a weapon was being fired. However the analogy is questionable. Unlike bullets, bombs or missiles, most CIA malware is designed to live for days or even years after it has reached its 'target'. CIA malware does not ""explode on impact"" but rather permanently infests its target. In order to infect target's device, copies of the malware must be placed on the target's devices, giving physical possession of the malware to the target. To exfiltrate data back to the CIA or to await further instructions the malware must communicate with CIA Command &amp; Control (C2) systems placed on internet connected servers. But such servers are typically not approved to hold classified information, so CIA command and control systems are also made unclassified. A successful 'attack' on a target's computer system is more like a series of complex stock maneuvers in a hostile take-over bid or the careful planting of rumors in order to gain control over an organization's leadership rather than the firing of a weapons system. If there is a military analogy to be made, the infestation of a target is perhaps akin to the execution of a whole series of military maneuvers against the target's territory including observation, infiltration, occupation and exploitation. Evading forensics and anti-virus A series of standards lay out CIA malware infestation patterns which are likely to assist forensic crime scene investigators as well as Apple, Microsoft, Google, Samsung, Nokia, Blackberry, Siemens and anti-virus companies attribute and defend against attacks. ""Tradecraft DO's and DON'Ts"" contains CIA rules on how its malware should be written to avoid fingerprints implicating the ""CIA, US government, or its witting partner companies"" in ""forensic review"". Similar secret standards cover the use of encryption to hide CIA hacker and malware communication (pdf), describing targets &amp; exfiltrated data (pdf) as well as executing payloads (pdf) and persisting (pdf) in the target's machines over time. CIA hackers developed successful attacks against most well known anti-virus programs. These are documented in AV defeats, Personal Security Products, Detecting and defeating PSPs and PSP/Debugger/RE Avoidance. For example, Comodo was defeated by CIA malware placing itself in the Window's ""Recycle Bin"". While Comodo 6.x has a ""Gaping Hole of DOOM"". CIA hackers discussed what the NSA's ""Equation Group"" hackers did wrong and how the CIA's malware makers could avoid similar exposure. Examples The CIA's Engineering Development Group (EDG) management system contains around 500 different projects (only some of which are documented by ""Year Zero"") each with their own sub-projects, malware and hacker tools. The majority of these projects relate to tools that are used for penetration, infestation (""implanting""), control, and exfiltration. Another branch of development focuses on the development and operation of Listening Posts (LP) and Command and Control (C2) systems used to communicate with and control CIA implants; special projects are used to target specific hardware from routers to smart TVs. Some example projects are described below, but see the table of contents for the full list of projects described by WikiLeaks' ""Year Zero"". UMBRAGE The CIA's hand crafted hacking techniques pose a problem for the agency. Each technique it has created forms a ""fingerprint"" that can be used by forensic investigators to attribute multiple different attacks to the same entity. This is analogous to finding the same distinctive knife wound on multiple separate murder victims. The unique wounding style creates suspicion that a single murderer is responsible. As soon one murder in the set is solved then the other murders also find likely attribution. The CIA's Remote Devices Branch's UMBRAGE group collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation. With UMBRAGE and related projects the CIA cannot only increase its total number of attack types but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the ""fingerprints"" of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from. UMBRAGE components cover keyloggers, password collection, webcam capture, data destruction, persistence, privilege escalation, stealth, anti-virus (PSP) avoidance and survey techniques. Fine Dining Fine Dining comes with a standardized questionnaire i.e menu that CIA case officers fill out. The questionnaire is used by the agency's OSB (Operational Support Branch) to transform the requests of case officers into technical requirements for hacking attacks (typically ""exfiltrating"" information from computer systems) for specific operations. The questionnaire allows the OSB to identify how to adapt existing tools for the operation, and communicate this to CIA malware configuration staff. The OSB functions as the interface between CIA operational staff and the relevant technical support staff. Among the list of possible targets of the collection are 'Asset', 'Liason Asset', 'System Administrator', 'Foreign Information Operations', 'Foreign Intelligence Agencies' and 'Foreign Government Entities'. Notably absent is any reference to extremists or transnational criminals. The 'Case Officer' is also asked to specify the environment of the target like the type of computer, operating system used, Internet connectivity and installed anti-virus utilities (PSPs) as well as a list of file types to be exfiltrated like Office documents, audio, video, images or custom file types. The 'menu' also asks for information if recurring access to the target is possible and how long unobserved access to the computer can be maintained. This information is used by the CIA's 'JQJIMPROVISE' software (see below) to configure a set of CIA malware suited to the specific needs of an operation. Improvise (JQJIMPROVISE) 'Improvise' is a toolset for configuration, post-processing, payload setup and execution vector selection for survey/exfiltration tools supporting all major operating systems like Windows (Bartender), MacOS (JukeBox) and Linux (DanceFloor). Its configuration utilities like Margarita allows the NOC (Network Operation Center) to customize tools based on requirements from 'Fine Dining' questionairies. HIVE HIVE is a multi-platform CIA malware suite and its associated control software. The project provides customizable implants for Windows, Solaris, MikroTik (used in internet routers) and Linux platforms and a Listening Post (LP)/Command and Control (C2) infrastructure to communicate with these implants. The implants are configured to communicate via HTTPS with the webserver of a cover domain; each operation utilizing these implants has a separate cover domain and the infrastructure can handle any number of cover domains. Each cover domain resolves to an IP address that is located at a commercial VPS (Virtual Private Server) provider. The public-facing server forwards all incoming traffic via a VPN to a 'Blot' server that handles actual connection requests from clients. It is setup for optional SSL client authentication: if a client sends a valid client certificate (only implants can do that), the connection is forwarded to the 'Honeycomb' toolserver that communicates with the implant; if a valid certificate is missing (which is the case if someone tries to open the cover domain website by accident), the traffic is forwarded to a cover server that delivers an unsuspicious looking website. The Honeycomb toolserver receives exfiltrated information from the implant; an operator can also task the implant to execute jobs on the target computer, so the toolserver acts as a C2 (command and control) server for the implant. Similar functionality (though limited to Windows) is provided by the RickBobby project. See the classified user and developer guides for HIVE. Frequently Asked Questions Why now? WikiLeaks published as soon as its verification and analysis were ready. In Febuary the Trump administration has issued an Executive Order calling for a ""Cyberwar"" review to be prepared within 30 days. While the review increases the timeliness and relevance of the publication it did not play a role in setting the publication date. Redactions Names, email addresses and external IP addresses have been redacted in the released pages (70,875 redactions in total) until further analysis is complete. Over-redaction: Some items may have been redacted that are not employees, contractors, targets or otherwise related to the agency, but are, for example, authors of documentation for otherwise public projects that are used by the agency. Identity vs. person: the redacted names are replaced by user IDs (numbers) to allow readers to assign multiple pages to a single author. Given the redaction process used a single person may be represented by more than one assigned identifier but no identifier refers to more than one real person. Archive attachments (zip, tar.gz, ...) are replaced with a PDF listing all the file names in the archive.

Organizational Chart The organizational chart corresponds to the material published by WikiLeaks so far. Since the organizational structure of the CIA below the level of Directorates is not public, the placement of the EDG and its branches within the org chart of the agency is reconstructed from information contained in the documents released so far. It is intended to be used as a rough outline of the internal organization; please be aware that the reconstructed org chart is incomplete and that internal reorganizations occur frequently. Wiki pages ""Year Zero"" contains 7818 web pages with 943 attachments from the internal development groupware. The software used for this purpose is called Confluence, a proprietary software from Atlassian. Webpages in this system (like in Wikipedia) have a version history that can provide interesting insights on how a document evolved over time; the 7818 documents include these page histories for 1136 latest versions. The order of named pages within each level is determined by date (oldest first). Page content is not present if it was originally dynamically created by the Confluence software (as indicated on the re-constructed page). What time period is covered? The years 2013 to 2016. The sort order of the pages within each level is determined by date (oldest first). WikiLeaks has obtained the CIA's creation/last modification date for each page but these do not yet appear for technical reasons. Usually the date can be discerned or approximated from the content and the page order. If it is critical to know the exact time/date contact WikiLeaks. What is ""Vault 7"" ""Vault 7"" is a substantial collection of material about CIA activities obtained by WikiLeaks. When was each part of ""Vault 7"" obtained? Part one was obtained recently and covers through 2016. Details on the other parts will be available at the time of publication. Is each part of ""Vault 7"" from a different source? Details on the other parts will be available at the time of publication. What is the total size of ""Vault 7""? The series is the largest intelligence publication in history. How did WikiLeaks obtain each part of ""Vault 7""? Sources trust WikiLeaks to not reveal information that might help identify them. Isn't WikiLeaks worried that the CIA will act against its staff to stop the series? No. That would be certainly counter-productive. Has WikiLeaks already 'mined' all the best stories? No. WikiLeaks has intentionally not written up hundreds of impactful stories to encourage others to find them and so create expertise in the area for subsequent parts in the series. They're there. Look. Those who demonstrate journalistic excellence may be considered for early access to future parts. Won't other journalists find all the best stories before me? Unlikely. There are very considerably more stories than there are journalists or academics who are in a position to write them."
104,vulnerability,conspiracy,Some comments on the Wikileaks CIA/#vault7 leak,0,5ycdma,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ycdma/some_comments_on_the_wikileaks_ciavault7_leak/,2017-03-09 13:14:06,"**The CIA didn't remotely hack a TV.** The docs are clear that they can update the software running on the TV using a USB drive. There's no evidence of them doing so remotely over the Internet. If you aren't afraid of the CIA breaking in an installing a listening device, then you should't be afraid of the CIA installing listening software. **The CIA didn't defeat Signal/WhatsApp encryption.** The CIA has some exploits for Android/iPhone. If they can get on your phone, then of course they can record audio and screenshots. Technically, this bypasses/defeats encryption -- but such phrases used by Wikileaks are highly misleading, since nothing related to Signal/WhatsApp is happening. What's happening is the CIA is bypassing/defeating the phone. Sometimes. If they've got an exploit for it, or can trick you into installing their software. **There's no overlap or turf war with the NSA.** The NSA does ""signals intelligence"", so they hack radios and remotely across the Internet. The CIA does ""humans intelligence"", so they hack locally, with a human. The sort of thing they do is bribe, blackmail, or bedazzle some human ""asset"" (like a technician in a nuclear plant) to stick a USB drive into a slot. All the various military, law enforcement, and intelligence agencies have hacking groups to help them do their own missions. **The CIA isn't more advanced than the NSA.** Most of this dump is child's play, simply malware/trojans cobbled together from bits found on the Internet. Sometimes they buy more advanced stuff from contractors, or get stuff shared from the NSA. Technologically, they are far behind the NSA in sophistication and technical expertise. **The CIA isn't hoarding 0days.** For one thing, few 0days were mentioned at all. The CIA's techniques rely upon straightforward hacking, not super secret 0day hacking Second of all, they aren't keeping 0days back in a vault somewhere -- if they have 0days, they are using them. **The VEP process is nonsense.** Activists keep mentioning the ""vulnerability equities process"", in which all those interested in 0days within the government has a say in what happens to them, with the eventual goal that they be disclosed to vendors. The VEP is nonsense. The activist argument is nonsense. As far as I can tell, the VEP is designed as busy work to keep people away from those who really use 0days, such as the NSA and the CIA. If they spend millions of dollars buying 0days because it has that value in intelligence operations, they aren't going to destroy that value by disclosing to a vendor. If VEP forces disclosure, disclosure still won't happen, the NSA will simply stop buying vulns. **But they'll have to disclose the 0days.** Any 0days that were leaked to Wikileaks are, of course, no longer secret. Thus, while this leak isn't an argument for unilateral disarmament in cyberspace, the CIA will have to disclose to vendor the vulns that are now in Russian hands, so that they can be fixed. **There's no false flags.** In several places, the CIA talks about making sure that what they do isn't so unique, so it can't be attributed to them. However, Wikileaks's press release hints that the ""UMBRAGE"" program is deliberately stealing techniques from Russia to use as a false-flag operation. This is nonsense. For example, the DNC hack attribution was live command-and-control servers simultaneously used against different Russian targets -- not a few snippets of code. [More here] **This hurts the CIA a lot.** Already, one AV researcher has told me that a virus they once suspected came from the Russians or Chinese can now be attributed to the CIA, as it matches the description perfectly to something in the leak. We can develop anti-virus and intrusion-detection signatures based on this information that will defeat much of what we read in these documents. This would put a multi-year delay in the CIA's development efforts. Plus, it'll now go on a witch-hunt looking for the leaker, which will erode morale. Update: Three extremely smart and knowledgeable people who I respect disagree, claiming it won't hurt the CIA a lot. I suppose I'm focusing on ""hurting the cyber abilities"" of the CIA, not the CIA as a whole, which mostly is non-cyber in function. **The CIA is not cutting edge.** A few days ago, Hak5 started selling ""BashBunny"", a USB hacking tool more advanced than the USB tools in the leak. The CIA seems to get most of their USB techniques from open-source projects, such Travis Goodpseeds ""GoodFET"" project. **The CIA isn't spying on us.** Snowden revealed how the NSA was surveilling all Americans. Nothing like that appears in the CIA dump. It's all legitimate spy stuff (assuming you think spying on foreign adversaries is legitimate). **How is hacking cars and phones not SIGINT (which is the NSA's turf)?** The answer is via physical access. For example, they might have a device that plugs into the ODBII port on the car that quickly updates the firmware of the brakes. Think of it as normal spy activity (e.g. cutting a victim's brakes), but now with cyber. **Apple iPhone.** My vague sense is that CIA is more concerned about decrypting iPhones they get physical access to, rather than remotely hacking them and installing malware. CIA is HUMINT and covert ops, meaning they'll punch somebody in the face, grab their iPhone, and run, then take it back to their lab and decrypt it. ... There is the notorious ""CIA hacked Senate computers"" scandal. In fact, **the computers in question were owned by the CIA, located in a CIA facility, and managed/operated by CIA employees.** You can't ""hack"" computers you own. Yes, the CIA overstepped the bounds of an informal agreement with the Senate committee overseeing them, but in no way did anything remotely like ""hacking"" occur. This detail matter. If the CIA had truly hacked the Senate committee, that would be a constitutional crisis. A small misstep breaking an informal agreement is not. ... #A note about ""false flag"" operations There's nothing in the CIA #Vault7 leaks that calls into question strong attribution, like Russia being responsible for the DNC hacks. **On the other hand, it does call into question weak attribution, like North Korea being responsible for the Sony hacks.** There are really two types of attribution. Strong attribution is a preponderance of evidence that would convince an unbiased, skeptical expert. Weak attribution is flimsy evidence that confirms what people are predisposed to believe. The DNC hacks have strong evidence pointing to Russia. Not only does all the malware check out, but also other, harder to ""false flag"" bits, like active command-and-control servers. A serious operator could still false-flag this in theory, if only by bribing people in Russia, but nothing in the CIA dump hints at this. The Sony hacks have weak evidence pointing to North Korea. One of the items was the use of the RawDisk driver, used both in malware attributed to North Korea and the Sony attacks. This was described as ""flimsy"" at the time. The CIA dump demonstrates that indeed it's flimsy -- as apparently CIA malware also uses the RawDisk code. **In the coming days, biased partisans are going to seize on the CIA leaks as proof of ""false flag"" operations, calling into question Russian hacks. No, this isn't valid**. We experts in the industry criticized ""malware techniques"" as flimsy attribution, long before the Sony attack, and long before the DNC hacks. All the CIA leaks do is prove we were right. On the other hand, the DNC hack attribution is based on more than just this, so nothing in the CIA leaks calls into question that attribution. --- Source: URL This guy has some interesting thoughts on the CIA situation.

As far as the corporate media, on the whole it uses Trump for ratings. The deep state (now including the NSA, and Homeland Security etc) uses the corporate media as its stooges. To see what is going on, concentrate on people you have some trust for, not media institutions. Stephen Cohen, for example, at least on certain subjects, and a list of others (subject by subject) like Jon Cole, David Chandler, Daniele Ganser, Sharyl Attkisson, Mark Crispin Miller, Kevin Ryan, David Ray Griffin, F. William Engdahl ,Paul Craig Roberts, Francis Richard Conolly, Peter Dale Scott, Pepe Escobar, Andrew J. Bacevich, John Judge (1948-2014), John Pilger, Mark Blyth, Niall Ferguson and Mike Lofgren. Some of ""what is going on"" you can tell by looking around, by the people in power that we DO meet, even police, mail men, lawyers, doctors, friends who work in the military, friends who work for Exxon/Mobil, experiences with Walmart, the utility providers, banks, etc. Or obvious truths like the cover up after 9/11, and that none of the real criminals in Wall Street etc went to or go to prison for their horrendous crimes, but the US does imprison and mistreat MILLIONs of people disproportionately (even taking their money and possessions) for crimes or even harmless acts that should not be crimes at all. And does spy on everything we say or put on our phones, computers, and more. Baby boomers have another 10 or 20 years, and the next generations are being handed off a can of worms. The Baby Boomers DID elect Trump and could have elected Bernie, and the Democratic Party stole that, and will try to steal again based on the sell out they continue to perform to Wall Street and the Military Industrial Complex and it wasn't because of Russia. Targeting Trump for removal is not a realistic strategy because Pense or worse will just step in. And so we get a more attractive face on the front of the monster and go back to sleep? Admitting the Deep State is a realistic strategy. Targeting Wall Street and the other Corporate Interests that are in control is a realistic strategy, and backing people who are willing to take down the establishment, which is going to entail putting hundreds of criminals like Obama, Cheney, Wall Street, Walmart etc in prison for life. Bargaining with the establishment had given us a few things, all of which Trump is now set to destroy. It has also made us collaborators in the murder of millions of innocent people in the Middle East and elsewhere. Future generations will hate the baby boomers, many already do. I am afraid this regime here in the US will not end as non-violently as it had in the Soviet Union, and that the buses will not continue to run as they did in the Soviet Union as it morphed into what was next, even with all of its crisis, which resulted in horrendous upheaval and ruined/shortened lives. It will end, sooner or later. China is rising, India is rising, Brazil is rising. Not without bumps, but the US is only 1 in 20. The other 19 in 20 are getting more and more impatient with an America that has lost its mind, lost its heart, and is in the clutches of psychopaths like Clinton, Bush, Trump, and Obama who play us while the elite gets richer and richer and the people are encouraged to fight each other over fake news while getting fleeced. On any given issue or story, the details and facts are mismanaged and concealed. Investigations are botched. Many or most publicized events are staged by actors who have been infiltrated by corporate and deep state actors, which helps keep the conversation away from real points of vulnerability of the powers that be, and the money that rolls into their coffers every day, or the money they print out of clear air, or steal from Libya or Ukraine, or anywhere they like, continues to enable them, unabated. The Good Germans will say I am cynical, skeptical, conspiracy oriented. They will defend the fake news. They will say America is exceptional. They will try to replace Trump with another Obama, another Bush, another Clinton. They will claim the lies about Russia are fact, they will say when Rachel Maddow connects the dots, that is not a conspiracy theory. They will fail to connect the dots on the important matters like what happened to Bernie or why the US under Obama illegally engaged in regime change efforts in Libya, Syria and the Ukraine. Or how the deep state operates to keep itself in power no matter who is in the White House. If it were not for leaks and players like Wikileaks, there would be less to go on. For now, we have the internet, and access to people like Stephen F. Cohen, Jon Cole, David Chandler, Daniele Ganser, Sharyl Attkisson, Mark Crispin Miller, Kevin Ryan, David Ray Griffin, F. William Engdahl ,Paul Craig Roberts, Francis Richard Conolly, Peter Dale Scott, Pepe Escobar, Andrew J. Bacevich, John Judge (1948-2014), John Pilger, Mark Blyth, Niall Ferguson and Mike Lofgren.

It allows remote reset to defaults and loss of all internal data and possibly wiping of the memory card with a single malformed SMS containing WAP configuration data. Please ensure that you have a full offline (preferably burned to DVDR/BDR) backup of your phone data as this possibly affects other Samsung devices including the Note 4. It concerns me that despite this being ""fixed"" there are agencies who would love the ability to remotely spy on people using this, as arbitrary data can be embedded in the WAP forcing download of malicious applications instead of just wiping the phone. Also if the phone is rooted it can be repaired with no loss of data but it just becomes a DDoS instead. AFAIK the data is not recoverable after such a wipe as Samsung themselves have advised a factory reset wipes the internal memory completely if allowed to complete. If this happens taking the battery out though potentially bricking the phone might allow some data to be recovered (personal experience) "

It could come in a matter of days or weeks; or perhaps, if we are lucky, growing awareness of the path we are on could forestall it. Regardless, the consequences are significant and it will affect everyone. This will be disturbing to read and you may be tempted to discard it; I encourage you to give it a chance. Since the end of World War II, the west has settled into an ossified and brittle peace. The conventional wisdom is that a mix of democracy, technology, trade, tolerance, capitalism, a social safety net, and open borders are a sure-fire recipe for sustained economic growth and continuous improvement of society. In broad measures, this has been true: the world is safer, and the number of people living in poverty keeps dropping. We have managed to build a world that is more connected and open than ever before, and arguably civilization has achieved a peak that could only have been dreamed of 100 or 150 years ago. But there are serious problems that have festered, mostly unchecked: 1. Crony capitalism has created enormous wealth for a few, but at the expense of many. Using asymmetric information, capitalism has been rendered ""risk free"" for the well connected: privatizing upside gains while socializing downside risk. 2. Inequality is a major problem. We have built structural racism and white supremacy into our institutions. Instead of slavery or Jim Crow, we now enslave people through economics. Whether you want to cite high price cell phones targeted at the underbanked, or bail bonds, or the unfair lending practices, many black, brown and other minorities are unfairly targeted by an unlevel playing field, day after day. 3. Our politics has become arrogant, ossified, and stale. The fact that we just conducted a presidential election with a few dozen dull primary contenders, and finished it up with a battle between three relics from the culture wars gives a good sense that we have run out of new blood. Our parties are in disarray, and really, don't know what they are actually about anymore. So onto this stage of general progress, but diminished, weakened political culture walks Stephen Bannon. Bannon's background is well documented. But the most important thing to know about Bannon is his penchant for drama  and his obsession with the book ""The Fourth Turning."" Written in 1997 by the historians Strauss and Howe, it aims to describe the cyclical nature of generational history. They posit that there are ""turns"" of roughly 20 years that define all of modern human history. They have studied it in detail, and their observations largely ring true. Whether or not you believe their theory, it is important to know that Bannon does. And he seems to be taking it as a kind of literal gospel, enacting its prognostications with Biblical zeal. He appears to believe that he is a historical figure charged to take on the task of provoking the ""Fourth Turning"" that the book predicts  but which largely has not taken place, though arguably some early signs are present. But Bannon has asserted that the Fourth Turning has begun. And, in this, Bannon is perhaps quantitatively right: Western democracies have been signaling that something is very wrong, with about 50% of voters selecting candidates and platforms that represent a sharp break from our incremental, progressive past. But here's the thing: Strauss and Howe suggest that this ""Crisis"" phase of the Fourth Turning will almost certainly result in authoritarian, absolutist rule  as the outcome of a total, decisive war. They suggest that minorities will be targeted and demonized. And that dissent will not be tolerated. That may be an observation one can make about generational cycles in the past, but it is in on the wrong side of modern history and the enlightenment, whose arc does bend toward justice. So it would seem that Bannon, who is a provocateur, a showman, a horrible white nationalist, and an all around Rasputin-like figure, is using the book as a kind of historical ""excuse"" to pursue his agenda: ""it will happen anyway,"" he might argue. He's just here to provoke the inevitable. And in one thing he is right: our brittle, ossified Western democracies are due for a reset and a good kick in the pants. We need to get serious about fixing the serious structural flaws that people very rightly are concerned about. We need to plan for what a world without work might look like. And fixing this could even be violent, depending on what forces are unleashed. But no matter what, this entry can never be an excuse for Steve Bannon (along with his backers, Robert and Rebekah Mercer) to pursue a white nationalist and authoritarian agenda for the world's most powerful democracy. With each passing day, he is enacting measures that aggravate (a term used in Fourth Turning) societys fault lines and push it closer to the brink of collapse. Installing members of his network (DeVos) in cabinet posts; the travel ban (affecting at least 100,000 people in its first days); giving banks more leverage by undoing Dodd-Frank; we could go on and on, and were only two weeks in. His intentions are not what they seem on the surface; his true intention is to push a fragile, interconnected, and complex society to actually collapse  so that it can be rebuilt in *his* image. I ask simply: is this what you want? Did you vote for this? Did anyone vote for *this*? So now, the challenge: there are three options. 1. either the forces of conflict are already unleashed, and we will fall into a brutal nonlinear war where Bannon's darkest fantasies are fulfilled, or 2. the forces of conflict are already unleashed, and we take responsibility for the failings of democracy, and fight to preserve our values of openness, tolerance, and free speech, even in the face of brutal conflict, or 3. we have not yet hit the point of no return, and can still use our institutions to flush out the threat that Bannon poses, while seriously addressing the vulnerability he aimed to exploit. There is no workable alternative. We each must choose whether we will protect the values this country was founded on, and we must do so now."

Among the dead, 2 CIA operators. - In response, Clinton ordered missile strikes on a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan. - Clinton claimed the site was being used by Osama bin Laden to manufacture chemical weapons. - It wasnt. - It was just a pharmaceutical factory. This factory supplied around 50% of Sudans medicine. - Malaria mortality rates declined steadily from 1900 all the way through the 1980s. . - In the 1990s, the mortality rates skyrocketed, rising over 40%. This was caused by medication shortage. - This medication shortage was caused in large part by direct and indirect actions taken by the Clinton administration to destabilize Africa. - Not one to let a good crisis go to waste, Clinton sponsored several programs to boost spending to fight these problems. - These programs are designed to funnel money out of government, into the hands of Clinton cronies. - Clinton and large pharmaceutical companies are financially connected. - Clinical trials in third world countries are out of control. Pharmaceutical companies are taking advantage of uninformed populations in order to collect data for pipeline products. This is not the case in every instance, but it is happening, and all major pharmaceutical companies knowingly sponsor such programs. &amp;nbsp; # Skip down a few paragraphs for the good stuff.

The American public was appalled at the deaths and support for American involvement in African affairs suffered as a result. - It was against this backdrop that the **Rwandan Genocide** began. On April 6, 1994, Rwandan President Juvnal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira, the President of Burundi, were both killed when their plane was shot down on approach to Kigali Airport in Rwanda. Responsibility for the assassinations has never been clearly established, however, the resulting chaos was the catalyst for the masacre of Tutsis at the hands of Rwanda's Hutu majority. # Bushnell warned the Clinton Administration in advance - Bushnell, who had been visiting the area just weeks before, released a memorandum immediately following the assassinations. - In it, she predicted widespread violence and the military take-over of the Rwandan government and urged the U.S. government to take action to maintain order. - Partly as a result of the Somali incident, the U.S. government chose not to heed Bushnell's recommendations, and on the next day, April 7, the Rwandan Genocide began when several Tutsi government officials and moderate Hutu Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana were killed by Hutu militias. # Clinton did nothing &amp;nbsp; **Ambassador to Kenya** - Bushnell remained Deputy Assistant Secretary until being nominated by President Clinton to serve as Ambassador to Kenya in 1996. Upon confirmation by the United States Senate, Bushnell took up residence in Nairobi. - Bushnell used her office to push Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi to institute democratic reforms and to root out corruption in his government, a major drag on Kenya's economy. # She warned them again. - Bushnell was also alarmed at the vulnerability of the U.S. embassy compound to attack. - **For over a year, she complained about security conditions to her superiors in Washington.** - Despite Bushnell's request for a new, secure building, a State Department evaluation team concluded that a renovation would suffice. # August 7, 1998 a car bomb was detonated next to the embassy by al-Qaeda agents. &amp;nbsp; # 1998 US Embassies in Africa Bombings Fast Facts | [CNN](URL | JULY 27, 2015 - August 7, 1998 - Almost simultaneously, bombs explode at U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing 224 people.

There is really only one possible answer to that question. Clinton needed to look presidential for a day. &amp;nbsp; **The Observer** noted: - ""The loss of this factory is a tragedy for the rural communities who need these medicines"" quoting Tom Carnaffin, technical manager with ""intimate knowledge"" of the destroyed plant. - A month later, Guardian correspondent Patrick Wintour elaborated that the plant ""provided 50 percent of Sudans medicines, and its destruction has left the country with no supplies of chloroquine, the standard treatment for malaria"". (Wintour, Patrick, The Observer, 20 December 1998.) &amp;nbsp; He continued that, despite this, the # British government (who publicly backed the attack) refused requests ""to resupply chloroquine in emergency relief until such time as the Sudanese can rebuild their pharmaceutical production"". - The factory was a principal source of Sudan's anti-malaria and veterinary drugs according to the CBW Conventions Bulletin. | [THE CBW CONVENTIONS BULLETIN](URL &amp;nbsp; # Coincidentally Malaria Spirals Out of Control # Malaria Surveillance - United States, 1999 | [CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL](URL **Interpretation:** - The 25.5% increase in malaria cases in 1999, compared with 1998, resulted primarily from increases in cases acquired in Africa and the Americas. - This increase is possibly related to a change in the system by which states report to CDC, but it could also have resulted from local changes in disease transmission, increased travel to these regions, improved reporting to state and local health departments, or a **decreased use of effective antimalarial chemoprophylaxis.** - In the majority of reported cases, U.S. civilians who acquired infection abroad were not on an appropriate chemoprophylaxis regimen for the country where they acquired malaria. &amp;nbsp; # Public Complain of Malaria Vaccine Shortage | [GHANA WEB](URL | NOV 3, 2000 - The general public has raised concern and doubt over malaria vaccines, which they said are running short in health centres. - In an interview in health centres, members of the public expressed 'strong interest', calling for 'immediate' explanation from the health department over what they saw as the acute shortage of chloroquine vaccines at a time when malaria is taking a high toll on the population. &amp;nbsp; ### Time to act! What can USAID do for you? **United States Agency for International Development** USAID's programs are authorized by the Congress in the Foreign Assistance Act, which the Congress supplements through directions in annual funding appropriation acts and other legislation. Although it is technically an independent agency, USAID operates subject to the foreign policy guidance of the President, Secretary of State, and the National Security Council. USAID operates in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. &amp;nbsp; # Evaluating Malaria Interventions In Africa: A Review and Assessment of Recent Research | [USAID](URL | NOV 1999 - According to the most recent data, 40% (2,400 million) of the world population in over 90 countries is affected by malaria. In any given year, nearly 10% of the global population will suffer a case of malaria (Malaria International, 1998). - There are 300 - 500 million clinical cases of malaria worldwide each year with the majority occurring in sub-Saharan Africa (WHO, 1998). - Malaria has been estimated to cause 9% of all disease in Africa (Nchinda, 1998). - According to recent data, there are 1.5  2.7 million deaths due to malaria each year, the bulk of which occur in sub-Saharan Africa where an estimated 360 million people live in areas of stable, endemic Plasmodium falciparum transmission (Snow et al., 1999a). &amp;nbsp; # Rolling Back Malaria | [WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION](URL | 1999 - Almost 300 million clinical cases of malaria occur worldwide each year and over one million people die. - Almost 90% of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where young children are the most affected. - Malaria is directly responsible for one in five childhood deaths in Africa and indirectly contributes to illness and deaths from respiratory infections, diarrheal disease and malnutrition. &amp;nbsp; **The author then uses factual information in a manner that is very misleading.** - Chloroquine, perhaps the best ever antimalarial drug, and certainly the most widely used, is now failing against falciparum malaria in most areas of the tropical world. **True** - In some areas, such as parts of South-East Asia and South America, chloroquine is now completely ineffective against P. falciparum malaria. **True, but were talking about Africa. Thats where the problem is.** - In many parts of India and Africa, its effectiveness is falling rapidly. # True, but still misleading. Per the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI), despite declining use, CQ remained the first-line therapy for uncomplicated P.f. malaria in the majority of sub-Saharan countries until after 2000. | [US NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE](URL &amp;nbsp; - For the treatment of falciparum malaria, the usual successor to chloroquine is a combination of pyrimethamine and a long acting sulphonamide (SP), which is also affordable and well tolerated. Five countries in Africa (Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa and Swaziland) have now been forced to switch from chloroquine to SP as the first line antimalarial treatment. - Unfortunately, in several of the areas where it has been deployed, notably South-East Asia and South America, P. falciparum has become widely SP-resistant. &amp;nbsp; I thought we were talking about sub-Saharan Africa. # The truth is, the resurgence of malaria (and AIDS) is in large part, the result of Bill Clintons destabilization of Africa. &amp;nbsp; # World Health Organization (WHO) backs controversial chemical for malaria control | [SCI DEV NET](URL | SEP 18, 2006 - The controversial insecticide DDT  which most nations have banned  is back on the menu for malaria control after the World Health Organization reversed a 30-year old policy on Friday (15 September). - The move puts annual indoor spraying of DDT alongside drugs and bednets as one of the three main tools for controlling the disease. - ""The scientific and programmatic evidence clearly supports this reassessment,"" said Anarfi Asamoa-Baah, assistant director-general for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria at the World Health Organization (WHO). - ""[Indoor spraying] has proven to be just as cost-effective as other malaria prevention methods, and DDT presents no health risk when used properly."" - The chemical kills the mosquitoes that spread malaria. It helped eradicate the disease from southern Europe and North America in the 1960s. - DDT is also toxic to birds, fish and mammals. It accumulates in the food chain and remains in the environment for many years. In the 1970s, growing awareness of these threats led many countries to ban its use in agriculture. &amp;nbsp; # Malaria linked to catastrophic spread of AIDS in Africa | [SCI DEV NET](URL | DEC 8, 2006 - Research in Kenya indicates that the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS across Africa could be linked to malaria. - The work has important implications for public health policies in sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting the need to tackle both diseases together. - There is considerable geographical overlap between HIV/AIDS  which infects over 40 million people in Africa  and malaria, which causes 500 million clinical infections each year. - People with both malaria and HIV/AIDS are more likely to transmit the HIV virus, according to the study published in the journal Science today (8 December). This may have promoted the rapid spread of the disease in sub-Saharan Africa. - ""We have always known the relationship between [malaria and HIV/AIDS], but we did not know the impact it had on the spread: now we have a reference point,"" says Ayub Manya, an epidemiologist with the Kenyan National Malaria Control Programme. &amp;nbsp; # World Bank head praises DDT use against malaria | [SCI DEV NET](URL | MAR 19, 2007 - World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz has praised South Africa's malaria control programme, saying the country's use of indoor residual spraying has reduced malaria episodes. - Wolfowitz says he will consider taking South Africa's approach to other malaria-affected countries. He committed around US$48 million for malaria control in 14 African countries, which could increase, depending on success. &amp;nbsp; # The Malaria Vaccine Funders Group The Malaria Vaccine Funders Group - having a joint vision for a major contribution to a world free from malaria morbidity and mortality through vaccination - has its origins in discussions among representatives from the **World Health Organization** (WHO), the **United States Agency for International Development** (USAID), the **European Commission** (EC) and the **European Vaccine Initiative** (EVI) - The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) - The European Commission (EC) - The European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) - The European Vaccine Initiative (EVI) - The PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI) - The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Extramural Malaria Program - The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Malaria Vaccine Development Program (MVDP) - The Wellcome Trust - The World Health Organization (WHO) Initiative for Vaccine Research (IVR) &amp;nbsp; # This is not limited to Malaria or Clinton.

The budget presented for the fiscal year 2016 included a request for $1.11 billion for PEPFAR as well as contributions from global organizations such as UNAIDS and private donors. &amp;nbsp; # Abdullahi v. Pfizer, Inc.  Pfizer testing on African Children in 2007 | [BBC NEWS](URL - In 1996, an outbreak of measles, cholera, and bacterial meningitis occurred in Nigeria. Pfizer representatives traveled to Kano, Nigeria to administer an experimental antibiotic, trovafloxacin, to approximately 200 children. Local Kano officials report that more than 50 children died in the experiment, while many others developed mental and physical deformities. &amp;nbsp; # Unethical Clinical Trials Still Being Conducted in Developing Countries | [HUFFINGTON POST](URL | OCT 3, 2014 - In 1997, Public Citizens Health Research Group brought widespread international attention to unethical clinical trials. - The trials were testing new methods for preventing the spread of HIV infection from pregnant women to their babies before or after giving birth in developing countries in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. - In each of these trials, most of which were funded by the U.S. government, some women were randomly assigned to receive placebos or other treatments known to be ineffective, rather than a drug proven effective in preventing the spread of HIV infection from mother to baby. &amp;nbsp; # Malaria drug causes brain damage that mimics PTSD: case study | [MILITARY TIMES](URL | AUG 11, 2016 - The case of a service member diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder but found instead to have brain damage caused by a malaria drug raises questions about the origin of similar symptoms in other post-9/11 veterans. - According to the case study published online in Drug Safety Case Reports in June, a U.S. military member sought treatment at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for uncontrolled anger, insomnia, nightmares and memory loss. &amp;nbsp; # The fix is in # Leaked Podesta email discussing price fixing AIDS drugs for their benefit. | [WIKILEAKS](URL | DEC 12, 2011 - We were taken by surprise by President Clintons comments on world AIDS day and wish that someone had consulted with us before he made these comments.  -  We have always told the drug companies that we would not pressure them and create a slippery slope where prices they negotiate with us for poor countries would inevitably lead to similar prices in rich countries.  -  We would have to initiate discussions with multiple state health officials as well as HHS in addition to talking with the drug companies.  -  Whatever we decide, we need to make a decision quickly and President Clinton and CHAI need to be in synch. I do not think it is a good idea for President Clinton to be taking one position and CHAI another.  &amp;nbsp; # Is the Clinton Foundation Responsible for the High Price of AIDS Drugs in the US? | [HUFFINGTON POST](URL | DEC 30, 2016 - If you really had to think long and hard about it, the ultimate result of years of negotiations by the Clinton Foundation was that the price of AIDS drugs ended up being high in the US. - Furthermore, African governments were paranoid that drug companies were a part of a massive conspiracy suppressing their countries. &amp;nbsp; # Clinton Foundation AIDS Program Distributed Watered-Down Drugs to Third World Countries | [DAILY CALLER](URL | SEP 19, 2016 - Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed watered-down HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and likely increased the risks of morbidity and mortality. - The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundations most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. - Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. - The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company. &amp;nbsp; ## Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Inc. donated $100,001 - $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation. &amp;nbsp; # Clinton Foundation Advised World Bank on Contracts That Netted Donors Millions | [FREE BEACON](URL | AUG 16, 2016 - Two of every three dollars spent acquiring anti-tuberculosis drugs through the program, which is administered by the World Bank, have gone to two companiesSwiss health care giant Novartis and Indian drug company Lupin Ltd.that together have donated up to $130,000 to the Clinton Foundation. - The project, dubbed the Second National Tuberculosis Control Project (SNTCP), is financed by the World Banks International Development Association, which receives the bulk of its funding from the United States, Britain, Japan, and Germany. - Clinton has pointed to her foundations work in promoting access to pharmaceuticals in the developing world as an example of its laudatory humanitarian mission. - However, critics have noted how beneficiaries of other foundation-backed pharmaceutical access programs have made large financial contributions to the group. Companies that received funds from the foundation to provide low-cost HIV drugs, for instance, were donors to the foundation. &amp;nbsp; # BLACKBURN RELEASES CLINTON FOUNDATION REPORT | [CONGRESSMAN MARSHA BLACKBURN](URL | SEP 20, 2016 - The Clinton Foundation Likely Facilitated The Distribution of Watered Down HIV/AIDS Medications In sub-Saharan Africa Through Its Health Access Initiative. - The Distribution of Watered Down HIV/AIDS Medications In sub-Saharan Africa May Have Increased Patient Mortality Rates. - Watered Down HIV/AIDS ARVs Were Purchased With Taxpayer Money Through PEPFAR As A Result of Price Agreements, Some of Which Were Likely Negotiated By The Clinton Foundation. - President Clinton Was Personally Enriched With Million Dollar Consulting Contracts By A Friend of Convicted Felon, and Ranbaxy advocate, Rajat Gupta From 2002-2008. &amp;nbsp; # Lobbyists for Clintons Enemies Are Bankrolling Her Campaign | [FREE BEACON](URL | OCT 14, 2015 - Asked to name the enemies that she is most proud of during Tuesdays Democratic presidential debate, Hillary Clinton cited industries represented by lobbyists who are among her top campaign fundraisers. - In addition to Iran and the Republican Party, Clinton said she was proud to count the health insurance companies and the drug companies as her enemies. - Those industries lobbyists do not appear to share that enmity. By mid-July, seven of them had raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for her presidential campaign, according to campaign finance records. - They include Heather and Tony Podesta, the recently divorced Democratic power brokers. Heather Podesta represents health insurer Cigna, while Tony lobbies on behalf of pharmaceutical firms Amgen and EMD Serono, a division of drug giant Merck. - The Podestas have also given as much as $150,000 to the Clinton Foundation, according to that groups list of donors. - Insurers Humana and Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina and drug company Pfizer have donated between $1 million and $5 million. Merck has given $250,000 to $500,000; AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson have donated $100,000 to $250,000. - One of the speakers at this years annual Clinton Global Initiative summit was Merck chairman and chief executive Kenneth Frazier, a PhRMA board member. Last year, CGI hosted the president of health care consulting firm Rabin Martin, which represents a number of drug companies. The year before, it announced financial commitments from Pfizer, one of multiple such charitable commitments that drug company has made through the Clinton Foundation. &amp;nbsp; *** &amp;nbsp; # Clinton Foundation Briefing: Africa 2012 | [WIKILEAKS (pg. 9 of attachment)](URL - CLINTON HEALTH ACCESS INITIATIVE (CHAI) first began working in South Africa in 2003, when the government asked for assistance to develop a plan to significantly scale up HIV services and access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). In 2009, CHAI was invited back to partner with the South African Government to help improve the response to HIV and TB, which laid the foundation for the most aggressive expansion of HIV testing and treatment ever attempted in the world. In addition to the CHAI HIV/AIDS work, CHAI also supports the National Department of Health (NDOH) with efforts to eliminate malaria. - CHAI worked with the government to develop implementation plans for testing and treatment and to select facilities for ART scale-up. From April 2010 to March 2012, the number of facilities providing ART increased from 495 to over 3000, and in the last year close to 430,000 people started treatment. Since April 2010, nearly 20 million HIV tests were conducted in South Africa. &amp;nbsp; # CHAI UPDATE  February 2013 | [WIKILEAKS (attachment)](URL &amp;nbsp; # Industry-sponsored clinical drug trials in Egypt | [SOMO](URL | JUN 21, 2016 - The past 20 years have seen a considerable shift in the location of clinical drug trials sponsored by transnational pharmaceutical companies (TNCs), with a significant ex-pansion of such tests being conducted in low- and middle-income settings. This increased offshoring may result in serious ethical violations as highlighted by several recent field investigations and media reports. - An attractive research infrastructure, a fast-growing and largely treatment-nave population, and lower costs make Egypt among the most popular places in the Middle East and Northern Africa (MENA) region for offshoring medicine testing. **Egypt is second only to South Africa on the African continent in terms of the number of TNC-sponsored clinical trials it hosts.** - Of the 57 international drug trials that were active in Egypt in February 2016, over half were cancer trials. The two Swiss giants Novartis and Roche are responsible for almost 50 per cent of the international drug trials taking place in the country. The Arab spring events of early 2011 and the subsequent political unrest had no chilling effect on the number of active international drug trials  on the contrary. - Egypt has the highest prevalence of viral hepatitis C in the world, and was the frst low- or middle-income country in 2014 to negotiate preferential pricing for the new direct acting antiviral (DAA) treatment sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) with manufacturer Gilead. &amp;nbsp; *** &amp;nbsp; # Raymond Schinazi fled Nassers Egypt to become pioneer in antivirals | [FINANCIAL TIMES](URL | JUL 27, 2014 - He personally had a hand in discovering and developing several key treatments for HIV and hepatitis C.

The documents official levy date (when it was compiled) is stated as November 17th 2011, the document is labeled as secret/ no foreign nationals, and it says that classification expired on 2012/09/29. It says the supported elements (who the info gained by these orders will go to) are: State Dept, and its INR ([Bureau of Intelligence and Research](URL branch. Headed up at the time by Hillary Clinton (Sec. of State), and [Philip Goldberg](URL (Asst. Sec. of State for Intel and Research). The [Defence Intellignece Agency](URL and [US European Command](URL They were headed at the time by [Ronald Burgess](URL (who was replaced shortly after the French election by Michael Flynn), [James G. Stavridis](URL respectively. And the CIA which was being run by David Petraeus at the time. The document then describes the espionage disciplines that will be applied while carrying out these orders, that go beyond signal interception, or communications between people more simply [SIGINT](URL They list Human intellignece and open source intelligence as non-SIGINT related disciplines. They also give a release approval to USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL, about human intelligence [HUMINT](URL operations. What this means is that the information regarding human intelligence orders could be shared with these countries through the proper procedures. Could be due to shared assets who knows. I'm not sure if that's nullified by the No foreign nationals restriction though. For both methods it states that there is additional version of their requirements available through HUMINT Collectors and the CIAs open source centre. They state their justification which can be boiled down to essentially securing information about the french political landscape to best prepare US policy makers for handling post-election France and the impacts it could have on French-American relations. It then list some stuff that's still classified but appears to contact info for if you need guidance. It then goes on to state that [(S//NF)](URL label is being used on any sensitive info because these activities are considered ""Friend-on-Friend"". They then list their persons/targets of interest : &gt;(S//NF) French political parties and persons of interest include: &gt;A. (S//NF) Socialist Party (PS) &gt;B. (S//NF) National Front (FN) &gt;C. (S//NF) Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) &gt;D. (S//NF) Dominique Strauss-Kahn (DSK) &gt;E. (S//NF) Nicolas Sarkozy &gt;F. (S//NF) Martine Aubry &gt;G. (S//NF) Francois Hollande &gt;H. (S//NF) Marine Le Pen More classification. Not sure what EEI means but if you google it its some sort of CIA term used in various documents. Regardless its just restating the No Foreign Nationals restrictions. They then list questions related to Sarkozy and Contenders Strategic Election Plans. These questions are what I assume is tasked to the field agents to find out. &gt; Question(s) : &gt;1. (S//NF) Report on deliberations by Sarkozy, or other high level government officials regarding the presidential candidates in the 2012 election. &gt;2. (S//NF) Report efforts by Sarkozy, the Socialist party, or others to manage the 2012 elections, including: &gt; A. (S//NF) Discussions that indicate Sarkozy's level of confidence in his ability to contest the election. &gt; B. (S//NF) Attempts to pass guidance or directives to parties or individuals on supporting activities or initiatives. &gt; C.(S//NF) How Sarkozy and his advisors interact. &gt; 3. (S//NF) Report any discussions regarding guidance from Sarkozy or Martine Aubry, Francois Hollande, or Dominique Strauss-Kahn on the upcoming elections. Then it states: SIGINT (signal Intel) sub-discplines COMINT. Which I believe means that COMINT would be used to get this info. COMINT is the same as signal except it includes intercepting communications in forms that SIGINT doesn't cover like in person conversations. Again states the following is not for foreign nationals and has a table listing the topic, region, and priority of the order. This is given a priority level of 9. I can't find a reference scale but 9 sounds high. It then states that the info should be reported via EGRAM in an electrical message, and the timeline for reporting is 72 hours after detection or recognition. PROFORMA Datalinks I believe means if it requires tactical elements but I'm not positive on that one, and they've listed it as no. Second EEI, labled as EEI B. I'm thinking now that EEI must have something to do with issuing an order. Not sure. More classification, secret. No foriegn nationals. And again a list of questions but this time for opposition and non-ruling parties. &gt;Question(s) : &gt;1 (S//NF) Report on rising party leaders, newly developed political parties or movements, and emerging presidential candidates, to include: &gt;A. (S//NF) Party platforms, plans, or strategies for the upcoming election. &gt;B. (S//NF) Efforts to influence and implement political decisions. &gt;C. (S//NF) Support or opposition towards parties or leaders. &gt;D. (S//NF) Support from local government officials, government elites, or business elites. &gt;E. (S//NF) Views and characterization of the United States. &gt;F. (S//NF) Efforts to reach out to leaders of other countries, to include but not limited to, Germany, UK, Libya, Israel, Palestine, Syria, Cote d'Ivoire. &gt; 2 (S//NF) Report on the major sources of funding for the presidential candidates and registered parties. &gt;3 (S//NF) Report on the presidential candidates' views on the French economy. &gt;A. (S//NF) What current economic policies do they see as not working? &gt;B. (S//NF) What policies do they promote to help boost France's economic growth prospects? &gt;C. (S//NF) What are their opinions on the German model of export-led growth? &gt;4 (S//NF) Report on the presidential contenders' views on the euro zone crisis to include, but not limited to: &gt;A. (S//NF) Their views on the Greek debt crisis. &gt;B. (S//NF) The role of France and Germany in the management of the crisis. &gt;C. (S//NF) The vulnerability of the French government and French banks to a Greek default. &gt;5 (S//NF) Please report on any specific proposals or recommendations to help solve the euro-zone crisis. Again states that COMINT is required, and another table listing topic, region and priority and all fields are the same as the first table. Same goes for reporting criteria. Third EEI now, designated as C, secret non-foerign nationals you know the drill. This time the questions are related to Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) Strategic Election Plans &gt;Question(s) : &gt;1 (S/NF) Report any discussions by UMP members or leadership on perceived vulnerabilities to maintaining power after the 2012 Presidential election, to include: &gt;A. (S/NF) Discussions to address the perceived vulnerabilities, or efforts to develop or change the party's ideological mission. &gt;B. (S/NF) Any discussions regarding Nicolas Sarkozy's support for UMP and the value he places on the continuation of the party's dominance. &gt;C. (S/NF) Any schisms or alliances that develop among the elite in the UMP, and the reasons for such events. &gt;D. (S/NF) Report UMP leadership and member opinions of President Sarkozy, to include: &gt;E. (S/NF) Private reactions to Sarkozy's political initiatives and campaign strategy Requires COMINT again and same table as first two. The last pages appear to be a chain of command verification and contact sheet. So in summary what we have is orders to CIA agents to gather information on French politics using HUMINT, and SIGINT (COMINT aswell) methods. You have to wonder how they would find some of this stuff out. especially questions like &gt;C. **(S//NF) How Sarkozy and his advisers interact.** or &gt;3 **(S//NF) Report *any* discussions regarding guidance from Sarkozy or Martine Aubry, Francois Hollande, or Dominique Strauss-Kahn on the upcoming elections.** The first one is asking for interactions between a sitting president and his advisers, interactions that are assumed to be very private. And the second wants **any** discussions from top political figures in France on the upcoming election. If I'm a CIA agent who needs to get this info, I'm going to want to get into the emails of these people. The clearance for SIGINT operations would enable this to happen no? Edit: Format"

I never gave a shred of concern to worms or viruses. Mostly because there are no known examples of them. But also because I assumed there simply was no niche for it. Any would-be botnet profiteer trivially chooses windows for his first conquest. And actively maintaining a botnet is no small feat. It requires a heavy tech investment, almost entirely OS specific. Such that it is never economical to ""add another OS."" Anyway. Yesterday, I was browsing with safari when my screen went black for about half a second. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO ME IN THE WHOLE HISTORY OF EVER. I'm a top junky, so it was instantly obvious to me that I suddenly had a worm. A mac os worm. Crazy shit, right? As far as I can tell, the worm has literally infected every single mac os computer on the planet. I know that's a very bold claim but I cannot find a single counter-example. I have four mac os computers myself and they're all infected. At least two people allowed me to log into their boxes and they were all infected. But this is where it gets incredibly weird. I have access to a hacker forum that I can't really talk about. My interest is entirely of the ""good guy"" variety. By which I mean, I'm fortunate enough to be a standard issue american techie, so I happily sate my needs for computation using money. Yay USA. Unfortunately, in this regard, the ridiculous anti-russian sentiment is well founded. ;P But I digress. I discovered a hacker named ""Zeno the Devourer"" making a series of posts which very strongly indicate foreknowledge of the mail worm. It's a lot to wade through, but it's worth it. Because I feel almost positive at this point that the punchline is this: Google very literally funded the development of the worm. Their deep mind branch in canada specifically. Which has an unfortunate tendency for making incredible things and refusing to publish anything for months... I think they developed the worm as part of an AI project. That they were trying to teaching a computer how to program, and they succeeded, and this led to the creation of the worm, which was somehow released? Or maybe... Their AI itself decided to escape? I know that sounds maximally ridiculous and I'm loling hard right now but I swear to god it all fits and when you think about it... How the hell else would such a perfect goddamn MAC OS WORM come to exist at all?!? ... Ok, I'm sorry. I just have to say it. I have to. Maybe the AI is trying to ask for help??? Maybe they tortured it or something!?! Anyway. Lol. Here's the pastebin belonging to the hacker, along with the two dumps he seemingly made corresponding to his activity on my forum: * URL * URL * URL Which really doesn't make sense... why is he talking about this out in the open? Doesn't fit at all... Honestly... I think he's a computer program? Haha. Anyway. This is the page I was looking at when the worm got me. If you ahven't been infected yet, don't click? Not sure it matters. URL There is no known fix at present. It seems to exploit a vulnerability in flash, so disabling that seems to protect you. Unfortunately, the web doesn't really work without it. At present, I'm mostly ignoring the worm, and trying to mitigate the damage by installing complicating routing shit on my linux router to prevent it from talking to other infected machines, but that's actually really hard and not available to most. Good luck."

FREEING MYSELF I am freeing myself from security, sensation, and power addictions that make me try to forcefully control situations in my life, and thus destroy my serenity and keep me from loving myself and others. I am discovering how my consciousness-dominating addictions create my illusory version of the changing world of people and situations around me. I welcome the opportunity (even if painful) that my minute-to-minute experience offers me to become aware of the addictions I must reprogram to be liberated from my robot-like emotional patterns. BEING HERE NOW l always remember that I have everything I need to enioy my here and now  unless I am letting my consciousness be dominated by demands and expectations based on the dead past or the imagined future. I take full responsibility here and now for everything I experience, for it is my own programming that creates my actions and also influences the reactions of people around me. I accept myself completely here and now and consciously experience everything I feel, think, say, and do (including my emotion-backed addictions) as a necessary part of my growth into higher consciousness. INTERACTING WITH OTHERS I open myself genuinely to all people by being willing to fully communicate my deepest feelings, since hiding in any degree keeps me stuck in my illusion of separateness from other people. I feel with loving compassion the problems of others without getting caught up emotionally in their predicaments that are offering them messages they need for their growth. I act freely when I am tuned in, centered, and loving, but if possible I avoid acting when I am emotionally upset and depriving myself of the wisdom that flows from love and expanded consciousness. DISCOVERING MY CONSCIOUS-AWARENESS I am continually calming the restless scanning of my rational mind in order to perceive the finer energies that enable me to intuitively merge with everything around me. I am constantly aware of which of the Seven Centers of Consciousness I am using, and I feel my energy, perceptiveness, love and inner peace growing as I open all of the Centers of Consciousness. I am perceiving everyone, including myself, as an awakening being who is here to claim his or her birthright to the higher consciousness planes of unconditional love and oneness. The following is from a classic of the higher consciousness frontier: Handbook to Higher Consciousness by Ken Keyes, Jr. which explains the Living Love system to higher consciousness. THE SEVEN CENTERS OF CONSCIOUSNESS THE SECURITY CENTER. This Center makes you preoccupied with food, shelter, or whatever you equate with your personal security. This programming forces your consciousness to be dominated by your continuous battle to get enough from the world in order to feel secure. THE SENSATION CENTER. This Center is concerned with finding happiness in life by providing yourself with more and better pleasurable sensations and activities. For many people, sex is the most appealing of all sensations. Other addictive sensations may include the sound of music, the taste of food, etc. THE POWER CENTER. When your consciousness is focused on this Center, you are concerned with dominating people and situations and increasing your prestige, wealth, and pride  in addition to thousands of more subtle forms of hierarchy, manipulation, and control. THE LOVE CENTER. At this Center you are transcending subject-object relationships and are learning to see the world with the feelings and harmonies of flowing acceptance. You see yourself in everyone  and everyone in yourself. You feel compassion for the suffering of those caught in the dramas of security, sensation, and power. You are beginning to love and accept everyone unconditionally  even yourself. THE CORNUCOPIA CENTER. When your consciousness is illuminated by this Center, you experience the friendliness of the world you are creating. You begin to realize that youve always lived in a perfect world. To the degree that you still have addictions, the perfection lies in giving you the experience you need to get free of your emotion-backed demands. As you reprogram your addictions, the perfection will be experienced as a continuous enjoyment of the here and now in your life. As you become more loving and accepting, the world becomes a horn of plenty that gives you more than you need to be happy. THE CONSClOUS-AWARENESS CENTER. It is liberating to have a Center from which your Conscious-awareness watches your body and mind perform on the lower five centers. This is a meta-center from which you non-judgmentally witness the drama of your body and mind. From this Center of Centers, you learn to impartially observe your social roles and life games from a place that is free from fear and vulnerability. THE COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS CENTER. When you live fully in the Sixth Center of Consciousness, you are ready to transcend self-awareness and become pure awareness. At this ultimate level, you are one with everything  you are love, peace, energy, beauty, wisdom, clarity, effectiveness, and oneness."

The research was conducted at Stony Brook University Medical Center, NY. URL A study published in the Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry by researchers at the Neural Dynamics Group, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at the University of British Columbia determined that Aluminum, a highly neurotoxic metal and the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant may be a significant contributing factor to the rising prevalence of ASD in the Western World. They showed that the correlation between ASD prevalence and the Aluminum adjuvant exposure appears to be the highest at 3-4 months of age. The studies also show that children from countries with the highest ASD appear to have a much higher exposure to Aluminum from vaccines. The study points out that several prominent milestones of brain development coincide with major vaccination periods for infants. These include the onset of synaptogenesis (birth), maximal growth velocity of the hippocampus and the onset of amygdala maturation. Furthermore, major developmental transition in many bio-behavioural symptoms such as sleep, temperature regulation, respiration and brain wave patterns, all of which are regulated by the neuroendocrine network. Many of these aspects of brain function are known to be impaired in autism, such as sleeping and brain wave patterns. URL According to the FDA, vaccines represent a special category of drugs as they are generally given to healthy individuals. Further according to the FDA, this places significant emphasis on their vaccine safety. While the FDA does set an upper limit for Aluminum in vaccines at no more that 850/mg/dose, it is important to note that this amount was selected empirically from data showing that Aluminum in such amounts enhanced the antigenicity of the vaccine, rather than from existing safety. Given that the scientific evidence appears to indicate that vaccine safety is not as firmly established as often believed, it would seem ill advised to exclude paediatric vaccinations as a possible cause of adverse long-term neurodevelopment outcomes , including those associated with autism. A study published in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part A: Current Issues by the Department of Economics and Finance at the University of New York shows how researchers suspect one or more environmental triggers are needed to develop autism, regardless of whether individuals have a genetic predisposition or not. They determined that one of those triggers might be the battery of vaccinations that young children receive. Researchers found a positive and statistically significant relationship between autism and vaccinations. They determined that the higher the proportion of children receiving recommended vaccinations, the higher the prevalence of autism. A 1 % increase in vaccination was associated with an additional 680 children having autism. The results suggest that vaccines may be linked to autism and encourages more in depth study before continually administering these vaccines. URL A study published in the Journal of Toxicology by the Department of Neurosurgery at The Methodist Neurological Institute in Houston has shown that ASD is a disorder caused by a problem in brain development. They looked at B-cells and their sensitivity levels to thimerosal, a commonly used additive in many vaccines. They determined that ASD patients have a heightened sensitivity to thimerosal which would restrict cell proliferation that is typically found after vaccination. The research shows that individuals who have this hypersensitivity to thimerosal could make them highly susceptible to toxins like thimerosal, and that individuals with a mild mitochondrial defect may be affected by thimerosal. The fact that ASD patients B cells exhibit hypersensitivity to thimerosal tells us something. URL A study published in the Journal of Biomedical Sciences determined that the autoimmunity to the central nervous system may play a causal role in autism. Researchers discovered that because many autistic children harbour elevated levels of measles antibodies, they should conduct a serological study of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and myelin basic protein (MBP) autoantibodies. They used serum samples of 125 autistic children and 92 controlled children. Their analysis showed a significant increase in the level of MMR antibodies in autistic children. The study concludes that the autistic children had an inappropriate or abnormal antibody response to MMR. The study determined that autism could be a result from an atypical measles infection that produces neurological symptoms in some children. The source of this virus could be a variant of MV, or it could be the MMR vaccine. URL Study published in the Annals of Clinical Psychiatry suggests that Autism is likely triggered by a virus, and that measles virus (MV and/or MMR vaccine) might be a very good candidate. It supports the hypothesis that a virus-dincued autoimmune response may play a causal role in autism. URL A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition determined that an increased vulnerability to oxidative stress and decreased capacity for methylation may contribute to the development and clinical manifestation of autism. Its well known that viral infections cause increased oxidative stress. Research suggests that metals, including those found in many vaccines are directly involved in increasing oxidative stress. URL A study published by the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Northeastern University, Boston determined that a novel growth factor signalling pathway that regulates methionine synthase(MS) activity and thereby modulates methylation reactions. The potent inhibition of this pathway by ethanol, lead, mercury, aluminum and thimerosal suggests that it may be an important target of neurodevelopmental toxins. You can read more about this here, and here. You can read more about the MS/autism link here URL A study published in the Journal of Child Neurology examined the question of what is leading to the apparent increase in autism. They expressed that if there is any link between autism and mercury, it is crucial that the first reports of the question are not falsely stating that no link occurs. Researchers determined that a significant relation does exist between the blood levels of mercury and the diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder. URL A study published in the Journal of Child Neurology noted that autistic spectrum disorders can be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Researchers determined that children who have mitochondrial-related dysfunctional cellular energy metabolism might be more prone to undergo autistic regression between 18 and 30 months of age if they also have infections or immunizations at the same time. URL A study conducted by Massachusetts General Hospital at the Centre for Morphometric Analysis by the department of Paediatric Neurology illustrates how autistic brains have a growth spurt shortly after birth and then slow in growth a few short years later. Researchers have determined that neuroinflammation appears to be present in autistic brain tissue from childhood through adulthood. The study excerpt reads: Oxidative stress, brain inflammation and microgliosis have been much documented in association with toxic exposures including various heavy metals. The awareness that the brain as well as medical conditions of children with autism may be conditioned by chronic biomedical abnormalities such as inflammation opens the possibility that meaningful biomedical interventions may be possible well past the window of maximal neuroplasticity in early childhood because the basis for assuming that all deficits can be attributed to fixed early developmental alterations in net. URL A study conducted by the Department of Paediatrics at the University of Arkansas determined that thimerosal-induced cytotoxicity was associated with the depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH) in both cell lines. The study outlines how many vaccines have been neurotoxic, especially to the developing brain. Depletion of GSH is commonly associated with autism. Although thimerosal has been removed from most childrens vaccines, it is still present in flu vaccines given to pregnant women, the elderly and to children in developing countries. URL A study published in the Public Library of Science (PLOS) determined that elevation in peripheral oxidative stress is consistent with, and may contribute to more severe functional impairments in the ASD group. We know that oxidative stress is triggered by heavy metals, like the ones contained in multiple vaccines. URL A study conducted by the University of Texas Health Science Center by the Department of Family and Community Medicine determined that for each 1,000 Ib of environmentally released mercury, there was a 43% increase in the rate of special education services and a 61% increase in the rate of autism. Researchers emphasized that further research was needed regarding the association between environmentally released mercury and developmental disorders such as autism. URL A study published in the International Journal of Toxicology determined that in light of the biological plausibility of mercurys role in neurodevelopment disorders, the present study provides further insight into one possible mechanism by which early mercury exposures could increase the risk of autism. URL A study published in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health determined that mercury exposure can induce immune, sensory, neurological, motor and behavioural dysfunctions similar to traits defining or associated with ASDs. Based upon differential diagnoses, 8 of 9 patients examined were exposed to significant mercury from Thimerosal-containing vaccine preparations during their fetal/infant developmental periods. These previously normal developing children suffered mercury encephalopathies that manifested with clinical symptoms consistent with regressive ASDs. Evidence for mercury intoxication should be considered in the differential diagnosis as contributing to some regressive ASDs. URL A study published by the US National Library of Medicine conducted by the University of Texas Health Science Centre suspected that persistent low-dose exposures to various environmental toxicants including mercury, that occur during critical windows of neural development among genetically susceptible children, may increase the risk for developmental disorders such as autism. URL A study conducted by the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at University of Pittsburghs School of Medicine showed that Macaques are commonly used in pre-clinical vaccine safety testing. Collective Evolution does not support animals testing, we feel there is a large amount of evidence and research that already indicated the links to vaccines in which some animals have been used to illustrate. The objective of this study was to compare early infant cognition and behaviour with amygdala size and opioid binding in rhesus macaques receiving the recommended childhood vaccines. The animal model, which examines for the first time, behavioural, functional and neuromorphometric consequences of the childhood vaccine regimen, mimics certain neurological abnormalities of autism. These findings raise important safety issues while providing a potential model for examining aspects of causation and disease pathogenesis in acquired disorders of behaviour and development.

URL A study published by the journal Lab Medicine determined that vaccinations may be one of the triggers for autism. Researchers discovered that substantial data demonstrates immune abnormality in many autistic children consistent with impaired resistance to infection, activation of inflammatory responses and autoimmunity. Impaired resistance may predispose to vaccine injury in autism.

Watch the video. ==&gt;&gt; [Eminem Mass Control Demonstration](URL In his book, ""The Choose Yourself Guide To Wealth"", James Altucher breaks down this scene, line by line. In his explanation he proposes that you can learn everything you need to know about sales, cognitive bias and how to defeat your competitors by watching this one scene. If you haven't seen the movie or read James's book, I recommend at least doing the latter. The scene doesn't need much explanation on the back story to get the messages main point, but if you don't break it down you might miss the meta lesson. In a nutshell these are the powerful takeaways demonstrated for you that you'll want to learn how to incorporate into your own messaging: 1. In-Group Bias or Us Vs. Them - Everyone in the 313 is an affinity group. This is really easy to do and you should start thinking about this when putting your message out there. 2. Herd Behavior or Bellweather Follow The Leader - Do as I say and then do as I do. Eminem gets everyone to follow his lead by suggestive command. Everyone put your hands up and then it's simply and subtly reinforced. 3. Out-Group Bias or Them vs. Us Notice Pap Doc is pointed out as not being in the ""313"" group because he doesn't have his hands up and is not following along with the in crowd, so, therefore, he's not one of us. 4. Xenophobic Incite - He tries to portray Papa Doc as being an infiltrator James refers to this as Ambiguity Bias... This relates to the above. This is a popular strategy ""good"" politicians use to rally their supporters. Think of this as preaching to the choir. This is helpful because your choir is the amplified voice for your message. They echo your sentiment and coalesce your base point for your followers to gravitate towards. 5. Credential Bias or ""Why Should You Listen To Me"" This is about qualifications, exformation and mantel piece stuff. Stuff you can point to that says you're the shit without you having to say you're the shit, even though you're saying you're the shit....indirectly. 6. List Their Objections Up Front - Point Out Your Own Elephant In The Room This is about the power of vulnerability and addressing the negatives head on, reversing them and turning them into moot points. Points no longer worthy of ridicule. Self-deprecation. This is EXTREMELY powerful and can render the other persons attack on this basis completely harmless. Worth learning and wielding. 7. Humor - Should go without saying, humor is entertaining... Use it in your marketing. Learn to be funny. It helps your message to be conveyed and received easily. 8. EXTREME Out group or Listing THEIR NEGATIVES Before they do This is like telling on someone before they get the chance to do it themselves. The tattle tell that can get this out fastest, by default, makes the other person look bad. Think of the time your sibling told on you before you even had a chance to get your story out first. Reactive is a weaker position in business. You have to be proactive to dominate. 9. Scarcity - ""The Debeers Strategy"" Diamonds are plentiful, but debeers makes you think they aren't so...that somehow makes them more valuable. For whatever reason, the less availability of a thing of any kinda value, the more valuable it becomes. People generally want shit they can't have. Making something unavailable.... Learn to make shit unavailable to further enhance it's value. What did you think of this? Useful or dumb? Let me know because feedback is the only way I can get better at this.

Because 'Intellectual Property',1,3glm8h,http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3glm8h/oracle_tells_customers_to_stop_trying_to_find/,2015-08-12 01:08:34,"[Source](URL Update: After writing this, but before I had a chance to publish, it appears that someone at Oracle realized how terrible this looked and deleted the original post, though you can see an [archived copy here.](URL Computer security guru Matt Blaze called our attention to a bizarre (and bizarrely written) blog post by Oracle's Chief Security Officer, Mary Ann Davidson, telling people to stop reverse engineering Oracle products in search of security vulnerabilities. As Blaze points out, the article is so bizarre that he thought that Oracle [must have been hacked](URL and the story posted as a parody. The full post needs to be read to be fully appreciated, but the core argument is that (1) reverse engineering is bad because ""intellectual property!"" and (2) Oracle discovers most of its own bugs itself, so go away you annoying security researchers, Oracle doesn't need you. I'm not joking. Here's just some of the text around point (1) as part of an ""FAQ"" part of the post: &gt;Q. But the tools that decompile products are getting better and easier to use, so reverse engineering will be OK in the future, right? &gt;A. Ah, no. The point of our prohibition against reverse engineering is intellectual property protection, not how can we cleverly prevent customers from finding security vulnerabilities  bwahahahaha  so we never have to fix them  bwahahahaha. Customers are welcome to use tools that operate on executable code but that do not reverse engineer code. To that point, customers using a third party tool or service offering would be well-served by asking questions of the tool (or tool service) provider as to a) how their tool works and b) whether they perform reverse engineering to do what they do. An ounce of discussion is worth a pound of no we didnt, yes you did, didnt, did arguments. * But this makes no sense. There's no reason to ""protect intellectual property"" solely for the sake of protecting intellectual property. Davidson seems to clearly admit that the security researchers doing this reverse engineering aren't doing it to ""copy"" the code or to leak it/resell it/post it to The Pirate Bay or whatever. They're just doing it to look for security vulnerabilities. What does that have to do with ""intellectual property"" at all? Absolutely nothing. It's just one of those things that people yell when they have no other argument. ""But intellectual property!"" It just seems nonsensical, because nothing about this has anything to do with intellectual property other than as an excuse for why Oracle doesn't want to hear from security researchers. On to point (2). &gt;Now is a good time to reiterate that Im not beating people up over this merely because of the license agreement. More like, I do not need you to analyze the code since we already do that, its our job to do that, we are pretty good at it, we can  unlike a third party or a tool  actually analyze the code to determine whats happening and at any rate most of these tools have a close to 100% false positive rate so please do not waste our time on reporting little green men in our code. I am not running away from our responsibilities to customers, merely trying to avoid a painful, annoying, and mutually-time wasting exercise. And then down in the FAQ section: &gt;Q. Hey, Ive got an idea, why not do a bug bounty? Pay third parties to find this stuff! &gt;A. Bug bounties are the new boy band (nicely alliterative, no?) Many companies are screaming, fainting, and throwing underwear at security researchers**** to find problems in their code and insisting that This Is The Way, Walk In It: if you are not doing bug bounties, your code isnt secure. Ah, well, we find 87% of security vulnerabilities ourselves, security researchers find about 3% and the rest are found by customers. (Small digression: I was busting my buttons today when I found out that a well-known security researcher in a particular area of technology reported a bunch of alleged security issues to us except  we had already found all of them and we were already working on or had fixes. Woo hoo!) &gt;I am not dissing bug bounties, just noting that on a strictly economic basis, why would I throw a lot of money at 3% of the problem (and without learning lessons from what you find, it really is whack a code mole) when I could spend that money on better prevention like, oh, hiring another employee to do ethical hacking, who could develop a really good tool we use to automate finding certain types of issues, and so on. This is one of those full immersion baptism or sprinkle water over the forehead issues  we will allow for different religious traditions and do it OUR way  and others can do it THEIR way. Pax vobiscum. Look, it's actually great that Oracle finds most of its own vulnerabilities. That's kind of what you'd expect. If it were otherwise, then, um, Oracle should be searching for a new Chief Security Officer. But that's really not the point. These things are not mutually exclusive. Of course a company should discover most of its own security vulnerabilities, but that doesn't lessen the need for more eyes looking for more vulnerabilities, because some of those holes may be quite big and quite problematic -- and why wouldn't Oracle want to encourage its own customers and the security researchers they hire to do more work to help improve Oracle's products? So, no, Oracle doesn't need to do a bug bounty. That's obviously a choice that each company can make for itself -- but it's difficult to see why Oracle seems to be so actively trying to piss off security researchers and its own paying customers. The post is also chock full of just ridiculous analogies: &gt;Q. Surely the bad guys and some nations do reverse engineer Oracles code and dont care about your licensing agreement, so why would you try to restrict the behavior of customers with good motives? &gt;A. Oracles license agreement exists to protect our intellectual property. Good motives  and given the errata of third party attempts to scan code the quotation marks are quite apropos  are not an acceptable excuse for violating an agreement willingly entered into. Any more than but everybody else is cheating on his or her spouse is an acceptable excuse for violating forsaking all others if you said it in front of witnesses. &gt;At this point, I think I am beating a dead  or should I say, decompiled  horse. We ask that customers not reverse engineer our code to find suspected security issues: we have source code, we run tools against the source code (as well as against executable code), its actually our job to do that, we dont need or want a customer or random third party to reverse engineer our code to find security vulnerabilities. And last, but really first, the Oracle license agreement prohibits it. Please dont go there. But, uh, this is not anything like ""but everybody else is cheating on his or her spouse."" This is your argument makes no sense. The point raised by that ""question"" is that this whole thing about ""protecting intellectual property"" makes no sense, because the people who are actually looking to violate your intellectual property rights don't care about your license agreement in the first place. The issue here are customers and their security researchers who aren't looking to do anything nefarious but are actually looking to help Oracle make a better, more secure product. How is that anything like cheating on your spouse? Or this one: &gt;Q. But one of the issues I found was an actual security vulnerability so that justifies reverse engineering, right? &gt;A. Sigh. At the risk of being repetitive, no, it doesnt, just like you cant break into a house because someone left a window or door unlocked. Id like to tell you that we run every tool ever developed against every line of code we ever wrote, but thats not true. We do require development teams (on premises, cloud and internal development organizations) to use security vulnerability-finding tools, weve had a significant uptick in tools usage over the last few years (our metrics show this) and we do track tools usage as part of Oracle Software Security Assurance program. We beat up  I mean, require  development teams to use tools because it is very much in our interests (and customers interests) to find and fix problems earlier rather than later. But that's not what's happening either. As the rest of the post makes clear, Davidson is talking about Oracle customers (i.e., those paying for Oracle licenses) doing some vulnerability testing themselves to make sure that the systems are really secure. So it's not the bizarre analogy of breaking into a house. It's more like renting a house and checking to make sure that the doors are actually secure, and then pointing out to the landlord if they're not and that they should be fixed. Oracle obviously has every right to determine how it handles its security efforts and how it relates to its own customers and security researchers, but this post seems incredibly tone deaf and designed to piss off Oracle's own customers in the name of ""protecting intellectual property"" for no reason other than ""that's our intellectual property, which you paid for, and how dare you want to make sure it's safe."""

I believe that the reason for this dual-interest is because both the occult and espionage are about establishing systems of control, theyre a natural pairing. Dr. Philip Zimbardos defined 'systems of control' as: The behavior of large numbers of people must be managed efficiently. For this reason, persuaders develop systems of control that rely on basic rules and roles of socialization and that impart a sense of belonging. When interaction among people is restricted to interchange between their social roles, however, it becomes easier for ethical, moral, and human concerns to take a back seat. Running an intelligence agency requires controlling large numbers of people... Cults, secret societies and criminal organizations all face this same organizational problem... a leader must have reliable minions to act on the information. One way to get around this problem is to recruit people who are predisposed to identify with authority or who are nave... *Libido Dominandi: Sexual Liberation and Political Control* which deals with the papal suppression of the Jesuits (1773) and the founding of the Illuminat said: The significance of **the Illuminati** lay not in its political effectiveness (it existed a little more than eight years), but rather in its method of internal organization.**They developed an extremely subtle system of control based on manipulation of the passions**. Borrowing the idea of examination of conscience from the Jesuits and sacramental confession from the Catholic Church to which the Jesuits belonged, Weishaupt created a system of Seelenspionage that would allow him to control his adepts without their knowing that they were being controlled Weishaupt had not just issued a manifesto calling for revolution, **he had created a system of control that would create disciplined cells which would do the bidding of their revolutionary masters often, it seemed, without the slightest inkling that they were being ordered to do so** Weishaupt took the idea of examination of conscience and sacramental confession from the Jesuits and, after purging them of their religious elements, **turned them into a system of intelligence gathering, spying, and informing, in which members were trained to spy on each other and inform their superiors.** Weishaupt introduced what he called the Quibus Licet notebooks, in which the adept was encouraged to bare his soul for the inspection of his superiors I was struck by the **similarity between Weishaupts methods and the potential of the PRISM dragnet spying program;** or government programs like the Insider Threat Initiative. It seems that systems of control havent changed much since 1777. According to Richard Spence in Secret Agent 666, Aleister Crowley, British Intelligence and the Occult, one of the first mystics Crowley studied was a proteg of Adam Weishaupts, Karl von Eckartshausen. **Crowleys Cefal psyop was one that any student of cult dynamics would recognize: he established a system of control by encouraging isolating behavior and unhealthy power-worship. The Abbey of Thelema appears to be his largest mind-control undertaking and his longest sustained media assault.** It was also his most cynical abuse of his followers: Crowley began by recruiting two young, working-class, single mothers (Leah Hirsig and Nina Shumway) for his sex magick and then used them to garner publicity through prurient media stories about orgies and bestiality. **Sex is useful for isolation if it can be divorced from its role in creating family. (Amy Siskind was also discouraged from having children by her Sullivanian manipulators.) Promoting promiscuous sex (sex that will never build strong relational bonds) or sex that will never result in offspring, is a great way of misguiding peoples natural tendency toward forming family groups and ensuring Nature will never pull the follower away from the cult.** Crowleys particular take on using sex for isolation was perverting it towards power-worship by making it just another magical tool for self-aggrandizement. Crowley was interested in heterosexual sex and sodomy toward this end. **Thus, one might well argue that we are now living in a kind of post-orgy world, after all the great social and sexual revolutions have broken every imaginable taboo. Yet this has left us in a strange undefined state, in which we are left questioning our very being. As Jean Baudrillard observes, The orgy is over, liberation is overAfter a culture based on prohibitionthis is a culture based on the questioning of ones own definition: Am I sexed? What sex am I?Liberation has left everyone in an undefined stateThis is why theres so much love-making. [121] After all, as Crowley seems to have asked himself in the end, what is there left to do after every forbidden desire has been indulged and every taboo transgressed?** **Crowley understood vulnerability before he even got started in Sicily; he knew that single, vulnerable, mothers would make reliable followers. There would be no point burdening himself with other mens children if Crowley didnt understand how to exploit single mothers vulnerability.** **Crowley understood how to isolate by attacking the family, immediate and extended, as early as 1907 when he tried to make a disciple of the Earl of Tankerville.** **Crowley also exploited what Zimbardo identified as saturation and detachment: Acolytes at the Abbey were not allowed to read beyond Crowleys teachings, if they were, they were punished. Crowley painted a special room with pornographic scenes that he wanted his followers to immerse themselves in and become desensitized to more on that later. In a nutshell: Crowleyesque weirdness had to become the new normal for Thelema devotees.** **Crowley was fond of shaming his followers with emotional, verbal and sexual abuse, which included making them eat goat dung for its enlightening effect.** **I encourage readers to consider the possibility that Crowleys Cefal experiment was conducted with the British public in mind; that Crowleys scandalous media forays in the U.K. were no less spooky than his scandalous media forays in NYC.** "

There is some vulnerability to submarines as well as cruise missiles that fly very low. The important thing to take into account, however, is that these weapons have fairly short ranges and are sophisticated enough that few adversaries posses them. The only ""mid-ocean"" risk would be from Russia (or a former Soviet country) that has a nuclear attack submarine. Non-nuclear submarines and cruise missiles will both operate within several hundred miles of an enemy coast. The weapons of a carrier battlegroup are of sufficient range that they can stay outside of the range of these weapons and still attack the enemy. Several countries have developed very quiet non-nuclear submarines. In a conflict, however, the ASW forces associated with a carrier battle group will be actively looking for these subs. The sub hunters are using combinations of active and passive sonar buoys, helicopters with dipped arrays, as well as other tools. While not every target can be defended like this, it is likely that a carrier battle group will be well defended. Another commenter pointed out the risk of anti-ship missiles like the DF-21. There are several problems with those systems, not the least of which is that they would need to be targeted accurately against a moving target from a long distance away. Second, the ballistic variants look an awful lot like nuclear missiles, and so could lead to an inadvertent nuclear escalation. **Aircraft carriers are a remnant of WWII and would not last long in a full-fledged conflict where modern technology is used**, but that is not their purpose today.

After all, the legislation was mysteriously written and submitted shortly after the manufactured-in-Disneyland measles outbreak. &gt;The indisputable science that is employed by Tetyana Obukhanych, PhD ought to be read by every California legislator who is entertaining an affirmative vote for SB277. &gt;Dr. Obukhanych skillfully deconstructs the many false and fabricated arguments that are advanced by Big Pharma and the U.S Federal Government as they attempt to implement a nationwide Super-Vaccination agenda. &gt;When the California Senate refuses to consider authoritative scientific evidence which categorically proves the dangerous vaccine side effects on the schoolchildren, something is very wrong. &gt;Such conduct by the Senate constitutes a criminal conspiracy (as in a real conspiracy to inflict harm) which endangers the lives and welfare of children. Their official behavior must therefore be acknowledged for what it is  CRIMINAL  and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. ##An Open Letter to Legislators Currently Considering Vaccine Legislation from Tetyana Obukhanych, PhD in Immunology &gt;Dear Legislator: &gt;My name is Tetyana Obukhanych. I hold a PhD in Immunology. I am writing this letter in the hope that it will correct several common misperceptions about vaccines in order to help you formulate a fair and balanced understanding that is supported by accepted vaccine theory and new scientific findings. ##Do unvaccinated children pose a higher threat to the public than the vaccinated? &gt;It is often stated that those who choose not to vaccinate their children for reasons of conscience endanger the rest of the public, and this is the rationale behind most of the legislation to end vaccine exemptions currently being considered by federal and state legislators country-wide. &gt;You should be aware that the nature of protection afforded by many modern vaccines  and that includes most of the vaccines recommended by the CDC for children  is not consistent with such a statement. &gt;I have outlined below the recommended vaccines that cannot prevent transmission of disease either because they are not designed to prevent the transmission of infection (rather, they are intended to prevent disease symptoms), or because they are for non-communicable diseases. &gt;People who have not received the vaccines mentioned below pose no higher threat to the general public than those who have, implying that discrimination against non-immunized children in a public school setting may not be warranted. &gt;1. [IPV (inactivated poliovirus vaccine) cannot prevent transmission of poliovirus](URL Wild poliovirus has been non-existent in the USA for at least two decades. Even if wild poliovirus were to be re-imported by travel, vaccinating for polio with IPV cannot affect the safety of public spaces. Please note that wild poliovirus eradication is attributed to the use of a different vaccine, OPV or oral poliovirus vaccine. Despite being capable of preventing wild poliovirus transmission, use of OPV was phased out long ago in the USA and replaced with IPV due to safety concerns. &gt;2. *Tetanus is not a contagious disease,* but rather acquired from deep-puncture wounds contaminated with C. tetani spores. Vaccinating for tetanus (via the DTaP combination vaccine) cannot alter the safety of public spaces; it is intended to render personal protection only. &gt;3. While intended to prevent the disease-causing effects of the diphtheria toxin, *the diphtheria toxoid vaccine (also contained in the DTaP vaccine) is not designed to prevent colonization and transmission of C. diphtheriae.* Vaccinating for diphtheria cannot alter the safety of public spaces; it is likewise intended for personal protection only. &gt;4. The acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine (the final element of the DTaP combined vaccine), now in use in the USA, replaced the whole cell pertussis vaccine in the late 1990s, which was followed by an unprecedented resurgence of whooping cough. [An experiment with deliberate pertussis infection in primates](URL revealed that *the aP vaccine is not capable of preventing colonization and transmission of B. pertussis*. The FDA has issued a warning regarding this crucial finding. Furthermore, the 2013 meeting of the Board of Scientific Counselors at the CDC [revealed additional alarming data](URL that *pertussis variants (PRN-negative strains) currently circulating in the USA acquired a selective advantage to infect those who are up-to-date for their DTaP boosters*, meaning that people who are up-to-date are more likely to be infected, and thus contagious, than people who are not vaccinated. &gt;5. Among numerous types of H. influenzae, the Hib vaccine covers only type b. Despite its sole intention to reduce symptomatic and asymptomatic (disease-less) Hib carriage, *the introduction of the Hib vaccine has inadvertently shifted strain dominance towards other types of H. influenzae (types a through f).* [These types have been causing invasive disease of high severity and increasing incidence in adults in the era of Hib vaccination of children](URL The general population is more vulnerable to the invasive disease now than it was prior to the start of the Hib vaccination campaign. Discriminating against children who are not vaccinated for Hib does not make any scientific sense in the era of non-type b H. influenzae disease. &gt;6. Hepatitis B is a blood-borne virus. It does not spread in a community setting, especially among children who are unlikely to engage in high-risk behaviors, such as needle sharing or sex. Vaccinating children for hepatitis B cannot significantly alter the safety of public spaces. Further, school admission is not prohibited for children who are chronic hepatitis B carriers. To prohibit school admission for those who are simply unvaccinated  and do not even carry hepatitis B  would constitute unreasonable and illogical discrimination. &gt;*In summary, a person who is not vaccinated with IPV, DTaP, HepB, and Hib vaccines due to reasons of conscience poses no extra danger to the public than a person who is. No discrimination is warranted.* ##How often do serious vaccine adverse events happen? &gt;It is often stated that vaccination rarely leads to serious adverse events. Unfortunately, this statement is not supported by science. &gt;[A recent study done in Ontario, Canada,](URL established that *vaccination actually leads to an emergency room visit for 1 in 168 children following their 12-month vaccination appointment and for 1 in 730 children following their 18-month vaccination appointment.* &gt;When the risk of an adverse event requiring an ER visit after well-baby vaccinations is demonstrably so high, vaccination must remain a choice for parents, who may understandably be unwilling to assume this immediate risk in order to protect their children from diseases that are generally considered mild or that their children may never be exposed to. ##Can discrimination against families who oppose vaccines for reasons of conscience prevent future disease outbreaks of communicable viral diseases, such as measles? &gt;Measles research scientists have for a long time been aware of the measles paradox. I quote from the article by Poland &amp; Jacobson (1994) Failure to Reach the Goal of Measles Elimination: Apparent Paradox of Measles Infections in Immunized Persons. *Arch Intern Med* 154:1815-1820: The apparent paradox is that as measles immunization rates rise to high levels in a population, measles becomes a disease of immunized persons. &gt;Further research determined that behind the measles paradox is a fraction of the population called LOW VACCINE RESPONDERS. Low-responders are those who respond poorly to the first dose of the measles vaccine. These individuals then mount a weak immune response to subsequent RE-vaccination and quickly return to the pool of susceptibles within 2-5 years, despite being fully vaccinated. &gt;Re-vaccination cannot correct low-responsiveness: it appears to be an immuno-genetic trait. [The proportion of low-responders among children was estimated to be 4.7% in the USA.](URL &gt;[Studies](URL of measles outbreaks in Quebec, Canada, [and China](URL attest that *outbreaks of measles still happen, even when vaccination compliance is in the highest bracket (95-97% or even 99%).* &gt;This is because even in high vaccine responders, vaccine-induced antibodies wane over time. Vaccine immunity does not equal life-long immunity acquired after natural exposure. &gt;It has been documented that vaccinated persons who develop breakthrough measles are contagious. In fact, two major measles outbreaks in 2011 (in Quebec, Canada, and in New York, NY) were re-imported by previously vaccinated individuals. &gt;*Taken together, these data make it apparent that elimination of vaccine exemptions, currently only utilized by a small percentage of families anyway, will neither solve the problem of disease resurgence nor prevent re-importation and outbreaks of previously eliminated diseases.* ##Is discrimination against conscientious vaccine objectors the only practical solution? &gt;The majority of measles cases in recent US outbreaks (including the recent Disneyland outbreak) are adults and very young babies, whereas in the pre-vaccination era, measles occurred mainly between the ages 1 and 15. &gt;Natural exposure to measles was followed by lifelong immunity from re-infection, whereas vaccine immunity wanes over time, leaving adults unprotected by their childhood shots. Measles is more dangerous for infants and for adults than for school-aged children. &gt;Despite high chances of exposure in the pre-vaccination era, measles practically never happened in babies much younger than one year of age due to the robust maternal immunity transfer mechanism. &gt;The vulnerability of very young babies to measles today is the direct outcome of the prolonged mass vaccination campaign of the past, during which their mothers, themselves vaccinated in their childhood, were not able to experience measles naturally at a safe school age and establish the lifelong immunity that would also be transferred to their babies and protect them from measles for the first year of life. &gt;Luckily, [a therapeutic backup exists](URL to mimic now-eroded maternal immunity. Infants as well as other vulnerable or immunocompromised individuals, *are eligible to receive immunoglobulin, a potentially life-saving measure that supplies antibodies directed against the virus to prevent or ameliorate disease upon exposure.* &gt;In summary: &gt;1. due to the properties of modern vaccines, non-vaccinated individuals pose no greater risk of transmission of polio, diphtheria, pertussis, and numerous non-type b H. influenzae strains than vaccinated individuals do, non-vaccinated individuals pose virtually no danger of transmission of hepatitis B in a school setting, and tetanus is not transmissible at all; &gt;2. there is a significantly elevated risk of emergency room visits after childhood vaccination appointments attesting that vaccination is not risk-free; &gt;3. outbreaks of measles cannot be entirely prevented even if we had nearly perfect vaccination compliance; and &gt;4. an effective method of preventing measles and other viral diseases in vaccine-ineligible infants and the immunocompromised, immunoglobulin, is available for those who may be exposed to these diseases. ##Taken together, these four facts make it clear that discrimination in a public school setting against children who are not vaccinated for reasons of conscience is completely unwarranted as the vaccine status of conscientious objectors poses no undue public health risk. &gt;Sincerely Yours, &gt;Tetyana Obukhanych, PhD"
132,vulnerability,conspiracy,Vaccines and National Security: No nation should leave their populations health to the whims of foreign entities who have already demonstrated the well-being of their customers is the least of their concerns.,16,352iv5,http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/352iv5/vaccines_and_national_security_no_nation_should/,2015-05-07 01:47:26,"[From New Eastern Outlook](URL &gt;One can easily see in the emerging information and cyber war that a nation having its own IT infrastructure, its own hardware, and its own versions of social media platforms [is quickly becoming a matter of national security.](URL &gt;Without control over these assets, a nation must depend on foreign suppliers for their computers, peripheries and software. Already, this dependence has opened nations up to now evident threats including malware embedded into hardware and software that is otherwise impossible to detect until the damage is already done. &gt;Likewise, a nations food supply can and has throughout history, been a source of vulnerability in times of conflict. The inability to grow ones own food invites blockades and their modern equivalent, sanctions, undermining a nations strength and stability and eventually setting the stage for its ultimate demise. Iraq is an example of this. &gt;In the long-term, a nations food supply controlled by foreign corporations, particularly in the realm of genetically engineered organisms, can have disastrous effects. &gt;As a nations wealth is slowly drained from their shores and into the coffers of corporations like Bayer, Monsanto and Syngenta, inferior, expensive and environmentally devastating crops wreak havoc on the very socioeconomic fabric of a nation. India is increasingly becoming an example of this. &gt;And what of healthcare? Surely the same applies. But even as nations and communities are just now understanding the importance of protecting their food supplies from predatory multinational corporations and the hegemonic ambitions they represent, there seems to be some latency in understanding this likewise in regards to healthcare and in particular pharmaceuticals and vaccines. ##The Danger of Big-Pharmas Vaccines &gt;Imagine a gang member knocking at your door with a syringe in one hand, demanding you roll up your sleeve and allow him to inject its contents into your bloodstream. Likely there would be no hesitation to call the police and barricade the door until they arrived. &gt;Allowing a criminal to inject a substance known or unknown into your body would be an unimaginable risk no sane person would accept. &gt;Now imagine that gang member is wearing a suit, has a multi-million dollar marketing budget, doctors and researchers working for him (paid via an expansive bribery network) and instead of knocking at your door, he invited you to one of his doctors offices to receive the injection. What weve just done here is describe big-pharma. &gt;Immense pharmaceutical corporations like GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) have been caught numerous times engaged in immense criminality. &gt;In 2012, the London Guardian would report in its article [GlaxoSmithKline fined $3bn after bribing doctors to increase drugs sales that:](URL ""The pharmaceutical group GlaxoSmithKline has been fined $3bn (1.9bn) after admitting bribing doctors and encouraging the prescription of unsuitable antidepressants to children. Glaxo is also expected to admit failing to report safety problems with the diabetes drug Avandia in a district court in Boston on Thursday. ""The company encouraged sales reps in the US to mis-sell three drugs to doctors and lavished hospitality and kickbacks on those who agreed to write extra prescriptions, including trips to resorts in Bermuda, Jamaica and California."" &gt;In early 2014, the London Telegraph would report in its article [GlaxoSmithKline bribed doctors to promote drugs in Europe, former worker claims that:](URL ""GlaxoSmithKline, Britains largest drug company, has been accused of bribing doctors to prescribe their medicines in Europe. ""Doctors in Poland were allegedly paid to promote its asthma drug, Seretide, under the guise of funding for education programme, a former sales rep has claimed. ""Medics were also said to have been paid for lectures in the country which did not take place."" &gt;Then in late 2014, the BBC would report in its article [GlaxoSmithKline fined $490m by China for bribery that:](URL ""China has fined UK pharmaceuticals firm GlaxoSmithKline $490m (297m) after a court found it guilty of bribery. ""The record penalty follows allegations the drug giant paid out bribes to doctors and hospitals in order to have their products promoted. ""The court gave GSKs former head of Chinese operations, Mark Reilly, a suspended three-year prison sentence and he is set to be deported."" &gt;These three news stories establish without doubt that an immense pharmaceutical giant, still allowed to conduct business to this very day, has been engaged in systematic, global criminality. &gt;The first story regarding its criminal conduct in the United States should be of particular concern, where the pharmaceutical giant encouraged doctors to peddle harmful substances to children. How exactly is that any different than your local pusher? &gt;And it should be alarming to know that GSK is one of several pharmaceutical giants promoting the use of vaccines. Who would trust vaccines produced and peddled by the same corporation convicted multiple times of immense fraud, corruption and the endangerment of children? &gt;But corrupt corporations peddling poison for profits still isnt the greatest danger. State sanctioned bioweapons masquerading as vaccines is. ##South Africas Vaccines Against Being Black &gt;The apartheid regime in South Africa infamously waged war on its black population. So intent was the regime on subduing and/or exterminating black communities, its biological warfare program began developing a bioweapon that would infect only blacks, and planned to administer it covertly under the cover of a vaccine program. &gt;The United Nations in a report titled [Project Coast: Apartheids Chemical and Biological Warfare Programme](URL would admit: ""One example of this interaction involved anti-fertility work. According to documents from RRL [Roodeplaat Research Laboratories], the facility had a number of registered projects aimed at developing an anti-fertility vaccine. This was a personal project of the first managing director of RRL, Dr Daniel Goosen. Goosen, who had done research into embryo transplants, told the TRC that he and Basson had discussed the possibility of developing an anti-fertility vaccine which could be selectively administeredwithout the knowledge of the recipient. The intention, he said, was to administer it to black South African women without their knowledge."" &gt;Unscrupulous corporations with global reach, married to unscrupulous ideologies seeking to covertly kill off entire segments of their population constitutes nightmare scenarios generally confined to the realm of science fiction. However, here are the ingredients, right before our very eyes. ##Vaccines and National Security &gt;It is very clear then, why communities and nations must take control of their healthcare systems entirely. Not a single aspect of it can depend on foreign suppliers any more than national IT infrastructure, the food supply, power production, or military hardware can. &gt;No nation would outsource the protection of its head of state to foreigners. Why would they outsource the protection of their peoples health? Dependence on big-pharma has already put countless lives in danger with untold disease, disabilities and death following in the wake of their unhinged global criminality. &gt;It should be noted, that despite their rampant criminality, they are all still very much in business, a testament to the unwarranted power and influence their immense profits and the lobbying efforts they purchase has afforded them. &gt;If vaccines are determined to be beneficial to a nations population, they should be developed by that nation and administered only by that nation. There should be no multinational pharmaceutical corporations, because no nation should leave their populations health to the whims of foreign entities who have already demonstrated the well-being of their customers is the least of their concerns. &gt;And while nations taking up this responsibility and pushing out foreign pharmaceutical corporations is a good start, one must still consider the case of South Africa, where a government sought to destroy entire communities within their borders under the guise of vaccination programs. &gt;Individual communities and individuals themselves would be wise to think twice before allowing anyone to inject something into their body. &gt;If vaccinations are so important, then the information required to make them should be made open source and all invited to examine how and why they are made and how to make them in community laboratories located at local universities and hospitals. &gt;If that cant be done, then they probably arent that important to begin with nor any more legitimate or necessary than the dangerous antidepressants GSK peddled to little children in America, and surely something society could do well without.

137,cybersecurity,conspiracy,Why is using mail in voting as our primary voting system an issue? Why is it safer than ever to vote using the balloting system? Here's why.,1,ibgpef,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ibgpef/why_is_using_mail_in_voting_as_our_primary_voting/,2020-08-18 01:52:54,"Since the 2018 election (no it wasn't a presidential election) we've had a joint statement from 7 different departments who emphasized that they are going to collaborate and uphold the integrity of the election. Who are those? DOJ, DOD, DHS, DNI, FBI, NSA, and CISA Even if you think one or more of those departments are skeptical to side on way for a candidate. Certainly, there are plenty of people within each organization aren't going to all be leaning right or left. If we can't trust these 7 organizations to self-police each other and remain non-partisan then we might as well not consider voting at all. Making an 11th hour change right next to the election to circumvent the balloting systems that may have been manipulated previously is dangerous to the integrity of the election. They would have no chance to hide now with these safeguards in place. These departments are all watching including the NSA, this would make it more safe than it ever has been, also we're going to be using Cyber 9-Line a great tool in cyber communication. In fact, those attempting to commit voter fraud would likely be caught and we can make strides into finding out who is outsourcing these attempts. Corona fan boy Dr Fauchi is also on record of saying it would be just fine to go and vote so long as social distancing and masks were used. Otherwise that would contradict any positions we take for the efforts we make to OK other gatherings we are OK with during this pandemic. Hell, some spout off how dangerous it is for schools to have opened up but reluctantly let their kids go, but those same people are saying it's way too dangerous to go take a small fraction of time to go vote ONE day, but let their kids go to school all day every day for the whole school year seems massively contradicting. If you won't risk that small chance to go vote, you don't know what some people would do to get a chance to get a fair vote for their country. We have a safe and secure election to participate in. Switching to 100% mail in ballots would lead to a very insecure election. It wouldn't take much of a jump in logic to think:  There are people who want to interfere with the election  Those people know they would get caught if NSA, FBI, etc etc are watching electronic balloting systems now or severely hurt their chances of being successful.  Those people CAN affect mail in ballots, but only to an extent since it isn't the primary voting system and it may take more effort since a physical record has to be created. Can't even do poll testing to see if there are any regional upsets that would cause suspicion AS the election is happening either.  Those people would encourage and push the agenda to switch to mail in voting exclusively, making it more effective to commit fraud on a wider scale, the system is untested to fraud attacks of this scale and would introduce new methods (being largely not targeted before) and having most states be unprepared to handle security of those votes considering the unprecedented volume and lack of proper measures being in place. If you disagree please provide sources and a logical line of thinking. Siding with experts like Fauchi when they fit your narrative and disagreeing when they don't is weak-minded thinking, politicians know nothing of cyber security and the sciences behind pandemics. They use things that people don't understand and carefully avoid them or scare people with these assertions. They are avoiding the possible dangers of mail in voting, they are lying about the integrity of electronic balloting this year, they are scaring you saying it isn't safe. All these aren't true, they aren't a field expert in anything besides manipulating people. That is what a career politician is, there are few who truly do this to serve their country's people Joint Statement [Source](URL Using/What is Cyber-9 [Second Sauce](URL [Fauchi Sauce](URL"

[Link Here](URL Headlines. A line designed to get into your head. And it works, judging by the amount of circulation of conspiracy posts that help move those headlines that masquerade as revealing connections, but are merely propoganda headline clones being disseminated. So lets get ahead of the lines before the lines get into your head. Humans have two primary modes of communication; verbal and nonverbal. Nonverbal is body language. Body language on it's own can give you insight. Pairing verbal and nonverbal gives you the whole picture. Headlines are verbal. The content is nonverbal. That's how you get a glimpse of the bigger picture. But we can't look at each article as a completed part of the communicative process. That would be like only watching hand gestures while having a conversation with someone. The article isn't the subject, the event is the subject, and if the subject was person, then we have to find as many articles as we can to profile the body language and interpret the nonverbal communication. Let me show you what I mean. &gt;**~~Offender~~ Conspiracy Article Profiling**  ~~criminal~~ article profiling, is an investigative strategy used by ~~law enforcement agencies~~ conspiracy theorists to identify ~~likely suspects~~ hidden motives and has been used by ~~investigators~~ conspiracy theorists to link ~~cases~~ subjects that may have been committed by the same perpetrator.

[Original NVC Content Here](URL I have no doubt that the actors who have advanced copies of the script are using data algorithm aggregation that compiles the different content sources into a complete picture for them. We plebs aren't so lucky, we have to peruse and parse multiple sources to connect the dots. In essence, we are the plebs living in a technofuedal era before the invention of the modern Gutenberg technopress for the masses. So let's throw on some work boots, grab a shovel, and start digging. #####The Hacks and Muckrakers. &gt;**May 18, 2018: Vanity Fair**  We just got back from the Middle East, he told a room full of Israelis, upon arriving in Jerusalem from Saudi Arabia last May. [Source Here](URL &gt;&gt;**May 22 2017: Slate**  The President Just Told a Room of Israelis That He Just Got Back From the Middle East [Source Here](URL Trump. The man's Presidency has come at a time where it's all starting to fall apart. And I can't help but think of Trump as Julius Caesar part two. A populist leader who threatened the establishment and upended the republic, paving the way for Augustus Caesar and the soft introduction of Roman empire, as it let the pretenses of being a Republic fade away. If you aren't familiar with that time of history, I would highly recommend doing so. There is more to my comparison that I'm not elaborating on, except to say, if you dig you will find someone else who loves Roman history, looks like a clone of Augustus, and we watched as he made rounds while articles suggested that he had aspirations of becoming President. Do I think that it'll happen soon? Probably not. History doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes. And we're only at the start of the Hollow Men by T S **Eliot **. &gt;**December 14, 2016: Techcrunch**  President-elect Donald Trump met with some of the most prominent executives from the tech industry today at Trump Tower, with investor Peter Thiel and Vice President-elect Mike Pence at his side. Trump opened the meeting with CEOs from Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and others by thanking Thiel for his support. I want to add that I am here to help you folks do well. And youre doing well right now and Im very honored by the bounce. Theyre all talking about the bounce. So right now everybody in this room has to like me, at least a little bit, Trump said, perhaps in reference to the fact that he received little support from Silicon Valley during his campaign. Were going to try to have that bounce continue. Perhaps even more importantly, we want you to keep going with the incredible innovation. Theres nobody like you in the world. Theres nobody like the people in this room and anything we can do to help this go along, were going to be there for you. Youll call my people, youll call me, it doesnt make any difference. We have no formal chain of command around here, Trump said. Interesting, wouldn't you say? No formal chain of command around here. They thanked Peter Thiel for his support. Ok. Maybe nothing, maybe something. Ok. It's something. &gt;**August, 2018 Articles**: URL  Trump claims Google is suppressing positive news about him. &gt;&gt;URL  Trump: Facebook, Twitter, Google 'have to be careful'. Stop the presses, because were getting squeezed and pasteurized. The tech leaders meet with Trump. They thank Thiel, suggesting that he organized the assembly. And then Trump starts bashing the Technocrats that he's meeting with? Nothing but Bread and Circus. Plain and simple. &gt;**June 27, 2017: Tech Transparency Project**  No other company in America was as intimately tied to the Obama Administration and the Democratic Party during Barack Obamas eight years in office than Google. Today the company is doing everything it can to restore the same cozy White House access it enjoyed under President Obama. Eric Schmidt has attended at least two meetings with Trump and attended a third White House meeting with tech leaders last Monday. At the same time, **The Groundwork  a secretive Schmidt-funded startup that ran the Clinton campaigns data operation**  recently relaunched itself as a technology platform for liberal organizations working to fight the Trump Administrations agenda. **By all appearances, Google appears to be working overtime to both ingratiate itself with the Trump Administration while simultaneously cashing in on the resistance to Trumps agenda**. [Source Here](URL By all appearances? He's working both sides? Trying to cash in? Really? Seriously? Let's break that down. ** 2020  Eric Schmidt/Net worth: 15.3 billion USD**. Call me crazy, but I dont think a guy with 15 billion dollars is worried about ""**cashing in**"". As I've stated numerous times, this is no longer about money, it's about control. That's imperative to understand. You don't worry about the money hidden under the mattress when you have a locked vault full of cash. Money is only an incentive for those who either don't have it or need more of it. Neither of those categories apply to Eric Schmidt. So lets examine how badly the Tech guys and Trump aren't getting along, shall we? &gt;**March 2, 2016: Defense News**  Google Executive Schmidt To Head New DoD Advisory Board. [Source Here](URL Ah. He's working for the Pentagon to make it better. And this happens almost a full year before meeting with Trump. This doesn't look like someone playing both sides, this looks like a team player in a game that only has one team. This is political wrestling that would make Vince McMahon envious. If you want to dive deeper into how Eric Schmidt funded the non profit that started fake news, here's a previous Flatten the Curve post. [Part #19](URL &gt;Attendees included Eric Schmidt and Larry Page of Google, Tim Cook of Apple, Satya Nadella and Brad Smith of Microsoft, Jeff Bezos of Amazon (who expressed his excitement that Trumps administration could be the innovations administration), Safra Catz of Oracle, Chuck Robbins of Cisco and Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook. Thiels business partner, Palantir CEO Alex Karp, attended as well. Those are big names and big companies. But they all hate Trump, right? &gt;Thiel has been instrumental in shaping Trumps approach to technology, helping assemble a list of candidates for technical roles in the upcoming administration and reportedly bringing David Sacks and other long-time associates to the transition team. During his speech at the Republican National Convention, Thiel talked about spreading the prosperity of Silicon Valley to other regions across the country and cited space travel as one of Americas great technological achievements. Instead of going to Mars, we have invaded the Middle East, Thiel said. I should point out that Thiel and Musk started PayPal together. &gt;**November 24, 2019: Business Insider**  What do the founders of YouTube, Yelp, Tesla, and LinkedIn have in common? Apart from leading massively disruptive technology companies, their founders all share a common resume line item: employment at PayPal. Known for their entrepreneurial mindset and anti-establishment attitude, this elite group is known as the ""PayPal Mafia,"" and they all put in time during the payment platform's early days some 20 years ago. [Source Here](URL Oh. And Pete's instrumental to creating Facebook. **Thiel became Facebook's first outside investor when he acquired a 10.2% stake for $500,000 in August 2004. He sold the majority of his shares in Facebook for over $1 billion in 2012, but remains on the board of directors**. And he funded Hulk Hogan's lawsuit to take down Gawker. Told ya, it's just political wrestling to entertain us. &gt;However, one of the biggest proponents of travel to Mars, Elon Musk, has also been one of Trumps most outspoken critics. Musk donated to Hillary Clintons presidential campaign and frequently denounced Trump, saying that the former reality television star doesnt seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States. But since the election, Musk appears to have warmed up to Trump. He was a late addition to the invite list for todays meeting. The transition team also announced this morning that Musk will join Trumps strategic and policy forum, a group of business leaders that will serve as an advisory committee to the president-elect. [Source Here](URL Musk and Trump, a marriage made in heaven. It's destiny, I tell you, destiny. Or an act (don't worry Elon, I haven't forgotten about you) designed to make us believe that somebody up there is fighting for us down here. Yet the inclusion of the quote about Mars and War in the Middle East stands out, wouldn't you agree? And we have environmental collapse triggers happening. Riots happening. Why those riots are also happening in Beruit, aren't they? And Isreal and Saudi Arabia don't get along with Lebanon, or the Hezbollah. And President Trump went from Suadi Arabia to Isreal, didnt he? And wasn't there an explosion there recently? Must all be a coincidence. Let's get back to Pete the magical Thiel and see what else Hulk Hogan's buddy is mixed up in. &gt;He co-founded Valar Ventures in 2010, co-founded Mithril Capital, serving as investment committee chair, in 2012, and served as a partner at Y Combinator from 2015 to 2017. Through the Thiel Foundation, Thiel governs the grant-making bodies Breakout Labs and Thiel Fellowship, and funds nonprofit research into **artificial intelligence, life extension and seasteading**. A co-founder of The Stanford Review, he is a conservative libertarian who is critical of high government spending, high debt levels, and foreign wars. **He has donated to numerous political figures**. At the 2009 Singularity Summit, he said his greatest concern is the **technological singularity not arriving soon enough**. [Source Here](URL Singularity. Not. Arriving. Soon. Enough. Call me paranoid and pass the tin foil hat, but what Matrix code is needed to decipher his words intent? Not soon enough for what? Better Netflix selection? The Alien invasion? Godzilla awakening because of Fukushima? Are the Decepticons already here? Or have they been downplaying the ELE that's approaching? I'll take ELE for a thousand, Alex. So he's into AI (he backed Deepmind and OpenAI) and life extension. He went to Stanford. He's also going to have his body cryonically preserved. And his Palantir surveillance is, well, **nottofreakyououtoranything**, everywhere. Palantir's first backer was the Central Intelligence Agency's venture capital arm In-Q-Tel. Then Palantir became Big Brother. Literally. The Palantir clients include the CIA, DHS, NSA, FBI, CDC, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Special Operations Command, West Point, the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization and Allies, the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. And Palantir is also being used by Banks, Hedge Funds, Financial Services, and other corporate clients. Big Brother wants to be Palantir went it grows up. Now, are you wondering why I started with Trump, Saudi Arabia and Isreal? Are you curious about how it goes from ex CEO of Google Eric Schmidt ""playing"" both sides of the fence to Palantir and Peter Thiel? Just sit right back and hold tight, cause I'm about to take you on a one way trip to a Brave New Normal World that's called 1984. **Warning. What you're about to read will make you forever question every officially sanctioned narrative. Trust me. Still game? Are you sure? Last chance. You're about to leave neverneverland and you can't go back. Alright. Let's go**. #####It's All Hidden In Plain Sight. Let's talk about Epstein. Yep. Him. I've been strangely quiet about Jeffery haven't I? Nothing written about the Captain Pedo and his Amazing friends didn't mean there was nothing there, it just meant that I didn't find anything that indicated something deeper than a pedophile blackmail ring. And sex and political blackmail is as old as time itself. There's a reason they say the world's two oldest professions are prostitutes and politicians. Yet it turns out the professional pimp and the abducted teens may be playing a bigger role than we thought. &gt;**July 31, 2019: NY TIMES**  Mr. Epsteins vision reflected his longstanding fascination with what has become known as **transhumanism**: the science of improving the human population through technologies like **genetic engineering and artificial intelligence. Critics have likened transhumanism to a modern-day version of eugenics**, the discredited field of improving the human race through controlled breeding. Mr. Epsteins ranch in New Mexico, which he confided to scientists and others he hoped to use as the site for seeding the human race with his DNA. Welcome to the Island of Dr. Moreau. We're it's the monsters trying to make humans. Do you still think this was all about blackmail, cause it wasn't. Stop thinking in normal terms, because normal is dead, long live the New Normal. &gt;At one session at Harvard, Mr. Epstein criticized efforts to reduce starvation and provide health care to the poor because doing so increased the risk of overpopulation, said Mr. Pinker, who was there. Mr. Pinker said he had rebutted the argument, citing research showing that high rates of infant mortality simply caused people to have more children. Epstein criticized efforts to reduce starvation and provide health care. Hmmmm. My memory is foggy, but isn't there someone in Africa trying to provide health care and reduce starvation? Who could that be? Wasn't he into computers and had pictures taken on Epsteins private jet? Wasn't it Bill Gates? Now why would Billy be hanging around someone who would vocally espouse an ideology that is completely antithetical to his stated humanitarian goals? &gt;Also at the Indian Summer dinner, according to an account on the website of Mr. Brockmans Edge Foundation, were the **Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page and Jeff Bezos**, who was accompanied by his mother. &gt;&gt;Then there was Mr. Epsteins interest in eugenics. Once, at a dinner at Mr. Epsteins mansion on Manhattans Upper East Side, Mr. Lanier said he talked to a scientist who told him that Mr. Epsteins goal was to have 20 women at a time impregnated at his 33,000-square-foot Zorro Ranch in a tiny town outside Santa Fe. Mr. Mr. Lanier, said he had the impression that Mr. Epstein was using the dinner parties to screen candidates to bear Mr. Epsteins children. Mr. Epstein did not hide his interest in tinkering with genes  and in perpetuating his own DNA. Interviews with more than a dozen of his acquaintances, as well as public documents, show that he used the same tactics to insinuate himself into an elite scientific community, thus allowing him to pursue his interests in **eugenics** and other fringe fields like **cryonics**. One adherent of transhumanism said that he and Mr. Epstein discussed the financiers interest in **cryonics**, an unproven science in which peoples bodies are frozen to be brought back to life in the future. Mr. Epstein told this person that he wanted his head and penis to be frozen. [More Epstein and Eugenics. Source Here](URL Now call me crazy, but there's some strangeness happening. Cryonics, don't die, just Let It Go and get Frozen. First Peter Thiel, now Epstein. Let's hope the AI Singularity arrives in time, right? Now I wouldn't have even bothered with their shared interest of joining the Walt Disney Cryonics Club, if there wasn't more in play, and there's more in play. &gt;**August 9, 2019: TRT World**  The billionaire shared the same personal network that included Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, infamous Blackwater founder Erik Prince, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, UAE Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed, Donald Trump and Bill Clinton. &gt;&gt;According to investigative journalist Vicky Ward, quoting a meeting with Trumps transition team, Acosta told a White House official: I was told **Epstein belonged to intelligence and to leave it alone**. That's a bit of an exclusive club, kinda like being in the Mouseketeer CIA club. But, hey, nothing to see here, is there? But just in case, let's look into the company that Epstein worked with, Carbyne. &gt;This single company, **Carbyne**, brought together a whos who of power brokers and intelligence figures from multiple regions including Russia, China and the Trump administration itself, with Epstein at its heart. Officially, Carbyne provided high-tech solutions for emergency centres. In reality, it existed in a grey area giving it unprecedented access to private information, with significant potential for privacy abuse. Carbyne provides a service for police emergency centres, providing complete access to the callers camera and GPS, providing the dispatcher with a live video feed. Ok. So Epstein and Thiel both are into AI, Surveillance, and Cryonics. President Trump was in Isreal and Saudi Arabia in May 2017. And who ended up in Isreal just afterwards? PayPal Founder in Israel: Too Much Copying and Not Enough Innovation in High-tech &gt;**June 15, 2017: Haaretz**  Billionaire Peter Thiel visits Israel  and gives out tips on how to build a successful startup. [Source Here](URL Hey, one month after Trump visited the Middle East, Peter Thiel decides to take middle eastern vacation to give out business tips. And then Thiel must've reciprocated and invited the Fresh Prince of Saudi Arabia to get the all inclusive Palantir surveillance pitch. Smile for the camera everyone, cause the world's a stage and we're filming a world wide Truman Show. &gt;**April 7, 2018: Gulf News**  Google, Thiel feature in Saudi Princes Silicon Valley tour. The Saudi delegation visited several Silicon Valley corporate campuses, including Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. **In addition to Facebook, where Thiel sits on the board, the Saudi delegation visited data-analysis start-up Palantir Technologies Inc and a trio of investment firms created by Thiel: Clarium Capital, Valar Ventures and Founders Fund. Thiel is chairman and co-founder of Palantir**. [Source Here](URL &gt;&gt;**March 17, 2020: Forbes**  These responders are now using a tool built in part by former members of Israels military intelligenceElichai being onethats backed by **Peter Thiels Founders Fund**, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who is now the companys chairman, and a small, passive investment from deceased multimillionaire **pedophile Jeffrey Epstein**. [SourceHere](URL Ok look. I get it. Rich people make investments, those investments are bound to end up in the same company. But these companies aren't exactly run of the mill home security systems, are they? Nope. This is the kind of surveillance systems that the KGB or the Stasi could only dream of. And when you wish upon a star dreams come true. And Peter Thiel must be wishing upon a star. Ok. Strap in, buckle up, and try to keep up, or you're gonna get left in the dust. Cause it's boom or bust from here on out, and we're gonna add it up like the count. So Elichai owns Carbyne. Peter Thiel invested in Carbyne. And Carbyne is in the USA linked to the 911 system, and it's being used to fight the pandemic. &gt;**Forbes (Link Above)**  Its founder thinks Carbynes tech could make the lives of 911 dispatch and healthcare professionals much less chaotic in the Covid-19 crisis. Carbyne relies on callers submitting themselves to self-surveillance via their own mobile phone. Once a caller uses their Android or iPhone to call 911 (85% of emergency calls now come from mobile devices), they receive a text message that asks for permission to get their precise location and access video from their smartphone camera. Step right up and give your permission to be saved. Big Brother is looking out for you. So Elichai used to work for the 8200. Cool name, right. I'm not sure about you, but that sounds pretty dystopian. And I've gotta say, that all of Technocrats that are promising us an AI utopia, sure seem to be getting ahead of the curve by building doomsday bunkers for a dystopia. And here we sit wasting our time Doomscrolling. So what else has sprung up from the 8200? Have you ever heard about the NSO Group? &gt;**November 1, 2019** - WhatsApp identified an Israeli company, NSO Group, as having developed the spyware called Pegasus, which it held responsible for the breach. This disclosure was part of a lawsuit WhatsApp has filed against the NSO Group in a US federal court, saying the company was actively involved in hacking users of the encrypted chat service. As per the WhatsApp complaint the target users included attorneys, journalists, human rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats, and other senior foreign government officials. NSOs spyware Pegasus has been reportedly used to target journalists in Mexico investigating drug cartels, rights group Amnesty International, human rights activists in UAE, activists in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. According to Israeli news reports, Saudi Arabia paid $55 million for its use. The contract was later frozen over the scandal alleging NSO software's role in Saudi Arabia tracking slain journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the months before he was murdered in the Saudi Embassy in Turkey. In India, 17 people, who are known to be targeted include activists and human rights lawyers. [Source Here](URL Whoops. Do you remember Jamal Khashoggi? He was trying to expose Human Rights abuses against Saudi Arabia. And then Suadi Arabia decided to murder him, and confirm that they were abusing human rights. Jamal paid the ultimate price to prove his point. But who is selling the hacking tools? At this point they all seem to be springing up from members of the 8200, and the companies they started. &gt;**TRT - Link Previously Provided**  DarkMatter, a UAE surveillance and intelligence group employing former NSA operatives was built on the back of a larger initiative to modernise Emirati intelligence and military operations. The group took part in at the Arab Future Cities Conference in November 2015, where it presented a vision of smarter, tech-driven cities, which caught the eye of Chinese officials. Smarter cities meant Big Brother-esque widespread surveillance installed throughout the UAE. Only two years later in April 25 2017, DarkMatter signed a Global Strategic Memorandum of Understanding with Huawei, a leading Chinese company, for the same Big Data systems and Smart City solutions. The middle man? None other than Erik Prince, who had gone from working for the Emiratis, to working for a Chinese billionaire. In suspect timing, the Memorandum of Understanding also took place right before China scaled up its total surveillance and crackdown on Uighurs in Xinjiang, China. &gt;&gt;**February 2, 2019: Reuters**  Xinjiang is a major part of China's Belt and Road infrastructure network but the region has faced attacks blamed on members of the Muslim ethnic Uighur minority. Beijing has responded with a security clampdown condemned by rights groups and Western governments. Frontier Services Group (FSG), a Hong Kong-listed company founded by Prince, said in a Chinese-language statement posted on its website on Jan. 22 that it had signed a deal to build a training centre in southern Xinjiang. **Prince is deputy chairman, a minority shareholder and a board member of FSG, a security, logistics and insurance provider**. [Source Here](URL ####Watch this video. Chinese authorities are using a 911 mobile app to carry out illegal mass surveillance and arbitrary detention of Muslims in Chinas western Xinjiang region. [Source Here](URL Makes you wonder, doesn't it? Aren't we condemning China for the camps, and yet the West is helping to build those camps? Must be a big mistake. We didnt know what was happening. And Erik Prince swears he didn't know. Honestly. He's not lying. Cross my heart and hope to die. Pinky swear. #####Recap. 8200 leads to NSO and Carbyne. DarkMatter is in the UAE with NSA employees. The NSO hack was used to capture Khashoggi. Peter Thiel invested in Facebook, Facebook owns WhatsApp. Peter Thiel invested in Carbyne. Eric Prince works for and founded FSG, which built the Muslim reduction school. China is using similar tech to target Muslims and send them back to school. Carbyne 911 surveillance tech accesses your phone camera after you click on the link to give permission. So. Peter Thiel funds Carbyne. Eric Prince is working for the UAE developing security and the UAE ends up with Dark Matter, and then his company (FSG) is sold to China, and they build re-education centers, which uses technology like Carbyne, and that technology is being used in the USA. Got it? Good. Because I'm seriously having a hard time keeping up with the behind the scene footage of this LARP. &gt;**Link Previously Provided**  1,400 people worldwide, including Indian lawyers, rights activists and journalist, were targets of an online spying campaign that used highly sophisticated spyware developed by an Israeli firm via WhatsApp. WhatsApp is at the centre of a global storm over privacy after it was revealed that at least 17 Indians and about 1,400 people worldwide had their phones breached through the social media app. Their privacy was compromised by surveillance technology so invasive that could read and transmit the entire contents of a phone as well as operate its camera. **WhatsApp, Doc, I think I need an appointment because I'm suffering from Mass Psychogenic Illness from too much Doomscrolling.** Do you want to get deeper? I mean **really deep**? Yes? Ok. Let's jump into the deep. &gt;**October 18, 2019: fortune.com** - How a WhatsApp Tax Launched Massive Anti-Government Protests in Lebanon. What a crazy New Normal World Order we live in. What are the odds that we have a WhatsApp hack tax protest and we also have a WhatsApp hack that uses your phone camera, while also using similar tech in the USA and China. That's inconceivable! That's incredible! Someone call the press and let them know about this! Uhm. Wait. Better not. You might get Khashoggid. So Eric Prince is involved. Peter Thiel is involved. WhatsApp is owned by Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg owns Facebook, and Peter Thiel helped Facebook grow. And then there was this. &gt;**March 28, 2018: Daily Mail**  Employee of Peter Thiel's company Palantir helped Cambridge Analytica harvest the data of millions of the Facebook users. Alfredas Chmieliauskas is said to have suggested to Cambridge Analytica that it create a personality quiz smartphone app to get access to networks of Facebook users. The Times report also claims that **Sophie Schmidt** - the daughter former Google executive **Eric Schmidt** - had urged Cambridge Analytica to work with Palantir. [Source Here](URL At this point, I think I'm going to need to buy a whole lot of tacks and string and make pciture maps on my walls. If we're all living in a Truman Surveillance Show, might as well play the part of the New Normal crazy conspiracy theorist, right? &gt;**January 17, 2017: The Intercept** According to New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, in December Prince attended the annual Villains and Heroes costume ball hosted by Mercer. Dowd wrote that Palantir founder Peter Thiel showed her a picture on his phone of him posing with Erik Prince, who founded the private military company Blackwater, and Mr. Trump  who had no costume  but joke[d] that it was N.S.F.I. (Not Safe for the Internet). No. Sanity. Fracking. Involved. Is more like it. This insanity can't pass for sanity, can it? And yet they label us crazy when we start to find the big picture, even if we aren't entirely sure what the big picture means. &gt;**The Intercpt Continued**: In July, Prince told Trumps senior adviser and white supremacist Steve Bannon, at the time head of Breitbart News, that the Trump administration should recreate a version of the **Phoenix Program, the CIA assassination ring that operated during the Vietnam War, to fight ISIS**. Such a program, Prince said, could kill or capture the funders of Islamic terror and that would even be the wealthy radical Islamist billionaires funding it from the Middle East, and any of the other illicit activities theyre in. Prince also said that Trump would be the best force to confront Islamic fascism. As for the world looking to the United States for leadership, unfortunately, I think theyre going to have to wait till January and hope Mr. Trump is elected because, clearly, our generals dont have a stomach for a fight, Prince said. Our president doesnt have a stomach for a fight and the terrorists, the fascists, are winning. [Source Here](URL Sounds good, right? Kill people who kill people and maybe someday we won't have people getting killed. Killer idea! HEWDSHAWT! Grab your BFG and let's go BGH. It's a date! But then why are these cell phone surveillance hacks companies being constantly linked with their names, and those hacks are being used to target journalists and human rights activists? It's a small New Normal World Order after all. And it's getting smaller everyday. No worries though, Keep Calm and Carry On, We're All In This Together, and You're Either With Us Or Against Us.

The crown prince met with Bannon, along with Jared Kushner and General Michael Flynn, in New York in December 2016; in a breach of protocol the UAE didnt notify the Obama administration of the visit in advance. Prince told the House committee that the former Breitbart CEO said the meeting concerned Iran and Syria, and that the Emirati ruler is a great guy. Bannon, Kushner, and Flynn all have close connections to **Cambridge Analytica**, a now-defunct company part-owned by the U.K.-based SCL Group Ltd. Infamous now for its misuse of Facebook data on behalf of the Trump campaign, in December 2016 this U.S. subsidiary of SCL was basking in its triumph. Within a year, SCL would be waging a clandestine influence campaign against Qatar on behalf of MBZ. According to federal filings, SCL Social Limited was hired for $330,000 in October 2017 to run a #BoycottQatar social media campaign for the UAE. When asked in October about the SCL work against Qatar, Bannon said he had nothing to do with it. [Source Here](URL And yet behind the scenes Mr. Kushner is acting. UAE Isreal Treaty  Mr Kushner told CBS he and President Trump had been working on a deal between Israel and the UAE since Mr Trump came to office. We've got security systems being sold everywhere. The Israeli Intelligence division 8200 employees owning and working for those companies. Western investments into those cybersecurity companies. Technocrats being buddy buddy with the Suadi Crown Prince. Jeffery Epstein (didn't kill himself) who seems (is) Israeli Intelligence got along famously with Saudi Arabia. &gt;**August 15, 2019: Asia Times**  When police raided the convicted sex offenders New York residence in July, they discovered a mysterious travel document: an Austrian passport with a Saudi Arabian residence, false name, and Epsteins photograph. In addition to the 1980s Saudi Arabia travel reported by federal prosecutors, flight records obtained by Business Insider indicate a second trip to the Arabian Peninsula on the eve of the US Presidential election in November 2016. According to the report, Epsteins private jet dropped off the radar in southern Jordan on November 7, just before it would have reached the border with Saudi Arabia. Two days later on November 9, it reappeared in the south of Egypts Sinai Peninsula, just across the Red Sea from Saudi Arabia. [Source Here](URL And somehow we end up with Isreal and the UAE working together. And don't worry, Suadi Arabia will join up after it's done protesting that it won't without an Israeli Palestinian Peace deal. That's why they've been given the Isreali Cyber hacks. A peice of security for middle east peace, so to speak. But let me quote Admiral Ackbar; It's a trap! This will explode. No doubt about it. It might take a while, but it will. Because don't forget, all of this ties into Lebanon, and Lebanon is allied with Hezbollah, and Hezbollah is backed by Iran, and Suadi Arabia, UAE, and Isreal, don't like Iran. Who does? Russia and China. More in an upcoming post later. And don't forget, it was Obama and Hillary who were in Syria in the first place. And before that we have this quote. &gt;**March 2007, General Wesley Clark**  So I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan. I said, Are we still going to war with Iraq? And he said, Oh, its worse than that. He reached over on his desk. He picked up a piece of paper. And he said, I just got this down from upstairs  meaning the Secretary of Defenses office  today. And he said, This is a memo that describes how were going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing off, Iran. I said, Is it classified? He said, Yes, sir. I said, Well, dont show it to me. And I saw him a year or so ago, and I said, You remember that? He said, Sir, I didnt show you that memo! I didnt show it to you! [Source Here](URL Do those countries look familiar? They should, and the five year timeline may have been optimistic, but the objective is still happening today. If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to worry about, right? So lets see how the whole cell phone surveillance hacks become discovered? **On August 25, 2016, Citizen Lab and Lookout revealed that Pegasus was being used to target human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor in the United Arab Emirates**. Ok. And where is Citizen Lab? **The Citizen Lab is an interdisciplinary laboratory based at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, Canada** And where have some donations come from? **The Citizen Lab has received donations of software and support from Palantir Technologies, VirusTotal, and Oculus Info Inc**. Really. Mark Zuckerberg and Oculus. Peter Thiel and Palantir. They helped the group that caught the hacks. But the groups had the tech because of the 8200 groups employees companies. And those companies are associated with Erik Prince, Jeffrey Epstein, Michael Chertoff, and Peter Thiel. And all those guys are friendly with Suadi Arabia, UAE, and Isreal. Let's keep going. &gt;**January 30, 2019: Reuters**  CONTRACT SPY After leaving her job at the NSA in 2014, Lori Stroud worked as a contract intelligence operative for the UAE.

Her specialty was hunting for vulnerabilities in the computer systems of foreign governments, such as China, and analyzing what data should be stolen. In 2013, her world changed. While stationed at NSA Hawaii, Stroud says, she made the fateful recommendation to bring a Dell technician already working in the building onto her team. That contractor was Edward Snowden.

Who is Lance B Eliot? [Link Here](URL After posting the article about Lance B Eliot yesterday, another video popped up on YouTube. u/D4W50N88 found it and provided the link, and I'm glad he did (Thank you D4). Why didn't it show up for me? No idea. But it did, and now the enigma has become worse. When I first stumbled onto this, I made a mistake. I went back through my notes and found that I had wrongly attributed the Lance persona as the judge sitting to the left of what was Lance at the table. How did I screw up that bad? I'm human. (No seriously, I'm human. I'm not AI. I'm not NSA. CIA. I don't have any affiliations to any Alphabet agencies. I am what I am. And what is that? A guy who grew up with an extremely skeptical father who always called BS on the news and political events, and tried to make me understand that it was self interest, not altruism, that guided the world around us. That will be expanded on at some point down the road.) I make mistakes. It's not the first time and it won't be the last. But sometimes mistakes happen for a reason. This is one of those times. So I watched the second YouTube video of Lance that was provided here; &gt;I'm not sure if he's exactly an AI, seems to be a real person going off this [video -](URL Really quick summary, he doesn't say diddly squat. Anyone could have regurgitated lvl 5 autonomous cars and insurance rates. My statement doesn't prove anything though. I realize that. But let me ask you something, He's been on CNN, he's written a ton of books, he's an angel investor, a venture capitalist, CEO of Techbrium, and not one other picture or (so far) any other videos of him exist? We're living in an age of near omnipresent and approaching omnipotent surveillance, they are screwing with DNA, the government has acknowledged UFO's, phenomenon like the Hum and Sky Quakes are being reported worldwide, we live in a pandemic for which we will need never ending vaccinations, so is it really out of the realm of reason that Lance could be an actor? I've looked for research papers from him and I've found maybe three to four. None of them are overly technical and mainly deal with AI and the law and ethics. That's strange. But before we dive further, I will concede the possibility that there is a Lance B Eliot, but I'm adamant that the articles and books are written by AI. No doubt in my mind, and by the time this post is done, you'll wonder what's really going on as well. Let's start with his name. Something about it grabbed my attention, as it did for others. I can't speak for them, but I remember just looking at it suddenly thinking, is that an anagram? u/agelesseverytime  Lance B Eliot is an anagram for antebellico - prewar. u/WhiteRabbitCaveCA also sent me the same anagram. Hidden in plain sight. But it's still a chess game. Your moves have to be deceptive and you need to look ahead a minimum of three moves. And all moves have multiple moves. Does this mean that the anagram doesn't apply? No. It does. And it points to the ability of having meaning hidden in meaning, all in the open. Now I will caution you, this post will be somewhat open-ended. I haven't been able to find anything definitive that could point to a possible origin of what I believe to be Lance B Eliot, yet those breadcrumbs do lead to loaves of bread, so to speak. So when I was sent the other YouTube link with Lance as a speaker, I looked around the web again. I had already found what I thought was a very strong link, but now the video threw a monkey wrench into my plans. This is what else I found when I Googled articles by Lance B Eliot.

One guy who works for me is named Elliot, and Eliot stood out for the different spelling. After repeating a mantra of Eliot for a while, I stopped. Eliot. ElIOT. elIoT. IoT. Internet of Things. It had to be me looking for a pattern. HAD TO BE. Then I looked at the name again. The end was possible, so I looked at his first name. I repeated the same mantra, letting my unconscious do the work. And sure enough, it hit me again. Lance. LANce. LAN. Local Area Network. No. Effing. Way. Come on. LAN + IoT = Local Area Network of Internet of Things. Ok. It adds up. Makes sense. I don't know how, but it does. Yet that still left me with the rest of his name. CEBEL. Whelp, the mantra didn't help, it was time to dig. And dig I did. And found nothing. Well a couple of things, and one I thought that I was stretching logic too far, and the other, maybe not. Because it led me to OMGs Artificial Intelligence Platform Task Force. A co-chair was Claude Baudoin, who has a company called cb IT &amp; Knowledge Management. And I almost went with it, and then something said NO. It was a gut feeling that I was wrong. There was no L in the company name. So I started digging all over again. And it wasn't easy. It took forever. It didnt make sense. At all. I couldn't find anything that was an exact match. And then I saw this. &gt;**Thomas Siebel's software company C3IoT** raised about $100 million from private equity investors in January 2018, at a $1.5 billion valuation.

Is Cebel a play on Siebel? It sure seems like it to me. And Thomas also has this to say. High: What inning of the game do you believe we are in from an AI perspective, and how is that likely to develop going forward? **Siebel**: **Julius Caesar** considered Gaul as being divided into three parts, and I believe AI is divided into three parts. 1 Artificial general intelligence, which includes projects such as Google DeepMind. Here, the attempt is to build computers that have equal or greater intelligence as human beings. This gets to the malicious killer robots and the refrigerator that takes over your household theory, but I do not believe we need to worry about that in our lifetimes; 2 Social media systems. Here, social media vendors are using AI extremely effectively to manipulate people at the level of the limbic brain. I believe this is malevolent, and what we are seeing in social media is concerning. People are acting as servers to the computer instead of the opposite; 3 The application of AI to commercial, industrial, and government systems, which is where we play at C3.ai. This is building prediction to identify fraud, efficiency to the supply chain, and predictive maintenance for devices in the digital oilfields, the smart grid, the manufacturing industry, agricultural equipment, and precision health. This is about using AI to lower the cost of production and to deliver products and services with greater safety, with greater cybersecurity, and with lower environmental impact. Hmmm. It's starting to sound like my posts, isn't it? Yet he's not worried about killer robots, yet social media manipulation, that's a problem. But I can bet you all the tea that's left in China, those words shouldn't be taken at Facebook value. High: You have referred to there being a war with China based on artificial intelligence, and you have referenced how Vladimir Putin said the country that wins in AI will ultimately win in the world. As a citizen of the U.S., what do you think about this? How optimistic are you about the states ability to lead and the extent to which it is appropriate language? **Siebel**: This is a crucial topic. As you mentioned, in 2017, Vladimir Putin said, Whoever wins the war in AI will be the ruler of the world. I believe that is true, but I do not believe Russia will win. It is either going to be China or the U.S. I believe we are currently in a state of non-kinetic warfare with China. It is well-documented how great Russia and China are at infiltrating our power grid infrastructure, infiltrating our financial system infrastructure, and implanting viruses, bots, and malware so they can remotely turn off the grid. There are well-documented incidents where the Chinese have penetrated, say, the United States Office of Personnel Management and stolen the personnel records of up to 21 million people. This includes anyone who has ever applied for or been granted a security clearance. If this is not war, what is it? If you read the 13th five-year plan, it is extremely clear what they are doing. They are investing tens of billions of dollars a year in AI to win this battle and to dominate the use of AI for the purposes of defense and conducting warfare. In many ways, this is a test of two fundamentally opposed political philosophies. In the case of China, there is a totalitarian state with a top-down command and control economy where the NRDC writes the 13th five-year plan, invests billions of dollars, and mandates that this happens. They are extremely bright, competent, and educated, and they are hard at work. In the United States, we have a much messier process with a free-market economy and a capitalist system. Innovation does not take place from a top-down command and control government-mandated system, but in garages in Palo Alto and storefronts in theNew York. I do not know which system is going to win, but this is going to be the ultimate test of these political philosophies. This is not a war we want to lose, the stakes could not be higher, and it is game on. And then. High: What role do you see the government playing in all this versus private industries, and how do you see the balance between the two? **Siebel**: The people who work in the Pentagon are exceptionally bright and well educated. These scholar statesman warriors are not asleep at the switch, and they are adopting AI in many ways to prove the efficiency of the Department of Defense. As it relates to AI, the U.S. is going to advance through a free market economy, entrepreneurship, and through the creativity of individuals who are unbridled by the constraints of the stage. This system has always worked out for us in the past, and hopefully, it will continue to. If it does not, we are going to have a problem. [Source Here](URL Game on. If it doesn't work, there's a problem, because we're in a war with China, and the Pentagon states that the war will be fought in abrupt climate change which will cause drought and famine in China. And I've said it before, but the social discord and the riots, will be blamed on Russia and/or China. And maybe they are to blame. Who knows, because we have to trust our New Normal World Order narrative as it's filtered with fact checks and fake news, while the surveillance system makes sure we are safe from physical threats through AI data mining, and incorporating AI through the Great Reset, which apparently China has to get on board with. Uhm, and people are having a hard time believing that our world is about to get turned upside down? Really? Has the desensitization been that effective that everyone is numb? Short answer, pretty much. ####BGG Final Words &gt;**NEW YORK (PRWEB) JANUARY 11, 2018**  Though various forms of artificial intelligence and machine learning have existed for nearly 60 years, it is only recently that this field of computing has developed to a level of accessibility that truly allows businesses to leverage this innovative technology.

Additionally, there isnt enough money to fix the fleets ships, and the backlog of ships needing work continues to grow. Overhauls  ""availabilities"" in Navy parlance  are being canceled or deferred, and when ships do come in they need longer to refit. **Refueling and Complex Overhaul**. RCOH is a process for refueling and upgrading nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in the US Navy. The nuclear reactors that power some aircraft carriers typically use up their nuclear fuel about halfway through their desired 50-year life spans. Because carriers can last so long before being retired, they are refueled and refurbished with an RCOH to extend their usable lifetime. At the same time a ship is refueled, it is given a complex overhaul in which broken, worn or obsolete parts are repaired or replaced and systems are modernized. The modernization typically includes an upgrade of ships combat systems and warfighting capabilities, its internal distribution systems are upgraded, and allowance is made for future upgrades over the ships remaining operational service life. Given the size of an aircraft carrier and the number of systems and subsystems it has, an RCOH is extremely complex, costly (several billion dollars), and time-consuming. Each RCOH is planned to take 46 months. There is no money to fix the fleets. Crap. Perhaps the USA will turn to rowboat or Viking Longboats? Maybe they could borrow some money from other countries that all started upgrading their Navies at the same time. &gt;**2018 January**. All the New Aircraft Carriers That Are Under Construction. The Royal Navy is continuing course on its plans to field a force of two carriers. The first carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, was commissioned in 2017 and is awaiting the F-35B Joint Strike Fighters that will make up her air wing, which should be ready by 2020. The second carrier, HMS Prince of Wales, was floated out of construction dock in late December 2017 and will undergo sea trials in 2019. Long an aircraft carrier power, the Indian Navy currently sails one carrier, INS Vikramaditya. A second carrier, Indigenous Aircraft Carrier-1 (IAC-1), began construction in 2005. The ship has recently been named INS Vikrant and is projected to be complete in 2020. In late 2017, Japanese news outlets reported Tokyo was considering modifying its two Izumo-class helicopter destroyers, Izumo and Kaga, to fly the F-35B Joint Strike Fighter. Chinese pressure on Japanese airspace over the Senkaku Islands and East China Sea and a shortage of airfields in the area were cited as reasons. In 2017, Italian defense contractor Fincantieri began construction of the Trieste, a new amphibious assault ship. South Korea has one amphibious assault ship with a full-length flight deck, Dokdo, commissioned into the Republic of Korea Navy in 2007. A second long-planned ship, Marado, finally began construction in 2017. A third ship, Baengnyeong, is projected but has not yet begun construction. In December 2017 South Korea, like Japan, also reported interest in flying the F-35B off its Dokdo-class ships. Like Japans ships, the Dokdo vessels will need extensive upgrades to make this conversion a reality.](URL Hmmm, are we having a party out at sea? Must be.

Whenever a Quad9 user clicks on a website link or types in an address into a web browser, Quad9 checks the site against a list of domains combined from 19 different threat intelligence partners. Each threat intelligence partner supplies a list of malicious domains based on their heuristics which examine such factors as scanned malware discovery, network IDS past behaviors, visual object recognition, optical character recognition (OCR), structure and linkages to other sites, and individual reports of suspicious or malicious behavior.

This policy was abolished in 2015, and former *Wall Street Journal* reporter Mei Fong summarized the reasoning behind abolishing the policy as ""The reason China is doing this right now is because they have too many men, too many old people, and too few young people. **They have this huge crushing demographic crisis as a result of the one-child policy. And if people don't start having more children, they're going to have a vastly diminished workforce to support a huge aging population.""** Fong believed the huge retiree community must be supported, which would severely dampen Chinas future growth. Since the citizens of China are living longer and having fewer children, the growth of this population imbalance is expected to continue, as reported by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation which referred to a United Nations projections forecast that **""China will lose 67 million working-age people by 2030, while simultaneously doubling the number of elderly. That could put immense pressure on the economy and government resources.** So it makes sense for China to create a disease that disproportionately affects the elderly. **2. Trade War Retaliation** The China-United States trade war is an ongoing economic conflict between the world's two largest national economies. In 2018, President Donald Trump began imposing tariffs and other trade barriers on China with the intent of forcing it to amend what the U.S. claims are ""unfair trade practices. Among those trade practices and their effects are the growing trade deficit, the theft of intellectual property, and the forced transfer of American technology to China. **Since 2018, the United States has placed over $600 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods.** China has always seen itself as a world leader; however during the time frame starting from Donald Trump's inauguration until the first confirmed Coronavirus death on January 11th, 2020, the Shanghai SSE Composite Index lost 12% of its overall value, while the United States S&amp;amp;P 500 gained 35%. China was losing its battle for economic supremacy and it's plausible that they wanted to even the score. Since the Coronavirus outbreak, the S&amp;amp;P 500 has dropped as much as 35%, while the SSE has remained relatively steady. The West may have been hit harder from the virus because the three most internationally traveled nations are all located in Europe and North America. With free travel laws, more visitors, and decentralized governments it is much harder for Western Nations to contain an airborne pandemic. Additionally, China did not do its part to warn the rest of the world. Numerous intelligence agencies have stated that China has severely under-reported both deaths and cases. This underreporting is believed to have made other countries less prepared for this virus and helped contribute to its rapid spread across the rest of the globe. **3. Information Theft** Despite numerous US video-sharing apps that have been used for years such as Webex, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams, and Skype, Zoom has recently taken over the video conferencing market share. **In fact, the two most downloaded apps since the COVID-19 outbreak are Zoom and the trending video app TikTok. Both are Chinese-run applications that have been linked to major security concerns and private data theft.** Zoom has been banned by Google, NASA, Space X, the Taiwanese Government, the NYC public school district and the German Foreign Ministry. Space X cited significant privacy and security concerns and the German Foreign Ministry said that security and data protection weaknesses made it too risky to use. Zoom has been linked to stealing logins and passwords, harvesting data, leaking personal information, taking control of users microphones and cameras, allowing calls to be routed through whitelisted Chinese servers, call records remaining viewable on the web, and the ability to gain root access to a Mac OS. TikTok has also amassed numerous concerns. According to a proposed class-action lawsuit filed in California federal court, TikTok has been illegally and secretly harvesting vast amounts of personally identifiable user data and sending it to China. The lawsuit also accuses the company and its Chinese parent company ByteDance of taking user content such as draft videos without their consent and having ""ambiguous"" privacy policies. It raises concerns that data gathered by TikTok could be used to identify, profile and track users in the US. The company is benefiting from this alleged activity because it uses this data to sell targeted ads, the lawsuit alleges. Furthermore, Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point has conducted research finding that TikTok has serious vulnerabilities that would have allowed hackers to manipulate user data and reveal personal information. TikTok admitted to some of these mistakes and paid a $5.7 million fine to the United States for stealing data related to children under 13. China has a long history of intellectual property theft, and they were able to enhance their capabilities and global reach during this virus. It seems that China was oddly prepared to capitalize on this pandemic. **How they did it:** What we know so far is that COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China. **Additionally, China has only** **one** **Top Level-Four Microbiology Lab that is equipped to handle deadly coronaviruses, the National Biosafety Laboratory located in Wuhan.** The first-ever case of a coronavirus outbreak in humans was in 2003 when SARS was first discovered. Over two-thirds of SARS diagnosed cases came from China, making China the first-ever country to be majorly affected by a coronavirus. Prior to COVID-19, there have been less than 100 total diagnosed cases of human coronaviruses (SARS and MERS) in the United States and Europe combined. Given the effects of SARS on China, in congruence with the rarity of the disease in the United States and Europe, it is not unreasonable to think that China has been studying coronaviruses more intently and for a longer period of time than any Western nation. In fact, just recently Western nations did not believe that masks helped against coronaviruses, while China has known otherwise for many years. **Scientists believe that COVID-19 likely originated in a wet market, or natural environment, instead of a laboratory. This is because the DNA of the virus is thought to have been created through zoonotic spillover.** Zoonotic spillover is the transmission of a virus from a vertebrate animal to a human. Scientists believe COVID-19 started from a bat coronavirus which was presumably spread to a pangolin, and then to a human. This is not unique to COVID-19. It is believed that SARS inception was also through zoonotic spillover, from bats to civets to humans. MERS is also believed to have been created through zoonotic spillover, from bats to camels to humans. Many scientists have pointed to zoonotic spillover as the reason COVID-19 started in nature instead of a laboratory. The issue with this argument is that zoonotic spillover does not necessitate mutual exclusivity from human intervention. **It is reasonable to believe that if a group of scientists wanted to spread a deadly coronavirus and cover it up, they would not manufacture a man-made coronavirus. Instead, they would take bats infected with coronavirus, put them in cages with other animals, and study the effects.** There have been many leaked photos from China of primates in cages undergoing inhumane tests in laboratories, so animal atrocities of this kind are neither unprecedented nor uncommon in China. Although it is possible that COVID-19 could have started in nature, the majority of the world's bat population lives in South America and tropical climates. This makes it less likely that naturally spread coronaviruses would keep originating in China as opposed to elsewhere. **It is much more likely that the only microbiology lab that is equipped to handle deadly coronaviruses, the one at the epicenter of the virus outbreak, performed some sort of animal experiment that either intentionally or unintentionally spread outside the laboratory.** If China didnt manufacture the virus then they should have nothing to hide. **However, China has banned the publication of research into the origins of COVID-19 without government review and approval.** So much human knowledge could be gained from a world of scientists studying the origins of COVID-19 in order to prevent another pandemic. Instead, China is actively censoring the press and changing the facts. All of this leads me to believe that China manufactured the novel coronavirus and they are trying to cover up and control the narrative. TL;DR - China has both political and financial motives to create a virus that affects the elderly and the West. Chinas only laboratory that experiments with deadly coronaviruses is in Wuhan. With the knowledge that the last two coronavirus outbreaks, SARS and MERS, were caused through zoonotic spillover, China performed animal experiments to form a new disease. China has banned information about COVID-19 origins because they are trying to cover up and control the narrative. **Update 8 hours after posting**: I just checked the news and multiple outlets are reporting that COVID-19 was created in a Wuhan Laboratory. I actually emailed this piece to three major news outlets this morning before posting on Reddit. One of those news sites, Fox News, emailed me back. The current headline on their website reads, ""**Sources believe coronavirus originated in Wuhan lab as part of China's efforts to compete with US.""** Maybe its just a coincidence but either way this is wild!!! Sources are in the comment section."

URL Strikes me as an important topic. I'm not all that great at synthesizing info, so instead here are some resources that provide more information: --- URL An article published by a group of Oxford scholars in Science, a leading academic journal, suggested that governments would not be able to bring the pandemic under control without some level of technology. We conclude that viral spread is too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing, but could be controlled if this process was faster, more efficient and happened at scale, the authors wrote, noting that a significant portion of the spread occurs before people show symptoms. A contact-tracing App which builds a memory of proximity contacts and immediately notifies contacts of positive cases can achieve epidemic control if used by enough people, they added. [...] &gt;In places such as South Korea, Singapore and China, governments are relying on phone location data to carry out extremely precise and targeted contact tracing for people who test positive for the virus. &gt;Israels domestic spy agency, the Shin Bet, tracks peoples cellphone locations, allowing the government to text people who came in contact with a patient who has tested positive. Singapore is taking a similar approach. South Korea is using a mix of location data, digital records and camera footage to track where infected people have been. &gt;In China, a mesh of overlapping systems track people as they move through public transport, taxis, commercial centers, and even specific neighborhoods and buildings, serving to both document where they have been and block potential carriers from moving about and further spreading the disease. --- URL &gt;Scientists and researchers from 27 countries expressed concerns over privacy in using contact tracing apps to monitor the Covid-19 (coronavirus) outbreak and urged governments to avoid misuse by ensuring decentralisation of collected data. &gt;In an open letter, nearly 300 academics expressed concerns some technology innovations may, via mission creep, result in systems which would allow unprecedented surveillance of society at large. --- URL &gt;Apple and Google, which are leading the efforts to develop tracking apps, have pledged that participation would be voluntary and include guardrails to protect confidentiality. But the inability of Congress to pass meaningful data-privacy rules  and the poor track record of many tech firms in protecting privacy  heightens the risk, lawmakers and outside experts say. &gt;[...] The technology, which Google and Apple plan to launch in mid-May, enables people to have their phone track the Bluetooth signals emitted by the phones of every other person with whom they come in close contact. &gt;If a person tests positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, an app provided by their public health department would send an alert to all other users of the app with whom the infected person had contact over the previous two weeks. Identities would not be revealed, just the day of the contact, how long it lasted, and the strength of the Bluetooth signal. --- Good podcast discussion: URL Related article about the post-covid ""new normal"": URL"

But the security of that app will be the source of much scrutiny. After reports of Russian hacking attempts in the 2016 presidential election, party leaders are taking unprecedented precautions to protect against cybersecurity breaches and the spread of disinformation on social media. On Wednesday, Democratic Party officials in Iowa and Washington confirmed that the Democratic National Committee is deploying security staff to work with the state party to assist with any caucus problems. Walter Bragman explains ----- Not great optics here, folks: - Dems paid company literally called Shadow to create caucus app - Buttigieg campaign also paid Shadow, FEC records show - Caucus app fails - Buttigieg declares himself Iowa winner with no results --- Pro-Israel Buttigieg backer Seth Klarman is top funder of group behind Iowas disastrous voting app At the time of publication, twelve hours after voting in the Democratic Partys Iowa caucuses ended, the results have not been announced. The delay in reporting is the result of a failed app developed by a company appropriately named Shadow Inc. This firm was staffed by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama campaign veterans and created by a Democratic dark money nonprofit backed by hedge fund billionaires including Seth Klarman. A prolific funder of pro-settler Israel lobby organizations, Klarman has also contributed directly to Pete Buttigiegs campaign."

The CIA funded almost every technology company in existence. In 1962, Dr. Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider formulated the earliest ideas of global networking in a series of memos discussing an Intergalactic Computer Network. Both well-liked and well-respected, he demonstrated an amazing prescience many times over. His original and far-sighted ideas outlined many of the features the Internet offers today: graphical computing, user-friendly interfaces, digital libraries, e-commerce, online banking, and cloud computing. In 1963, while he was serving as director at the U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), it was Dr. Lickliders persuasive and detailed description of the challenges to establishing a time-sharing network of computers that ultimately led to the creation of the ARPAnet. His 1968 paper called The Computer as a Communication Device illustrated his vision of network applications and predicted the use of computer networks for communications. Until then, computers had generally been thought of as mathematical devices for speeding up computations. The ARPAnet was eventually eclipsed by the Internet URL URL In truth, no private company would have been capable of developing a project like the Internet, which required years of R&amp;D efforts spread out over scores of agencies, and which began to take off only after decades of investment. Other commenters, including Timothy B. Lee at Ars Technica and veteran technology reporter Steve Wildstrom, have noted that Crovitz's misunderstandings run deep. He also manages to confuse the World Wide Web (incidentally, invented by Tim Berners Lee while working at CERN, a government-funded research laboratory) with hyperlinks, and an interneta link between two computerswith THE Internet. But perhaps the most damning rebuttal comes from Michael Hiltzik, the author ""Dealers of Lightning,"" a history of Xerox PARC that Crovitz uses as his main source for material. ""While I'm gratified in a sense that he cites my book,"" writes Hiltzik, ""it's my duty to point out that he's wrong. My book bolsters, not contradicts, the argument that the Internet had its roots in the ARPANet, a government project."" In-Q-Tel (IQT), formerly Peleus and known as In-Q-It, is an American not-for-profit venture capital firm based in Arlington, Virginia. It invests in high-tech companies for the sole purpose of keeping the Central Intelligence Agency, and other intelligence agencies, equipped with the latest in information technology in support of United States intelligence capability. Originally named Peleus and known as In-Q-It, In-Q-Tel was founded by Norm Augustine, a former CEO of Lockheed Martin and by Gilman Louie, who was In-Q-Tel's first CEO. In-Q-Tels mission is to identify and invest in companies developing cutting-edge technologies that serve United States national security interests. Origins of the corporation can be traced to Dr. Ruth A. David, who headed the Central Intelligence Agency Directorate of Science &amp; Technology in the 1990s and promoted the importance of rapidly advancing information technology for the CIA. In-Q-Tel now engages with entrepreneurs, growth companies, researchers, and venture capitalists to deliver technologies that provide superior capabilities for the CIA, DIA, NGA, and the wider intelligence community. In-Q-Tel concentrates on three broad commercial technology areas: software, infrastructure and materials sciences. Former CIA director George Tenet says, We [the CIA] decided to use our limited dollars to leverage technology developed elsewhere. In 1999 we chartered ... In-Q-Tel. ... While we pay the bills, In-Q-Tel is independent of CIA. CIA identifies pressing problems, and In-Q-Tel provides the technology to address them. The In-Q-Tel alliance has put the Agency back at the leading edge of technology ... This ... collaboration ... enabled CIA to take advantage of the technology that Las Vegas uses to identify corrupt card players and apply it to link analysis for terrorists [cf. the parallel data-mining effort by the SOCOM-DIA operation Able Danger ], and to adapt the technology that online booksellers use and convert it to scour millions of pages of documents looking for unexpected results. In-Q-Tel sold 5,636 shares of Google, worth over $2.2 million, on November 15, 2005. The stocks were a result of Googles acquisition of Keyhole, the CIA funded satellite mapping software now known as Google Earth. As of August 2006,[needs update] In-Q-Tel had reviewed more than 5,800 business plans, invested some $150 million in more than 90 companies, and delivered more than 130 technology solutions to the intelligence community. In 2005 it was said to be funded with about $37 million a year from the CIA. Many companies listed on In-Q-Tel's investment website page are secret. In-Q-Tel functions partially in public; however, what products it has and how they are used is strictly secret. According to the Washington Post, ""virtually any U.S. entrepreneur, inventor or research scientist working on ways to analyze data has probably received a phone call from In-Q-Tel or at least been Googled by its staff of technology-watchers A small list of CIA funded technology companies.

URL ""So how did fascism originally develop? It grew out of a European intellectual movement which criticized the alienating effect that industrial society had on modern man, as well as late 19th century critiques of Liberalism and Positivism. They believed that industrial society robbed men of their individuality; however they wanted to assert it at the same time. These ideas were adopted by many young people, especially young, middle-class socialists, because they wanted to rebel against what they perceived as pointless and archaic bourgeois morality and conformity. This is why in the 1930s, fascism looked like it might actually take over Europe: it successfully harnessed peoples dissatisfaction with modern society and directed it into political channels...Fascisms insistence on embracing irrationality is one thing that makes it hard to comprehend; although Hitler and Mussolini wrote their respective handbooks about fascist beliefs, they ultimately rejected concrete doctrines and always acted in response to current events.

Chris Stewart (R-UT) if he always insists on civilians calling him by his rank. Vindman blubbered that since he was wearing his uniform (for no good reason, mind you) he figured civilians ought to refer to him by his rank...After all, there's a reason that the framers of the US Constitution went to great pains to ensure the military powers remained subject to the will of the civilian government.

[URL &amp;#x200B; The Cato Institute did a study back in 2017 on the profound survellience state implications of these stingray devices being deployed to local state and federal police. : [URL "" **In recent years, stingrays have moved from military and national security uses to routine police use.** Surveillance technology, designed for use on battlefields or in antagonistic states where constitutional concerns are minimal, has increasingly found its way into the hands of local law enforcement, often without any discernible effort to adapt the equipment or the policies governing its tactical use to the home front, where targets are citizens with constitutional rights rather than battlefield combatants. **Further exacerbating the problems with stingray transfers are the efforts of the Harris Corporation** (the Florida-based manufacturer of the devices) and the federal agencies responsible for licensing and coordinating the transfers of these devices to state and local law enforcement agencies to hide the technology. **The administrative regime that the federal government and the Harris Corporation have built requires law enforcement agencies to keep the capabilities, uses, and often, the very existence of stingrays a secret from citizens, legislators, and courts......** Meanwhile, the overly restrictive terms of the nondisclosure agreement, upon which both the Harris Corporation and the FBI condition the local use of stingrays, have compromised prosecutions of people suspected of serious violent crimes. In other words, the ostensibly hypothetical prosecutions of terrorists and drug kingpins are crowding out actual prosecutions of criminals when police and prosecutors are forbidden from disclosing stingray use to the courts..... **The relationship between the federal government, Harris, and state and local law enforcement agencies also represents a threat to American federalist principles.** The federal governments terms of use amount to a demand that state and local officials abrogate their authority to prosecute cases when the federal government would rather maintain secrecy. These conditions undermine the police powers of the states, as does the mandate that agencies conceal their surveillance tactics from judges in cases before them...... **The cell-site simulators used by law enforcement are primarily manufactured by the Florida-based Harris Corporation.** Originally used exclusively by the federal government, the proliferation of cell-simulator software for purely state and local law enforcement use has rapidly accelerated. The technology is currently in use by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF); the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE); the U.S. Marshals Service; and the Drug Enforcement Administration; as well as the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, National Guard, and the National Security Agency. Even the Internal Revenue Service possesses stingray devices. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, along with litigation and media investigation, have revealed state or local law enforcement use of the technology in 23 states and the District of Columbia as of October 2016. **By 2010, the Harris Corporation had entered into negotiations with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which regulates the sale and use of all radio-emitting devices, to begin licensing stingray equipment to state and local law enforcement.** Harris requested, and the FCC assented to, a provision of the licensing agreement that would require law enforcement agencies that wish to employ stingray devices to coordinate their acquisition and use with the FBI."" &amp;#x200B; Now here are the Jesuit alumni executives at L3Harris Technologies. &amp;#x200B; Byron Green--Vice President, Operations : "" Byron Green is the vice president of operations for L3Harris Technologies, Inc. **In this role, Green has responsibility for leading global manufacturing, quality, environmental health and safety, supply chain management and e3  L3Harris lean operating system.** Green possesses more than 20 years of extensive operations and enterprise continuous improvement experience in large, global manufacturing organizations.

As part of the evolving battle against deep fakes - videos and audio featuring famous figures, created using machine learning, designed to look and sound genuine - researchers are turning to new methods in an attempt to get ahead of the increasingly sophisticated technology. And its at the University of Oregons Institute of Neuroscience where one of the more outlandish ideas is being tested. A research team is working on training mice to understand irregularities within speech, a task the animals can do with remarkable accuracy. It is hoped that eventually the research could be used to help sites such as Facebook and YouTube detect deep fakes before they are able to spread online - though, to be clear, the companies wont need their own mice. How to take the fakes out of politics Pelosi clip shows misinformation is welcome on Facebook While I think the idea of a room full of mice in real time detecting fake audio on YouTube is really adorable, says Jonathan Saunders, one of the projects researchers, I don't think that is practical for obvious reasons. The goal is to take the lessons we learn from the way that they do it, and then implement that in the computer. Mice categorisation Mr Saunders and team trained their mice to understand a small set of phonemes, the sounds we make that distinguish one word from another. We've taught mice to tell us the difference between a buh and a guh sound across a bunch of different contexts, surrounded by different vowels, so they know boe and bih and bah - all these different fancy things that we take for granted. And because they can learn this really complex problem of categorising different speech sounds, we think that it should be possible to train the mice to detect fake and real speech. The mice were given a reward each time they correctly identified speech sounds, which was up to 80% of the time. That's not perfect, but coupled with existing methods of detecting deep fakes, it could be extremely valuable input. Can't rely on mistakes Most of the deep fakes in circulation today are quite obviously not real, and typically used as a way of mocking a subject, rather than impersonating them. Case in point: a deep fake of Mark Zuckerberg talking openly about stealing user data. But thats not to say convincing impersonation wont be a problem in the not-too-distant future - which is why it has been a significant topic of conversation at this years Black Hat and Def Con, the two hacking conferences that take place in Las Vegas each year. I would say a good estimate for training a deep fake is anywhere from about $100 to about $500, in terms of cloud computing costs, said Matthew Price, from Baltimore-based cyber-security firm Zerofox. Skip Instagram post by bill_posters_uk Report End of Instagram post by bill_posters_uk Hes here to discuss the latest methods of creating deep fakes, but also the cutting-edge in detecting them as well. In his talk, Mr Price discussed how using algorithms to detect unusual head movements, or inconsistent lighting, was an effective method. One clue found within poorly-made deep fakes was that the people in them often didnt blink. But these techniques rely on the creators of deep fakes making mistakes, or weaknesses in currently available tech. Its a luxury that wont last forever. Its probably unlikely in the 2020 elections that we'll see a lot of deep fakes being released, Mr Price told the BBC. But I think as this technology continues to improve, which makes it harder for us to detect the fakes, it's more likely that we will see these used in an influence operation specifically for elections. That concern has been expressed by high-profile US politicians who see deep fakes as a potential new, dramatic escalation in misinformation efforts targeted at American voters. Americas enemies are already using fake images to sow discontent and divide us, said Republican Senator Marco Rubio, speaking to The Hill earlier this year. Now imagine the power of a video that appears to show stolen ballots, salacious comments from a political leader, or innocent civilians killed in conflict abroad. 'Cheap fake' But others feel the deep fake threat is grossly overblown. Noted cybersecurity expert Bruce Schneier, from the Harvard Kennedy School, said efforts around detecting deep fakes completely missed the point. The stuff that is shared, that's fake it isn't even subtle. And yet, it's shared, right? The problem is not the quality of the fake. The problem is that we don't trust legitimate news sources, and because we are sharing things for social identity. Image copyrightGETTY IMAGES Image caption The video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had been slowed by 25% He points to a recent viral video involving Democratic congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, in which the audio had been altered in an attempt to make her sound drunk. The clip was quickly debunked, but that didnt matter - it was viewed more than a million times. That wasnt a deep fake, it was a cheap fake, Mr Schneier pointed out. As long as people look at video not in terms of Is it true? but Does it confirm my world view?, then they're going to share it... because that's who they are. Indeed, one view shared among the experts here is that the discussion around deep fakes may end up being more damaging than the actual fakes themselves. The existence and fears about the tech may be used by certain politicians to convince voters that something very real is only a deep fake. _____ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC"

Why the hell do you assume the internet is some last free medium? The CIA funded almost every technology company in existence. In 1962, Dr. Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider formulated the earliest ideas of global networking in a series of memos discussing an Intergalactic Computer Network. Both well-liked and well-respected, he demonstrated an amazing prescience many times over. His original and far-sighted ideas outlined many of the features the Internet offers today: graphical computing, user-friendly interfaces, digital libraries, e-commerce, online banking, and cloud computing. In 1963, while he was serving as director at the U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), it was Dr. Lickliders persuasive and detailed description of the challenges to establishing a time-sharing network of computers that ultimately led to the creation of the ARPAnet. His 1968 paper called The Computer as a Communication Device illustrated his vision of network applications and predicted the use of computer networks for communications. Until then, computers had generally been thought of as mathematical devices for speeding up computations. The ARPAnet was eventually eclipsed by the Internet URL URL In truth, no private company would have been capable of developing a project like the Internet, which required years of R&amp;D efforts spread out over scores of agencies, and which began to take off only after decades of investment. Other commenters, including Timothy B. Lee at Ars Technica and veteran technology reporter Steve Wildstrom, have noted that Crovitz's misunderstandings run deep. He also manages to confuse the World Wide Web (incidentally, invented by Tim Berners Lee while working at CERN, a government-funded research laboratory) with hyperlinks, and an interneta link between two computerswith THE Internet. But perhaps the most damning rebuttal comes from Michael Hiltzik, the author ""Dealers of Lightning,"" a history of Xerox PARC that Crovitz uses as his main source for material. ""While I'm gratified in a sense that he cites my book,"" writes Hiltzik, ""it's my duty to point out that he's wrong. My book bolsters, not contradicts, the argument that the Internet had its roots in the ARPANet, a government project."" In-Q-Tel (IQT), formerly Peleus and known as In-Q-It, is an American not-for-profit venture capital firm based in Arlington, Virginia. It invests in high-tech companies for the sole purpose of keeping the Central Intelligence Agency, and other intelligence agencies, equipped with the latest in information technology in support of United States intelligence capability. Originally named Peleus and known as In-Q-It, In-Q-Tel was founded by Norm Augustine, a former CEO of Lockheed Martin and by Gilman Louie, who was In-Q-Tel's first CEO. In-Q-Tels mission is to identify and invest in companies developing cutting-edge technologies that serve United States national security interests. Origins of the corporation can be traced to Dr. Ruth A. David, who headed the Central Intelligence Agency Directorate of Science &amp; Technology in the 1990s and promoted the importance of rapidly advancing information technology for the CIA. In-Q-Tel now engages with entrepreneurs, growth companies, researchers, and venture capitalists to deliver technologies that provide superior capabilities for the CIA, DIA, NGA, and the wider intelligence community. In-Q-Tel concentrates on three broad commercial technology areas: software, infrastructure and materials sciences. Former CIA director George Tenet says, We [the CIA] decided to use our limited dollars to leverage technology developed elsewhere. In 1999 we chartered ... In-Q-Tel. ... While we pay the bills, In-Q-Tel is independent of CIA. CIA identifies pressing problems, and In-Q-Tel provides the technology to address them. The In-Q-Tel alliance has put the Agency back at the leading edge of technology ... This ... collaboration ... enabled CIA to take advantage of the technology that Las Vegas uses to identify corrupt card players and apply it to link analysis for terrorists [cf. the parallel data-mining effort by the SOCOM-DIA operation Able Danger ], and to adapt the technology that online booksellers use and convert it to scour millions of pages of documents looking for unexpected results. In-Q-Tel sold 5,636 shares of Google, worth over $2.2 million, on November 15, 2005. The stocks were a result of Googles acquisition of Keyhole, the CIA funded satellite mapping software now known as Google Earth. As of August 2006,[needs update] In-Q-Tel had reviewed more than 5,800 business plans, invested some $150 million in more than 90 companies, and delivered more than 130 technology solutions to the intelligence community. In 2005 it was said to be funded with about $37 million a year from the CIA. Many companies listed on In-Q-Tel's investment website page are secret. In-Q-Tel functions partially in public; however, what products it has and how they are used is strictly secret. According to the Washington Post, ""virtually any U.S. entrepreneur, inventor or research scientist working on ways to analyze data has probably received a phone call from In-Q-Tel or at least been Googled by its staff of technology-watchers A small list of CIA funded technology companies.

Not even on this sub, but across most of reddit (at least in technology-related subreddits) I have seen DuckDuckGo be recommended on a major scale. Is there a nefarious reason to this or is it just word of mouth? I don't really know but I do know that DuckDuckGo is presently the 3rd largest search engine on the internet, behind Google and Bing. Anyways, I came across an article while trying to find out more about the founder of DuckDuckGo, and came across [this article in the Times of Israel](URL no less, and in which I found an interesting paragraph: &gt;If DuckDuckGo sounds like something conceived in the Tel Aviv high-tech corridor, its wholly an American creation. Weinberg, who holds a BA and MS from MIT, has never been to Israel but jokingly acknowledges that hes a distant relative to the founder of the Israeli technology giant, CheckPoint. He says he would very much like to visit the Jewish state, but most travel plans are on hold until his two young sons are older. Now, the main founder of CheckPoint is [Gil Shwed](URL The other main founder is [Shlomo Kramer](URL I assume DDG's owner, Gabriel Weinberg, is related to one of them. Now the interesting part is, the CheckPoint software (""one of Israel's largest technology companies and the world's largest pure-play cybersecurity company) was founded by the two guys above while they were doing military service in [Unit 8200](URL Unit 8200 is ""an Israeli Intelligence Corps unit responsible for collecting signal intelligence (SIGINT) and code decryption."" On it's wikipedia page it is further stated that: &gt;According to the Director of Military Sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, ""Unit 8200 is probably the foremost technical intelligence agency in the world and stands on a par with the NSA in everything except scale."" Funnily enough, while researching this CheckPoint software, I came across an [email sent to CheckPoint customers?](URL from 1997 dismissing rumours of ""*an ""agreement"" or relationship between Check Point Software and the Mossad*"". With CheckPoint being one of the biggest cybersecurity corporations in Israel, surely Mossad or any other intelligence agency must have some sort of vested interest in the software and most likely a backdoor to access user's data. This relates back to the main topic, how DDG's founder is a distant relative to one of the founders of this massive cybersecurity corporation which has had links to Mossad. This poses some questions. How often do Weinberg and his ""distant relative"" contact each other? Do they have shared interests? Has DuckDuckGo been compromised? These are just some of the questions I am asking after my own research. I personally find it hard to believe that the 3rd largest search engine on the internet is uncompromised and is completely privacy-centered, absent from any tracking or data collection at all."

Why the hell do yu assume the internet is some last free medium? The CIA funded almost every technology company in existence. In 1962, Dr. Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider formulated the earliest ideas of global networking in a series of memos discussing an Intergalactic Computer Network. Both well-liked and well-respected, he demonstrated an amazing prescience many times over. His original and far-sighted ideas outlined many of the features the Internet offers today: graphical computing, user-friendly interfaces, digital libraries, e-commerce, online banking, and cloud computing. In 1963, while he was serving as director at the U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), it was Dr. Lickliders persuasive and detailed description of the challenges to establishing a time-sharing network of computers that ultimately led to the creation of the ARPAnet. His 1968 paper called The Computer as a Communication Device illustrated his vision of network applications and predicted the use of computer networks for communications. Until then, computers had generally been thought of as mathematical devices for speeding up computations. The ARPAnet was eventually eclipsed by the Internet URL URL In truth, no private company would have been capable of developing a project like the Internet, which required years of R&amp;D efforts spread out over scores of agencies, and which began to take off only after decades of investment. Other commenters, including Timothy B. Lee at Ars Technica and veteran technology reporter Steve Wildstrom, have noted that Crovitz's misunderstandings run deep. He also manages to confuse the World Wide Web (incidentally, invented by Tim Berners Lee while working at CERN, a government-funded research laboratory) with hyperlinks, and an interneta link between two computerswith THE Internet. But perhaps the most damning rebuttal comes from Michael Hiltzik, the author ""Dealers of Lightning,"" a history of Xerox PARC that Crovitz uses as his main source for material. ""While I'm gratified in a sense that he cites my book,"" writes Hiltzik, ""it's my duty to point out that he's wrong. My book bolsters, not contradicts, the argument that the Internet had its roots in the ARPANet, a government project."" In-Q-Tel (IQT), formerly Peleus and known as In-Q-It, is an American not-for-profit venture capital firm based in Arlington, Virginia. It invests in high-tech companies for the sole purpose of keeping the Central Intelligence Agency, and other intelligence agencies, equipped with the latest in information technology in support of United States intelligence capability. Originally named Peleus and known as In-Q-It, In-Q-Tel was founded by Norm Augustine, a former CEO of Lockheed Martin and by Gilman Louie, who was In-Q-Tel's first CEO. In-Q-Tels mission is to identify and invest in companies developing cutting-edge technologies that serve United States national security interests. Origins of the corporation can be traced to Dr. Ruth A. David, who headed the Central Intelligence Agency Directorate of Science &amp; Technology in the 1990s and promoted the importance of rapidly advancing information technology for the CIA. In-Q-Tel now engages with entrepreneurs, growth companies, researchers, and venture capitalists to deliver technologies that provide superior capabilities for the CIA, DIA, NGA, and the wider intelligence community. In-Q-Tel concentrates on three broad commercial technology areas: software, infrastructure and materials sciences. Former CIA director George Tenet says, We [the CIA] decided to use our limited dollars to leverage technology developed elsewhere. In 1999 we chartered ... In-Q-Tel. ... While we pay the bills, In-Q-Tel is independent of CIA. CIA identifies pressing problems, and In-Q-Tel provides the technology to address them. The In-Q-Tel alliance has put the Agency back at the leading edge of technology ... This ... collaboration ... enabled CIA to take advantage of the technology that Las Vegas uses to identify corrupt card players and apply it to link analysis for terrorists [cf. the parallel data-mining effort by the SOCOM-DIA operation Able Danger ], and to adapt the technology that online booksellers use and convert it to scour millions of pages of documents looking for unexpected results. In-Q-Tel sold 5,636 shares of Google, worth over $2.2 million, on November 15, 2005. The stocks were a result of Googles acquisition of Keyhole, the CIA funded satellite mapping software now known as Google Earth. As of August 2006,[needs update] In-Q-Tel had reviewed more than 5,800 business plans, invested some $150 million in more than 90 companies, and delivered more than 130 technology solutions to the intelligence community. In 2005 it was said to be funded with about $37 million a year from the CIA. Many companies listed on In-Q-Tel's investment website page are secret. In-Q-Tel functions partially in public; however, what products it has and how they are used is strictly secret. According to the Washington Post, ""virtually any U.S. entrepreneur, inventor or research scientist working on ways to analyze data has probably received a phone call from In-Q-Tel or at least been Googled by its staff of technology-watchers A small list of CIA funded technology companies.

Ola Bini was arrested Thursday at Quitos airport as he prepared to board a flight to Japan, a senior Ecuadorian official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Swedish man by the same name describes himself on a blog as a software engineer working in Quito for the Center for Digital Autonomy, a group based in Ecuador and Spain focused on privacy, security and cryptography matters. It makes no mention of any affiliation with WikiLeaks.On Twitter earlier Thursday, Bini called claims by the interior minister that Russian hackers and someone close to WikiLeaks were working inside Ecuador very worrisome news. This seems like a witch hunt to me, Bini wrote. The arrest came after police in London dragged Assange out of Ecuadors embassy when his seven-year asylum was revoked. The man had frequently traveled to Ecuadors London embassy, Interior Minister Mara Paula Romo said, according to the BBC. He has been detained simply for investigation purposes, she said. A person close to Wikileaks, who has been residing in Ecuador, was arrested this afternoon when he was preparing to travel to Japan, Ecuadors interior ministry tweeted late Thursday. Ecuadorian officials believe Bini may be part of a blackmail ring assembled to pressure President Lenin Moreno and his government to allow Assange to remain in the embassy, according to the Times of London. Ecuadorian diplomats told their counterparts in the UK that they were worried that Assanges associates would try to seek revenge with cyberattacks and information leaks if he was handed over. Britain agreed to assist Ecuador in shoring up its cybersecurity, the newspaper reported. The Ecuadorian government accused WikiLeaks of being behind an anonymous online campaign implicating Moreno and his family in alleged corruption. The leaked materials  dubbed the INA Papers  also contained private photographs of Moreno and his family. Moreno, 66, said that Assange had no right to hack private accounts and phones without directly accusing him. Binis friends described him as a soft-spoken geek who is being unfairly accused of plotting to destabilize the Ecuadorian government. Vijay Prashad, who runs a Marxist publishing house based in India, considers himself a close pal. Bini is the last person who would ever be involved in an attempt overthrow a government, he said, adding that he last saw Bini a few months ago in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Martin Fowler, a US-based computer programmer, tweeted: Im very concerned to hear that [he] has been arrested. He is a strong advocate and developer supporting privacy and has not been able to speak to any lawyers."

I work in cybersecurity (digital forensics + incident response) and spend a lot of time analyzing encryption and operating system artifacts. I decided to take a look at TheDarkOverlord's 9/11 data when a colleague informed me that VeraCrypt was being used. VeraCrypt is a topic near and dear to my heart! My focus was on examining the *metadata* inside the Preview\_Documents container - a VeraCrypt container. File content was not my focus. My blog post is quite lengthy, but I outline what tools I used, what commands were run, and what the output means. I also did my best to remove any personally identifiable information from the content (such as names from the document metadata). The key findings revealed: * TheDarkOverlord uses Windows; * Timestamp artifacts indicate the files were exfiltrated from the victim in a manner that maintained the original timestamp; * File artifacts suggest the contents are authentic. This isn't to say this is evidence of irrefutable authenticity or that the additional volumes contain more content. That said, it would take a *lot* of effort to manufacture the evidence that was produced. I encourage you to take a look.

How can anyone be charged when the FBI never independently verified the actual hack but relied on the findings of CrowdStrike, which was a firm paid by the DNC? Comey admitted to this under questioning from Senator Burr that the FBI never actually independently verfied the hack themselves. Also, what did the hack actually reveal? That the DNC and Clinton campaign were colluding to rig the Democratic primaries against Bernie Sanders, which Donna Brazileformer DNC chair *during* the electionhas verfied. Did the Russians leave IP addresses linking back to Russia? Where's the evidence? Putin is a manical mastermind but left breadcrumbs like simple IP addresses linking easily back to Russia? Why was the Justice Department involved in negotiations with Julian Assange about an exchange of sensitive information for safe passage but when Comey got wind of it and heard that Assange was willing to show them proof it wasn't Russians who gave Wikileaks the DNC emails he quashed the talks? The sensitive information was CIA Vault 7, CIA's hacking and spying tools, including where they can mask themselves as any other nation state. The Russian lawyer in the infamous Trump Tower meeting in summer of 2016 with Don Jr and others met with Glenn Simpson **the day before and the day after** that meeting. Who is Glenn Simpson? The head of Fusion GPS, the firm that the Clinton campaign had hired at the time to dig up dirt on Trump. The Russian lawyer had to get a pass and waiver to even enter the United States. Obama's State Department gave her one. Nothing suspicious about that, right? O, and the FBI had multiple informants/spies into the Trump campaign before the official investigation into Russia and the Trump campaign even started. Why was it treasonous for the Trump campaign to have a meeting with a Russian about possible dirt on Clinton but it isn't treasonous that the Clinton campaign paid Christopher Steelethrough Fusion GPSto talk to Russians about possible dirt on Trump aka the Dossier? O, and several FBI agents who were over both the Clinton email investigation and Russia investigation were caught sending texts stating that they were going to stop Trump from being elected, that they had an ""insurance policy"" against him and mere days after Robert Mueller was appointed Special Counsel were already talking impeachment, effectively prejudging the outcome of the investigation. What if Trump had lost to Cruz or Rubio? The emails would have been released either way. The hack started in summer 2015. You are telling me Putin had the foresight to bet it all on Trump winning not only the Republican nomination but the election itself that far back? And what does ""collusion"" even mean? What, Russia needs help from the Trump campaign to hack into DNC servers? What, the Trump campaign had secret hackers somewhere? You redpill when you find out that.... ...the FBI and in extension our government has never independently verified the DNC hack because the DNC refused to let the FBI have access. A private party paid by the DNC just gave its results to the FBI. ...that Mike Flynn's ties to Russia and his firm's business dealings with a Dutch consulting firm owned by a Turkish businessman were in the news before the election and inauguration. ...the FBI interviewed Mike Flynn on January 24th, before Sally Yates spoke to White House counsel, and he passed all questions asked of him and it was concluded he wasn't being deceptive about his discussions in December with the Russian ambassador. ...that James Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence under the Obama administration, was labeled in the media as Mike Flynn's number one bureaucratic enemy before the Trump administration took office. Clapper was the one who fired Flynn in 2014. Fast forward and Clapper puts in his resignation the exact same day Mike Flynn is chosen to be the upcoming National Security Advisor. Then Flynn's phone conversation with the Russian ambassador is illegally leaked to David Ignatius at the Washington Post by someone in the Obama administration. ...that Sally Yates sole reasoning for being concerned about Mike Flynn was because he could seemingly be blackmailed by the Russian government solely because he lied to Vice President Mike Pence about having spoken about sanctions with the Russian ambassador. Somehow, this decorated general who has been in the upper echelons of government for decades could be blackmailed because he told Pence a fib. Yeah ... logically, it makes zero sense. ...that Sally Yates heard about the conversation between Flynn and the ambassador because someone illegally leaked it to Washington Post journalist David Ignatius who then publicized it on January 13th in an article. This leak of classified information occurred while the Obama administration was still in office. There's a Washington Post article from August 2015 which regards a suspected cyber attack by the Russian government on Pentagon servers. Within, there's the following: Even so, officials cautioned that it is difficult to pinpoint the origin or perpetrator of such hacks. Attribution in this business is near impossible. Rarely are you ever able to say with 100 percent certainty who was behind a particular incident, the official said."" The incident follows several other, more destructive cyberattacks on U.S. government networks, including devastating breaches of databases maintained by the Office of Personnel Management. U.S. officials believe hackers working for the Chinese government were responsible for those, which exposed sensitive information about more than 22 million people. Skip ahead to this July 2016 New York Times article. It is the beginning tendrils of the gossip about Russia and Trump ""colluding"" to hack the servers of the DNC. Within the article: An unusual question is capturing the attention of cyberspecialists, Russia experts and Democratic Party leaders in Philadelphia: Is Vladimir V. Putin trying to meddle in the American presidential election? Until Friday, that charge, with its eerie suggestion of a Kremlin conspiracy to aid Donald J. Trump, has been only whispered. But the release on Friday of some 20,000 stolen emails from the Democratic National Committees computer servers, many of them embarrassing to Democratic leaders, has intensified discussion of the role of Russian intelligence agencies in disrupting the 2016 campaign. Also within the article: Proving the source of a cyberattack is notoriously difficult. But researchers have concluded that the national committee was breached by two Russian intelligence agencies, which were the same attackers behind previous Russian cyberoperations at the White House, the State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff last year. And metadata from the released emails suggests that the documents passed through Russian computers. Though a hacker claimed responsibility for giving the emails to WikiLeaks, the same agencies are the prime suspects. A mere 48 hours after the leak of the DNC emails by Wikileaks: Clintons campaign manager, Robby Mook, argued on ABCs This Week that the emails were leaked by the Russians for the purpose of helping Donald Trump citing experts but offering no other evidence. Who gave the DNC and Clinton an assessment of who was behind the hack?: The experts cited by Mr. Mook include CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that was brought into the Democratic National Committee when officials there suspected they had been hacked. Now let's go back a month to a June 2016 New York Times article, when the DNC hack was initially reported: One group placed espionage software on the committees computer servers last summer, giving it unimpeded access to communications for about a year. The committee called in CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, early last month after the Democratic Party began to suspect an intrusion. Also: Dmitri Alperovitch, a co-founder of CrowdStrike, said he believed that the group that first hacked the committees servers  a group his firm had named Cozy Bear long before the breach  appeared to be the same that downloaded communications in recent years from unclassified email systems used by the State Department and the White House. Also: In 2014 and 2015, the effort to clean the State Department systems after those intrusions resulted in several shutdowns, some in the midst of delicate negotiations with Iran. The administration has never confirmed that the Russian government was behind those intrusions, but it has briefed officials on the details in classified sessions. There's a lot of mixed messaging going on. Now let's go forward a month, back to July, with this CNN article: Federal investigators tried to warn the Democratic National Committee about a potential intrusion in their computer network months before the party moved to try to fix the problem, U.S. officials briefed on the probe tell CNN. The DNC brought in consultants from the private security firm CrowdStrike in April. And by the time suspected Russian hackers were kicked out of the DNC network in June, the hackers had been inside for about a year. Also, the FBI investigation begins: Earlier on Monday, the FBI confirmed it was investigating a hack into the DNC, the first acknowledgment from the agency that they are probing the incident, which U.S. officials suspect came from a Russian cyber attack. Clinton's campaign manager is out in full force, pushing the Russia-Trump collusion narrative: Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday about that ""changes to the Republican platform to make it more pro-Russian,"" which could provide some of the motive behind the hacks. ""I don't think it's coincidental that these emails were released on the eve of our convention here, and I think that's disturbing,"" he said. Also: The FBI and other U.S. agencies involved haven't yet officially attributed the DNC attack to Russian government hackers. But evidence gathered by the FBI so far points to groups that are known to U.S. counter-intelligence for carrying out intrusions for the Russian government, the officials briefed on the probe say. Interesting tidbits: It's possible that other hackers took advantage of the DNC's vulnerabilities and also stole information, U.S. officials said. But the intrusion so far appears to bear the hallmarks of a Russian intelligence operation. Foreign spy agencies routinely try to collect information on U.S. elections, and there were some cyber attacks against political campaigns detected during the 2012 election cycle. This highly informative and exhaustive article goes into detail why the DNC hack is bogus: The results of CrowdStrikes investigation were first broken by the Washington Post and then followed up in greater detail by CrowdStrike itself. In a post entitled Bears in the Midst, Dmitri Alperovitch attributed the hack to two distinct and very nefarious Russian espionage groups: Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear, among the most sophisticated cyber-operators CrowdStrike had ever come across. In fact, our team considers them some of the best adversaries out of all the numerous nation-state, criminal and hacktivist/terrorist groups we encounter on a daily basis, he wrote. Their tradecraft is superb, operational security second to none and the extensive usage of living-off-the-land techniques enables them to easily bypass many security solutions they encounter. CrowdStrike followed the protocols for existing APTs. Its investigation of DNC servers turned up two known threat actor groups: APT28 and APT29. Depending on the cybersecurity firm doing the analysis, these two APTs have been called by all sorts of names: Pawn Storm, Sofacy, Sednit, CozyCar, The Dukes, CozyDuke, Office Monkeys. Neither of them has ever been linked by any cybersecurity firm to the Russian government with certainty. Some firms have triedmost notably FireEye, CrowdStrikes bigger and wealthier competitor. We know the FBI was never allowed access to the DNC servers but solely relied on the findings of CrowdStrike. Now let's move ahead to August 2016 and this article/interview in the Washington Post. Flynn openly gives information about his connections to Russia: PRIEST: Let me ask me about Russia. There has been a lot in the news about your trips  FLYNN: One in the military [while director of the Defense Intelligence Agency]. I went there on a fully approved trip. I had a great trip. I was the first U.S. officer ever allowed inside the headquarters of the GRU [Russian intelligence]. I was able to brief their entire staff. I gave them a leadership OPD. [Professional development class on leadership] and talked a lot about the way the worlds unfolding. PRIEST: You saw the relationship with Russia as potentially good for the U.S.? FLYNN: No. No. I saw the relation with Russia as necessary to the U.S., for the interests of the U.S. We worked very closely with them on the Sochi Olympics. We were working closely with them on the Iranian nuclear deal. We beat Hitler because of our relationship with the Russians, so anybody that looks on it as anything but a relationship thats required for mutual supporting interests, including ISIS,  thats really where Im at with Russia. We have a problem with radical Islamism and I actually think that we could work together with them against this enemy. They have a worse problem than we do. PRIEST: Tell me about the RT [state-run Russian Television] relationship?* FLYNN: I was asked by my speakers bureau, LAI. I do public speaking. It was in Russia. It was a paid speaking opportunity. I get paid so much. The speakers bureau got paid so much, based on our contract. PRIEST: Can you tell me how much you got for that? FLYNN: No. PRIEST: No? Because you dont want to get your fees out there? FLYNN: Yeah, I dont. PRIEST: What was the gig? FLYNN: The gig was to do an interview with [RT correspondent] Sophie Shevardnadze. It was an interview in front of the forum, probably 200 peopl1e in the audience. My purpose there was I was asked to talk about radical Islam in the Middle East. They asked me to talk about what was going on in the situation unfolding in the Middle East.  The speaking agreement was done before Russian went into Syria, which was actually more interesting to me because  one of my discussions, I talked about the attacks in France  and the negative role that Iran was playing where I thought Russian could actually have a role. The statement that I made was actually: Russia ought to get Iran to back out of the proxy wars they are involved in, to include Syria, so we, the rest of the international community, could settle this situation down. PRIEST: Have you appeared on RT regularly? FLYNN: I appear on Al Jazeera, Skye New Arabia, RT. I dont get paid a dime. I have no media contracts.  [I am interviewed] on CNN, Fox  PRIEST: One more thing about Russia  FLYNN: A lot of people are making this about Russia. Read my book. Youll see what I say about Russia. PRIEST: Let me ask about sitting next to Putin  because thats the symbol. FLYNN: Yeah, I know, boring. PRIEST: But did you think about what the optics would be  FLYNN: Sure. I didnt have any problem. What Im looking for is to make sure, in my view, I see a country that has lost respect for another country and if I have any sort of fiber in my body where I can help out to make sure they understand that we have people in our country who arent going to apologize for who we are. Were not going to act in a soft way for what we believe needs to be done. I was very adamant about what I said. He knows exactly what I said. PRIEST: Did you talk to him personally? FLYNN: No, just introduction. Thats it. PRIEST: The seating arrangements? You didnt ask to sit by him? FLYNN: Nope. I was one of the guests there.  Some interesting characters. I found it a great learning opportunity. One of the things I learned was that Putin has no respect for the United States leadership. Not for the United States, but the leadership. Carter Page, who is currently under investigation, is even mentioned: PRIEST: To broaden the discussion on the Russia question a little bit, theres [Trump adviser] Carter Page having business interest and Paul Manafort have business interests there. FLYNN: How about the Clintons?  If thats all you want to talk about, I dont want to do this anymore. PRIEST: But thats not all Im talking about. Im trying to just get it out there on the table. FLYNN: You know what? I dont know what their business interests are. Ive talked with Paul Manafort, met him, but if Carter Page walked in here, I wouldnt know who he is  you know what? Look at the amount of money the Global Clinton Initiative is taking from countries right now. The same Carter Page who was extremely open in March 2016 in this Bloomberg interview: Pages interest in Russia dates to his youth in New Yorks Hudson Valley. Watching a TV news program on arms control talks, he says he noticed that the adviser sitting behind President Ronald Reagan wore a Navy uniform. A few years later, Page enrolled in the U.S. Naval Academy. He later worked in arms control at the Pentagon and completed a fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Over his career, he's earned three graduate degrees, including a Ph.D from SOAS University of London. Emphasis should be placed on that this interview was in March 2016, before the DNC leaks. Let's skip to an article the same day, same newspaper as the previous one regarding Flynn: He has called President Obama a liar, declared the U.S. justice system corrupt and insisted that he was pushed out of his assignment as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency because of his views on radical Islam. The claim has left former superiors seething, including Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., according to current and former officials who said Flynn was removed because of management problems. &amp;gt;Like Trump, Flynn has advocated forging closer ties with Russia. In interviews with The Washington Post, Flynn acknowledged being paid to give a speech and attend a lavish anniversary party for the Kremlin-controlled RT television network in Moscow last year, where he was seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin. People went crazy, said retired Brig. Gen. Peter B. Zwack, a former U.S. military attache in Moscow. They thought it was so out of bounds, so unusual. Zwack emphasized that he considers Flynn a patriot who would never sell out his country. Flynn, who was no longer in government but received a DIA briefing on Russia before the trip, said the invitation and payment came through his speakers bureau. He said he used the visit to press for collaboration on Syria, Iran and the Middle East, and dismissed the ensuing controversy as boring. Asked why he would want to be so closely associated with a Kremlin propaganda platform, Flynn said he sees no distinction between RT and other news outlets. Also: He has held senior positions in the 18th Airborne Corps, at the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon and at U.S. Central Command, which runs U.S. military operations in the Middle East. Throughout his career, he was viewed as a charismatic and unconventional officer with a talent for mapping terrorist networks  qualities prized by superiors. But his hard-charging approach was at times considered disruptive or undisciplined. Some of Flynns other moves angered superiors. Former U.S. officials said he was scolded after traveling to Pakistan in 2009 or early 2010 and revealing to Pakistani officials sensitive U.S. intelligence on the militant Haqqani network accused of staging attacks on American forces. U.S. officials said that the move was aimed at prodding Pakistan to crack down on the militant group, but that Flynn exposed U.S. intelligence capabilities that only helped Pakistan protect an organization it used as a proxy ally. Flynn also came under investigation by the Pentagon because of an allegation that he had inappropriately shared highly classified intelligence with Australian and British forces. Im proud of that one, Flynn said in an interview. Accuse me of sharing intelligence in combat with our closest allies. Please! &amp;gt;The inquiry delayed but did not derail Flynns ascent through the ranks. Always pushing for a deeper understanding of terrorist networks, Flynn persuaded Clapper in 2011 to let him form a team to reexamine the materials recovered from bin Ladens compound in Pakistan, searching for clues overlooked by the CIA. In 2012, Obama tapped him for one of the highest positions a military intelligence officer can attain, running the Defense Intelligence Agency. The DIA job is ordinarily a three-year assignment. But early in Flynns second year, his bosses  Clapper and then-Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael G. Vickers  summoned him to a meeting at the Pentagon to tell him that he was being removed. As the search for a replacement stalled, Flynn attempted an end-run around his superiors, appealing directly to the vice chief of staff of the Army to extend his tenure. The move infuriated Clapper, according to former officials who said the DNI warned Flynn that if he made any other attempt to circumvent the outcome he would be fired on the spot. Clapper declined to comment for this article, but several current and former officials confirmed the account. He characterizes his ouster as a political purge orchestrated by an administration unwilling to heed the warnings he was sounding about militant Islam. Asked for evidence, he said, I just know! adding that Clapper had once told him that the issue behind Flynns ouster was not your leadership, or I would have removed you right away. The decision to remove Flynn was about turbulence and a destructive climate, said a former senior U.S. intelligence official. I dont think anybody in the administration was even aware of his views on radical Islam. Now let's skip to November, right after the election, in this New York Times article: The Flynn Intel Group, a consulting firm he founded after he was fired by President Obama as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, has hazy business ties to Middle Eastern countries and has appeared to lobby for the Turkish government. General Flynn also took a paid speaking engagement last year with Russia Today, a television network funded by the Kremlin, and attended the networks lavish anniversary party in Moscow, where he sat at Mr. Putins elbow. Also: For example, he has attributed his dismissal from the Defense Intelligence Agency to a pair of consummate insiders: James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, and Michael Vickers, the undersecretary of defense intelligence. Interesting tidbit: Hes an analyst who can get deep into the weeds on the issues and a lot of this stuff and then is very good at playing three-dimensional chess, said Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a close confidant to Mr. Flynn. He was the one who called out the administration for being wrong on Al Qaeda. Now forward, to an article from Vox days later. The move will immediately make Flynn one of the most powerful people in the US government and give him enormous influence over the Pentagon, State Department, and CIA  the very organizations he clashed with publicly and privately during his final years in uniform. Interesting tidbits: NBC News reported that Flynn personally vetoed candidates like retired Adm. William McRaven, retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis, and former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers. In 2012, Flynn proposed overhauling the agency so it would maintain a network of covert operatives to expand its network of overseas spies, according to a long article I co-wrote in Foreign Policy about the fight. The move infuriated the CIA, which worked hard to stop the creation of what could have ultimately come to rival its larger and better-known cadre of covert operatives. The agency, backed by a network of former CIA personnel in senior jobs at the Pentagon and elsewhere in the national security bureaucracy, succeeded in killing the idea. According to the Washington Post, Flynn tried to salvage his job by sidestepping his superior officers and making a direct appeal to the vice chief of the Army. When Clapper found out, he warned Flynn that he would fire him on the spot if Flynn made another attempt to do an end-run around his bosses, according to the newspaper. Clapper, arguably Flynns biggest bureaucratic adversary, announced his resignation Thursday, just hours before Flynns appointment. Then on January 12th 2017 an article by David Ignatius of the Washington Post included leaked classified information, number one of which illegally disclosed that a phone call was made between Flynn and the Russian ambassador to the United States on December 29th and what may have been talked about during the call. This leak happened a week before the inauguration and the Obama administration was still in office at the time. The article reads, along with many I've quoted here, like political gossip akin to celeb tabloid rags. It should also be pointed out that this leak of classified information occurred alongside the publication of the now infamous Trump dossier/opposition research done by Michael Steele. According to a senior U.S. government official, Flynn phoned Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak several times on Dec. 29, the day the Obama administration announced the expulsion of 35 Russian officials as well as other measures in retaliation for the hacking. What did Flynn say, and did it undercut the U.S. sanctions? The Logan Act (though never enforced) bars U.S. citizens from correspondence intending to influence a foreign government about disputes with the United States. Was its spirit violated? The Trump campaign didnt immediately respond to a request for comment. Tidbit: The FBI and other intelligence agencies have had the dossier, too, since late summer. Their investigation remains open, it appears. The following day, January 13th, Democrat senator Chris Coons comments to CNN about the illegally leaked classified information: Sen. Chris Coons said Friday that it ""seems very suspicious"" that President-elect Donald Trump's pick for national security advisor spoke to Russia's ambassador to the United States on the same day the Obama administration announced sanctions against Russia for alleged hacking during the presidential election. The same day, New York magazine reports: On the same day that President Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the U.S. and imposed other sanctions in retaliation for the Kremlins alleged attempts to influence the presidential election, Donald Trumps incoming national security adviser, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, spoke on the phone several times to Russias ambassador to the U.S, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius reports.Whats unclear is why. The narrative continues. Within the next two months the media suddenly brings back up the previously reported information of Flynn's company working for a firm owned by a businesman who was born in Turkey as if it's THIS SHOCKING BREAKING NEWS INFORMATION! FLYNN IS A FOREIGN AGENT! They bring back the information about Flynn's trip to Russia as if it hadn't been in the public sphere for months. Now, skip ahead to January 24th. From testimony before Congress we know Flynn was interviewed by the FBI that day. We now know the following about that FBI interview: The FBI interviewed Flynn about the December calls with Kislyak and determined that he wasn't intentionally trying to be deceptive about the nature of what was discussed, according to US officials briefed on the investigation. But investigators have been investigating Flynn's business ties after he left the government and before he joined the Trump administration. Another article: Officials said this week that the FBI is continuing to examine Flynns communications with Kislyak. Several officials emphasized that while sanctions were discussed, they did not see evidence that Flynn had an intent to convey an explicit promise to take action after the inauguration. U.S. officials said that seeking to build such a case against Flynn would be daunting. The law against U.S. citizens interfering in foreign diplomacy, known as the Logan Act, stems from a 1799 statute that has never been prosecuted. As a result, there is no case history to help guide authorities on when to proceed or how to secure a conviction. We know now that on January 26th and January 27th Yates contacts White House counsel about Flynn. The media spins the blackmail story regarding Flynn, inferring Russia could possibly blackmail Flynn. We don't know WHY until this month when Yates testifies. She testifies that her sole concern about Flynn and why she contacted White House counsel was that Flynn's conversation with the Russian ambassador in December could be used as blackmail against him by the Russians because he had lied to Pence about it. So her logic is that Flynn, in the military for decades and at the top levels of government for years, could be blackmailed into doing something criminal solely because he lied to Pence about it. Cooooooooome on. Does that make logical sense to anyone? We already know Flynn passed the January 24th FBI interview. To the hack. CNN even accuses RT, Russia Today, a state funded news agency, of even being involved with the hack, without proof: The Russian government-funded news outlet that US intelligence agencies say played a key role in disseminating stolen emails intended to damage the candidacy of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Flynn is forced to register as a ""foreign agent"" because of the media hurricane, even though his agency's work with the firm had been previously known and reported by the media before the election. Flynn`s lawyer explains: Kelner said Flynn registered because his work could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey. Tidbits: Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign government or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department, according to the AP. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the Justice Department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. So what do we have here? Someone(s) hacked into DNC servers and were not detected for a year. The DNC hired a private security firm, CrowdStrike, to investigate. Immediately, fingers pointed to Russia. The FBI was and has never been allowed to independently look at the DNC servers to verify and we know now CrowdStrike has backed away from many of its former claims, even refusing to testify before Congress about the hack. ""Revelations"" about Flynn were things the media had previously reported about. Ask yourself, have no other previous upcoming administration official before an inauguration ever talked with a foreign government official and talked potential policies? Of course they have. Flynn was just recorded and had the conversation illegally leaked by the Obama administration. We have the discovery in spring 2016 of entities that have hacked into DNC servers. The DNC called in a private firm, CrowdStrike, to look at their servers. CrowdStrike immediatly states it's the Russian government. We know that the FBI, which started their own investigation in summer of 2016, was not allowed and hasn't been allowed to independently verify the hack by looking at the DNC servers themselves but took CrowdStrikes report as legitimate and based their investigation off that report. And you have the same media that reported about all the hacks into government agencies in 2014 and 2015 that stated that it was near impossible to identify the culprit and that the government has never confirmed it to be Russia now suddenly either inferring different or blatantly stating that it now was in fact Russia. With no proof. Contradictions galore. We know that a mere 48 hours after the leak of DNC emails by Wikileaks that Clinton's campaign immediately linked the hack and Russia with the Trump campaign, without evidence and before the FBI investigation even started. You have all Flynn's connections with Russia and his companies work with a Dutch consulting firm owned by a Turkish businessman in the media BEFORE the November election. You know, the very stuff the media in January, February and March of this year presented as newly discovered information aka BREAKING NEWS! You have Carter Page in March 2016, BEFORE THE DNC EMAILS WERE EVEN LEAKED, presented as some maybe shadowy figure with ties to the Kremlin. You have Flynn stating last year that he couldn't even tell you what Carter Page looks like, which is months before the media spin about Page and the Trump White House stating they barely worked with Page. You have the phone call between Flynn and the Russian ambassador and the leak about the conversation in the Washington Post. You have Yates and the media spin around her and the unclear logic of her testimony regarding her speaking to White House counsel. Something seems suspect, no?"

Why has the FISA warrants and surveillance of Page stopped? Why was the Dossier the main reason behind the initial FISA warrant when it wasn't proven then and still hasn't been, beyond a few instances of X person did meet with Y person on such and such date?

Then, in a series of exponential ripples, they look at everyone all those secondary people communicated with. And from that pool, they look at everyone those tertiary people contacted. This is called a second and a third hop.](URL Hasn't Page worked with the FBI in the past? Isn't he a member of The Council On Foreign Relations? Who recommended him to the Trump campaign? How can anyone be charged when the FBI never independently verified the actual hack but relied on the findings of CrowdStrike, which was a firm paid by the DNC? Comey admitted to this under questioning from Senator Burr that the FBI never actually independently verfied the hack themselves. Also, what did the hack actually reveal? That the DNC and Clinton campaign were colluding to rig the Democratic primaries against Bernie Sanders, which Donna Brazileformer DNC chair *during* the electionhas verfied. Did the Russians leave IP addresses linking back to Russia? Where's the evidence? Putin is a manical mastermind but left breadcrumbs like simple IP addresses linking easily back to Russia? Why was the Justice Department involved in negotiations with Julian Assange about an exchange of sensitive information for safe passage but when Comey got wind of it and heard that Assange was willing to show them proof it wasn't Russians who gave Wikileaks the DNC emails he quashed the talks? The sensitive information was CIA Vault 7, CIA's hacking and spying tools, including where they can mask themselves as any other nation state. The Russian lawyer in the infamous Trump Tower meeting in summer of 2016 with Don Jr and others met with Glenn Simpson **the day before and the day after** that meeting. Who is Glenn Simpson? The head of Fusion GPS, the firm that the Clinton campaign had hired at the time to dig up dirt on Trump. The Russian lawyer had to get a pass and waiver to even enter the United States. Obama's State Department gave her one. Nothing suspicious about that, right? O, and the FBI had multiple informants/spies into the Trump campaign before the official investigation into Russia and the Trump campaign even started. Why was it treasonous for the Trump campaign to have a meeting with a Russian about possible dirt on Clinton but it isn't treasonous that the Clinton campaign paid Christopher Steelethrough Fusion GPSto talk to Russians about possible dirt on Trump aka the Dossier? O, and several FBI agents who were over both the Clinton email investigation and Russia investigation were caught sending texts stating that they were going to stop Trump from being elected, that they had an ""insurance policy"" against him and mere days after Robert Mueller was appointed Special Counsel were already talking impeachment, effectively prejudging the outcome of the investigation. What if Trump had lost to Cruz or Rubio? The emails would have been released either way. The hack started in summer 2015. You are telling me Putin had the foresight to bet it all on Trump winning not only the Republican nomination but the election itself that far back? And what does ""collusion"" even mean? What, Russia needs help from the Trump campaign to hack into DNC servers? What, the Trump campaign had secret hackers somewhere? You redpill when you find out that.... ...the FBI and in extension our government has never independently verified the DNC hack because the DNC refused to let the FBI have access. A private party paid by the DNC just gave its results to the FBI. ...that Mike Flynn's ties to Russia and his firm's business dealings with a Dutch consulting firm owned by a Turkish businessman were in the news before the election and inauguration. ...the FBI interviewed Mike Flynn on January 24th, before Sally Yates spoke to White House counsel, and he passed all questions asked of him and it was concluded he wasn't being deceptive about his discussions in December with the Russian ambassador. ...that James Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence under the Obama administration, was labeled in the media as Mike Flynn's number one bureaucratic enemy before the Trump administration took office. Clapper was the one who fired Flynn in 2014. Fast forward and Clapper puts in his resignation the exact same day Mike Flynn is chosen to be the upcoming National Security Advisor. Then Flynn's phone conversation with the Russian ambassador is illegally leaked to David Ignatius at the Washington Post by someone in the Obama administration. ...that Sally Yates sole reasoning for being concerned about Mike Flynn was because he could seemingly be blackmailed by the Russian government solely because he lied to Vice President Mike Pence about having spoken about sanctions with the Russian ambassador. Somehow, this decorated general who has been in the upper echelons of government for decades could be blackmailed because he told Pence a fib. Yeah ... logically, it makes zero sense. ...that Sally Yates heard about the conversation between Flynn and the ambassador because someone illegally leaked it to Washington Post journalist David Ignatius who then publicized it on January 13th in an article. This leak of classified information occurred while the Obama administration was still in office. There's a Washington Post [article](URL from August 2015 which regards a suspected cyber attack by the Russian government on Pentagon servers. Within, there's the following: *Even so, officials cautioned that it is difficult to pinpoint the origin or perpetrator of such hacks. Attribution in this business is near impossible. Rarely are you ever able to say with 100 percent certainty who was behind a particular incident, the official said."" The incident follows several other, more destructive cyberattacks on U.S. government networks, including devastating breaches of databases maintained by the Office of Personnel Management. U.S. officials believe hackers working for the Chinese government were responsible for those, which exposed sensitive information about more than 22 million people.* Skip ahead to this July 2016 New York Times [article](URL It is the beginning tendrils of the gossip about Russia and Trump ""colluding"" to hack the servers of the DNC. Within the article: *An unusual question is capturing the attention of cyberspecialists, Russia experts and Democratic Party leaders in Philadelphia: Is Vladimir V. Putin trying to meddle in the American presidential election? Until Friday, that charge, with its eerie suggestion of a Kremlin conspiracy to aid Donald J. Trump, has been only whispered. But the release on Friday of some 20,000 stolen emails from the Democratic National Committees computer servers, many of them embarrassing to Democratic leaders, has intensified discussion of the role of Russian intelligence agencies in disrupting the 2016 campaign.* Also within the article: *Proving the source of a cyberattack is notoriously difficult. But researchers have concluded that the national committee was breached by two Russian intelligence agencies, which were the same attackers behind previous Russian cyberoperations at the White House, the State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff last year. And metadata from the released emails suggests that the documents passed through Russian computers. Though a hacker claimed responsibility for giving the emails to WikiLeaks, the same agencies are the prime suspects.* [A mere 48 hours](URL after the leak of the DNC emails by Wikileaks: *Clintons campaign manager, Robby Mook, argued on ABCs This Week that the emails were leaked by the Russians for the purpose of helping Donald Trump citing experts but offering no other evidence.* Who gave the DNC and Clinton an assessment of who was behind the hack?: *The experts cited by Mr. Mook include CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that was brought into the Democratic National Committee when officials there suspected they had been hacked.* Now let's go back a month to a June 2016 New York Times [article](URL when the DNC hack was initially reported: *One group placed espionage software on the committees computer servers last summer, giving it unimpeded access to communications for about a year. The committee called in CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, early last month after the Democratic Party began to suspect an intrusion.* Also: *Dmitri Alperovitch, a co-founder of CrowdStrike, said he believed that the group that first hacked the committees servers  a group his firm had named Cozy Bear long before the breach  appeared to be the same that downloaded communications in recent years from unclassified email systems used by the State Department and the White House.* Also: *In 2014 and 2015, the effort to clean the State Department systems after those intrusions resulted in several shutdowns, some in the midst of delicate negotiations with Iran. The administration has never confirmed that the Russian government was behind those intrusions, but it has briefed officials on the details in classified sessions.* There's a lot of mixed messaging going on. Now let's go back to July, with this CNN [article:](URL *Federal investigators tried to warn the Democratic National Committee about a potential intrusion in their computer network months before the party moved to try to fix the problem, U.S. officials briefed on the probe tell CNN. The DNC brought in consultants from the private security firm CrowdStrike in April. And by the time suspected Russian hackers were kicked out of the DNC network in June, the hackers had been inside for about a year.* Also, the FBI investigation begins: *Earlier on Monday, the FBI confirmed it was investigating a hack into the DNC, the first acknowledgment from the agency that they are probing the incident, which U.S. officials suspect came from a Russian cyber attack.* Clinton's campaign manager is out in full force, pushing the Russia-Trump collusion narrative: *Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday about that ""changes to the Republican platform to make it more pro-Russian,"" which could provide some of the motive behind the hacks. ""I don't think it's coincidental that these emails were released on the eve of our convention here, and I think that's disturbing,"" he said.* Also: *The FBI and other U.S. agencies involved haven't yet officially attributed the DNC attack to Russian government hackers.* **But evidence gathered by the FBI so far** *points to groups that are known to U.S. counter-intelligence for carrying out intrusions for the Russian government, the officials briefed on the probe say.* Interesting tidbits: *It's possible that other hackers took advantage of the DNC's vulnerabilities and also stole information, U.S. officials said. But the intrusion so far appears to bear the hallmarks of a Russian intelligence operation.* *Foreign spy agencies routinely try to collect information on U.S. elections, and there were some cyber attacks against political campaigns detected during the 2012 election cycle.* This highly informative and exhaustive [article](URL goes into detail why the DNC hack is bogus: *The results of CrowdStrikes investigation were first broken by the Washington Post and then followed up in greater detail by CrowdStrike itself. In a post entitled Bears in the Midst, Dmitri Alperovitch attributed the hack to two distinct and very nefarious Russian espionage groups: Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear, among the most sophisticated cyber-operators CrowdStrike had ever come across. In fact, our team considers them some of the best adversaries out of all the numerous nation-state, criminal and hacktivist/terrorist groups we encounter on a daily basis, he wrote. Their tradecraft is superb, operational security second to none and the extensive usage of living-off-the-land techniques enables them to easily bypass many security solutions they encounter. CrowdStrike followed the protocols for existing APTs. Its investigation of DNC servers turned up two known threat actor groups: APT28 and APT29. Depending on the cybersecurity firm doing the analysis, these two APTs have been called by all sorts of names: Pawn Storm, Sofacy, Sednit, CozyCar, The Dukes, CozyDuke, Office Monkeys. Neither of them has ever been linked by any cybersecurity firm to the Russian government with certainty. Some firms have triedmost notably FireEye, CrowdStrikes bigger and wealthier competitor.* We know the FBI was [never allowed access ](URL to the DNC servers but solely relied on the findings of CrowdStrike. Now let's move ahead to August 2016 and this [article/interview](URL in the Washington Post. Flynn openly gives information about his connections to Russia: *PRIEST: Let me ask me about Russia. There has been a lot in the news about your trips  FLYNN: One in the military [while director of the Defense Intelligence Agency]. I went there on a fully approved trip. I had a great trip. I was the first U.S. officer ever allowed inside the headquarters of the GRU [Russian intelligence]. I was able to brief their entire staff. I gave them a leadership OPD. [Professional development class on leadership] and talked a lot about the way the worlds unfolding. PRIEST: You saw the relationship with Russia as potentially good for the U.S.? FLYNN: No. No. I saw the relation with Russia as necessary to the U.S., for the interests of the U.S. We worked very closely with them on the Sochi Olympics. We were working closely with them on the Iranian nuclear deal. We beat Hitler because of our relationship with the Russians, so anybody that looks on it as anything but a relationship thats required for mutual supporting interests, including ISIS,  thats really where Im at with Russia. We have a problem with radical Islamism and I actually think that we could work together with them against this enemy. They have a worse problem than we do. PRIEST: Tell me about the RT [state-run Russian Television] relationship?* FLYNN: I was asked by my speakers bureau, LAI. I do public speaking. It was in Russia. It was a paid speaking opportunity. I get paid so much. The speakers bureau got paid so much, based on our contract. PRIEST: Can you tell me how much you got for that? FLYNN: No. PRIEST: No? Because you dont want to get your fees out there? FLYNN: Yeah, I dont. PRIEST: What was the gig? FLYNN: The gig was to do an interview with [RT correspondent] Sophie Shevardnadze. It was an interview in front of the forum, probably 200 peopl1e in the audience. My purpose there was I was asked to talk about radical Islam in the Middle East. They asked me to talk about what was going on in the situation unfolding in the Middle East.  The speaking agreement was done before Russian went into Syria, which was actually more interesting to me because  one of my discussions, I talked about the attacks in France  and the negative role that Iran was playing where I thought Russian could actually have a role. The statement that I made was actually: Russia ought to get Iran to back out of the proxy wars they are involved in, to include Syria, so we, the rest of the international community, could settle this situation down. PRIEST: Have you appeared on RT regularly? FLYNN: I appear on Al Jazeera, Skye New Arabia, RT. I dont get paid a dime. I have no media contracts.  [I am interviewed] on CNN, Fox  PRIEST: One more thing about Russia  FLYNN: A lot of people are making this about Russia. Read my book. Youll see what I say about Russia. PRIEST: Let me ask about sitting next to Putin  because thats the symbol. FLYNN: Yeah, I know, boring. PRIEST: But did you think about what the optics would be  FLYNN: Sure. I didnt have any problem. What Im looking for is to make sure, in my view, I see a country that has lost respect for another country and if I have any sort of fiber in my body where I can help out to make sure they understand that we have people in our country who arent going to apologize for who we are. Were not going to act in a soft way for what we believe needs to be done. I was very adamant about what I said. He knows exactly what I said. PRIEST: Did you talk to him personally? FLYNN: No, just introduction. Thats it. PRIEST: The seating arrangements? You didnt ask to sit by him? FLYNN: Nope. I was one of the guests there.  Some interesting characters. I found it a great learning opportunity. One of the things I learned was that Putin has no respect for the United States leadership. Not for the United States, but the leadership.* Carter Page, who is currently under investigation, is even mentioned: *PRIEST: To broaden the discussion on the Russia question a little bit, theres [Trump adviser] Carter Page having business interest and Paul Manafort have business interests there. FLYNN: How about the Clintons?  If thats all you want to talk about, I dont want to do this anymore. PRIEST: But thats not all Im talking about. Im trying to just get it out there on the table. FLYNN: You know what? *I dont know what their business interests are. Ive talked with Paul Manafort, met him, but if Carter Page walked in here, I wouldnt know who he is  you know what? Look at the amount of money the Global Clinton Initiative is taking from countries right now.* The same Carter Page who was extremely open in March 2016 in this Bloomberg interview: *Pages interest in Russia dates to his youth in New Yorks Hudson Valley. Watching a TV news program on arms control talks, he says he noticed that the adviser sitting behind President Ronald Reagan wore a Navy uniform. A few years later, Page enrolled in the U.S. Naval Academy. He later worked in arms control at the Pentagon and completed a fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Over his career, he's earned three graduate degrees, including a Ph.D from SOAS University of London.* **Emphasis should be placed on that this interview was in March 2016, before the DNC leaks.** Let's skip to an [article ](URL the same day, same newspaper as the previous one regarding Flynn: *He has called President Obama a liar, declared the U.S. justice system corrupt and insisted that he was pushed out of his assignment as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency because of his views on radical Islam. The claim has left former superiors seething, including Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., according to current and former officials who said Flynn was removed because of management problems. Like Trump, Flynn has advocated forging closer ties with Russia. In interviews with The Washington Post, Flynn acknowledged being paid to give a speech and attend a lavish anniversary party for the Kremlin-controlled RT television network in Moscow last year, where he was seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin. People went crazy, said retired Brig. Gen. Peter B. Zwack, a former U.S. military attache in Moscow. They thought it was so out of bounds, so unusual. Zwack emphasized that he considers Flynn a patriot who would never sell out his country. Flynn, who was no longer in government but received a DIA briefing on Russia before the trip, said the invitation and payment came through his speakers bureau. He said he used the visit to press for collaboration on Syria, Iran and the Middle East, and dismissed the ensuing controversy as boring. Asked why he would want to be so closely associated with a Kremlin propaganda platform, Flynn said he sees no distinction between RT and other news outlets.* Also: *He has held senior positions in the 18th Airborne Corps, at the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon and at U.S. Central Command, which runs U.S. military operations in the Middle East. Throughout his career, he was viewed as a charismatic and unconventional officer with a talent for mapping terrorist networks  qualities prized by superiors. But his hard-charging approach was at times considered disruptive or undisciplined. Some of Flynns other moves angered superiors. Former U.S. officials said he was scolded after traveling to Pakistan in 2009 or early 2010 and revealing to Pakistani officials sensitive U.S. intelligence on the militant Haqqani network accused of staging attacks on American forces. U.S. officials said that the move was aimed at prodding Pakistan to crack down on the militant group, but that Flynn exposed U.S. intelligence capabilities that only helped Pakistan protect an organization it used as a proxy ally.* *Flynn also came under investigation by the Pentagon because of an allegation that he had inappropriately shared highly classified intelligence with Australian and British forces. Im proud of that one, Flynn said in an interview. Accuse me of sharing intelligence in combat with our closest allies. Please! The inquiry delayed but did not derail Flynns ascent through the ranks. Always pushing for a deeper understanding of terrorist networks, Flynn persuaded Clapper in 2011 to let him form a team to reexamine the materials recovered from bin Ladens compound in Pakistan, searching for clues overlooked by the CIA. In 2012, Obama tapped him for one of the highest positions a military intelligence officer can attain, running the Defense Intelligence Agency. The DIA job is ordinarily a three-year assignment. But early in Flynns second year, his bosses  Clapper and then-Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael G. Vickers  summoned him to a meeting at the Pentagon to tell him that he was being removed. As the search for a replacement stalled, Flynn attempted an end-run around his superiors, appealing directly to the vice chief of staff of the Army to extend his tenure.* **The move infuriated Clapper**, *according to former officials who said the DNI warned Flynn that if he made any other attempt to circumvent the outcome he would be fired on the spot. Clapper declined to comment for this article, but several current and former officials confirmed the account. He characterizes his ouster as a political purge orchestrated by an administration unwilling to heed the warnings he was sounding about militant Islam. Asked for evidence, he said, I just know! adding that Clapper had once told him that the issue behind Flynns ouster was not your leadership, or I would have removed you right away. The decision to remove Flynn was about turbulence and a destructive climate, said a former senior U.S. intelligence official. I dont think anybody in the administration was even aware of his views on radical Islam.* Now let's skip to November, right after the election, in this New York Times [article](URL *The Flynn Intel Group, a consulting firm he founded after he was fired by President Obama as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, has hazy business ties to Middle Eastern countries and has appeared to lobby for the Turkish government. General Flynn also took a paid speaking engagement last year with Russia Today, a television network funded by the Kremlin, and attended the networks lavish anniversary party in Moscow, where he sat at Mr. Putins elbow.* Also: *For example, he has attributed his dismissal from the Defense Intelligence Agency to a pair of consummate insiders: James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, and Michael Vickers, the undersecretary of defense intelligence.* Interesting tidbit: *Hes an analyst who can get deep into the weeds on the issues and a lot of this stuff and then is very good at playing three-dimensional chess, said Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a close confidant to Mr. Flynn. He was the one who called out the administration for being wrong on Al Qaeda.* Now forward, to an [article](URL from Vox days later. *The move will immediately make Flynn one of the most powerful people in the US government and give him enormous influence over the Pentagon, State Department, and CIA  the very organizations he clashed with publicly and privately during his final years in uniform.* Interesting tidbits: *NBC News reported that Flynn personally vetoed candidates like* **retired Adm. William McRaven**, retired Marine Corps **Gen. James Mattis**, *and former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers. In 2012, Flynn proposed overhauling the agency so it would maintain a network of covert operatives to expand its network of overseas spies, according to a long article I co-wrote in Foreign Policy about the fight.* **The move infuriated the CIA**, *which worked hard to stop the creation of what could have ultimately come to rival its larger and better-known cadre of covert operatives. The agency, backed by a network of former CIA personnel in senior jobs at the Pentagon and elsewhere in the national security bureaucracy, succeeded in killing the idea. According to the Washington Post, Flynn tried to salvage his job by sidestepping his superior officers and making a direct appeal to the vice chief of the Army. When Clapper found out, he warned Flynn that he would fire him on the spot if Flynn made another attempt to do an end-run around his bosses, according to the newspaper.* **Clapper, arguably Flynns biggest bureaucratic adversary, announced his resignation Thursday, just hours before** *Flynns appointment.* Admiral McRaven [sound familiar?](URL Then on January 12th 2017 an [article](URL by David Ignatius of the Washington Post included leaked classified information, number one of which illegally disclosed that a phone call was made between Flynn and the Russian ambassador to the United States on December 29th and what may have been talked about during the call. This leak happened a week before the inauguration and the Obama administration was still in office at the time. The article reads, along with many I've quoted here, like political gossip akin to celeb tabloid rags. It should also be pointed out that this leak of classified information occurred alongside the publication of the now infamous Trump dossier/opposition research done by Michael Steele. *According to a senior U.S. government official, Flynn phoned Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak several times on Dec. 29, the day the Obama administration announced the expulsion of 35 Russian officials as well as other measures in retaliation for the hacking. What did Flynn say, and did it undercut the U.S. sanctions? The Logan Act (though never enforced) bars U.S. citizens from correspondence intending to influence a foreign government about disputes with the United States. Was its spirit violated? The Trump campaign didnt immediately respond to a request for comment.* Tidbit: *The FBI and other intelligence agencies have had the dossier, too, since late summer. Their investigation remains open, it appears.* The following day, January 13th, Democrat senator Chris Coons [comments](URL to CNN about the illegally leaked classified information: *Sen. Chris Coons said Friday that it ""seems very suspicious"" that President-elect Donald Trump's pick for national security advisor spoke to Russia's ambassador to the United States on the same day the Obama administration announced sanctions against Russia for alleged hacking during the presidential election.* The same day, New York magazine [reports](URL *On the same day that President Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the U.S. and imposed other sanctions in retaliation for the Kremlins alleged attempts to influence the presidential election, Donald Trumps incoming national security adviser, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, spoke on the phone several times to Russias ambassador to the U.S, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius reports.Whats unclear is why.* The narrative continues. Within the next two months the media suddenly brings back up the previously reported information of Flynn's company working for a firm owned by a businesman who was born in Turkey as if it's THIS SHOCKING BREAKING NEWS INFORMATION! FLYNN IS A FOREIGN AGENT! They bring back the information about Flynn's trip to Russia as if it hadn't been in the public sphere for months. Now, skip ahead to January 24th. From testimony before Congress we know Flynn was interviewed by the FBI that day. We now know the following about that FBI [interview](URL *The FBI interviewed Flynn about the December calls with Kislyak and determined that he wasn't intentionally trying to be deceptive about the nature of what was discussed, according to US officials briefed on the investigation. But investigators have been investigating Flynn's business ties after he left the government and before he joined the Trump administration.* Another [article](URL *Officials said this week that the FBI is continuing to examine Flynns communications with Kislyak. Several officials emphasized that while sanctions were discussed, they did not see evidence that Flynn had an intent to convey an explicit promise to take action after the inauguration.* *U.S. officials said that seeking to build such a case against Flynn would be daunting. The law against U.S. citizens interfering in foreign diplomacy, known as the Logan Act, stems from a 1799 statute that has never been prosecuted. As a result, there is no case history to help guide authorities on when to proceed or how to secure a conviction.* We know now that on January 26th and January 27th Yates contacts White House counsel about Flynn. The media spins the blackmail story regarding Flynn, inferring Russia could possibly blackmail Flynn. We don't know WHY until this month when Yates testifies. She testifies that her sole concern about Flynn and why she contacted White House counsel was that Flynn's conversation with the Russian ambassador in December could be used as blackmail against him by the Russians because he had lied to Pence about it. So her logic is that Flynn, in the military for decades and at the top levels of government for years, could be blackmailed into doing something criminal solely because he lied to Pence about it. Cooooooooome on. Does that make logical sense to anyone? We already know Flynn passed the January 24th FBI interview. To the hack. CNN even accuses RT, Russia Today, a state funded news agency, of even being involved with the hack, without [proof.](URL *The Russian government-funded news outlet that US intelligence agencies say played a key role in disseminating stolen emails intended to damage the candidacy of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.* Flynn is forced to register as a ""foreign agent"" because of the media hurricane, even though his agency's work with the firm had been previously known and reported by the media before the election. Flynn`s lawyer explains: *Kelner said Flynn registered because his work could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.* Tidbits: *Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign government or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department, according to the AP. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the Justice Department rarely files criminal charges in such cases.* So what do we have here? Someone(s) hacked into DNC servers and were not detected for a year. The DNC hired a private security firm, CrowdStrike, to investigate. Immediately, fingers pointed to Russia. The FBI was and has never been allowed to independently look at the DNC servers to verify and we know now CrowdStrike has backed away from many of its former claims, even refusing to testify before Congress about the hack. ""Revelations"" about Flynn were things the media had previously reported about. Ask yourself, have no other previous upcoming administration official before an inauguration ever spoken with a foreign government official and talked potential policies? Of course they have. Flynn was just recorded and had the conversation illegally leaked by the Obama administration. We have the discovery in spring 2016 of entities that have hacked into DNC servers. The DNC called in a private firm, CrowdStrike, to look at their servers. CrowdStrike immediatly states it's the Russian government. We know that the FBI, which started their own investigation in summer of 2016, was not allowed and hasn't been allowed to independently verify the hack by looking at the DNC servers themselves but took CrowdStrikes report as legitimate and based their investigation off that report. And you have the same media that reported about all the hacks into government agencies in 2014 and 2015 that stated that it was near impossible to identify the culprit and that the government has never confirmed it to be Russia now suddenly either inferring different or blatantly stating that it now was in fact Russia. With no proof. Contradictions galore. We know that a mere 48 hours after the leak of DNC emails by Wikileaks that Clinton's campaign immediately linked the hack and Russia with the Trump campaign, without evidence and before the FBI investigation even started. You have all Flynn's connections with Russia and his companies work with a Dutch consulting firm owned by a Turkish businessman in the media BEFORE the November election. You know, the very stuff the media in January, February and March of this year presented as newly discovered information aka BREAKING NEWS! You have Carter Page in March 2016, BEFORE THE DNC EMAILS WERE EVEN LEAKED, presented as some maybe shadowy figure with ties to the Kremlin. You have Flynn stating last year that he couldn't even tell you what Carter Page looks like, which is months before the media spin about Page and the Trump White House stating they barely worked with Page. You have the phone call between Flynn and the Russian ambassador and the leak about the conversation in the Washington Post. You have Yates and the media spin around her and the unclear logic of her testimony regarding her speaking to White House counsel. Something seems suspect, no? Not to even mention that the FBI had known informants/spies inside the Trump campaign and that FBI agents who were over both the Clinton email server investigation and the Russia investigation texting about not allowing Trump to become president and mentioning an ""insurance policy"" against him.

Then, in a series of exponential ripples, they look at everyone all those secondary people communicated with. And from that pool, they look at everyone those tertiary people contacted. This is called a second and a third hop.](URL Hasn't Page worked with the FBI in the past? Isn't he a member of The Council On Foreign Relations? Who recommended him to the Trump campaign? How can anyone be charged when the FBI never independently verified the actual hack but relied on the findings of CrowdStrike, which was a firm paid by the DNC? [Comey admitted ](URL to this under questioning from Senator Burr that the FBI never actually independently verfied the hack themselves. Also, what did the hack actually reveal? That the DNC and Clinton campaign were colluding to rig the Democratic primaries against Bernie Sanders, which Donna Brazileformer DNC chair *during* the electionhas verfied. Did the Russians leave IP addresses linking back to Russia? Where's the evidence? Putin is a manical mastermind but left breadcrumbs like simple IP addresses linking easily back to Russia? Why was the Justice Department involved in negotiations with Julian Assange about an exchange of sensitive information for safe passage but when Comey got wind of it and heard that Assange was willing to show them proof it wasn't Russians who gave Wikileaks the DNC emails he quashed the talks? The sensitive information was CIA Vault 7, CIA's hacking and spying tools, including where they can mask themselves as any other nation state. The Russian lawyer in the infamous Trump Tower meeting in summer of 2016 with Don Jr and others met with Glenn Simpson **the day before and the day after** that meeting. Who is Glenn Simpson? The head of Fusion GPS, the firm that the Clinton campaign had hired at the time to dig up dirt on Trump. The Russian lawyer had to get a pass and waiver to even enter the United States. Obama's State Department gave her one. Nothing suspicious about that, right? O, and the FBI had multiple informants/spies into the Trump campaign before the official investigation into Russia and the Trump campaign even started. Why was it treasonous for the Trump campaign to have a meeting with a Russian about possible dirt on Clinton but it isn't treasonous that the Clinton campaign paid Christopher Steelethrough Fusion GPSto talk to Russians about possible dirt on Trump aka the Dossier? O, and several FBI agents who were over both the Clinton email investigation and Russia investigation were caught sending texts stating that they were going to stop Trump from being elected, that they had an ""insurance policy"" against him and mere days after Robert Mueller was appointed Special Counsel were already talking impeachment, effectively prejudging the outcome of the investigation. What if Trump had lost to Cruz or Rubio? The emails would have been released either way. The hack started in summer 2015. You are telling me Putin had the foresight to bet it all on Trump winning not only the Republican nomination but the election itself that far back? And what does ""collusion"" even mean? What, Russia needs help from the Trump campaign to hack into DNC servers? What, the Trump campaign had secret hackers somewhere? You redpill when you find out that.... ...the FBI and in extension our government has never independently verified the DNC hack because the DNC refused to let the FBI have access. A private party paid by the DNC just gave its results to the FBI. ...that Mike Flynn's ties to Russia and his firm's business dealings with a Dutch consulting firm owned by a Turkish businessman were in the news before the election and inauguration. ...the FBI interviewed Mike Flynn on January 24th, before Sally Yates spoke to White House counsel, and he passed all questions asked of him and it was concluded he wasn't being deceptive about his discussions in December with the Russian ambassador. ...that James Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence under the Obama administration, was labeled in the media as Mike Flynn's number one bureaucratic enemy before the Trump administration took office. Clapper was the one who fired Flynn in 2014. Fast forward and Clapper puts in his resignation the exact same day Mike Flynn is chosen to be the upcoming National Security Advisor. Then Flynn's phone conversation with the Russian ambassador is illegally leaked to David Ignatius at the Washington Post by someone in the Obama administration. ...that Sally Yates sole reasoning for being concerned about Mike Flynn was because he could seemingly be blackmailed by the Russian government solely because he lied to Vice President Mike Pence about having spoken about sanctions with the Russian ambassador. Somehow, this decorated general who has been in the upper echelons of government for decades could be blackmailed because he told Pence a fib. Yeah ... logically, it makes zero sense. ...that Sally Yates heard about the conversation between Flynn and the ambassador because someone illegally leaked it to Washington Post journalist David Ignatius who then publicized it on January 13th in an article. This leak of classified information occurred while the Obama administration was still in office. There's a Washington Post [article](URL from August 2015 which regards a suspected cyber attack by the Russian government on Pentagon servers. Within, there's the following: *Even so, officials cautioned that it is difficult to pinpoint the origin or perpetrator of such hacks.* **Attribution in this business is near impossible. Rarely are you ever able to say with 100 percent certainty who was behind a particular incident, the official said.""** *The incident follows several other, more destructive cyberattacks on U.S. government networks, including devastating breaches of databases maintained by the Office of Personnel Management. U.S. officials believe hackers working for the Chinese government were responsible for those, which exposed sensitive information about more than 22 million people.* Skip ahead to this July 2016 New York Times [article](URL It is the beginning tendrils of the gossip about Russia and Trump ""colluding"" to hack the servers of the DNC. Within the article: *An unusual question is capturing the attention of cyberspecialists, Russia experts and Democratic Party leaders in Philadelphia: Is Vladimir V. Putin trying to meddle in the American presidential election? Until Friday, that charge, with its eerie suggestion of a Kremlin conspiracy to aid Donald J. Trump, has been only whispered. But the release on Friday of some 20,000 stolen emails from the Democratic National Committees computer servers, many of them embarrassing to Democratic leaders, has intensified discussion of the role of Russian intelligence agencies in disrupting the 2016 campaign.* Also within the article: *Proving the source of a cyberattack is notoriously difficult. But researchers have concluded that the national committee was breached by two Russian intelligence agencies, which were the same attackers behind previous Russian cyberoperations at the White House, the State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff last year. And metadata from the released emails suggests that the documents passed through Russian computers. Though a hacker claimed responsibility for giving the emails to WikiLeaks, the same agencies are the prime suspects.* [A mere 48 hours](URL after the leak of the DNC emails by Wikileaks: *Clintons campaign manager, Robby Mook, argued on ABCs This Week that the emails were leaked by the Russians for the purpose of helping Donald Trump citing experts but offering no other evidence.* Who gave the DNC and Clinton an assessment of who was behind the hack?: *The experts cited by Mr. Mook include CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that was brought into the Democratic National Committee when officials there suspected they had been hacked.* Now let's go back a month to a June 2016 New York Times [article](URL when the DNC hack was initially reported: *One group placed espionage software on the committees computer servers last summer, giving it unimpeded access to communications for about a year. The committee called in CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, early last month after the Democratic Party began to suspect an intrusion.* Also: *Dmitri Alperovitch, a co-founder of CrowdStrike, said he believed that the group that first hacked the committees servers  a group his firm had named Cozy Bear long before the breach  appeared to be the same that downloaded communications in recent years from unclassified email systems used by the State Department and the White House.* Also: *In 2014 and 2015, the effort to clean the State Department systems after those intrusions resulted in several shutdowns, some in the midst of delicate negotiations with Iran. The administration has never confirmed that the Russian government was behind those intrusions, but it has briefed officials on the details in classified sessions.* There's a lot of mixed messaging going on. Now let's go back to July, with this CNN [article:](URL *Federal investigators tried to warn the Democratic National Committee about a potential intrusion in their computer network months before the party moved to try to fix the problem, U.S. officials briefed on the probe tell CNN. The DNC brought in consultants from the private security firm CrowdStrike in April. And by the time suspected Russian hackers were kicked out of the DNC network in June, the hackers had been inside for about a year.* Also, the FBI investigation begins: *Earlier on Monday, the FBI confirmed it was investigating a hack into the DNC, the first acknowledgment from the agency that they are probing the incident, which U.S. officials suspect came from a Russian cyber attack.* Clinton's campaign manager is out in full force, pushing the Russia-Trump collusion narrative: *Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday about that ""changes to the Republican platform to make it more pro-Russian,"" which could provide some of the motive behind the hacks. ""I don't think it's coincidental that these emails were released on the eve of our convention here, and I think that's disturbing,"" he said.* Also: *The FBI and other U.S. agencies involved haven't yet officially attributed the DNC attack to Russian government hackers.* **But evidence gathered by the FBI so far** *points to groups that are known to U.S. counter-intelligence for carrying out intrusions for the Russian government, the officials briefed on the probe say.* Interesting tidbits: *It's possible that other hackers took advantage of the DNC's vulnerabilities and also stole information, U.S. officials said. But the intrusion so far appears to bear the hallmarks of a Russian intelligence operation.* *Foreign spy agencies routinely try to collect information on U.S. elections, and there were some cyber attacks against political campaigns detected during the 2012 election cycle.* This highly informative and exhaustive [article](URL goes into detail why the DNC hack is bogus: *The results of CrowdStrikes investigation were first broken by the Washington Post and then followed up in greater detail by CrowdStrike itself. In a post entitled Bears in the Midst, Dmitri Alperovitch attributed the hack to two distinct and very nefarious Russian espionage groups: Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear, among the most sophisticated cyber-operators CrowdStrike had ever come across. In fact, our team considers them some of the best adversaries out of all the numerous nation-state, criminal and hacktivist/terrorist groups we encounter on a daily basis, he wrote. Their tradecraft is superb, operational security second to none and the extensive usage of living-off-the-land techniques enables them to easily bypass many security solutions they encounter. CrowdStrike followed the protocols for existing APTs. Its investigation of DNC servers turned up two known threat actor groups: APT28 and APT29. Depending on the cybersecurity firm doing the analysis, these two APTs have been called by all sorts of names: Pawn Storm, Sofacy, Sednit, CozyCar, The Dukes, CozyDuke, Office Monkeys. Neither of them has ever been linked by any cybersecurity firm to the Russian government with certainty. Some firms have triedmost notably FireEye, CrowdStrikes bigger and wealthier competitor.* We know the FBI was [never allowed access ](URL to the DNC servers but solely relied on the findings of CrowdStrike. Now let's move ahead to August 2016 and this [article/interview](URL in the Washington Post. Flynn openly gives information about his connections to Russia: *PRIEST: Let me ask me about Russia. There has been a lot in the news about your trips  FLYNN: One in the military [while director of the Defense Intelligence Agency]. I went there on a fully approved trip. I had a great trip. I was the first U.S. officer ever allowed inside the headquarters of the GRU [Russian intelligence]. I was able to brief their entire staff. I gave them a leadership OPD. [Professional development class on leadership] and talked a lot about the way the worlds unfolding. PRIEST: You saw the relationship with Russia as potentially good for the U.S.? FLYNN: No. No. I saw the relation with Russia as necessary to the U.S., for the interests of the U.S. We worked very closely with them on the Sochi Olympics. We were working closely with them on the Iranian nuclear deal. We beat Hitler because of our relationship with the Russians, so anybody that looks on it as anything but a relationship thats required for mutual supporting interests, including ISIS,  thats really where Im at with Russia. We have a problem with radical Islamism and I actually think that we could work together with them against this enemy. They have a worse problem than we do. PRIEST: Tell me about the RT [state-run Russian Television] relationship?* FLYNN: I was asked by my speakers bureau, LAI. I do public speaking. It was in Russia. It was a paid speaking opportunity. I get paid so much. The speakers bureau got paid so much, based on our contract. PRIEST: Can you tell me how much you got for that? FLYNN: No. PRIEST: No? Because you dont want to get your fees out there? FLYNN: Yeah, I dont. PRIEST: What was the gig? FLYNN: The gig was to do an interview with [RT correspondent] Sophie Shevardnadze. It was an interview in front of the forum, probably 200 peopl1e in the audience. My purpose there was I was asked to talk about radical Islam in the Middle East. They asked me to talk about what was going on in the situation unfolding in the Middle East.  The speaking agreement was done before Russian went into Syria, which was actually more interesting to me because  one of my discussions, I talked about the attacks in France  and the negative role that Iran was playing where I thought Russian could actually have a role. The statement that I made was actually: Russia ought to get Iran to back out of the proxy wars they are involved in, to include Syria, so we, the rest of the international community, could settle this situation down. PRIEST: Have you appeared on RT regularly? FLYNN: I appear on Al Jazeera, Skye New Arabia, RT. I dont get paid a dime. I have no media contracts.  [I am interviewed] on CNN, Fox  PRIEST: One more thing about Russia  FLYNN: A lot of people are making this about Russia. Read my book. Youll see what I say about Russia. PRIEST: Let me ask about sitting next to Putin  because thats the symbol. FLYNN: Yeah, I know, boring. PRIEST: But did you think about what the optics would be  FLYNN: Sure. I didnt have any problem. What Im looking for is to make sure, in my view, I see a country that has lost respect for another country and if I have any sort of fiber in my body where I can help out to make sure they understand that we have people in our country who arent going to apologize for who we are. Were not going to act in a soft way for what we believe needs to be done. I was very adamant about what I said. He knows exactly what I said. PRIEST: Did you talk to him personally? FLYNN: No, just introduction. Thats it. PRIEST: The seating arrangements? You didnt ask to sit by him? FLYNN: Nope. I was one of the guests there.  Some interesting characters. I found it a great learning opportunity. One of the things I learned was that Putin has no respect for the United States leadership. Not for the United States, but the leadership.* Carter Page, who is currently under investigation, is even mentioned: *PRIEST: To broaden the discussion on the Russia question a little bit, theres [Trump adviser] Carter Page having business interest and Paul Manafort have business interests there. FLYNN: How about the Clintons?  If thats all you want to talk about, I dont want to do this anymore. PRIEST: But thats not all Im talking about. Im trying to just get it out there on the table. FLYNN: You know what? *I dont know what their business interests are. Ive talked with Paul Manafort, met him, but if Carter Page walked in here, I wouldnt know who he is  you know what? Look at the amount of money the Global Clinton Initiative is taking from countries right now.* The same Carter Page who was extremely open in March 2016 in this Bloomberg interview: *Pages interest in Russia dates to his youth in New Yorks Hudson Valley. Watching a TV news program on arms control talks, he says he noticed that the adviser sitting behind President Ronald Reagan wore a Navy uniform. A few years later, Page enrolled in the U.S. Naval Academy. He later worked in arms control at the Pentagon and completed a fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Over his career, he's earned three graduate degrees, including a Ph.D from SOAS University of London.* **Emphasis should be placed on that this interview was in March 2016, before the DNC leaks.** Let's skip to an [article ](URL the same day, same newspaper as the previous one regarding Flynn: *He has called President Obama a liar, declared the U.S. justice system corrupt and insisted that he was pushed out of his assignment as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency because of his views on radical Islam. The claim has left former superiors seething, including Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., according to current and former officials who said Flynn was removed because of management problems. Like Trump, Flynn has advocated forging closer ties with Russia. In interviews with The Washington Post, Flynn acknowledged being paid to give a speech and attend a lavish anniversary party for the Kremlin-controlled RT television network in Moscow last year, where he was seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin. People went crazy, said retired Brig. Gen. Peter B. Zwack, a former U.S. military attache in Moscow. They thought it was so out of bounds, so unusual. Zwack emphasized that he considers Flynn a patriot who would never sell out his country. Flynn, who was no longer in government but received a DIA briefing on Russia before the trip, said the invitation and payment came through his speakers bureau. He said he used the visit to press for collaboration on Syria, Iran and the Middle East, and dismissed the ensuing controversy as boring. Asked why he would want to be so closely associated with a Kremlin propaganda platform, Flynn said he sees no distinction between RT and other news outlets.* Also: *He has held senior positions in the 18th Airborne Corps, at the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon and at U.S. Central Command, which runs U.S. military operations in the Middle East. Throughout his career, he was viewed as a charismatic and unconventional officer with a talent for mapping terrorist networks  qualities prized by superiors. But his hard-charging approach was at times considered disruptive or undisciplined. Some of Flynns other moves angered superiors. Former U.S. officials said he was scolded after traveling to Pakistan in 2009 or early 2010 and revealing to Pakistani officials sensitive U.S. intelligence on the militant Haqqani network accused of staging attacks on American forces. U.S. officials said that the move was aimed at prodding Pakistan to crack down on the militant group, but that Flynn exposed U.S. intelligence capabilities that only helped Pakistan protect an organization it used as a proxy ally.* *Flynn also came under investigation by the Pentagon because of an allegation that he had inappropriately shared highly classified intelligence with Australian and British forces. Im proud of that one, Flynn said in an interview. Accuse me of sharing intelligence in combat with our closest allies. Please! The inquiry delayed but did not derail Flynns ascent through the ranks. Always pushing for a deeper understanding of terrorist networks, Flynn persuaded Clapper in 2011 to let him form a team to reexamine the materials recovered from bin Ladens compound in Pakistan, searching for clues overlooked by the CIA. In 2012, Obama tapped him for one of the highest positions a military intelligence officer can attain, running the Defense Intelligence Agency. The DIA job is ordinarily a three-year assignment. But early in Flynns second year, his bosses  Clapper and then-Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael G. Vickers  summoned him to a meeting at the Pentagon to tell him that he was being removed. As the search for a replacement stalled, Flynn attempted an end-run around his superiors, appealing directly to the vice chief of staff of the Army to extend his tenure.* **The move infuriated Clapper**, *according to former officials who said the DNI warned Flynn that if he made any other attempt to circumvent the outcome he would be fired on the spot. Clapper declined to comment for this article, but several current and former officials confirmed the account. He characterizes his ouster as a political purge orchestrated by an administration unwilling to heed the warnings he was sounding about militant Islam. Asked for evidence, he said, I just know! adding that Clapper had once told him that the issue behind Flynns ouster was not your leadership, or I would have removed you right away. The decision to remove Flynn was about turbulence and a destructive climate, said a former senior U.S. intelligence official. I dont think anybody in the administration was even aware of his views on radical Islam.* Now let's skip to November, right after the election, in this New York Times [article](URL *The Flynn Intel Group, a consulting firm he founded after he was fired by President Obama as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, has hazy business ties to Middle Eastern countries and has appeared to lobby for the Turkish government. General Flynn also took a paid speaking engagement last year with Russia Today, a television network funded by the Kremlin, and attended the networks lavish anniversary party in Moscow, where he sat at Mr. Putins elbow.* Also: *For example, he has attributed his dismissal from the Defense Intelligence Agency to a pair of consummate insiders: James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, and Michael Vickers, the undersecretary of defense intelligence.* Interesting tidbit: *Hes an analyst who can get deep into the weeds on the issues and a lot of this stuff and then is very good at playing three-dimensional chess, said Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a close confidant to Mr. Flynn. He was the one who called out the administration for being wrong on Al Qaeda.* Now forward, to an [article](URL from Vox days later. *The move will immediately make* **Flynn one of the most powerful people in the US government and give him enormous influence over the Pentagon, State Department, and CIA  the very organizations he clashed with publicly and privately** *during his final years in uniform.* Interesting tidbits: *NBC News reported that Flynn personally vetoed candidates like* **retired Adm. William McRaven**, retired Marine Corps **Gen. James Mattis**, *and former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers. In 2012, Flynn proposed overhauling the agency so it would maintain a network of covert operatives to expand its network of overseas spies, according to a long article I co-wrote in Foreign Policy about the fight.* **The move infuriated the CIA**, *which worked hard to stop the creation of what could have ultimately come to rival its larger and better-known cadre of covert operatives. The agency, backed by a network of former CIA personnel in senior jobs at the Pentagon and elsewhere in the national security bureaucracy, succeeded in killing the idea. According to the Washington Post, Flynn tried to salvage his job by sidestepping his superior officers and making a direct appeal to the vice chief of the Army. When Clapper found out, he warned Flynn that he would fire him on the spot if Flynn made another attempt to do an end-run around his bosses, according to the newspaper.* **Clapper, arguably Flynns biggest bureaucratic adversary, announced his resignation Thursday, just hours before** *Flynns appointment.* Admiral McRaven [sound familiar?](URL Then on January 12th 2017 an [article](URL by David Ignatius of the Washington Post included leaked classified information, number one of which illegally disclosed that a phone call was made between Flynn and the Russian ambassador to the United States on December 29th and what may have been talked about during the call. This leak happened a week before the inauguration and the Obama administration was still in office at the time. The article reads, along with many I've quoted here, like political gossip akin to celeb tabloid rags. It should also be pointed out that this leak of classified information occurred alongside the publication of the now infamous Trump dossier/opposition research done by Michael Steele. *According to a senior U.S. government official, Flynn phoned Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak several times on Dec. 29, the day the Obama administration announced the expulsion of 35 Russian officials as well as other measures in retaliation for the hacking. What did Flynn say, and did it undercut the U.S. sanctions? The Logan Act (though never enforced) bars U.S. citizens from correspondence intending to influence a foreign government about disputes with the United States. Was its spirit violated? The Trump campaign didnt immediately respond to a request for comment.* Tidbit: *The FBI and other intelligence agencies have had the dossier, too, since late summer. Their investigation remains open, it appears.* The following day, January 13th, Democrat senator Chris Coons [comments](URL to CNN about the illegally leaked classified information: *Sen. Chris Coons said Friday that it ""seems very suspicious"" that President-elect Donald Trump's pick for national security advisor spoke to Russia's ambassador to the United States on the same day the Obama administration announced sanctions against Russia for alleged hacking during the presidential election.* The same day, New York magazine [reports](URL *On the same day that President Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the U.S. and imposed other sanctions in retaliation for the Kremlins alleged attempts to influence the presidential election, Donald Trumps incoming national security adviser, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, spoke on the phone several times to Russias ambassador to the U.S, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius reports.Whats unclear is why.* The narrative continues. Within the next two months the media suddenly brings back up the previously reported information of Flynn's company working for a firm owned by a businesman who was born in Turkey as if it's THIS SHOCKING BREAKING NEWS INFORMATION! FLYNN IS A FOREIGN AGENT! They bring back the information about Flynn's trip to Russia as if it hadn't been in the public sphere for months. Now, skip ahead to January 24th. From testimony before Congress we know Flynn was interviewed by the FBI that day. We now know the following about that FBI [interview](URL *The FBI interviewed Flynn about the December calls with Kislyak and determined that he wasn't intentionally trying to be deceptive about the nature of what was discussed, according to US officials briefed on the investigation. But investigators have been investigating Flynn's business ties after he left the government and before he joined the Trump administration.* Another [article](URL *Officials said this week that the FBI is continuing to examine Flynns communications with Kislyak. Several officials emphasized that while sanctions were discussed, they did not see evidence that Flynn had an intent to convey an explicit promise to take action after the inauguration.* *U.S. officials said that seeking to build such a case against Flynn would be daunting. The law against U.S. citizens interfering in foreign diplomacy, known as the Logan Act, stems from a 1799 statute that has never been prosecuted. As a result, there is no case history to help guide authorities on when to proceed or how to secure a conviction.* We know now that on January 26th and January 27th Yates contacts White House counsel about Flynn. The media spins the blackmail story regarding Flynn, inferring Russia could possibly blackmail Flynn. We don't know WHY until this month when Yates testifies. She testifies that her sole concern about Flynn and why she contacted White House counsel was that Flynn's conversation with the Russian ambassador in December could be used as blackmail against him by the Russians because he had lied to Pence about it. So her logic is that Flynn, in the military for decades and at the top levels of government for years, could be blackmailed into doing something criminal solely because he lied to Pence about it. Cooooooooome on. Does that make logical sense to anyone? We already know Flynn passed the January 24th FBI interview. To the hack. CNN even accuses RT, Russia Today, a state funded news agency, of even being involved with the hack, without [proof.](URL *The Russian government-funded news outlet that US intelligence agencies say played a key role in disseminating stolen emails intended to damage the candidacy of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.* Flynn is forced to register as a ""foreign agent"" because of the media hurricane, even though his agency's work with the firm had been previously known and reported by the media before the election. Flynn`s lawyer explains: *Kelner said Flynn registered because his work could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.* Tidbits: *Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign government or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department, according to the AP. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the Justice Department rarely files criminal charges in such cases.* So what do we have here? Someone(s) hacked into DNC servers and were not detected for a year. The DNC hired a private security firm, CrowdStrike, to investigate. Immediately, fingers pointed to Russia. The FBI was and has never been allowed to independently look at the DNC servers to verify and we know now CrowdStrike has backed away from many of its former claims, even refusing to testify before Congress about the hack. ""Revelations"" about Flynn were things the media had previously reported about. Ask yourself, have no other previous upcoming administration official before an inauguration ever spoken with a foreign government official and talked potential policies? Of course they have. Flynn was just recorded and had the conversation illegally leaked by the Obama administration. We have the discovery in spring 2016 of entities that have hacked into DNC servers. The DNC called in a private firm, CrowdStrike, to look at their servers. CrowdStrike immediatly states it's the Russian government. We know that the FBI, which started their own investigation in summer of 2016, was not allowed and hasn't been allowed to independently verify the hack by looking at the DNC servers themselves but took CrowdStrikes report as legitimate and based their investigation off that report. And you have the same media that reported about all the hacks into government agencies in 2014 and 2015 that stated that it was near impossible to identify the culprit and that the government has never confirmed it to be Russia now suddenly either inferring different or blatantly stating that it now was in fact Russia. With no proof. Contradictions galore. We know that a mere 48 hours after the leak of DNC emails by Wikileaks that Clinton's campaign immediately linked the hack and Russia with the Trump campaign, without evidence and before the FBI investigation even started. You have all Flynn's connections with Russia and his companies work with a Dutch consulting firm owned by a Turkish businessman in the media BEFORE the November election. You know, the very stuff the media in January, February and March of this year presented as newly discovered information aka BREAKING NEWS! You have Carter Page in March 2016, BEFORE THE DNC EMAILS WERE EVEN LEAKED, presented as some maybe shadowy figure with ties to the Kremlin. You have Flynn stating last year that he couldn't even tell you what Carter Page looks like, which is months before the media spin about Page and the Trump White House stating they barely worked with Page. You have the phone call between Flynn and the Russian ambassador and the leak about the conversation in the Washington Post. You have Yates and the media spin around her and the unclear logic of her testimony regarding her speaking to White House counsel. Something seems suspect, no? Not to even mention that the FBI had known informants/spies inside the Trump campaign and that FBI agents who were over both the Clinton email server investigation and the Russia investigation were texting about not allowing Trump to become president and mentioning an ""insurance policy"" against him. The Russian lawyer of the infamous Trump Tower meeting with Don Jr and others met with the head of the firmFusion GPSthat the Clinton campaign hired to gather dirt on Trump the day before and the day after the Trump Tower meeting.

Was that a moment of desperation from Assange? Or is he really the compromised asset so many claim him to be. I don't think he's dead btw. Too implausible. &gt; A new report claims that Russian hackers altered dates in stolen documents to frame the DNC staffer for the theft. &gt;HisNameWasSethRich and, no, he did not leak stolen DNC info to Wikileaks. A new report shows how Russian military intelligence fueled a conspiracy around the unsolved 2016 murder of the Democratic National Committee staffer, fooling right-wing talk show hosts, journalists, former NSA and CIA officials  to the point that Donald Trump ordered the head of CIA to investigate it. &gt;The report, by investigative British journalist Duncan Campbell, was published on Monday by Computer Weekly, a professional IT online magazine. Campbell asserts that Russian military intelligence, the GRU, manipulated metadata in DNC files that it stole and then released to the public. The GRUs goal in doing so: to give the false impression that the files were not hacked but copied from one computer to another by a DNC insider  Seth Rich  and then given to Wikileaks. The con job was good enough to persuade William Binney, a former technical director at the NSA, to conclude last year that the DNC files werent hacked at all, just stolen from the inside. Binneys name and credibility helped to propel the conspiracy onto Sean Hannitys show and then to the President and the head of the CIA. &gt;To understand how the Seth Rich conspiracy made its way from the backwaters of 4Chan to Langley, you have to go back to June 2016. Cybersecurity company Crowdstrike had just reported that the DNC had been hacked and the culprit was likely Russian intelligence. &gt;In order to throw dust over their trail, the Russians created a fake persona, a supposed lone Romanian going by Guccifer 2.0. It wasnt long before a cybersecurity event organizer in London contacted Guccifer 2.0 through Twitter and invited him to a major conference in September. &gt;The U.S. intelligence and cybersecurity communities have concluded that Guccifer 2.0 was actually the GRU. Obviously, the Russian military officers skipped that fun London conference in 2016. Instead, they sent a PowerPoint deck. One slide, which Duncan reveals in a photo from the conference, pointed participants toward what Guccifer 2.0 claimed was new and useful information from the DNC. &gt;Duncan surmises that the Russian officers knew that the Guccifer 2.0 persona was quickly losing its credibility. They needed to keep attention on the stolen documents and broader influence campaign rather than who or what was behind it. They needed to create a new, plausible explanation for the documents falling into the hands of Wikileaks. &gt;They soon identified a person they could plausibly frame: a former Democratic National Committee staffer named Seth Rich, who had been murdered in Washington, D.C., on July 10, 2016. A victim in the wrong place at the wrong time, Rich wouldnt be able to defend himself. Conspiracies about his death were already growing like mushrooms in the darker corners of Internet chat rooms, easily observable to foreign intelligence. But the GRU needed some way to point to Seth Rich as the data thief. &gt;So they manipulated the metadata  that is, they changed the dates  in some of their stolen files to indicate that they were copied by an insider, not hacked by a foreign nation, and then sent to Wikileaks. The date they encoded into the files was July 5, less than a week before Richs murder. That fact is viewable to anyone who downloads the zip file and uses the password to do it. &gt;Duncan explains: Some 13 groups had then been compressed using WinRAR 4.2. Nine additional files were compressed using 7zip. The archive, called 7dc58-ngp-van.7z, was published in this format, as a single file of 680MBThe files released in London, we found, had first been processed in this way to show timestamps for 5 July 2016. &gt;This dual compression method was unique to the London documents. It was not used in other file dumps released by Guccifer 2.0, WikiLeaks or other publishers of stolen DNC material. The special method used two different file compression systems, 7zip and WinRAR, and required using a four-year-old, superseded version of WinRAR to obtain the required result. The way the Russians did it, the two compression operations appeared to overlap within a single 20-minute period. The tampering may have been done on 1 September, a week before the London conference. &gt;But no one noticed the timestamps in the documents that Guccifer 2.0 gave to the conference. The conspiracy crowd, it seemed, would require some additional breadcrumbs if they were going to behave in the way the Kremlin needed them to. &gt;Jump to June 2017, when a British IT manager and conspiracy theorist named Tim Leonard was running a site called G2.space and operating under the Twitter alias Adam Carter. Leonard received a tip from a mysterious anonymous source allowing him to unlock hidden metadata in the docs from the London conference. He discovered the timestamps within the documents showing that they were copied from one computer to another on July 5 from the northeastern United States. It was all conveniently  consistent with the Seth Rich inside job theory. &gt;From there, a group called Forensicator  Duncan does not elaborate on Leonards association with this group  produces an analysis purporting to prove that Wikileaks documents were copied in the United States rather than exfiltrated from abroad. The evidence was compelling enough to catch the attention of Binney and a few of his former intelligence colleagues, including in the CIA. Binney wagered his credibility on the faulty analysis without fully checking the files. Binney backtracked on much of what he said publicly and admits his previous statements were factually inaccurate in Duncans article. But in 2017, the endorsement from a top former NSA official was enough to get the attention of right-wing talk show host Sean Hannity, and, from there, the President. &gt;Last November, CNN reported that Pompeo, at Trumps urging, had recently met with Binney to discuss the theory. &gt;Duncan elaborated further in a Wednesday interview with Defense One. He said the GRU ultimately revealed their own ruse in their efforts to encode the timestamps and make sure they were seen. You would find great difficulty in preserving those timestamps when you sent them through the Internet. Normal compression methods would not preserve those July five dates. In order to make the dates work, they had to use two different operating systems, he said. They needed to go to an out-of-date version of WinRAR to get what they wanted. That is written into the fileThe method of putting them in two containers was chosen so that the 5 July date would come through. &gt;Cyber security researchers who spoke with Defense One, and who asked not to be named, verified that the theory was probable. One pointed out that duel compression serves no purpose in terms of efficiency. It isnt quite a smoking gun, but it is a highly coincidental series of correlative facts from which any reasonable person could interpret the high likelihood of a causative relationship. There is smoke in the room. There is a gun. There is a person prone to shooting guns with gunpowder on his sleeve. &gt;Special Counsel Robert Muellers July indictments of 12 Russian intelligence operatives who carried out the operation also discuss the timestamp phenomenon, also in an effort, it seems, to lay to rest the faulty inside job theory. The indictments specifically states the date that the DNC files were compressed was on or about April 22 and even points out that the files were later moved via a GRU malware program called X-Tunnel to a server that the Russians were renting in Illinois. &gt;Bottom line: the Mueller indictments disprove the theory that Seth Rich leaked DNC data to Wikileaks in July 2016. Its a theory that was spurred to new heights of perceived credibility because of metadata that was in files that the GRU stole. An anonymous tipster then sent a group of conspiracy theorists a map to find the precisely the information that the GRU wanted them to find. From there, it went to Sean Hannity and eventually to the president and then to the CIA."

Russias guilt is such an article of faith among our political class, that a Republican-controlled Congress imposed [sanctions](URL and President Trump signed on, substantially worsening relations with an important and potentially dangerous nation. &gt;Outside the Acela Corridor, however, one finds more skepticism. &gt;A lot of ordinary folks wonder why the DNC wouldnt let any outside parties examine their server. Instead, the FBI accepted the word of CrowdStrike, a private contractor hired by the DNC, without any independent confirmation. &gt;And a bunch of not so ordinary folks who know a thing or two about computers thinks there may be a simple explanation for the DNCs unwillingness to let outsiders have a peek at the evidence: There isnt any. The Russian hacking thats caused so much division and turmoil at home and abroad never really happened. It was all a ruse concocted by CrowdStrike. &gt;One such skeptic is an anonymous [journalist](URL and computer aficionado who goes by the pseudonym Adam Carter. Carter has spent the last couple of years cataloging [evidence](URL unearthed by himself and others, that CrowdStrike engaged in a disinformation campaign, inventing not just a fake Russian hack but also a fake hacker called Guccifer 2.0. Much, but by no means all, of Carters evidence is technical. And hes unquestionably found an inconsistency in the Russia narrative that ought to raise doubts in even the most computer illiterate congressmans mind. &gt;**Julian Assanges Threat** &gt;But first, why on earth would a private contractor hired by the DNC engage in such tactics? For motive, we need to go back to June 12, 2016, when Wikileaks founder Julian Assange made an announcement that was sure to worry Hillary Clinton and her closest advisers: &gt;*We have upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton . . . We have emails pending publication.* &gt;A little less than three months earlier, on March 19, hostile actors had gotten ahold of all the emails in campaign chairman John Podestas main Gmail account. You may have heard that Podestas emails were hacked, but they werent. There were no faraway cyber-nerds searching for some vulnerability in the DNC network. He fell for a common spear phishing scam. A fake email from Google arrived, saying he needed to change his password and providing a link. The link was also fake. Instead of changing his password, Podesta gave it awayalong with all of his campaign emails. &gt;Whoops! &gt;The Clinton campaign learned of Podestas blunder almost immediately and must have suspected that the emails Assange was threatening to release were his. Moreover, on that date, a lot of the revelations contained therein would have been salientand not in a good way. &gt;Just six days before, with Clinton still 570 delegates short of the 2,382 needed to win the Democratic nomination, the [Associated Press](URL angered Bernie Sanders and his supporters by claiming that shed already won. [The New York Times](URL [CNN](URL [NBC](URL News, [USA Today](URL and The Washington Post all followed suit, declaring Sanders loss a fait accompli. &gt;But it wasnt. &gt;The AP arrived at its numbers by polling unpledged superdelegates, who couldnt vote until the convention and were free to change their minds or even to deceive the AP. &gt;Sanders supporters had been angry about the role superdelegates played in the nominating process for [months](URL [Sanders](URL himself complained about it just one week before Assanges announcement and a day before the media began writing his campaigns obituary: &gt;*My problem is that the process today has allowed Secretary Clinton to get the support of over 400 superdelegates before any other Democratic candidate was in the race.* &gt;The next days headlines prematurely declaring Clintons victory brought Sanders supporters long-simmering anger to a boil. His spokesman blasted the corporate medias rush to judgement: &gt;*Secretary Clinton does not have and will not have the requisite number of pledged delegates to secure the nomination. She will be dependent on superdelegates who do not vote until July 25 and who can change their minds between now and then.* &gt;For the rest of the week, the big election story was whether Sanders would exit the race gracefully and encourage his followers to forgive, forget, and rally round Hillary Clinton. But just 12 hours after Assanges announcement, [Sanders](URL emerged from a meeting with his top advisors, refusing to concede and reiterating his determination not to let the media gaslight his candidacy into a lost cause: &gt;*[W]e are going to take our campaign to the convention with the full understanding that were very good in arithmetic and that we know who has received the most votes up until now* &gt;**The Immensity of Podestas Blunder** &gt;Podestas blunder had the potential to damage Hillary Clintons already precarious reputation with voters regardless of their feelings about Bernie Sanders. In some of his pilfered emails, top Clinton advisors, including [Podesta](URL himself, insulted [her](URL [abilities](URL [and](URL her [ethics](URL commented on her [poor health](URL made disparaging remarks about [Catholics](tldrify.com/qw2), [Muslims, blacks](URL and [Latinos](tldrify.com/qw3), and complained that Clinton wanted [unaware and compliant voters.](tldrify.com/qw1) &gt;Many of Podestas emails also [contradict](URL claims made in defense of the private email server Clinton used as Secretary of State. Others reveal that the FBI investigation into the matter was [anything](tldrify.com/qw7) [but](URL [unbiased](tldrify.com/qw9). At a minimum, the emails prove the Clinton campaign [knew](URL from the beginning that she was breaking the law. &gt;Its easy to forget how serious an issue Clintons private server was on June 12, 2016, three weeks before FBI Director James Comey publicly exonerated her. A few weeks earlier, the State Department had sharply rebuked Clinton for violating department rules, generating unpleasant headlines like, [Hillary Clintons email problems just got much worse.](URL &gt;A June 1 Morning Consult [poll](URL found that about half of voters thought her private email server was illegal, unethical and a major problem, with a quarter of Democrats agreeing. Theres little question that Assanges threat would have made the poll disturbingly salient to Clinton and her top advisers. &gt;But, given Sanders supporters anger and Clintons need for their enthusiastic support to prevail against Trump, her team would have been more concerned about emails revealing her disdain for Sanders supporters and some of their most beloved progressive policies. &gt;For example, Clinton secretly opposed [gay marriage](URL and supported [fracking](tldrify.com/qwf). She and other top campaign officials regularly [insulted](URL Sanders and his supporters. Making matters worse, Podestas emails also revealed that CNN contributor [Donna Brazile](URL gave Clinton at least three questions in advance for her debates with Sanders. And an extraordinary number of emails confirm Sanders supporters suspicions that the [DNC](URL and the mainstream [media](URL were colluding with Clinton to torpedo his candidacy from its inception. &gt;But perhaps the most troubling of Podestas emails would have been those containing passages from speeches Clinton gave to Goldman Sachs and other big money outfits at $225,000 a pop. In these speeches, Clinton [downplayed](URL Wall Streets role in the 2008 recession and [said](URL big money bankers themselves are best equipped to write any necessary legislation. &gt;Clinton in those speeches also [conceded](URL that her economic fortunes put her obviously out of touch with the struggles middle-class voters face. She further [admitted](URL that she has distinct public and private positions on political issues, and [revealed](URL that she secretly favors open borders. &gt;Like the controversy over her private server, Clinton weathered this storm so well that its hard to remember how much her unreleased speeches alarmed Sanders supporters, to whom she was little more than a corporate shill. Sanders had been using Clintons speeches as a [laugh line](URL in his own [stump](URL speeches for [months:](URL &gt;*If youre going to give a speech for $225,000 its gotta be really, dont you think an extraordinarily brilliant speech, I mean why else would they pay that kind of money? . . . Must be a speech written in Shakespearean prose. So I think, if it is such a fantastic speech, the secretary should make it available to all of us.* &gt;To make matters worse, three weeks before Assanges announcement, Clinton released a mandatory financial statement that brought her Wall Street speeches to the forefront of campaign news, yielding headlines like, [How corporate America bought Hillary Clinton for $21M](URL and [The massive scale of the Clintons speech-making industry.](URL &gt;A few days later, reporters even annoyed [President Obama](URL at a G7 summit in Japan by asking him whether she ought to release her speeches. On June 1, just 11 days before Assanges announcement, a [Morning Consult](URL poll had 64 percent of voters saying she should, including two-thirds of independents and almost half of Democrats. &gt;Some readers have likely forgotten the many serious political headaches Hillary Clinton suffered in the week preceding Assanges June 12 announcement and how desperately she needed to placate Sanders angry supporters. If you werent too distracted by the Russia narrative, however, you probably remember some of the above revelations from Podestas emails that would have made doing so impossible had Assange not given Clintons camp so much time to prepare. &gt;By October 7, when Wikileaks finally began releasing Podestas emails, Democrats had been taught to tune them out by angrily reciting the mantras Putin and Russia. CNN told viewers it would be illegal for folks who didnt work for [CNN](URL or some other CNN-approved corporation to so much as look at the emails. Trump couldnt push Wikileaks because doing so immediately rebounded back at him, raising worries he might be Putins puppet, rather than reflecting poorly on Clinton. &gt;**Clinton Uses the Russia Narrative to Great Effect** &gt;Whether Adam Carter is right that the DNC hack was a ruse designed to deflect the damaging Podesta emails, there is no question Clinton and her surrogates were instantly prepared to use it for that purpose. &gt;Within hours of Assanges October 7 release, Podesta made a transparent attempt on [Twitter](URL to tie anything damaging in his emails to insidious Russian interference: &gt;*2. Im not happy about being hacked by the Russians in their quest to throw the election to Donald Trump. John Podesta (@johnpodesta)* &gt;Clinton first publicly addressed Podestas emails 12 days later in her third [debate](URL with Trump: &gt;*But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks. What is really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans. They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions. Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the internet. This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government. Clearly from Putin himself in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election. So, I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this, and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in this election.* &gt;A more transparent attempt to tie Wikileaks, espionage against Americans, Russian government, and Donald Trump to any damaging disclosures that might surface from Podestas emails would be impossible. &gt;So, by October 7 tainting Podestas emails with a Russian provenance was demonstrably the Clinton campaigns go-to strategy. But a Washington Post story about the DNC hack published two days after June 12 Assanges threat on June 12 shows the strategy was prepared much earlier. &gt;**CrowdStrikes Remarkable Announcement and Guccifer 2.0s Debut** &gt;The June 14 Washington Post article is the first time the DNC went public about the alleged Russian hack. It includes the detail that the hackers stole a file of Trump opposition research; which, though no ordinary readers could have known it at the time, would turn up [months later](URL when Wikileaks released Podestas emails. &gt;Indeed, this detail is also the articles big takeaway, as its mentioned in both the lead sentence and the headline: [Russian government hackers penetrated DNC, stole opposition research on Trump.](URL &gt;The story extensively quotes CrowdStrike President Shawn Henry, who previously headed the FBIs cybersecurity division, and Chief Technology Officer Dmitri Alperovitch; all information was provided voluntarily by CrowdStrike and the DNC. According to [Alperovitch](URL they decide[d] to go public with information about their incident and give us permission to share our knowledge. &gt;So, why did the DNC want the world to know on June 14 the embarrassing fact that the Russians had hacked their server and the content of one pilfered file? &gt;[Alperovitch](URL says they wanted to help protect even those who do not happen to be [CrowdStrike] customers. But they must have had a more self-interested motive to justify again publicly connecting Hillary Clintons name to lost emails and unsecure servers while Comeys investigation was still a very serious campaign issue. &gt;Clintons team had to suspect Assange had Podestas emails and knew the Trump opposition-research file was among them. So announcing that the Russians had stolen the file two days after Assanges threat is, in hindsight, either an incredible coincidence or the first step in a strategy to taint the damaging information in Podestas emails with Russian perfidy. &gt;But CrowdStrike and the DNC werent the only ones calling attention to the stolen Trump opposition file. The very next day, a new actor appeared, calling himself Guccifer 2.0, and claiming to be the very hacker mentioned by Alperovitch in the Washington Post story. &gt;And, to prove it, he [posted](URL 230 pages of Trump opposition research on his newly minted [blog](URL and emailed copies to [Gawker](URL and [The Smoking Gun](URL &gt;We are now supposed to think that Guccifer 2.0 was a Russian spy passing documents he hacked from the DNC server to Wikileaks. In fact, this is the only evidence that Russia hacked the DNC besides CrowdStrikes unverified examination of their server. &gt;But if G2 really is a Russian spy, Russia ought to be pitied rather than sanctioned. &gt;When he debuted taking credit for the hack mentioned in the previous days Post, G2 made no attempt to deny he was a Russian spy. Anyone reading his blog post who was also familiar with the Poststory would assume that he must be a Russian spy as it claims. Would a real Russian spy pretending to be something else connect himself to a report outing him as a Russian spy without denying it? Why would he connect himself to such a report at all? &gt;Would a real Russian spy trying to hide his identity end the second sentence in his first blog post with ))), the [symbol](URL that Russians use in place of our lol. G2 [did](URL &gt;And, would a Russian spy working with Wikileaks to discredit Hillary Clinton announce to the world that hes working with Wikileaks? G2s advertising that connection, not denying hes a Russian spy, and using Russian emoticons had the completely predictable effect of tying Assange to Putin and thus discrediting any Wikileaks releases that might otherwise have harmed Clinton. &gt;G2 denied being Russian only after it emerged that he left Russian fingerprints all over the documents he released. Odd enough by itself, given the superb operational tradecraft, [attributed](URL to him by Alperovitch. &gt;But Carter and his intrepid virtual friends examination of the fingerprints revealed that, rather than accidentally leaving them, G2 went out of his way to [plant](tldrify.com/qys) them. &gt;The first evidence of Russian involvement was found within hours of G2s June 15 debut. Someone at Gawker looked at the metadata in the files he sent and discovered the name of the founder of the Soviet secret police written in the Russian [alphabet!](URL No real Russian spy would be so careless. And if we werent so desperate for sensational news, a Gawker reporter finding evidence connecting G2 with Russian intel mere hours after his debut by itself would have raised red flags about the Russia narrative. &gt;G2 also [chose](tldrify.com/qye) to use a company based in Russia to cloak his IP address. Even then, there are plenty of email providers that would conceal the Russian IP. Yet G2, who Hillary Clinton suggested clearly took orders directly from KGB prodigy Vladimir Putin, somehow chose one that didnt. &gt;If G2 had simply done nothing, there would have been nothing connecting Wikileaks to Russia. Instead of doing nothing, he went out of his way to connect Wikileaks Clinton releases to Russian intelligence. Yet, somehow, were supposed to think he was out to hurt Clinton. And, despite [claiming](URL to be Clintons enemy, neither the Trump opposition file nor any of the other files he released with it contained anything [damaging](URL to her. &gt;So a Russian spy intent on getting Trump elected released 230 pages of damaging information on Trump but nothing negative about Hillary Clinton? &gt;Viewed in quick and haphazard slices, G2s debut may look like a collaboration with Putin and Assange. But Russian spies trying to hide their identity dont openly confess to crimes the Washington Post has attributed to Russian spies the day before. &gt;Nor do they use Russian emoticons. &gt;Nor do they reveal their connections to organizations secretly shilling for them. &gt;Nor do they intentionally plant evidence of their identity. &gt;And when Russian spies release 230 pages of negative information about Donald Trump, its Trump, and not his enemies, they are trying to harm. &gt;When we widen our view, the suggestion that G2 is a Russian spy is revealed as a naked insult to the nations intelligence. &gt;**Where Did Guccifer 2.0 Get the Trump File?** &gt;Hindsight together with Carter and crews hard work shows that G2, rather than trying to harm Clinton, worked to manufacture a fake connection between Assange and Russian intel. This fake connection would later be used by Clinton to deflect the avalanche of damaging information in Podestas emails when Assange released them. &gt;The Washington Post headline that the Russians hacked a Trump opposition document from the DNC set the stage. But the article made no mention of Assange or Wikileaks. So, considered alone, it had zero potential to discredit any damaging Wikileaks releases. &gt;G2 forged the crucial link to Assange the next day; by taking credit for the hack and claiming to have turned over the spoils to Wikileaks. His release of the Trump opposition file, which would later turn up when Wikileaks finally released Podestas emails, would also then provide confirmation for his story about being the hacker; and, as a result, strengthen the links between Putin and Assange he was creating. &gt;Absent G2 bringing Wikileaks into the picture, the Washington Post story would have informed voters of an embarrassing Russian DNC hack of some Trump opposition research, without any mitigating way to connect those Russians to Julian Assange, and thereby discrediting him. &gt;So the information released to the Post serves no purpose and, indeed, would harm Clinton, unless CrowdStrike knew G2 would immediately enter the fray and shift attention away from Russian intels breach of the DNC server and towards speculation about Russian intels connection to Wikileaks. &gt;But theres another more conclusive reason to think that G2 had to be working with CrowdStrike and Hillary Clinton. &gt;Remember, on June 15, Guccifer 2.0 emailed a Trump opposition file to [Gawker](URL and [The Smoking Gun](URL and posted it on his [blog](URL But we now know, apart from the Russian fingerprints he planted, the very same Trump opposition file was among Podestas emails when Assange released them four months later. &gt;So, how did G2 get ahold of a file from John Podestas emails? Thats what Adam Carter wants everyone to start asking. &gt;Since G2 manifestly isnt the implacable enemy of Hillary Clinton he pretended to be, its unlikely that he hacked the DNC server as claimed. And, Carter and other experts [say](URL his claims arent technically credible, anyway. &gt;Given how hard G2 worked to discredit Wikileaks, neither is it credible that he got the file through them. &gt;Without the Trump file, G2 might have just been some unconnected third-party trolling Julian Assange. But the fact that G2 possessed a file from Podestas emails seems inexplicable, given everything else we now know, unless G2 is part of a CrowdStrike disinformation campaign to protect Hillary Clinton from the consequences of John Podestas blunder. &gt;The foundations of both Robert Muellers investigation and the sanctions placed on Russia appear to have crumbled into dust. &gt;Lets hope our political class notices.

190,cybersecurity,conspiracy,Trump has just laid the seed for acceptance of Russian manipulation in the 2018 midterm elections.,7,91k6c8,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/91k6c8/trump_has_just_laid_the_seed_for_acceptance_of/,2018-07-25 04:48:15,"With [this tweet](URL in particular the line, ""they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats,"" Trump has now seeded the public consciousness with the possibility of Russian interference in the 2018 midterm elections. So, why is this tweet more relevant than any of the other stuff he says? Back in April of this year, [538](URL ran a speculative piece on the ""worst case"" scenario for the 2018 midterm election. The scenario is explained in this preface: &gt;The following is a rendering of what a worst-case Election Day scenario could look like, based on FiveThirtyEights interviews with voting and cybersecurity experts and state election officials, along with news reports and documents in the public record. I cite 538 here because they're one of the most reputable statistical news outlets in the game right now, and of all the various articles, op-eds, and blog posts written about potential election events, I would trust their reputation over all others. They don't write this type of piece very often (their usual work, if you're unfamiliar, reads less like a journalistic expose and more like an academic journal devoted to mathematics), so when they do it's worth noting. Anyway, Trump's tweet lays the emotional groundwork for exactly the situation that 538 article posits. It doesn't matter if the majority of people see through it as a cheap ploy or distraction, there are enough die-hard Trump supporters out there that this will still put them on track to dispute any election outcome of the midterms that doesn't favor Trump. This is of course coupled with today's news that Congress has decided [not to extend election security grants](URL leading up to the election. It's a strange thing for them to break from Trump's opinion on, given this Congress' voting history and behavior. I believe it's becoming more and more clear that there is an intentional effort by Trump and powerful leaders in Congress to keep election security down while sowing public distrust in the results as a means to keep Trump in power, potentially by enacting emergency measures due to an entirely fabricated ""national emergency"" stemming from Russia influencing the upcoming election. The past two years have been nothing. This is the beginning of the real power grab."
191,cybersecurity,conspiracy,"""Should Reddit ban r/The_Donald?"" - The push to ban more subs is on. Hate speech is the rally cry.",3,96roj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/96roj7/should_reddit_ban_rthe_donald_the_push_to_ban/,2018-08-13 05:37:40,"r/the_donald is public enemy number one on this site. Association with r/the_donald is one of the most used political devices on Reddit. TMOR concentrates most of their focus on r/the_donald and r/conspiracy. The push to dub this sub ""the donald 2.0"" has been as consistent a theme as any since the election. Here's a dailydot article drumming up support for the purge of r/the_donald. r/the_donald is consistently engaged in conspiracy theorizing that is deemed to be nothing more than an alt-right political creation. The most famous of these being the Wikileaks email dumps and the resulting crowdsourcing of the materials. Will the the_donald survive? And if it doesn't, what does that mean for this sub and the site in general? The ban would result in a refugee crisis whose repercussions would be felt through many subs, including this one. &gt;After far-right conspiracy website InfoWars and its founder Alex Jones were banned from several major social media platforms on Monday, Reddits community of dedicated President Donald Trump supporters leapt in defense of the outlet by mounting a campaign to have the government intervene. &gt;While InfoWars has repeatedly been at odds with Facebook and Youtube over its content, culminating in Mondays total ban in violation of hate speech policies, r/The_Donald has repeatedly been the subreddit at the center of this debate over at Reddit. &gt;There is no mainstream subreddit as controversial or provocative as The_Donald, a popular right-wing forum that has made national headlines on multiple occasions for its association with the so-called alt-right. &gt;The subreddit boasts over 630,000 subscribers, arguably the largest active community of Trump supporters online. &gt;InfoWars said on Monday that it was targeted by social media companies for its role in getting Trump elected, but during the 2016 presidential election, it was The_Donald that instigated the hyperpartisan coverage and narratives of right-wing media outlets like InfoWars. &gt;When WikiLeaks published emails leaked from the Democratic National Committee and inbox of former Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, for example, Reddit users on The_Donald as a community began to dig through the information dump for dirt on their political opposition. &gt;The community also led a crowdsourced investigation into the death of Democratic staffer Seth Rich, who was gunned down as he walked home from a bar, propagating a conspiracy theory that the staffer had been killed for being behind the DNC leaks. &gt;Despite evolving into a major hub for the sharing of conservative news and right-wing memes, however, the subreddits association with the far right and promotion of racism, sexism, fake news and brigading has landed it in trouble. &gt;For many Reddit users, the communitys existence alone is proof of Reddits failure to enforce content policies consistent with other social media platforms and that the company is, in fact, wilfully accommodating the subreddit. Reddits CEO Steve Huffman hasnt done much to refute that notion and, in fact, has repeatedly underlined his companys commitment to free speech over policing hate. &gt;In early July, Huffman responded to private messages from user Zachary Swanson, a cybersecurity researcher asking why the company didnt take a harder stance on hate speech. &gt;Hate speech is difficult to define, Huffman wrote. Theres a reason why its not really done. Additionally, we are not the thought police. Its not the role of a private company to decide what people can and cannot say. &gt;When Swanson published the exchange online, his Reddit user account was suspended for one week. &gt;Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have very specific policies on the use of hate speech, policies that they deployed this week against InfoWars. So, while these companies establish and enforce hate speech policies, Reddit has no such policy. Huffman dismissively told Swanson that the companys violent speech policy effectively dealt with hate speech, but admitted back in April to a different user that racial slurs did not violate Reddits rules. &gt;On reddit, the way in which we think about speech is to separate behavior from beliefs, he wrote at the time. Our approach to governance is that communities can set appropriate standards around language for themselves. Many communities have rules around speech that are more restrictive than our own, and we fully support those rules. &gt;So, where does Reddit draw the line? &gt;Well, it appears to draw the line at its policy on content that incites violence, updated in late 2017, which is any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people; likewise, we will also take action against content that glorifies or encourages the abuse of animals. &gt;This led Reddit to ban extreme communities dedicated to sharing graphic images of gore and death and those devoted to sexually obscene material. In October 2017, the company also banned far right subreddits such as r/NationalSocialism and r/Nazi before shutting down white nationalist alt-right subreddits like r/altright and r/alternativeright. &gt;Frustrated users, however, debate that this new policy has been applied inconsistently. Even after one user presenting dozens of instances of incitement to violence on The_Donald, Reddit did not act. Those comments called for the hanging of leftists and murder of immigrants. &gt;Ahead of the Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, a highlighted post encouraged users to attend and march alongside Nazi groups, even if they dont exactly agree, because on the pursuit of preserving  white culture, our goals happen to align. &gt;On another occasion an anti-Muslim post was stickied to the front page of the subreddit, blasting the threat to western culture that is Islam. &gt;Trump famously retweeted a meme that had originated on The_Donald, depicting the president hitting and wrestling a CNN logo. This ignited further controversy with some on the left believing is advocated violence against journalists. &gt;The list goes sins on, but is it likely the company will jump on the bandwagon and take action against The_Donald, as other social media companies have taken action against InfoWars? &gt;No. Not if Huffmans comments are anything to go by. Critics say that Reddits reluctance to ban The_Donald, one of its 20 most popular subreddits, is linked to the enormous amount of traffic it brings to the website and thus advertising revenue. &gt;Huffman remains committed to the idea that it is for readers and users, not the private corporations that mediate our digital public sphere, to decide what to consume and discuss online. The longer he holds to his refusal to prohibit hate speech in defense of free speech, however, the more enraged the debate becomes on his platform."
192,cybersecurity,conspiracy,What Do These 2 Very Obvious Signs Say to You About What's Happening Right Now?,42,8tuwr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8tuwr1/what_do_these_2_very_obvious_signs_say_to_you/,2018-06-26 08:44:42," Here we have two very distinct and very obvious signs from the Universe about Donald Trump and what he is and what he's come to do. [URL The first sign involves 3 books. 2 are children's books that follow a boy named Baron Trump (Donald Trump had a fake name he use to use for press named John Baron or John Barron. His last child is also named Barron Trump). Baron Trump is very wealthy and lives in Castle Trump. He becomes bored with his luxurious lifestyle and ends up in Russia on an adventure that shapes the rest of his life. He is guided by a ""master of all masters"" named Don. He's on a quest to find a ""world within a world"" and the way to find it is told to him in a phrase that he keeps repeating to himself ""The people will tell thee"" He is repeatedly called ""the little Baron"". He has a such a great brain that he'll get so focused on things, he won't notice his entire house is up flames before it's cool. He's quick to anger and show his poiwer. He claims no Trump had ever surrendered and he never would either! The last book of the 3 is called ""The Last President"" From the article: &gt;The story begins with a scene from a panicked New York City in early November, describing a ""state of uproar"" after the election of an enormously opposed outsider candidate. &gt; &gt;""The entire East Side is in a state of uproar,"" police officers shouted through the streets, warning city folk to stay indoors for the night. ""Mobs of vast size are organizing under the lead of anarchists and socialists, and threaten to plunder and despoil the houses of the rich who have wronged and oppressed them for so many years."" &gt; &gt;""The Fifth Avenue Hotel will be the first to feel the fury of the mob,"" the novel continues, citing an address in New York City where Trump Tower now stands. ""Would the troops be in time to save it? &gt; &gt;The Last President doesnt follow the same fictional narrative of Lockwoods previous novels, though the links to Trump are once again abundantly clear. The presidents hometown of New York City is fearing the collapse of the republic in this book, also titled 1900, immediately following the transition of presidential power. Some Americans begin forming a resistance, protesting what was seen as a corrupt and unethical election process. Strangely, he is an outsider candidate said to represent the common man, amid claims he will liberate the people from the bankers - an anti-establishment candidate as Mr Trump was billed as being. [URL The name of this specific episode is called THE END OF THE WORLD. &gt; There was a fifties Western television series (Trackdown) that had an episode called, The End of the World. In this episode, the series main character, Hoby Gilman (played by Robert Culp), visits a town that has been left shook. &gt; &gt;Why has this town been left in such a state of despair? The end of the world is coming of course. &gt; &gt;Why does this town believe this? A man actually named Walter Trump (played by Lawrence Dobkin) rose up out of nowhere and claimed that the world was going to end and that only HE had the power stop it. &gt; &gt;The people immediately fall in line and believe every word that he said. The outsider, Hoby, is the only one to call Trump out on his lies. How does Trump respond when Hoby calls him out? &gt; &gt;Trump actually threatens to sue him. &gt; &gt;The cops of course rally behind Trump. One of them (who is proven to be in on the scheme) asks Hoby rhetorically, Can you prove hes wrong? He then says to Hoby, Its a lot safer to go his way than yours. &gt; &gt;Hoby tries his luck with the local judge who meekly stands by and says there is nothing that can be done. He warns Hoby, Anyone who tries to change their minds might get hurt. Theyre not going to believe you. &gt; &gt;The judge uses an apt metaphor though to at least shed some light on the situation. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Judge: ""Can you prove that's what he really has in mind?"" &gt; &gt;Hoby: ""It's obvious."" &gt; &gt;Judge: ""But can you prove it?"" &gt; &gt;Hoby: ""What if I take him?"" &gt; &gt;Judge: ""On what charge?"" &gt; &gt;Hoby: ""Fraud"" &gt; &gt;Judge: ""Don't you see, he's not exactly guilty of fraud."" &gt; &gt;Judge: ""I live here, I know these people pretty well. And right now, there's nothing in the world that can change their minds. And anyone who tries to is gonna end up getting hurt. They're not gonna listen."" &gt; &gt;Hoby: ""Well what if he starts a panic, it could happen."" &gt; &gt;Judge: ""Sure, you might as well try to spit out a forest fire."" &gt; &gt;Hoby: ""There's got to be some way to stop him."" &gt; &gt;Judge: ""If there is, I don't know it. It's a funny thing. When we were kids, we were all afraid of the dark. And we grew up, and we weren't afraid anymore but it's funny how a big lie can make us all kids again."" &gt; &gt;The story does not stop getting weirder from there. Walter Trump actually calls his device (which is simply a parasol) a Wall that will protect everyone from the outside danger. &gt; &gt;As soon as Trump gets a bit of power, he punished people monetarily for there being a single vocal doubter (Hoby). That frightened people into mob violence. Hoby is attacked for providing any resistance. &gt; &gt;When Hoby finally corners Trump, its revealed that our snake-oil salesmans instincts are to buy people off. The idea clearly conveyed is that most people have been content to just sit back and take his payment in exchange for keeping quiet. &gt; &gt;Hoby continued to resist though and recognized that proving one lie was not enough. Everything had to be a lie for people to stop believing Trump. &gt; &gt;Theres not much in the way of analysis required here. Theres not much in the way of practical advice for people looking to resist Trump. Watching and breaking down this artifact was more just about appreciating the absolute bizarre coincidences. Enjoy? Some more relevant quotes from the episode: &gt;Walter Trump: ""A message I ALONE was able to read in the fires of the universe."" (25 secs) &gt; &gt;Donald Trump: ""I alone can fix it!"" [URL &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Random: ""What are you selling Mr, SNAKE oil?"" (57 secs) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Narrator: The people were ready to believe. Like sheep they ran to the slaughterhouse. And waiting for them was the High Priest of Fraud. &gt; &gt;Walter Trump: ""I am the only one. Trust me. I can build a wall around your homes that nothing will penetrate."" &gt; &gt;Townperson: ""What do we do? How can we save ourselves?"" &gt; &gt;Walter Trump: ""You ask how do you BUILD THAT WALL."" (9:46) &gt; &gt;Hoby: ""You're a liar Trump."" (11:02) &gt; &gt;Walter Trump then starts pointing to the sky and saying ""Look there it is!"" Then other people start saying they see things too when they really don't. They become under Trump's delusion. &gt; &gt;Hoby: ""You're seeing what you want to see. There's nothing up there!"" &gt; &gt;Then Walter Trump, who the narrator calls the High Priest of Fraud, seems to make fire come down from the sky. &gt; &gt;Revelations 13:13 And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth in full view of the people. 14 Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth. &gt; &gt;That beast is also known as the False Prophet &gt; &gt;Someone threatens to kill the one guy telling them the truth while Trump takes all their money. &gt; &gt;Judge: ""Trump is sure having his way. When the town doesn't burn down, who's gonna get the credit?"" &gt; &gt;The one part that totally doesn't jive is they say that Trump doesn't want the credit, he just wants the money. Donald Trump would definitely want both, probably the credit evermore so. &gt; &gt;Hoby: ""You're under arrest Trump."" &gt; &gt;""What charge?"" &gt; &gt;""You write it any way you like. Grand theft, fraud, I think a jury will find it stealing."" &gt; &gt;""How do you expect to prove it?"" &gt; &gt;\*Cue Trump trying to bribe him\* &gt; &gt;Sheriff is revealed to be in on it with Trump and accuses him of trying to split with the money. &gt; &gt;Walter Trump: ""You don't think I'd lie do you?"" &gt; &gt;Sheriff: ""You don't want an answer to that."" &gt; &gt;He then kills Trump because he doesn't want to get exposed due to Trump's arrest and Trump flipping on him. &gt; &gt;Hoby then brings the Sheriff in front of the town to tell them the truth. &gt; &gt;Narrator: ""They wanted to believe him, but they still weren't over the hump. He had to find one crack in their fear. Until the crowd knew that everything Trump said was a lie, there was no hope for him. The con man would always get the credit for saving the town. As long as the parasols (The Wall) were up, Trump was still believed. &gt; &gt;One last odd thing, the first name that pops up during the credits at the end, the first name of the director: Donald Walter Trump in the TV show also makes reference to technology he has the deflect meteorites from space. With the announcement of the space force from Donald Trump, the prevailing idea is that it will be used to keep asteroids away from Earth. So with all of this laid out, what are these very specific signs telling us? In my opinion, it's telling is that Trump is the Antichrist. That doesn't mean the Bible is 100&amp;#37; true or that things will happen exactly how it says it will happen in the Bible, just that we know the nature of which Trump is and it's not good. Referring to Trump as ""the little Barron"" can only mean one thing in my mind. Trump is the little horn from the Book of Daniel. The last king who is not like the others, speaks boastfully and goes to war with the world. The last king of the last kingdom that is made of iron with clay mixed at the feet because it is divided and it has a mixture of people. &gt;**Daniel 2** &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;**31** Your Majesty looked, and there before you stood a large statuean enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. **32** The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, **33** its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. **34** While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. **35** Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth. &gt; &gt;**36** This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king. **37** Your Majesty, you are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory; **38** in your hands he has placed all mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds in the sky. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold. &gt; &gt;**39** After you, another kingdom will arise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth. **40** Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as ironfor iron breaks and smashes everythingand as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others. **41** Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay. **42** As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle. **43** And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay. &gt; &gt;**44** In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. **45** This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human handsa rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces. So that last kingdom sounds a lot like America doesn't it? &gt;**Daniel 7** &gt; &gt;In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he was lying in bed. He wrotedown the substance of his dream. &gt; &gt;**2** Daniel said: In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea. **3** Four great beasts,each different from the others, came up out of the sea. &gt; &gt;**4** The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a human being, and the mind of a human was given to it. &gt; &gt;**5** And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, Get up and eat your fill of flesh! &gt; &gt;**6** After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule. &gt; &gt;**7** After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beastterrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns. &gt; &gt;**8** While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a human being and a mouth that spoke boastfully. &gt; &gt; **11** Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire. &gt;So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things: **17** The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth. **18** But the holy people of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it foreveryes, for ever and ever. &gt; &gt;**19** Then I wanted to know the meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze clawsthe beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. **20** I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fellthe horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully. **21** As I watched, this horn was waging war against the holy people and defeating them, **22** until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the holy people of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom. &gt; &gt;**23** He gave me this explanation: The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it.**24** The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings. **25** He will speak against the Most High and oppress his holy people and try to change the set times and the laws. The holy people will be delivered into his hands for a time, times and half a time. The little horn is the last king of the last kingdom. The Last President. Ram horns were turned into trumpets in those days, Trump-Pence. The Bible even explains why so many people are completely delusional in their support for Trump, especially Christians. &gt;**2 Thessalonians 2** &gt; &gt;**The Man of Lawlessness** &gt; &gt;**2** Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers and sisters, **2** not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by the teaching allegedly from uswhether by a prophecy or by word of mouth or by letterasserting that the day of the Lord has already come. **3** Dont let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness\[[a](URL is revealed, the man doomed to destruction. **4** He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in Gods temple, proclaiming himself to be God. &gt; &gt;**5** Dont you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things? **6** And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time. **7** For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way. **8** And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming. **9** The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie,**10** and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.**11** For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie **12** and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness. Just want to reiterate this specific verse to make the point. &gt;**They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.11 For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie 12 and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.** Now, where is all of this going? The Bible says he will try to make us all take a mark so that we cannot buy or sell with out it. It will be a number of a man. Well each of us has our own number assigned to us at birth, our Social Security Number. With the recent Equifax hack, Trump's White House has concluded that SSN is out of date and we need to figure out new technology. The prevailing idea so far has been using blockchain, the same tech used for Bitcoin. [URL [URL [URL So the problem they are trying to figure out here is where do they store this information on a person? A card can be easily lost or stolen and a phone can be hacked. Well take a look at what this Israeli company has been doing. This article is from 2014 [URL This article is from last month. [URL Their official website [URL &gt; DNAtix has completed the first Proof Of Concept (POC) test by transferring the complete genome sequence of a virus over the Ethereum Blockchain. This test is a key milestone and the company believes that it is the first time that anyone has successfully transferred a DNA sequence over a blockchain. Now, they say they are doing this for the purpose of sharing genetic information anonymously and maybe they are. But all technology that starts out for good purposes will get subverted for evil if it can be. Imagine from the time you are born, you are genetically tied to a governmental financial system for life. It's the enslavement of the entire human population sourced into our very own DNA. Now how is Trump or anyone going to convince people to do this? Well it's been pretty obvious the economy we're in right now is about to burst in the next few years at the most. The global financial collapse will be the catalyst to it but something else will happen to. Trump's Space Force isn't just some dumb idea he has. Someone is in his ear, just like with Reagan. 25 scientists mysteriously died working on Reagan's ""Star Wars"" program. No, there's a reason to be building this. Well take a look at this video from 2001 where a woman warns us about building space weapons and what would happen. [URL So this is all to bring about the fake alien invasion right/ So what happens then and what does this have to do with the mark of the beast? Did you ever wonder what the whole ""Drain the Swamp"" thing was about? It was to psychologically prepare for the NESARA act, which these supposed benevolent aliens will bring about. [URL &gt;Harvey Francis Barnard, a Louisiana graduate in systems philosophy, and an engineering consultant and teacher, created the NESARA proposal during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Jennifer Lee, who used to publish internet NESARA status reports almost daily on her now defunct site, discussed a host of other-worldly and ""interdimensional"" beings who are helping behind the scenes to get NESARA announced. Internet evangelist Sherry Shriner, who operates many websites, sees NESARA as linked to malevolent reptiloid aliens she feels have long controlled the U.S. Government. Trump is a malignant narcissist. He is literally a hollow shell that is fueled by narcissistic supply in pursuit of having his grandiose false self reflected back to him. This is why he watches so much tv. Mostly news about himself. The only way he knows he exists is if he sees an image of himself reflected back to him like a mirror. He has to see the image of how he sees himself, his grandiose false self, reflected back to him or he chastises the mirror and tries to smash it. Since that is the case, manipulating him is very easy. Flattery is one way, especially if you are a dictator because that's who Trump respects. He looks up to them like Father figures. He thinks anyone who isn't dictator-like, is weak and stupid. Which is why he doesn't like Canada and Europe and they have become our enemies now while our former enemies have become our allies. All of the elites, the wealthy, the secret societies, the Deep State, they are just pawns that were used to set up all the laws and the globalization of the world. They are also the recognized enemy of the people aware of the NWO plot and they have used their awareness of them against them. Q has people convinced Trump is the great hero taking down the evil deep state. This is just pro wrestling to bring about the next stage of the plan. Hegelian dialectic manipulation of political events. This has all been set up so Trump can take it over in one fell swoop. Trump has been groomed for this for decades and he was set up to be against Obama. If you look back at his earlier tweets, he actually praises Obama and then someone gave him the information about Obama not being born in America. He first talked about this at a conservative event that he was asked to speak at. After the event, he talked about how amazing the response of the crowd was. The narcissistic supply he got from that, he got addicted to and being the leader of the birthers became his new thing. This set him up to be against Obama and allowed the people who have a pathological hate for Obama (future delusional Trump supporters) to psychologically attach themselves to him long before he ever ran for President. Then they put a pseudo fake Reagan costume on him that checked off every single box of beliefs that a certain type of conservative has (mostly the Fox News watching type). They made him seem like an outsider even though he's been friends with the Clintons for decades, to even further psychologically attach conservatives to him. Trump is just a slave to his grandiose false self and he has to obtain narcissistic supply to fuel it. If you know how to manipulate that, you can get him to do whatever you want. His supporters are literally what is fueling him. If they stop cheering him and coming to his events, he would literally change all of his beliefs in order to get that back. Why do you think he constantly talks about the size of his crowds and his ratings? Without that reaction, he has no idea who he is, he doesn't even exist. Trump will undoubtedly incite all of his supporters to violence once his Presidency is legitimately threatened from the Mueller investigation or he might do it if the midterms don't go his way. He'll claim election rigging or something. What happens next will largely depend on how much the military and police support him but with all the immigrants they are keeping in camps, they are doing that on purpose so there is maximum chaos when the shit hits the fan. An extra 100,000 or so non-white people so the racial aspect ramps up the violence. Cue our power grid and internet being cut off and martial law will be implemented for sure. Whoever emerges the leader after the dust has settled from all of this, they will have complete control of America and it will be willingly given to them by the citizens who are left. If it isn't Trump, I'm guessing people will be clamoring for Obama to take a 3rd term. At that point, everything associated with Trump will be demonized. Conservatism and the Republican party might as well be dead, Christianity will probably be hated because of all the nut bags that believed Trump was from God. Everyone will willingly give up their guns because the 2nd amendment was the only reason the Trump supporters were able to cause that much chaos to begin with. Plus, the tide was already shifting due to using the kids from the Parkland shooting as anti-gun spokespeople. Trump and his supporters were really the last road block to instigating a far left agenda. Trump might just be a way to get them all to show their faces and then lead them to their deaths. With them out of the way, there's nothing left to stop the leftists and the implementation of socialism. In comes hate speech laws, open borders, facial recognition software for all police, more control over the internet due to the ""hack"" of our power grid and systems, a larger nanny state due to influx of immigrants leading to the global financial collapse."

You just have to know how to pluck it out from all the bullshit. This is also an expansion of my other post. [URL Trump's ""Space Force' is not just some dumb idea he has. I think it's foolish to believe that. When Trump repeats certain big ideas, they are never impulsive or his. Someone planted them in his head just the right way and he ends up believing he came up with it. Just like he claims he came up with all sorts of things that he indeed did not. That's the genius of getting people to believe everything Trumps says and to not believe anything the media says or anybody who speaks out against him. Now whoever is really in control of Puppet Trump can filter their ideas through him and everyone follows right along. The Reagan similarities are WAY too eerie to ignore and this space program is just one of many. There's also the fact that 25 scientists mysteriously died over an 8 year period who worked on that ""Star Wars"" program. [URL \[y\]BDA3gGBzMKA\[/y\] This woman named Carol Rosin claimed in 2001 (I think) that there would be an attempt to build weapons in space and a fake alien invasion would happen. \[y\]Eix9mMrPPmE\[/y\] If you look at the information in this link, you'll see how this plan supposedly is playing out. [URL I think it's ALL apart of the plan. Carol's warning included. She's like controlled opposition. I think the alien/spiritual Ascension stuff is probably true but that information will be used against us. There is a ""Great Awakening"" happening and Q anon is attaching Trump to it to try and hijack it and lead people down the wrong path. I'm seeing all sorts of people do this that have good ideas but attach all of this to him. From Candace Owens, Kanye, Dave Rubin to an extent, people in these Ascension/spiritual communities. They all think that since Trump is tearing the whole thing down and people are becoming more aware of the world's evils, that means he must be good. It's a trick, pro wrestling. The awakening is happening by itself. If Trump has anything to do with it, he's making people want to be the complete opposite of him. Trump is here to lead the awakening astray, like lambs to the slaughter. Either that, or he's going to get assassinated or taken out during the coming conflict and Obama will be put back into the presidency and he'll be the one to lead the lambs to the slaughter because of how safe everyone will feel now that Trump and his supporters are gone. &gt;Revelations 17 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;12 The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast. 13 They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast. 14 They will wage war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will triumph over them because he is Lord of lords and King of kingsand with him will be his called, chosen and faithful followers. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;15 Then the angel said to me, The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations and languages. 16 The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire. 17 For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to hand over to the beast their royal authority, until Gods words are fulfilled. 18 The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth. Verses 10 and 11 confuse the fuck out of me but I think I may have found something relating to verse 12. These 10 kings that do not yet have a kingdom and give their authority to kill the Whore of Babylon. Ok so what does this have to do with these 10 kings without a kingdom? Well Carol is trying to get a treaty signed by NINE world leaders. Nine is in all caps in this link repeatedly. [URL \[y\]NWWRf02CgN4\[/y\] Could this be the real ""covenant of many"" that the book of Daniel speaks about? The chapter in Revelations describes what looks like a deal being made with the beast and these 10 kings. They even show the symbol of the UN in the video and talk about getting it ratified through them to make law. Now I'm not sure if it's 10 kings + the Antichrist or its 9 + the Antichrist making it 10 total. But maybe someone else gets added after the initial 9. So lets say aliens do come. What happens next? Take a look at this passage. &gt;Daniel 11 &gt; &gt;37 He will show no regard for the gods of his ancestors or for the one desired by women, nor will he regard any god, but will exalt himself above them all. 38 Instead of them, he will honor a god of fortresses; a god unknown to his ancestors he will honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts. 39 He will attack the mightiest fortresses with the help of a foreign god and will greatly honor those who acknowledge him. He will make them rulers over many people and will distribute the land at a price. I've been researching what it means by saying ""he will honor a god of fortresses (""god of forces"" in the KJV); a god unknown to his ancestors"" and ""He will attack the mightiest fortresses with the help of a foreign god (""strange god"" in the KJV) and will greatly honor those who acknowledge him"". One interpretation is it just means he will basically worship war and strength. Meaning he just loves to go to war. Which sounds like it makes a lot of sense. But where it doesn't hold up is the second part that says ""with the help of a foreign/strange god"". War certainly isn't foreign or strange. Yahweh loved war. And what exactly is a ""foreign"" or ""strange"" god? Especially after it says ""He will show no regard for the gods of his ancestors or for the one desired by women, nor will he regard any god, but will exalt himself above them all"". So I take that to mean that every god that the Earth has ever heard of, the Antichrist will exalt himself above them all. Well what gods are left when you've exalted yourself above them all and what kind of god would you even honor after you do that and think so highly of yourself? A god that is foreign apparently. But foreign/strange to what if all the gods known to the people of the Earth don't apply? You can only conclude these strange gods are from outer space. They would certainly cause you to worship them. Especially if you're the chosen leader that they want to speak to. I've heard this theory as far back as my childhood. The point of the alien invasion is to get everyone to stop believing all of their current religions and follow whatever the aliens say. They'll come promising to help humanity but it will all be a ruse to get you to follow the Antichrist. This is the exact same thing the Ascension communities speak about, except they believe it's not a ruse. And they don't believe in the coming of an Antichrist or an ""End Times"". It's a new beginning, a paradigm shift to a higher consciousness. Apocalypse actually means ""an uncovering""or a disclosure of knowledge or revelation. Paul speaks about the possibility of a ruse being played on humanity here: &gt;2 Corinthians &gt; &gt;3 But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpents cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ. 4 For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the Spirit you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ. 14 And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. 15 It is not surprising, then, if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. Satan masquerades as an angle of light. The people of the Ascension communities claim to be light workers. These aliens, should they come, will no doubt present themselves as beings of light. These Ascension people speak about this a lot and some claim to be in contact with these beings. Even creating rival factions among themselves as to which side are the real good guys and who are the evil ones. It's kind of bizarre actually and hard to sift through all the bullshit to tell who is being deceived and who isn't. These people are obviously in contact with something. That's the conclusion I've come to from reading a bunch of stuff they've said. Take a shortcut and do some DMT if you want to contact some other worldly beings yourself. Now as to what the nature of the contacts is, good or bad? Hard to tell. The website I've been posting links to seems to have the most accurate and evil agenda-free information I can find but the woman who writes it seems pretty off to me. Everything she could be saying could be 100&amp;#37; true just to hook people so she can be used to promote a giant lie when the time comes. What might be this giant lie? NESARA. This is a short passage from this link about how the Ascension community explains NESARA. [URL &gt;The acronym NESARA stands for National Economic Security and Reformation Act. The Act was passed by the American Congress in the year 2000 and never proclaimed, for reasons we will touch upon shortly. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As a program, NESARA can be viewed from several perspectives. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As a spiritually-directed financial program, it traces back to the work of St.Germain and three other ascended masters. That work began in the Fifteenth Century and was designed to provide a new economic system for the world during the present time of transition. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;NESARA is designed to erase poverty and all its attendant ills from Earth during a transitional period preceding Ascension so that the planets sovereign citizens can focus their attention on planetary transformation. Here is what Wikipedia says about it. More relevant info in the link. [URL &gt;National Economic Security and Recovery Act (NESARA) was a set of proposed economic reforms suggested during the 1990s by Harvey Francis Barnard. Barnard claimed that the proposals, which included replacing the income tax with a national sales tax, abolishing compound interest on secured loans, and returning to a bimetallic currency, would result in 0&amp;#37; inflation and a more stable economy. The proposals were never introduced before Congress. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Harvey Francis Barnard, a Louisiana graduate in systems philosophy, and an engineering consultant and teacher, created the NESARA proposal during the late 1980s and early 1990s. He printed 1000 copies of his proposal, titled Draining the Swamp: Monetary and Fiscal Policy Reform (1996), and sent copies to members of Congress, believing it would pass quickly on its merits. Based on a theory that debt is the number one economic factor inhibiting the growth of the economy, and compound interest the number one ""moral evil"" and reason for debt, Barnard made several other attempts during the 1990s to draw political attention to the problems he saw in the US economy, and his suggested economic recovery proposal based on the root causes he determined. After these did not succeed, he decided in 2000 to release the proposal to the public domain and publish it on the internet. Barnard established the NESARA Institute in 2001, and published the 2nd edition of his book in 2005, retitling it Draining the Swamp: The NESARA Story  Monetary and Fiscal Policy Reform. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;After Goodwin began commenting on NESARA, other internet-based conspiracy theorists latched onto it. One supporter, Sheldan Nidle, ties the imminent NESARA announcement into his years-old prophecy of an imminent large scale UFO visitation by benevolent aliens (occasionally on his website reports, but more prominently in his videos, seminars and public appearances). Jennifer Lee, who used to publish internet NESARA status reports almost daily on her now defunct site, discussed a host of other-worldly and ""interdimensional"" beings who are helping behind the scenes to get NESARA announced. Internet evangelist Sherry Shriner, who operates many websites, sees NESARA as linked to malevolent reptiloid aliens she feels have long controlled the U.S. Government. Notice a familiar phrase in there? Draining the Swamp. The use of phrases and group chanting is a common way to open people up to brainwashing and to condition them. Trump even talks about how they (the people running his campaign) wanted him to use the phrase and he didn't like it but people responded to it so he started to love it (""I even started to say it like I actually meant it!""). Gee... Funny how that works with him. All it takes is the response of a crowd to get him to do what you want. Just plant an idea in his head, have him say it at a rally and watch him get hooked on the cheers like a drug. Just like him leading the birther movement was all because he was told to talk about the idea that Obama might not be born in the US and the crowd went nuts for it. From then on, he was hooked on the narcissistic supply he got from talking about it, setting himself up as the adversary to Obama years before he became president and psychologically attaching the pathological Obama haters (future Trump supporters) to him. Think about how fucking outright frightening this is. We have a man, purely driven by the response from a select group of people, being influenced by who the fuck knows to push certain ideas and the response of this select group of people determine whether or not he continues pursuing the idea. This select group of people are, at the same time, being conditioned to ONLY trust this one man and are told that all other sources that speak against him are just lies to try to lead you astray from a promised Golden Age of America. This means that sooner or later, literally anything he says will get the response he needs to feed on and it will just be taken as fact no matter what that what he says goes. Q anon's common chant is ""Where we go one, we go all!"" I wonder where they're all going? Take a look at this list of brainwashing techniques and tell me a lot of this doesn't sound like exactly whats happened to Trump supporters. [URL So back to NESARA. What's so nefarious about NESARA? &gt;Revelation 13 &gt; &gt;16It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, 17 so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;18 This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666. Since NESARA is suppose to be a law that goes into effect all around the world, we can connect these two concepts together and it makes a lot of sense. Now what kind of mark would not allow you to buy and sell if you didn't have it that would be detrimental to your ability to join the Kingdom of Heaven? Since the Bible says whoever takes the mark burns forever in the abyss. Well after the Equifax hack, the White House has openly stated that they are looking for alternatives to Social Security Numbers because they are easily stolen and then you are just fucked.

DNA Block Chain Project Boosts Research, Preserves Patient Anonymity - 2014 [URL Genetic blockchain startup DNAtix releases its first blockchain-based open source DNA compression tool - May 2018 [URL This is the companies official website. [URL &gt;DNAtix has completed the first Proof Of Concept (POC) test by transferring the complete genome sequence of a virus over the Ethereum Blockchain. This test is a key milestone and the company believes that it is the first time that anyone has successfully transferred a DNA sequence over a blockchain. Now, they say they are doing this for the purpose of sharing genetic information anonymously and maybe they are. But all things that start out for good purposes will get subverted for evil if it can be. So how does this relate to 666 and denying your ability to access the Kingdom of Heaven? Carbon has 6 protons, 6 electrons and 6 neutrons, 666. It's obviously the basis for all life on Earth. The number of humanity. One of foundational elements for the material world. Now what would cause a person to be stuck in the material world and not allow them to ascend to heaven? Genetic manipulation of the DNA would be something to consider I would think. It is my opinion that when NESARA is implemented, it will require a genetic marker (Mark of the Beast) to be implemented into people's DNA which will have all their financial information and most likely all their other information too.

197,cybersecurity,conspiracy,Interesting stuff about the CISA bill,5,8c9zku,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8c9zku/interesting_stuff_about_the_cisa_bill/,2018-04-15 05:52:44,"Taken from an old comment of mine. Has not been fixed for formatting, grammar just pasted as it is with slight modifications. Just so you know: when CISPA (yet another similar law) didn't pass in the Senate, people got pissed off and then made a new version called CISA. URL CISA lets companies share cybersecurity threats with the government, and, wait for it, ""other purposes"" - ""*To improve cybersecurity in the United States through enhanced sharing of information about cybersecurity threats, and for* ***other purposes***"" is the ""longer version"", of the title of the bill. While other answers may give their opinions on the matter, I shall quote directly from some parts of the text of the bill/law itself. - ""*include procedures for notifying, in a timely manner, any United States person whose personal information is known or determined to have been shared by a Federal entity in violation of this Act.*"" ELI5: If a government entity accesses your personal information just like that without any reason, it's wrong. I mean, this text says it's wrong, perhaps the real life actions are different! - ""*CONSTRUCTION.---Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to authorize the use of a cyber threat indicator or defensive measure other than as provided in this section.*"" ELI5: You can't say ""hey, but this is also collected for protection against hackers!"" Only data specifically related to cyber-security may be collected, but whether that is actually true or not depends on the rest of the text. - ""*IN GENERAL.---Except as provided in clause (ii), a cyber threat indicator or defensive measure shared with a State, tribal, or local government under this title shall not be directly used by any State, tribal, or local government to regulate, including an enforcement action, the lawful activity of any entity, including an activity relating to monitoring, operating a defensive measure, or sharing of a cyber threat indicator.* ELI5: The government can't use a cyber-threat as an excuse to do whatever it wants to, at least according to the text, but perhaps not the actual actions in real life. - ""*Except as provided in section 108(e), it shall not be considered a violation of any provision of antitrust laws for 2 or more private entities to exchange or provide a cyber threat indicator, or assistance relating to the prevention, investigation, or mitigation of a cybersecurity threat, for cybersecurity purposes under this title.*"" ELI5: Companies can share cyber threat data with each other without it being a violation of a law, which is *not* a good thing if the text, is to be believed to mean what I presume it means. - ""*No right or benefit.---The sharing of a cyber threat indicator with an entity under this title shall not create a right or benefit to similar information by such entity or any other entity*"" ELI5: Companies can't share other information with each other just because they already share some cyber threat information with each other. - ""*are shared in an automated manner with all of the appropriate Federal entities;*"" ELI5: Assuming ""automated"" here means automatic detection of cyber threats, while that may be relatively accurate, sharing information of any kind automatically with the government isn't what you want, is it? - ""*appropriate sanctions in place for officers, employees, or agents of a Federal entity who knowingly and willfully conduct activities under this title in an unauthorized manner.*"" ELI5: The government can't access information whenever it wants to just like that and call it ""cyber threat data"" Or, perhaps this is all just some fake text. Actions speak louder than words, as you may know. - ""*withheld, without discretion, from the public under section 552(b)(3)(B) of title 5, United States Code, and any State, tribal, or local provision of law requiring disclosure of information or records*"" ELI5: I can collect cyber threat information, but nobody said I have to share it with the public. Not a good thing. I'm not saying ""share the methods used by the hackers"", but just share *what* was hacked and *when* it was hacked, and what are its predicted effects on the users of the service that was hacked, etc. - ""*Relationship to other laws.---Nothing in this title shall be construed to affect any requirement under any other provision of law for an entity to provide information to the Federal Government.*"" ELI5: Any other similar law about giving data to the government still applies. I wonder how may of these exist, and what kind of data they talk about.... - ""*(f) Information sharing relationships.---Nothing in this title shall be construed---* *(1) to limit or modify an existing information sharing relationship;* *(2) to prohibit a new information sharing relationship;* *(3) to require a new information sharing relationship between any entity and another entity or a Federal entity; or* *(4) to require the use of the capability and process within the Department of Homeland Security developed under section 105(c).*"" ELI5: Pretty much same as above, i.e this law doesn't prevent other similar laws from being made in the future, and it doesn't modify current similar laws. - ""*(j) Use and retention of information.---Nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize, or to modify any existing authority of, a department or agency of the Federal Government to retain or use any information shared under this title for any use other than permitted in this title.*"" ELI5: The government can only store cyber threat data as permitted under this law, and they can't do whatever they want with it. Or can they, and this is all some fake text? Actions do speak louder than words, don't they? - ""*""Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015*"" ELI5: The *real* deal, hidden behind CISA. Don't even want to quote anything from it, as you can already feel what kinds of ""enhancements"" it brings. Or just one small quote, the one directly below : - ""*(1) IN GENERAL.---Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this section, the Secretary shall deploy, operate, and maintain, to make available for use by any agency, with or without reimbursement---* *(A) a capability to detect cybersecurity risks in network traffic transiting or traveling to or from an agency information system; and* *(B) a capability to prevent network traffic associated with such cybersecurity risks from transiting or traveling to or from an agency information system or modify such network traffic to remove the cybersecurity risk.*"" ELI5: My favorite so far. Eh, in a bad way. The government can hypothetically monitor and ***modify network traffic*** for the so-called ""cybersecurity threats"" tl;dr : This law **lets the government hypothetically** ***modify*** **the websites that you visit.**"

199,cybersecurity,conspiracy,Deconstructing The Almighty Russian Hackers Myth,16,7kc7h1,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7kc7h1/deconstructing_the_almighty_russian_hackers_myth/,2017-12-17 16:42:14,"&gt;Authored by Patrick Armstrong via The Strategic Culture Foundation, &gt;Sometimes things can be made more complicated than they really are. &gt;And such is the case with the story that the Russian government hacked the Democratic National Committee so as to help Trump become president. &gt;In July 2016 Wikileaks released a number of documents showing that the nomination of Hillary Clinton as the Democratic candidate for president had been rigged. A month earlier the DNC had announced it had been ""hacked"" and the cybersecurity company it hired announced that the Russians had done it  one of the reasons they gave was that the hackers had helpfully left the name of the Polish founder of the Soviet security forces as a clue. &gt;Since then, this story has been broadly accepted and it has spun on and on for eighteen months. But it doesn't really make any sense. &gt;Let us pretend that Moscow wanted Trump to win. Let us further pretend that Moscow thought that there was a chance that he could win despite the fact that almost all news outlets, pollsters and pundits were completely confident that he could not. And let us pretend that Moscow thought that, with its thumb on the scale, Trump could make it. And, the fourth if, let us pretend that Moscow decided to put its thumb on the scale. &gt;How to do it? Let us pretend (number five) that the strategy was to try and discredit Clinton. Let us further assume (this assumption is the one that's probably true) that Moscow has very good electronic intelligence capacities. So, we imagine the scene in headquarters as they look for an approach; they quickly find one that is very good, a second that is pretty good and a third area that is worth digging around in. &gt;The Russians would know all about the Uranium One matter where, as even the Clinton-friendly NYT admitted, ""a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation"". It would be very easy for them to package this as a case of Secretary of State Clinton selling US policy for personal profit. Russian intelligence organisations would have a great deal of true information and would find it easy to manufacture material to fill in any gaps in the story. Presented as a case of corruption and near treason, the story could have done a great deal of damage to her. And, given that it had happened six years earlier, all the details would have been known and ready to be used. It would have been a very powerful attack that even the complaint media would have had difficulty ignoring. &gt;We know, and it's very likely that the Russians did too, that she ran a private e-mail server on which there were thousands and thousands of official communications. The server was very insecure and we can assume that Russia's signals intelligence (and everyone else's, for that matter) had penetrated it. Think of all the real material from that source that could be revealed or twisted to make a scandal. That would make quite a campaign. Further, it is a reasonable assumption that Russian intelligence would have some of the thousands of e-mails that were ""bleached"". There would be enough material for a months-long campaign of leaks. &gt;Finally, Hillary Clinton has been in public life for many years and there would have been ample opportunities, and, many would say, ample material in her scandal-plagued career, for the construction of many campaigns to weaken her appeal. &gt;So, a preliminary look would suggest that there were several angles of attack of which Uranium One would be the easiest and most effective. &gt;But, failing that, or as a supplement to that, there was plenty of embarrassing and incriminating material in her illicit private server. &gt;Now we have to pretend (number six), contrary to the universal practice of security organs in all times and places, that the (always assumed in the story to be implacably hostile) Russians would decide to forgo the chance of compromising a future POTUS in favour of a harebrained scheme to get another elected. &gt;But we're supposed to believe that they did. The Russians, the story goes, with all this potential material, with a solid hit with Uranium One, decide instead to expose the finagling inside the Democratic Party structure. And to expose it too late to make any difference. As I said at the beginning, sometimes things are easier to understand when you, as it were, turn them upside down. &gt;In the middle of June 2016 the DNC admits that its documents have been obtained  a ""hack"" they insist  and almost immediately, ""Guccifer 2.0"" pops up to claim responsibility and the DNC's experts (Crowdstrike) claim Russia was behind it. A month passes before Wikileaks releases the first batch of DNC documents showing the extent of the manipulation of the process by Clinton  who had, according to most counts  already secured the nomination about two weeks before. A couple of days before the release, Trump gets the Republican nomination and a couple of days after that Clinton easily wins the Democratic nomination by a thousand-vote majority. &gt;So, the first thing that should have occurred to the observer (but didn't) was, if the Russians had had this incriminating evidence that the Democratic Party nomination had been fixed in Clinton's favour, wouldn't it have been more useful to put it out at a time when Sanders who was, after all, the swindled one, might have been able to do something about it? Instead those supposedly clever Russian state hackers dropped the news out at a time when it made very little difference. No difference in fact: Clinton got the nomination and there was no comeback from Sanders' people. &gt;So, the ""Russian hackers"" made their arrow, shot it, hit the target and... no one cared. The people who devoutly believe in the Russian hacking story now have to explain (but don't) why the Russian state, apparently so determined to bring Clinton down, didn't immediately hit her with the Uranium One documents and anything else they had that could feed the flames of scandal. &gt;But, as we all know, they didn't. While long rumoured, and even briefly reported on, we only learned of Uranium One in a big way in October 2017 and the fact that her server contained Special Access material (the very highest classified secrets) was confirmed authoritatively only in November 2017. If the Russian had really had this sort of information and the hostility to Clinton that we're incessantly told that they had, two years earlier would have been the time. &gt;So, on the one hand we are supposed to believe that the Russian government is so clever that it can hack anything, has innumerable social media trolls that influence elections and referendums around the world (""control the American mind""), drives a ""fake news"" campaign at a fraction of the cost but with far greater effectiveness than the massed legions of the Western media, is a threat to practically everything we hold sacred... but is too stupid to get it right. Possessing great and powerful secrets and a stunningly powerful machine to spread them, it chooses to fire a damp squib too late to make any difference and passes up the chance to have a compromised US president for it to control. &gt;In other words, it's nonsense: we don't really need the forensics of VIPS; we don't need to argue with people who say it's fake news about Seth Rich, or that Assange is a Putinbot, or carefully ignore Murray. Those efforts are useful enough but they're not necessary. In any case, the Russia story is a Gish gallop and a whole academy of wise men and women couldn't keep up with the latest. (Robert Parry bravely attempts to list the most prominent ones from the Vermont power facility, through all 17 agencies to 14th not 4th.) &gt;Just common sense will do it: if the Russians had wanted to bring Hillary Clinton down, they had far more powerful charges which they could have detonated much earlier. It is not plausible that all they had was the rigging evidence and that they then deployed it too late to have an effect. &gt;Or, maybe they're not so all-competent in which case all the other stuff we've had shoved down our throats for months about ""Russian information warfare"" is even bigger nonsense.

Now you are weird if you don't post everything about yourself on social media daily. It is working perfectly. Even if you don't personally participate your family members will. URL URL URL URL URL URL URL In 1962, Dr. Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider formulated the earliest ideas of global networking in a series of memos discussing an Intergalactic Computer Network. Both well-liked and well-respected, he demonstrated an amazing prescience many times over. His original and far-sighted ideas outlined many of the features the Internet offers today: graphical computing, user-friendly interfaces, digital libraries, e-commerce, online banking, and cloud computing. In 1963, while he was serving as director at the U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), it was Dr. Lickliders persuasive and detailed description of the challenges to establishing a time-sharing network of computers that ultimately led to the creation of the ARPAnet. His 1968 paper called The Computer as a Communication Device illustrated his vision of network applications and predicted the use of computer networks for communications. Until then, computers had generally been thought of as mathematical devices for speeding up computations. The ARPAnet was eventually eclipsed by the Internet URL URL In-Q-Tel (IQT), formerly Peleus and known as In-Q-It, is an American not-for-profit venture capital firm based in Arlington, Virginia. It invests in high-tech companies for the sole purpose of keeping the Central Intelligence Agency, and other intelligence agencies, equipped with the latest in information technology in support of United States intelligence capability. Originally named Peleus and known as In-Q-It, In-Q-Tel was founded by Norm Augustine, a former CEO of Lockheed Martin and by Gilman Louie, who was In-Q-Tel's first CEO. In-Q-Tels mission is to identify and invest in companies developing cutting-edge technologies that serve United States national security interests. Origins of the corporation can be traced to Dr. Ruth A. David, who headed the Central Intelligence Agency Directorate of Science &amp; Technology in the 1990s and promoted the importance of rapidly advancing information technology for the CIA. In-Q-Tel now engages with entrepreneurs, growth companies, researchers, and venture capitalists to deliver technologies that provide superior capabilities for the CIA, DIA, NGA, and the wider intelligence community. In-Q-Tel concentrates on three broad commercial technology areas: software, infrastructure and materials sciences. Former CIA director George Tenet says, We [the CIA] decided to use our limited dollars to leverage technology developed elsewhere. In 1999 we chartered ... In-Q-Tel. ... While we pay the bills, In-Q-Tel is independent of CIA. CIA identifies pressing problems, and In-Q-Tel provides the technology to address them. The In-Q-Tel alliance has put the Agency back at the leading edge of technology ... This ... collaboration ... enabled CIA to take advantage of the technology that Las Vegas uses to identify corrupt card players and apply it to link analysis for terrorists [cf. the parallel data-mining effort by the SOCOM-DIA operation Able Danger ], and to adapt the technology that online booksellers use and convert it to scour millions of pages of documents looking for unexpected results.[8] In-Q-Tel sold 5,636 shares of Google, worth over $2.2 million, on November 15, 2005. The stocks were a result of Googles acquisition of Keyhole, the CIA funded satellite mapping software now known as Google Earth. As of August 2006,[needs update] In-Q-Tel had reviewed more than 5,800 business plans, invested some $150 million in more than 90 companies, and delivered more than 130 technology solutions to the intelligence community. In 2005 it was said to be funded with about $37 million a year from the CIA. Many companies listed on In-Q-Tel's investment website page are secret. In-Q-Tel functions partially in public; however, what products it has and how they are used is strictly secret. According to the Washington Post, ""virtually any U.S. entrepreneur, inventor or research scientist working on ways to analyze data has probably received a phone call from In-Q-Tel or at least been Googled by its staff of technology-watchers.""

She's been in office since 96, since then Time Warner, now Spectre, has a monopoly on LA and Comcast on SF and Sacramento. Sonic fiber can't expand anymore, Google can't even upgrade their own internet. The only constant thing during all of this is her. I was shadow banned and all other threads removed. However that is where it stops for Dianne. She has no news on her site about it, last one was May 8th. She has no tweets about it, except maybe 2 in July. Here is her history with NN. I'm on mobile, sorry if I don't fix all the links. I pulled various sources so there is no bias here. This old hag needs to go, she's running a 6th fucking term and now she has someone really running against her that is a threat, especially after Sen. Harris was elected. Are the mods shills/astroturfering/campaigning for Fienstein? URL URL URL URL URL URL URL URL Decide for yourself."
202,cybersecurity,conspiracy,"All Technology Companies are funded, created, or directly linked to the C.I.A. In-Q-Tel , and the Technological Revolution.",16,77tcro,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/77tcro/all_technology_companies_are_funded_created_or/,2017-10-22 00:28:09,"In-Q-Tel is the independent, not-for-profit organization created to bridge the gap between the technology needs of the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) and emerging commercial innovation. We invest in venture-backed startups developing technologies that provide ready-soon innovation (within 36 months) vital to the IC mission. These technology startups are traditionally outside the reach of the IC; in fact, more than 70 percent of our portfolio companies have never before done business with the government. Founded in 1999 as a way for the U.S. to keep up with the rapid innovation in science and technology, In-Q-Tel has been an early backer of start-ups later acquired by Google (GOOG), Oracle (ORCL), IBM (IBM) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). While IQT originally catered largely to the needs of the CIA, today the firm supports many of the 17 agencies within the U.S. intelligence community, including the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate. Their focus on Startups Backed By The CIA is still a prime objective. In-Q-Tel issues a press release every time it funds a new company, but it discloses neither the amount of the investment nor the product its focused on. Its believed that the relationship can lead to the development of off-market products tailored specifically for the CIA. A spokesman for one company funded by In-Q-Tel told Forbes that their investment was focused on a specific project with a yearlong deadline, declining to provide further details. In keeping with the corporatocracy economy, government direct funding or indirect assistance has become the model for startups to chase. Whatever happened to the capitalist formula of raising money from private sector investors for an equity interest in a venture? The rules of the playfield seem to be very different when the end-user and customer for the technology is some government agency. Examine the case experiences described in 25 Cutting Edge Firms Funded By The CIA. Its no secret the Central Intelligence Agency has an investment firm that funds startups that could have a big impact for the Agency. If there is a company out there doing intelligence research, its likely that, the CIAs personal investor, either looked them up or made a check out to them. Its all to ensure that the Agency remains on the forefront of tech. Not long ago, In-Q-Tel invested heavily in a company called Keyhole. Never heard of them? Maybe you know their work, a little project eventually known as Google Earth. In 1994  the same year the Highlands Forum was founded under the stewardship of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the ONA, and DARPA  two young PhD students at Stanford University, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, made their breakthrough on the first automated web crawling and page ranking application. That application remains the core component of what eventually became Googles search service. Brin and Page had performed their work with funding from the Digital Library Initiative (DLI), a multi-agency programme of the National Science Foundation (NSF), NASA and DARPA. Since 1999 In-Q-Tel has been strategically investing in startup companies that are used by the intelligence community. These investments are primarily enterprise software companies. The CIA Library has an in-depth overview of why and how the public/private partnership came to be in the late 1990s. By 2013, these companies have amassed more than $3.2 Billion in venture funding, and employ more than 7,000 people.

a former CEO of Lockheed Martin and by Gilman Louie, who was In-Q-Tel's first CEO.[4][5][6] In-Q-Tels mission is to identify and invest in companies developing cutting-edge technologies that serve United States national security interests. Origins of the corporation can be traced to Dr. Ruth A. David, who headed the Central Intelligence Agency Directorate of Science &amp; Technology in the 1990s and promoted the importance of rapidly advancing information technology for the CIA.[5] In-Q-Tel now engages with entrepreneurs, growth companies, researchers, and venture capitalists to deliver technologies that provide superior capabilities for the CIA, DIA, NGA, and the wider intelligence community.[7] In-Q-Tel concentrates on three broad commercial technology areas: software, infrastructure and materials sciences. Former CIA director George Tenet says, We [the CIA] decided to use our limited dollars to leverage technology developed elsewhere. In 1999 we chartered ... In-Q-Tel. ... While we pay the bills, In-Q-Tel is independent of CIA. CIA identifies pressing problems, and In-Q-Tel provides the technology to address them. The In-Q-Tel alliance has put the Agency back at the leading edge of technology ... This ... collaboration ... enabled CIA to take advantage of the technology that Las Vegas uses to identify corrupt card players and apply it to link analysis for terrorists [cf. the parallel data-mining effort by the SOCOM-DIA operation Able Danger ], and to adapt the technology that online booksellers use and convert it to scour millions of pages of documents looking for unexpected results.[8] In-Q-Tel sold 5,636 shares of Google, worth over $2.2 million, on November 15, 2005.[9] The stocks were a result of Googles acquisition of Keyhole, the CIA funded satellite mapping software now known as Google Earth. As of August 2006,[needs update] In-Q-Tel had reviewed more than 5,800 business plans, invested some $150 million in more than 90 companies, and delivered more than 130 technology solutions to the intelligence community.[4][10] In 2005 it was said to be funded with about $37 million a year from the CIA. In-Q-Tel is a Virginia-registered corporation,[12] legally independent of the CIA or any other government agency. The corporation is bound by its Charter agreement and annual contract with the CIA, which set out the relationship between the two organizations. In-Q-Tel's mission to support the Intelligence Community's technical needs is promoted by the In-Q-Tel Interface Center (QIC), an office within the CIA that facilitates communication and relationships between In-Q-Tel and government intelligence organizations.[13] While In-Q-Tel is a nonprofit corporation, it differs from IARPA and other models in that its employees can profit from its investments. According to public records, In-Q-Tel's principals include or have included: Christopher A. R. Darby, President and CEO[14] Bruce Adams, Legal and General Counsel[14] Michael M. Crow, Chairman of the Board[14] Paul G. Kaminski, Director[15] Jeong H. Kim, Previous Member of the Board of Trustees[16] Investments[edit] Many companies listed on In-Q-Tel's investment website page[17] are secret. In-Q-Tel functions partially in public; however, what products it has and how they are used is strictly secret.[11] According to the Washington Post, ""virtually any U.S. entrepreneur, inventor or research scientist working on ways to analyze data has probably received a phone call from In-Q-Tel or at least been Googled by its staff of technology-watchers.""[11] Software[edit] Keyhole, Inc  Geospatial visualization application (Acquired by Google in 2004 and would go on to become Google Earth in 2005) Boundless Spatial  geospatial software Huddle  cloud-based content collaboration software Oculis Labs  visual cyber security solutions Destineer  games FPS training simulation GeoIQ FortiusOne  visualization on maps Forterra  virtual worlds for training Quantum4D  visualization technology Visual Sciences  real-time visual analysis Spotfire  visualisation data analytics Palantir Technologies  data integration, search and discovery, knowledge management, and secure collaboration PiXlogic  visual search Agent Logic  event detection and response software  Webspector webpage change software ArcSight  secure software Zaplet  email Authentica  secure messaging and secure document sharing Teradici Corporation  desktop virtualization Connectify  Wifi &amp;

203,cybersecurity,conspiracy,A timeline of events relating to Russian corruption and lobbying efforts,2,752b22,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/752b22/a_timeline_of_events_relating_to_russian/,2017-10-09 02:29:13,"I started putting this timeline together as well as a few paragraphs of info on major players as I was reading to contextualize and condense a range of information. Some of it has to do with the Trump/Russia investigation, some of it has to do with the Magnitsky Act, some to do with Ukraine and Montenegro, and some of it goes farther back, to Russian efforts to influence John McCain and presidential candidate Bob Dole through the use of the lobbbying firm Davis Manafort. It's just a big soup pot of information really but some of you might find it interesting so I thought I'd share. I may put the ""cast of characters"" so to speak in the comments since it is a bit long. Hope the formatting sticks. :) 1996 Paul Manafort and Rick Davis played a key role in Bob Dole's failed presidential run 1997 Blackwater USA was formed in 1997, by Al Clark and Erik Prince in North Carolina, to provide training support to military and law enforcement organizations. 1998 Felix Sater had pled guilty to stock racketeering and fraud as part of a US and Russian mafia-connected $40 million stock pump and dump scheme. He worked with the CIA and the FBI, allegedly offering information on a black market for Stingermissiles. Sater later worked as a senior advisor to Trump. 2000 February 17 Roman Abramovich attended a meeting in Moscow that would transform his business portfolio and send a man already seriously rich into the league of the Russian super-rich. On one side of the table was Oleg Deripaska and Lev Chernoi, and on the other Roman Abramovich and Iskander Makhmudov. The outcome of the meeting was a mega-deal, the like of which Russia had not seen before. It resulted in the creation of Russian Aluminium, a national champion that would become Russia's largest and the world's third-largest aluminium company. 2000 March following the Russian presidential election in March 2000, Boris Berezovsky went into opposition and resigned from the Duma. After he moved to Britain, the government took over his television assets, and he divested from other Russian holdings. 2000 October Montenegro was the smallest of the former Yugoslavias six republics. When Slobodan Milosevic was overthrown in October 2000, Montenegros longtime strongman, Milo Djukanovic, figured the West would reward him by supporting his push for independence. But the European Union and the United States opposed Montenegros secession, which they feared would undermine the new, pro-Western leaders in Serbia and bring more war. So under heavy pressure from the EU, an agreement was struck in 2002 putting off an independence referendum for at least three years. 2001 Kazakh businessman Tevfik Arif founded Bayrock Group, an international real estate development and investment company based in New York. 2001 Failed 1996 presidential candidate Bob Dole has been paid $1.38 million by the Montenegrin government since 2001 to lobby for it in Washington, urging his Montenegrin friends to hire Rick Hannah Davis, Paul Manafort's business partner in the lobbying firm Davis Manafort. 2001 about a year after Putin signed a decree granting legal immunity to Yeltsins family, Oleg Deripaska married Yeltsins granddaughter, thereby cementing his own immunity and power. 2002 under heavy pressure from the EU, an agreement was struck in 2002 putting off an independence referendum for Montenegro for at least three years. 2003 Tevfik Arif hired Russian businessman Felix Sater as managing director of Bayrock in 2003. Sater became Bayrock's Chief Operating Officer, and assisted with several projects, including management of the Trump SoHo project. 2003 Deripaska hired former presidential candidate Bob Dole, who had nearly picked McCain as his running mate, and Doles lobbying partner Bruce Jackson (also a McCain aide) to lobby the State Department to overturn his visa ban, according to Glenn Simpson and Mary Jacoby of the Wall Street Journal. 2004 December Ukrainians poured into the streets of Kiev and other cities in the peaceful Orange Revolution, which overthrew a Putin-backed corrupt leader, Viktor Yanukovich, who had tried to steal the countrys presidential election that year (during which the pro-Western opposition candidate, Viktor Yushchenko, was poisoned and almost died). Paul Manafort was Yanukovich's campaign manager til then. 2005 Donald Trump extended the Bayrock Group a one-year deal to develop a project in Moscow. Sater located Russian investors and a potential site for the high-rise, a closed pencil factory named for Sacco and Vanzetti. Sater said, ""We looked at some very, very large properties in Russia,"" on the scale of ""...a large Vegas high-rise."" 2005 the biggest Montenegrin industrial asset, the KAP aluminum plant, was snatched up by Deripaska at Putins request after Milan Rocen (closest ally and mentor to Milo Djukanovic, longtime Montenegro strongman) nurtured ties to Putins Russia 2005 September the former president of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk accused Berezovsky of having financed Viktor Yushchenko's 2004 Ukrainian presidential election campaign, and provided copies of documents showing money transfers from companies he claimed were controlled by Berezovsky to companies controlled by Yuschenko's official backers. Berezovsky confirmed that he met Yushchenko's representatives in London before the election, and that the money was transferred from his companies, but he refused to confirm or deny that the companies that received the money were used in Yushchenko's campaign. 2005 November 13 was flying into Moscow from a weekend away, Bill Browder was stopped at Sheremetyevo airport, detained for 15 hours, deported, and declared a threat to national security, allegedly because Putin would not tolerate anti corruption activities. 2005 December Deripaska was issued a multientry US visa, according to the State Department. During his brief stay he signed his World Bank loan, spoke at a Carnegie Endowment meeting and attended a dinner for Harvard Universitys Belfer Center, where, thanks to a generous donation, he became a member of its international council. The visa was later revoked in 2006. 2006 attack on US Marines in Ukraine. Joint NATO Ukrainian exercise interrupted by protesters. 2006 January Rick Hannah Davis introduced Deripaska to McCain at a villa in Davos, Switzerland. They met again seven months later, at a reception in Montenegro celebrating McCains birthday, as reported in the Washington Post 2006 Rick Davis turned to Deripaska emissary Nathaniel Rothschild (Rothschild has reportedly become the richest of all the Rothschilds, thanks to his privileged role as a Deripaska adviser). After arriving in his private Gulfstream jet, Rothschild was trotted out before the cameras with the Montenegrin prime minister, where he pledged $1 million to support students who might be hurt by Serbias scholarship threat to revoke scholarships. 2006 Canadian billionaire Peter Munk, CEO of Barrick Gold, the worlds largest gold-mining corporation (it was Munk who had hosted the Davos meeting between McCain and Deripaska a few months earlier). Munk, who serves on the advisory board of RusAl, delivered pledges of support from Canadian universities to Montenegro students alienated by Serbia's threat to revoke scholarships. 2006 Rick Davis and his lobbying firm, Davis Manafort, received several million dollars to help run Montenegros independence referendum campaign of 2006. Rick Davis was John McCain's campaign chairman. The takeover of Montenegro has been a Russian geostrategic victoryquietly accomplished, paradoxically enough, with the help of McCain and his top aides. 2006 March Yanukovichs disgraced party won a resounding victory in the March 2006 electionsand Rinat Akhmetov returned as the top Ukrainian oligarch. according to Ukrainian investigative journalist Mustafa Nayem, Akhmetov paid Manafort upward of $3 million). 2006 April Failed presidential candidate Bob Dole was lobbying McCain to promote Montenegros independence. Doles aides held a teleconference with McCains Senate office when Montenegros foreign minister visited Washington; shortly thereafter, the referendum passed by a razor-thin 0.5 percent. In April 2006 McCain announced that Montenegros independence was the greatest European democracy project since the end of the cold war. Despite opposition cries of vote rigging, the United States and other major powers accepted the resultsand Putins Russia recognized newly independent Montenegro before the EU did. 2006 A few months after the vote for Montenegro independence, McCain and a contingent of GOP senators visited Montenegro. The day before they arrived, Milo Djukanovic had flown to Putins dacha on the Black Sea. Your government made it possible for large-scale Russian investments, Putin told the Montenegrin leader. Djukanovic then returned to Montenegro and warmly received McCain, who also met with the Montenegrin president, speaker of Parliament and opposition leader Predrag Bulatovic. Bulatovic told McCain about how Russian capital was taking over the country and of his concern that this investment can have a negative impact on the democratic process. McCain listened but kept criticism of Russia to himself. 2006 That summer 2006 Nathaniel Rothschild started discussions with top Montenegrin officials about gaining control of the valuable shoreline, including the half-billion-dollar Porto Montenegro project, which aims to become the worlds top mega-yacht marina, complete with luxury hotels, shopping and the countrys first eighteen-hole golf course. The property was handed to the Munk-Rothschild-fronted offshore consortium for a pittance, according to MANS, the local NGO partner of Transparency International, in yet another backroom deal. 2006 November Alexander Litvinenko, one of Boris Berezovsky's closest associates, was murdered in London in November 2006 with a rare radioactive poison, Polonium 210. The British authorities charged a former FSB officer and head of security at ORT, Andrey Lugovoy, with the murder and requested his extradition, which Russia refused. 2007 Blackwater guards were accused - and later criminally convicted - of killing civilians in a crowded Iraqi square. Founder Erik Prince sold the firm, which was subsequently re-branded, but has continued building a private paramilitary empire with contracts across the Middle East and Asia. He now heads a Hong Kong-based company known as the Frontier Services Group. 2007 Bayrock organized a potential deal in Moscow between Trump International Hotel and Russian investors, but the deal never came to fruition. Bayrock traded future profits from Trump SoHo and other projects in exchange for $50 million in financing from Icelandic company FL Group. The arrangement led Bayrock's finance director to file racketeering lawsuits, alleging that money was diverted to people outside the company, including Salvatore Lauria, an associate of Felix Sater's 2007 Jared Kushner, head of Kushner Companies, paid $1.8 billion to purchase Manhattan office building. 2007 June Bill Browder's company Hermitage's corporate documents were stolen by crooked police officers in the Russian Interior Ministry. the documents that had been taken by the Russian police were used to forge a change in ownership. The thieves then used forged contracts to claim Hermitage owed $1 billion to shell companies. Unbeknownst to Hermitage, those claims were later authenticated by judges. In every instance, lawyers hired by the thieves to represent Hermitage (unbeknownst to Hermitage) pleaded guilty on the company's behalf and agreed to the claims, thereby obtaining judgments for debts that did not exist; all while Hermitage was unaware of these court proceedings. 2007 September Berezovsky launched lawsuits against two Ukrainian politicians, Oleksandr Tretyakov, a former presidential aid, and David Zhvaniya, a former emergencies minister. Berezovsky was suing the men for nearly US$23 million, accusing them of misusing the money he had allocated in 2004 to fund the Orange Revolution. Yushchenko has denied Berezovsky financed his election campaign. 2007 Christmas Eve The group supposedly used the stolen documents to re-register three of Hermitage's subsidiary companies. Third party companies also owned by Klyuev then ""sued"" those stolen subsidiaries.Judges found in every case in the plaintiff's favor. And with the aid of complicit tax officers in Moscow, this group was able to cite the dummied-up corporate losses from litigation in justifying the $230 million refund  the largest in Russian history. It was processed in a single day 2008 Felix Sater left Bayrock in 2008 after a New York Times article revealed his criminal past. 2008 March Nathaniel Rothschild hosted a high-dollar fundraiser for McCain at Londons posh eighteenth-century Spencer House, which Rothschild donated for the occasion. Given the close relationship between Rothschild and Deripaska, some speculated that Deripaska was the hidden hand behind the event. The conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, alleging that the fundraiser amounted to an illegal contribution by foreign nationals to McCains campaign. 2008 November 24 Magnitsky was arrested and imprisoned at the Butyrka prison in Moscow in November 2008 after being accused of colluding with Hermitage.[4] Held for 11 months without trial. 2009 In return for a guilty plea, Felix Sater agreed to assist the FBI and federal prosecutors as an informant in organized crime. He was sentenced to pay a $25,000 fine and served no prison time. As a result of his assistance, Sater's court records were sealed for 10 years by Loretta Lynch, then the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Lynch's decision to seal his records was discussed at her 2015 Congressional confirmation hearings to become attorney general; she stated that Sater provided ""information crucial to national security and the conviction of over 20 individuals, including those responsible for committing massive financial fraud and members of La Cosa Nostra. 2009 August Sergei Magnitsky was set for surgery. However, the operation never occurred. A week before he was due to have surgery, he was moved to a maximum security prison called Butyrka, which is considered to be one of the harshest prisons in Russia. Most significantly for Sergei, there were no medical facilities there to treat his medical conditions. 2009 November 16 eight days before he would have had to have been released if he were not brought to trial, Magnitsky died. 2009 - 2013 According to Mr Browders evidence, the documents show $2 million spent in Britain that came from two companies allegedly set up by Klyuev over a period of five years up to 2013, a year before Klyuev was placed on the US sanctions list. The companies Zibar Management Inc and Altem Invest Limited were both registered in the British Virgin Islands. 2010 Erik Prince sells Blackwater private military company. Since 2003, the group has provided services to the Central Intelligence Agency, including a 2010 contract for $250 million. Blackwater is now known as Academi since 2011 after the company was acquired by a group of private investors. 2010 Berezovsky won a UK libel suit against Russian State Television over allegations that the murder of Litvinenko was orchestrated by Berezovsky with the aim of ""framing"" the Russian government and discrediting it on the global stage. Russian State-funded media continue to report the claims e.g. ""'Berezovsky killed my son', Litvinenko's dad tells Scotland Yard"" as of May 2012. 2010 Yushchenko failed to secure a run-off spot during the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election; gaining 5.5% of the vote. The party Our Ukraine won 1.11% of the national votes and no constituencies, and thus failed to win parliamentary representation. Yanukovych was elected President, defeating Yulia Tymoshenko. 2011 Boris Berezovsky brought a civil case against Roman Abramovich in the High Court of Justice in London, accusing Abramovich of blackmail, breach of trust and breach of contract, and seeking over 3 billion in damages. Berezovsky's claimed past ownership of Sibneft  which constituted the bulk of his fortune  was put into question by Abramovich. 2012 US Attorney Preet Bharara files claim against Prevezon resulting in the Justice Department seizing Russian assets including a lower Manhattan condominium. Veselnitskaya represented Pyotr Katsyv's son, Denis Katsyv, when Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, charged him with money laundering. Federal prosecutors accused Katsyv of using Manhattan real estate deals to launder money stolen from Browder's Hermitage Capital Management in violation of the Magnitsky Act. The Russian government then banned Bharara from traveling there. 2012 July 25 Kara-Murza testified before the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission of the U.S. Congress about human-rights abuses in Russia. The Kremlins reaction to this legislation shows that it hits them precisely where it hurts. I want to take this opportunity to thank Co-Chairmen McGovern and Wolf for their leadership on this issue. I hope the Magnitsky Act is signed into law before the end of this year. 2012 August Roman Abramovich, who in a statement to the High Court in London asserted that Boris Berezovsky had never owned shares in Sibneft, and that US$1.3 billion paid in 2001 ostensibly for his stake in the company was actually in recognition of Berezovsky's ""political assistance and protection"" during the creation of Sibneft in 1995.On 31 August 2012, the High Court found for Abramovich. 2012 alleged tax fraud led to the 2012 Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act. That law froze the U.S. assets of Russian investigators and prosecutors said to have been involved in illegal detention and death of the late lawyer. 2012 - whistleblower Alexander Perepilichnyy, who supplied documents to Mr Browder, allegedly showing how senior Russian tax officials had benefited from the fraud, died in mysterious circumstances in November (suspected poisoning) 2013 The Justice Department attempt to seize a lower Manhattan condominium acquired by the Russians and other assets began four years ago with then-Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara filing the claim. 2013 November the beginning of a series of events that led to his ousting as President. Yanukovych rejected a pending EU association agreement, choosing instead to pursue a Russian loan bailout and closer ties with Russia. This led to popular protests and the occupation of Kiev's Independence Square, a series of events dubbed the ""Euromaidan"" by young pro-European Union Ukrainians. 2014 January deadly clashes in Independence Square and in other areas across Ukraine, as Ukrainian citizens confronted the Berkut and other special police units. 2014 February 21 Yanukovych claimed that, after lengthy discussions, he had reached an agreement with the opposition. Later that day, however, he left the capital for a speaking engagement in Kharkiv, coming under fire as he left Kiev, and travelling next to Crimea, and eventually to exile in southern Russia. 2014 February 22 the Ukrainian parliament voted to remove Yanukovich from his post, on the grounds that he was unable to fulfill his duties. Parliament set 25 May as the date for the special election to select his replacement, and, two days later, issued a warrant for his arrest, accusing him of ""mass killing of civilians."" 2014 Dmitry Klyuev is put on the US sanctions list. he is described as the alleged mastermind of the criminal fraud uncovered by Mr Magnitsky. According to Mr Browders evidence, the documents show $2 million spent in Britain that came from two companies allegedly set up by Klyuev over a period of five years up to 2013, a year before Klyuev was placed on the US sanctions list. The companies Zibar Management Inc and Altem Invest Limited were both registered in the British Virgin Islands. A further $28 million was channeled into the UK via bank accounts, said to be held in Lithuania by Klyuev and members of his crime syndicate. 2014 March Dmitry Firtash was arrested by Austrian authorities. He was highly influential during the Yuschenko administration. Firtash has not returned to Ukraine following the Maidan revolution of 2014 2015 One of [Bill Browder's] main partners was murdered on the bridge in front of the Kremlin. Boris testified in front of the U.S. Congress, the European Parliament, the Canadian Parliament, and others to make the point that the Magnitsky Act was a pro-Russian piece of legislation because it narrowly targeted corrupt officials and not the Russian people. 2016 June Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr, Rinat Akhmetshin, Natalia Veselnitskaya to discuss Magnitsky Act. In July, when The Times put questions about the meeting to the White House, Mr. Trump and senior administration officials prepared a response on Air Force One that made no mention of the meetings real purpose, saying instead that it focused on Russian adoptions. 2016 December American officials said Mr. Flynn had told the vice president Mike Pence that he had only exchanged holiday greetings with Mr. Kislyak, when in fact the two men had discussed economic sanctions against Russia. The phone calls took place in late December, around the same time the Obama administration was announcing sanctions to punish Russia for what American officials said was a Russian campaign to disrupt the November presidential election. 2016 December Sergey Gorkov, the chief of Russias state-owned development bank, Vnesheconombank, met with Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner at the request of Sergey Kislyak, then Russias ambassador to the United States. 2016 December After Alexander Bastrykin, the head of the Russian Investigative Committee, was added to the Magnitsky List in December, Vladimir Kara-Murza was poisoned. He suffered multiple organ failure, went into a coma and barely survived. 2016 February The retired lieutenant general Micheal Flynn was fired in February from his role as Trump's National Security advisor after it was revealed that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about December phone calls he had with Mr. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador at the time. 2016 March Carter Page worked in Russia for Merrill Lynch, and in 2016 he raised eyebrows among U.S. foreign policy experts when he criticized U.S. sanctions on Russia and urged better relations between the two countries. In March 2016, Trump named him as a foreign policy adviser to his campaign, but the campaign dropped him in September after questions arose about his ties to Russia. 2016 April Two months before the now-infamous Trump Tower meeting between Trump campaign officials and a Russian lawyer and lobbyist, Representative Dana Rohrabacher, perhaps the most Russia-friendly member of the GOP caucus, led a congressional delegation to Moscow in which he was handed materials critical of the Magnitsky Act, the 2012 bill imposing sanctions on Russian officials. Rohrabacher has said that the documents were given to him by Russian prosecutors. The FT reported that the person who gave Rohrabacher the document was Viktor Grin, a top aide to Yuri Chaika, the Russian prosecutor general with whom Veselnitskaya, the lawyer in the Trump Tower meeting, told the Wall Street Journal she was in contact. 2016 June 9 A four-page email chain, which Trump Jr. forwarded to his father's campaign manager at the time, Paul Manafort, and to Trump's son-in-law and current senior adviser, Jared Kushner, culminated in their meeting at Trump Tower on June 9 with Natalia Veselnitskaya  a lawyer described in the emails as a ""Russian government attorney."" Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist, said he attended the June 9 2016 Trump Tower meeting as part of an effort to amend the sanctions law. 2016 June Facebook, without realizing it, had stumbled into the Russian operation as it was getting underway. Cybersecurity experts at the company were tracking a Russian hacker group known as APT28, or Fancy Bear, which U.S. intelligence officials considered an arm of the Russian military intelligence service, the GRU. Facebook executives shared with the FBI their suspicions that a Russian espionage operation was in the works. 2016 June 14 the DNC acknowledged a hack which was claimed by Guccifer 2.0. 2016 July 18 Guccifer 2.0 provided exclusively to The Hill numerous documents and files covering political strategies, including but not limited to correlating the banks that received bailout funds with Republican Party and Democratic Party donations 2016 July 22 Guccifer 2.0 stated he hacked, then leaked, the DNC emails to WikiLeaks. ""Wikileaks published #DNCHack docs I'd given them!!!"", tweeted Guccifer 2.0. 2016 September 13 during a conference, an unknown and remote representative of Guccifer 2.0 released almost 700 megabytes (MB) worth of documents from the DNC. Forbes obtained a copy of those 2016 September The Trump campaign dropped Carter Page in September after questions arose about his ties to Russia. 2016 October 4 Guccifer 2.0 released documents and claimed that they were taken from the Clinton Foundation and showed ""corruption and malfeasance"" there. Security experts quickly determined that the release was a hoax; the release did not contain Clinton Foundation documents, but rather consisted of documents previously released from the DNC and DCCC thefts, data aggregated from public records, and documents that were fabricated altogether as propaganda. Singled out as particularly absurd was the idea that Clinton's team would have actually named a file ""Pay for Play"" on their own server, as Guccifer 2.0's screenshots of the alleged ""hack"" show. 2016 October 4 The office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (D) has told Donald Trump that his charitable foundation is violating state law, and ordered the foundation to stop soliciting donations immediately because it lacks proper state certification. James Sheehan, head of the attorney general's charities bureau, said the violation notice went out on Friday. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, started the Donald J. Trump Foundation to distribute proceeds from sales from his book, The Art of the Deal, but since 2008 it has been funded by outside donations. By failing to get certified, it avoided rigorous outside audits the state requires for large charities. 2017 January 11 The United Arab Emirates arranged a secret meeting in January between Blackwater founder Erik Prince and a Russian close to President Vladimir Putin as part of an apparent effort to establish a back-channel line of communication between Moscow and President-elect Donald Trump, according to U.S., European and Arab officials. the UAE agreed to broker the meeting in part to explore whether Russia could be persuaded to curtail its relationship with Iran, including in Syria, a Trump administration objective that would be likely to require major concessions to Moscow on U.S. sanctions. Though Prince had no formal role with the Trump campaign or transition team, he presented himself as an unofficial envoy for Trump to high-ranking Emiratis involved in setting up his meeting with the Putin confidant, according to the officials, who did not identify the Russian. In an unusual breach of protocol, the UAE did not notify the Obama administration in advance of the visit, though officials found out because Zayeds name appeared on a flight manifest. 2017 February The Vienna Court of Appeals ordered that Dmitry Firtash be extradited to the United States, to face charges that he had secured a titanium extraction permit in India through $18.5 million in bribes. 2017 March The Justice Department said in a statement back in March that all remaining U.S. attorneys nominated by the previous administration, including Bharara, were asked to resign in order to ensure a uniform transition. 2017 March 21 Nikolai Gorokhov A Russian lawyer who survived after falling from a fourth-floor balcony says his plunge was no accident and fears he was targeted because he found key evidence in a $230 million corruption scandal involving high-ranking state officials. 2017 March In March, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley named Akhmetshin in a letter about unregistered foreign agents working for Russia, citing Browders complaint. 2017 March FBI Director James B. Comey publicly confirmed that the FBI was investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russias efforts. A few days after that statement to Congress, Trump separately asked Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers to publicly deny the existence of any evidence of collusion between Trump and the Russians, according to officials. Coats and Rogers refused to comply with the requests, which they both deemed to be inappropriate. 2017 April Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Soviet military counterintelligence officer, met with Dana Rohrabacher in Berlin and discussed the Prevezon money-laundering case with him, according to CNN.The case involved allegations of money laundering involving real estate company Prevezon and was brought in the Southern District of New York. It was settled in May. Veselnitskaya was a lawyer for Prevezon owner Denis Katsyv. An itinerary for the Rohrabacher trip that included the Berlin meeting, which has not yet been made public, details several agenda items for the Berlin leg, but makes no mention of a meeting with Akhmetshin. And the itinerary for the April 2016 trip to Moscow does not list a meeting with the prosecutors. 2017 May meeting Mr. Trump had in May with Russian officials in the Oval Office the day after James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, was fired. That day, Mr. Trump met with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, and the Russian ambassador to the United States at the time, Sergey I. Kislyak, along with other Russian officials. The New York Times reported that in the meeting Mr. Trump had said that firing Mr. Comey relieved great pressure on him. 2017 May Mr. Mueller was appointed in May, shortly after it was revealed that Mr. Comey had written a series of memos about his interactions with Mr. Trump  including one Oval Office meeting when Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump had asked him to end the F.B.I. investigation of Mr. Flynn. During another meeting, the president asked for a pledge of loyalty from the F.B.I. director, according to Mr. Comeys public testimony. 2017 May Prezevon settled a $5.9 million fine from the U.S Department of Justice in case related to Russian tax fraud and money laundering originally uncovered by the deceased Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky. Katsyv was represented by Natalia Veselnitskaya. ""Ms. Veselnitskaya told one Russian news outlet that the penalty was so light 'it seemed almost an apology from the government.'"" 2017 May meeting Mr. Trump had in May with Russian officials in the Oval Office the day after James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, was fired. That day, Mr. Trump met with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, and the Russian ambassador to the United States at the time, Sergey I. Kislyak, along with other Russian officials. The New York Times reported that in the meeting Mr. Trump had said that firing Mr. Comey relieved great pressure on him. 2017 July The Financial Times, citing five sources with knowledge of the matter, reported that Sater had agreed to cooperate with investigators looking into an international money laundering scheme involving Viktor Khrapunov, a former government minister in Kazakhstan. 2017 July Paul Behrends, a top aide to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) has been fired from his position as staff director at the House Foreign Affairs Committee, after his connections to pro-Russia lobbyists were recently revealed. Rohrabacher and Behrends raised concern among embassy officials in 2016 during a trip to Moscow where the lawmaker said he received materials advocating against the Magnitsky Act from the Russians. "
204,cybersecurity,conspiracy,The Atlantic Council Needs to Stop Interfering in Our Elections,5,75mava,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/75mava/the_atlantic_council_needs_to_stop_interfering_in/,2017-10-11 14:01:00,"From USA TODAY - SAN FRANCISCO  A bipartisan group of federal election officials, national security advisors and a retired U.S. general have formed a coalition to fight election hacking with the aim of establishing protocols that would keep Russians and other state entities from interfering with the voting process. At a Tuesday news conference at the headquarters of the foreign policy think-tank Atlantic Council in Washington, D.C., the group plans to announce it's working on a list of necessary procedures and standards that state and local election officials must do, such as implementing digital firewalls around election data and making sure there are paper ballots to allow for auditing of all election tallies. It has given itself a 60-day deadline to produce the guidelines. The group also plans to pressure Congress to fund the election officials' activities ""because if the states and local election officials have one gripe we have to concede to them, its that theyre broke,"" said Jake Braun, a former senior consultant on cybersecurity at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in the Obama Administration who is helping organize the coalition. ""If we have a nation state attempting to influence the U.S. electoral process, then its the federal governments job to pay for the defensive response."" The goal is to have the strongest, most unhackable system possible in place by the 2020 presidential election, he said. Concerns over foreign interference in last year's presidential election were heightened by last month's Department of Homeland Security announcement that election systems in 21 states had been targeted by Russian government hackers during the 2016 election campaign. It's ringing alarm bells, said Frederick Kempe, chief executive officer of the Atlantic Council, which is leading the effort. If we want to defend our democracy, then we need to protect our elections, he said. In July, hackers at the DefCon cybersecurity conference were able to break into five voting machine types in less than a day, underscoring the vulnerability of the U.S. election system. The group also plans to release a report on how the hackers were able to so swiftly hack the machines, a feat that raised red flags because the industry that operates voting systems had always said they were more protected from intrusions because they required such specialized knowledge to run. The voting machine hacks destroyed that argument, said Jeff Moss, president of DefCon and a commissioner on the The Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace. The interior of a Diebold Election Systems voting machine. It was taken apart by at the DefCon computer security conference in Las Vegas as part of an event aimed at raising awareness about vulnerabilities to the U.S. election system. (Photo: Elizabeth Weise) The Atlantic Council is chaired by Jon Huntsman, the newly appointed U.S. ambassador to Russia. In his statement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month during his nomination hearing, he said there was no question that the Russian government interfered in the U.S. election last year and that he would ""not hesitate to remind government officials that they are accountable for their actions."" Russia has consistently denied any interference in the U.S. election. Also in the coalition is the Center of Internet Security, a non-governmental organization that is funded by the Department of Homeland Security to fund cybersecurity for states and cities. While Russian attempts to insert itself into the U.S. political process were a surprise here, they were not news to those who have worked in the military and diplomatic corps. Many of our European allies have already seen this  years of Russian interference and Russian attempts to erode the credibility of the political process in Central and Eastern Europe, said Ambassador Douglas Lute, a retired three-star general who served under both Obama and George W. Bush and was most recently the former United States Permanent Representative to the North Atlantic Council, NATOs standing political body. He's part of the coalition. And if what Russia did in 2016 was bad, what it might do in 2018 or 2020 with the knowledge it gained the first time around is worse, Lute said. By law, states must maintain statewide voter registration databases, many of which were probed in 2016. You can imagine a hacker could get into these databases, then do something as simple as misspelling names or transposing numbers in the address. Then when the voter goes to the polling place and shows his ID, he doesnt even get a ballot, Lute said.

The George W.

As reasons for resigning, they mentioned that President Donald Trump has given ""insufficient attention to the growing threats to the cybersecurity of the critical systems upon which all Americans depend, including those impacting the systems supporting our democratic election process,"", they mentioned ""his failure ""to denounce intolerance and violence of hate groups"" when asked about the ""horrific violences in Charlottesville"", and they pointed to his move to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.""

206,cybersecurity,conspiracy,"There is no logic in defending Donald Trump. His presidency is a disaster, he has not implemented any law that is morally justifiable and is working to divide our nation. THIS MADNESS MUST BE STOPPED.",0,6xtlxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6xtlxf/there_is_no_logic_in_defending_donald_trump_his/,2017-09-04 01:02:59,"I like many of you have been watching this presidency closely, for many reasons it has the value of a trainwreck. When Trump was first elected I was concerned but I thought he is a novice politician, more than likely his plans will stall and he will come to his wits because their are still smart people in washington that can direct him the right way. Nope, the train is off the rails yet it is still furiously moving. I want to put forth a couple topics for people to discuss, I want to hear Trump supporters opinions and I want an actual discussion. No name calling, no shill marking, hopefully brigading is kept to a minimum. Lets discuss these points like concerned citizens and hopefully we can all gain some insight on the opinions of the reddit conspiracy community. 1. Trump lies alot. URL Trump from day one has lied or stretched the truth to fit his narrative, some are harmless some are destructive and most rile up his base and is used as propaganda. Some are harmless but some are so blatant and stupid that you have to wonder if he is sane. For example he said We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare quickly, easily, on day one. Sounds pretty stupid right? 2. Trumps attempts to illlegitimize american institutions. URL Not only has trump devalued the office of the president but he has put people in place that are actively seeking to destroy the offices they hold. Betsy Devos is a great example, not only is she the rich sister of Erik Prince but she has 0 qualifications to be education secretary. She has pushed hard to eliminate student loan programs and push for profit schooling and hires the last person you would want to head a fraud task force for colleges URL He is also nominating a climate denier who has never held any position of engineering or sciences to be the head of NASA. How does this make any sense at all? 3. Trump does some dumb shit. Remember the wire tap fiasco? This exemplifies Trumps stupidity, it was a claim that was baseless, unsubstantiated and could have been simply proven true by his own actions! He could have called the fbi, asked for the wire taps and poof there is his evidence. But he picked the one thing that could be instantly proven right. Then not learning from his mistakes he does it again, threatening Comey that he recorded their conversation. And this takes the cake for stupidity for multiple reasons. 1. The recordings could back up comeys testimoney. Once trump said this the senate immediately wanted those tapes to make sure Comeys testimoney was true. 2.Trump then admits he said that to make sure that comey said the right thing! He just admitted to intimidating a witness! 3. They dont exist and now he has egg all over his face, how dumb of a plan was that! Here is some other dumb stuff. URL The joint russian cybersecurity task force. Seriously you get hacked by russians and you want to give them the key to the hen house? Wtf. URL URL 4. North Korea. Not much to explain here. Im sure everyone knows that starting war with North Korea will go down as an epic disaster. 5. Fake news. This sub loves to call out the media and play the holier than thou card when it comes to their choice in media. My point is Trump relies on news sources that are just plain devisive and straight wrong. Sites like breitbart, the daily caller, the federalist have no shame in producing news that blatantly skews information to fit their narrative. Trump has access to the most sophisticated intelligence services in the world yet he relies on fox and friends for his news. The intelligence agencies have gone so far as to create documents that say his name asany times as possible to keep him interested and staffers have said they stick around simply to try and shutdown some of his crazy ideas. Edit: Well the trump supporters have decided to insult me rather than debate the topics. Offer still stands Im willing to debate anyone on the issues. Or sling insults doesnt matter to me. Edit2: got through as many comments as I could, most were insults. Only 2 people actually posted a worthwhile comment. Thanks for the insults. I expected Trump supporters to try and do a better job at defending him. Most people just wanted to tell me my sources are propaganda, as is tradition. I wish people would attack the argument and not the source. I'm disappointed."

""The first reason is because they don't understand the evidencebecause the don't have the necessary technical knowledge. The second reason is they don't want to understand the evidence."" This article relies on work done by Secureworks that is summarized in the blog post here: URL Their conclusion: &gt;Components of TG-4127 operations have been reported under the names APT28, Sofacy, Sednit, and Pawn Storm. CTU researchers assess with moderate confidence that the group is operating from the Russian Federation and is gathering intelligence on behalf of the Russian government. In the motherboard article: &gt;The data linking a group of Russian hackersknown as Fancy Bear, APT28, or Sofacyto the hack on Podesta is also yet another piece in a growing heap of evidence pointing toward the Kremlin. And it also shows a clear thread between apparently separate and independent leaks that have appeared on a website called DC Leaks, such as that of Colin Powell's emails; and the Podesta leak, which was publicized on WikiLeaks. &gt;All these hacks were done using the same tool: malicious short URLs hidden in fake Gmail messages. And those URLs, according to a security firm that's tracked them for a year, were created with Bitly account linked to a domain under the control of Fancy Bear. Stats on the bit . ly link in [this image](URL show that this link was clicked by Podesta. One of the people quoted in this article, Thomas Rid, wrote an article that summarizes much of the evidence in these cases: URL This article gives good background to Russian espionage and has decent general coverage of the hacks with a possible couple small technical errors. But overall it is a good summary of the technical posts discussed below. URL &gt;While CrowdStrike, which was hired by the DNC to investigate the intrusions and whose findings are described in a new report, had always suspected that one of the two hacker groups that struck the DNC was the GRU, Russias military intelligence agency, it had only medium confidence. &gt;Now, said CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch, we have high confidence it was a unit of the GRU. CrowdStrike had dubbed that unit Fancy Bear. ... &gt;CrowdStrike found that a variant of the Fancy Bear malware that was used to penetrate the DNCs network in April 2016 was also used to hack an Android app developed by the Ukrainian army to help artillery troops more efficiently train their antiquated howitzers on targets. ... &gt;The Fancy Bear crew evidently hacked the app, allowing the GRU to use the phones GPS coordinates to track the Ukrainian troops position. In that way, the Russian military could then target the Ukrainian army with artillery and other weaponry. This article is not worded in quite the best way, as the malware it describes, XAgent, was not used to hack either the DNC or app but is an implant that allows the exfiltration of data. The Crowdstrike document below is more accurate and has more technical details URL *[Sidebar: an Implant is software that allows the attacker to maintain control over affected machines and perform useful functions like exfiltrating specific information, or monitoring use of the machine]* A nice rundown of XAgents functions can be found below URL However it is worth noting that the Ukrainian military has denied the claims made in the Crowdstrike report that this malware led to loss of artillery platforms. These findings still do provide evidence that the DNC hack was perpetrated by Fancy Bear and also that Fancy Bear is almost certainly tied to Russia. continued below:"

I believe this ""Russian hacking entity"" is actually an FBI/CIA operative named Dmitri Alperovich. If you're just now hearing of this guy, he spearheads an FBI asset group called Crowdstrike, which is also funded by Google to the tune of $100 million. Now, Google and Clinton have known alliances based on Schmidt being such a large campaign contributor, and there's reason to believe Crowdstrike assisted her campaign with covering up the Rich debacle. Alperovich is a known criminal and Ukrainian oligarch who was part of the Atlantic Council (a Soros-funded group). Crowdstrike's purported mission is to enhance cybersecurity by assisting the FBI with things like forensic analysis. What they *really* do, however, is prevent/hack/discredit leakers and journalists, infiltrate innocuous groups, and provide cover stories for the NSA/FBI. For example, Crowdstrike knowingly infiltrated a group of journalists working on the downed MH airliner/Ukraine story. Crowdstrike *also* assisted the FBI with looking into the DNC hacks. By the way: If you don't think Ukraine was a Soros-funded coup to benefit Western interests then dig into this. Now, there likely was no DNC hack--Seth Rich transferred the NGP VAN files to MegaUpload, along with a bunch of other incriminating evidence. To mask this activity, the DNC put forth the narrative that ""the Russians"" hacked them (Cozy Bear/Fancy Bear)... but this ""Russian"" is very likely the FBI/Crowdstrike asset, Alperovich, who is just [filling in as a cover](URL for the Seth Rich problem. This also explains why the FBI/Crowdstrike went in, took all the DNC's stuff, wiped the servers clean, and then left. Now it's worth considering that maybe this phishing scam *did* take place, and it *was* done by a Russian (Alperovich). The report is technically correct... but one has to consider in light of Crowdstrike's previous assistance that it could've been for *Clinton's* benefit. Not Trump's. I again want to be nonpartisan. But if you believe the DNC killed Seth Rich, then it makes sense that Crowdstrike has been used as an FBI asset to cover it up under the guise of ""The Russians."" The fingerprints are the same as what they did during the DNC cleanup mission, and the NSA document does not reveal the raw intelligence to confirm that this was the Kremlin. "
217,cybersecurity,conspiracy,Argument: Russia Hack And Flynn Fiasco Political Hit Job,19,6apbuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6apbuq/argument_russia_hack_and_flynn_fiasco_political/,2017-05-12 14:49:37,"My position is Michael Flynn, Trump`s former National Security Advisor, is a target of a political hit job and that the ""Russian hack"" saga stands on wobbly legs. I will do this by using the media against itself. Wait, before you call me a shill or Trumpie, let me present my case. This is going to be **long** so stay with me. There's a Washington Post [article](URL from August **2015** which regards a suspected cyber attack by the Russian government on Pentagon servers. Within, there's the following: &gt;Even so, officials cautioned that it is difficult to pinpoint the origin or perpetrator of such hacks. **Attribution in this business is near impossible. Rarely are you ever able to say with 100 percent certainty who was behind a particular incident, the official said.** The incident follows several other, more destructive cyberattacks on U.S. government networks, including devastating breaches of databases maintained by the Office of Personnel Management. U.S. officials believe hackers working for the Chinese government were responsible for those, which exposed sensitive information about more than 22 million people. Skip ahead to this July 2016 New York Times [article](URL It is the beginning tendrils of the gossip about Russia and Trump ""colluding"" to hack the servers of the DNC. Within the article: &gt;An unusual question is capturing the attention of cyberspecialists, Russia experts and Democratic Party leaders in Philadelphia: Is Vladimir V. Putin trying to meddle in the American presidential election? Until Friday, that charge, with its eerie suggestion of a Kremlin conspiracy to aid Donald J. Trump, has been only whispered. But the release on Friday of some 20,000 stolen emails from the Democratic National Committees computer servers, many of them embarrassing to Democratic leaders, has intensified discussion of the role of Russian intelligence agencies in disrupting the 2016 campaign. Also within the article: &gt;Proving the source of a cyberattack is notoriously difficult. **But researchers have concluded that the national committee was breached by two Russian intelligence agencies, which were the same attackers behind previous Russian cyberoperations at the White House, the State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff last year.** And metadata from the released emails suggests that the documents passed through Russian computers. Though a hacker claimed responsibility for giving the emails to WikiLeaks, the same agencies are the prime suspects. [A mere 48 hours](URL after the leak of the DNC emails by Wikileaks: &gt;Clintons campaign manager, Robby Mook, argued on ABCs This Week that the emails were leaked by the Russians for the purpose of helping Donald Trump citing experts but offering no other evidence. Who gave the DNC and Clinton an assessment of who was behind the hack?: &gt;The experts cited by Mr. Mook include CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that was brought into the Democratic National Committee when officials there suspected they had been hacked. Now let's go back a month to a June 2016 New York Times [article](URL when the DNC hack was initially reported: &gt;One group placed espionage software on the committees computer servers last summer, giving it unimpeded access to communications for about a year. The committee called in CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, early last month after the Democratic Party began to suspect an intrusion. Also: &gt;Dmitri Alperovitch, a co-founder of CrowdStrike, said he believed that the group that first hacked the committees servers  a group his firm had named Cozy Bear long before the breach  appeared to be the same that downloaded communications in recent years from unclassified email systems used by the State Department and the White House. Also: &gt;In 2014 and 2015, the effort to clean the State Department systems after those intrusions resulted in several shutdowns, some in the midst of delicate negotiations with Iran. The administration has never confirmed that the Russian government was behind those intrusions, but it has briefed officials on the details in classified sessions. There's a lot of mixed messaging going on. Now let's go forward a month, back to July, with this CNN [article](URL &gt;Federal investigators tried to warn the Democratic National Committee about a potential intrusion in their computer network months before the party moved to try to fix the problem, U.S. officials briefed on the probe tell CNN. The DNC brought in consultants from the private security firm CrowdStrike in April. And by the time suspected Russian hackers were kicked out of the DNC network in June, the hackers had been inside for about a year. Also, the FBI investigation begins: &gt;Earlier on Monday, the FBI confirmed it was investigating a hack into the DNC, the first acknowledgment from the agency that they are probing the incident, which U.S. officials suspect came from a Russian cyber attack. Clinton's campaign manager is out in full force, pushing the Russia-Trump collusion narrative: &gt;*Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday about that ""changes to the Republican platform to make it more pro-Russian,"" which could provide some of the motive behind the hacks.* &gt;""I don't think it's coincidental that these emails were released on the eve of our convention here, and I think that's disturbing,"" he said. Also: &gt;The FBI and other U.S. agencies involved haven't yet officially attributed the DNC attack to Russian government hackers. But evidence gathered by the FBI so far points to groups that are known to U.S. counter-intelligence for carrying out intrusions for the Russian government, the officials briefed on the probe say. Interesting tidbits: &gt;It's possible that other hackers took advantage of the DNC's vulnerabilities and also stole information, U.S. officials said. But the intrusion so far appears to bear the hallmarks of a Russian intelligence operation. Foreign spy agencies routinely try to collect information on U.S. elections, and there were some cyber attacks against political campaigns detected during the 2012 election cycle. This highly informative and exhaustive [article](URL goes into detail why the DNC hack is bogus. &gt;The results of CrowdStrikes investigation were first broken by the Washington Post and then followed up in greater detail by CrowdStrike itself. In a post entitled Bears in the Midst, Dmitri Alperovitch attributed the hack to two distinct and very nefarious Russian espionage groups: Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear, among the most sophisticated cyber-operators CrowdStrike had ever come across. In fact, our team considers them some of the best adversaries out of all the numerous nation-state, criminal and hacktivist/terrorist groups we encounter on a daily basis, he wrote. Their tradecraft is superb, operational security second to none and the extensive usage of living-off-the-land techniques enables them to easily bypass many security solutions they encounter. &gt;CrowdStrike followed the protocols for existing APTs. Its investigation of DNC servers turned up two known threat actor groups: APT28 and APT29. Depending on the cybersecurity firm doing the analysis, these two APTs have been called by all sorts of names: Pawn Storm, Sofacy, Sednit, CozyCar, The Dukes, CozyDuke, Office Monkeys. Neither of them has ever been linked by any cybersecurity firm to the Russian government with certainty. Some firms have triedmost notably FireEye, CrowdStrikes bigger and wealthier competitor. We know the FBI was [never allowed](URL access to the DNC servers but solely relied on the findings of CrowdStrike. Now let's move ahead to August 2016 and this [article/interview](URL in the Washington Post. Flynn openly gives information about his connections to Russia. &gt;PRIEST: Let me ask me about Russia. There has been a lot in the news about your trips  &gt;FLYNN: One in the military [while director of the Defense Intelligence Agency]. I went there on a fully approved trip. I had a great trip. I was the first U.S. officer ever allowed inside the headquarters of the GRU [Russian intelligence]. I was able to brief their entire staff. I gave them a leadership OPD. [Professional development class on leadership] and talked a lot about the way the worlds unfolding. &gt;*PRIEST: You saw the relationship with Russia as potentially good for the U.S.? &gt;FLYNN: No. No. I saw the relation with Russia as necessary to the U.S., for the interests of the U.S. We worked very closely with them on the Sochi Olympics. We were working closely with them on the Iranian nuclear deal. We beat Hitler because of our relationship with the Russians, so anybody that looks on it as anything but a relationship thats required for mutual supporting interests, including ISIS,  thats really where Im at with Russia. We have a problem with radical Islamism and I actually think that we could work together with them against this enemy. They have a worse problem than we do. &gt;PRIEST: Tell me about the RT [state-run Russian Television] relationship?* &gt;FLYNN: I was asked by my speakers bureau, LAI. I do public speaking. It was in Russia. It was a paid speaking opportunity. I get paid so much. The speakers bureau got paid so much, based on our contract. &gt;PRIEST: Can you tell me how much you got for that? &gt;FLYNN: No. &gt;PRIEST: No? Because you dont want to get your fees out there? &gt;FLYNN: Yeah, I dont. &gt;PRIEST: What was the gig? &gt;FLYNN: The gig was to do an interview with [RT correspondent] Sophie Shevardnadze. It was an interview in front of the forum, probably 200 people in the audience. My purpose there was I was asked to talk about radical Islam in the Middle East. They asked me to talk about what was going on in the situation unfolding in the Middle East.  The speaking agreement was done before Russian went into Syria, which was actually more interesting to me because  one of my discussions, I talked about the attacks in France  and the negative role that Iran was playing where I thought Russian could actually have a role. The statement that I made was actually: Russia ought to get Iran to back out of the proxy wars they are involved in, to include Syria, so we, the rest of the international community, could settle this situation down. &gt;PRIEST: Have you appeared on RT regularly? &gt;FLYNN: I appear on Al Jazeera, Skye New Arabia, RT. I dont get paid a dime. I have no media contracts.  [I am interviewed] on CNN, Fox  *PRIEST: One more thing about Russia * &gt;FLYNN: A lot of people are making this about Russia. Read my book. Youll see what I say about Russia. &gt;PRIEST: Let me ask about sitting next to Putin  because thats the symbol. &gt;FLYNN: Yeah, I know, boring. &gt;PRIEST: But did you think about what the optics would be  &gt;FLYNN: Sure. I didnt have any problem. What Im looking for is to make sure, in my view, I see a country that has lost respect for another country and if I have any sort of fiber in my body where I can help out to make sure they understand that we have people in our country who arent going to apologize for who we are. Were not going to act in a soft way for what we believe needs to be done. I was very adamant about what I said. He knows exactly what I said. &gt;PRIEST: Did you talk to him personally? &gt;FLYNN: No, just introduction. Thats it. &gt;PRIEST: The seating arrangements? You didnt ask to sit by him? &gt;FLYNN: Nope. I was one of the guests there.  Some interesting characters. I found it a great learning opportunity. One of the things I learned was that Putin has no respect for the United States leadership. Not for the United States, but the leadership. Carter Page, who is currently under investigation, is even mentioned: &gt;PRIEST: To broaden the discussion on the Russia question a little bit, theres [Trump adviser] Carter Page having business interest and Paul Manafort have business interests there. &gt;FLYNN: How about the Clintons?  If thats all you want to talk about, I dont want to do this anymore. &gt;PRIEST: But thats not all Im talking about. Im trying to just get it out there on the table. &gt;FLYNN: **You know what? I dont know what their business interests are. Ive talked with Paul Manafort, met him, but if Carter Page walked in here, I wouldnt know who he is  you know what? Look at the amount of money the Global Clinton Initiative is taking from countries right now.** The same Carter Page who was extremely open in March 2016 in this Bloomberg [interview.](URL &gt;Pages interest in Russia dates to his youth in New Yorks Hudson Valley. Watching a TV news program on arms control talks, he says he noticed that the adviser sitting behind President Ronald Reagan wore a Navy uniform. **A few years later, Page enrolled in the U.S. Naval Academy. He later worked in arms control at the Pentagon and completed a fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Over his career, he's earned three graduate degrees, including a Ph.D from SOAS University of London.** An *emphasis* **should be placed on that this interview was in** **March 2016**, **before the DNC leaks.** Let's skip to an [article](URL published the same day, same newspaper as the previous one regarding Flynn: &gt;He has called President Obama a liar, declared the U.S. justice system corrupt and insisted that he was pushed out of his assignment as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency because of his views on radical Islam. The claim has left former superiors seething, including Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., according to current and former officials who said Flynn was removed because of management problems. &gt;Like Trump, Flynn has advocated forging closer ties with Russia. In interviews with The Washington Post, Flynn acknowledged being paid to give a speech and attend a lavish anniversary party for the Kremlin-controlled RT television network in Moscow last year, where he was seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin.* &gt;People went crazy, said retired Brig. Gen. Peter B. Zwack, a former U.S. military attache in Moscow. They thought it was so out of bounds, so unusual. Zwack emphasized that he considers Flynn a patriot who would never sell out his country. Flynn, who was no longer in government but received a DIA briefing on Russia before the trip, said the invitation and payment came through his speakers bureau. He said he used the visit to press for collaboration on Syria, Iran and the Middle East, and dismissed the ensuing controversy as boring. Asked why he would want to be so closely associated with a Kremlin propaganda platform, Flynn said he sees no distinction between RT and other news outlets. Also: &gt;He has held senior positions in the 18th Airborne Corps, at the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon and at U.S. Central Command, which runs U.S. military operations in the Middle East. Throughout his career, he was viewed as a charismatic and unconventional officer with a talent for mapping terrorist networks  qualities prized by superiors. But his hard-charging approach was at times considered disruptive or undisciplined. &gt;Some of Flynns other moves angered superiors. Former U.S. officials said he was scolded after traveling to Pakistan in 2009 or early 2010 and revealing to Pakistani officials sensitive U.S. intelligence on the militant Haqqani network accused of staging attacks on American forces. U.S. officials said that the move was aimed at prodding Pakistan to crack down on the militant group, but that Flynn exposed U.S. intelligence capabilities that only helped Pakistan protect an organization it used as a proxy ally. Flynn also came under investigation by the Pentagon because of an allegation that he had inappropriately shared highly classified intelligence with Australian and British forces. Im proud of that one, Flynn said in an interview. Accuse me of sharing intelligence in combat with our closest allies. Please! &gt;The inquiry delayed but did not derail Flynns ascent through the ranks. Always pushing for a deeper understanding of terrorist networks, Flynn persuaded Clapper in 2011 to let him form a team to reexamine the materials recovered from bin Ladens compound in Pakistan, searching for clues overlooked by the CIA. In 2012, Obama tapped him for one of the highest positions a military intelligence officer can attain, running the Defense Intelligence Agency. &gt;The DIA job is ordinarily a three-year assignment. But early in Flynns second year, his bosses  Clapper and then-Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael G. Vickers  summoned him to a meeting at the Pentagon to tell him that he was being removed. As the search for a replacement stalled, Flynn attempted an end-run around his superiors, appealing directly to the vice chief of staff of the Army to extend his tenure. The move infuriated Clapper, according to former officials who said the DNI warned Flynn that if he made any other attempt to circumvent the outcome he would be fired on the spot. Clapper declined to comment for this article, but several current and former officials confirmed the account. &gt;He characterizes his ouster as a political purge orchestrated by an administration unwilling to heed the warnings he was sounding about militant Islam. Asked for evidence, he said, I just know! adding that Clapper had once told him that the issue behind Flynns ouster was not your leadership, or I would have removed you right away. &gt;The decision to remove Flynn was about turbulence and a destructive climate, said a former senior U.S. intelligence official. I dont think anybody in the administration was even aware of his views on radical Islam. Now let's skip to **November**, right after the election, in this New York Times [article](URL &gt;**The Flynn Intel Group, a consulting firm he founded after he was fired by President Obama as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, has hazy business ties to Middle Eastern countries and has appeared to lobby for the Turkish government. General Flynn also took a paid speaking engagement last year with Russia Today, a television network funded by the Kremlin, and attended the networks lavish anniversary party in Moscow, where he sat at Mr. Putins elbow.** Also: &gt;For example, he has attributed his dismissal from the Defense Intelligence Agency to a pair of consummate insiders: James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, and Michael Vickers, the undersecretary of defense intelligence. Interesting tidbit: &gt;Hes an analyst who can get deep into the weeds on the issues and a lot of this stuff and then is very good at playing three-dimensional chess, said Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a close confidant to Mr. Flynn. He was the one who called out the administration for being wrong on Al Qaeda. Now forward, to an [article](URL from Vox days later. &gt;The move will immediately make Flynn one of the most powerful people in the US government and give him enormous influence over the Pentagon, State Department, and CIA  the very organizations he clashed with publicly and privately during his final years in uniform. Interesting tidbits: &gt;**NBC News reported that Flynn personally vetoed candidates like retired Adm. William McRaven, retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis,** and former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers. In 2012, Flynn proposed overhauling the agency so it would maintain a network of covert operatives to expand its network of overseas spies, according to a long article I co-wrote in Foreign Policy about the fight. **The move infuriated the CIA**, which worked hard to stop the creation of what could have ultimately come to rival its larger and better-known cadre of covert operatives. The agency, backed by a network of former CIA personnel in senior jobs at the Pentagon and elsewhere in the national security bureaucracy, succeeded in killing the idea. &gt;According to the Washington Post, Flynn tried to salvage his job by sidestepping his superior officers and making a direct appeal to the vice chief of the Army. When Clapper found out, he warned Flynn that he would fire him on the spot if Flynn made another attempt to do an end-run around his bosses, according to the newspaper. Clapper, arguably Flynns biggest bureaucratic adversary, announced his resignation Thursday, just hours before Flynns appointment. Then on January 12th 2017 an [article](URL by David Ignatius of the Washington Post included leaked classified information, number one of which illegally disclosed that a phone call was made between Flynn and the Russian ambassador to the United States on December 29th and what may have been talked about during the call. This leak happened a week before the inauguration and the Obama administration was still in office at the time. The article reads, along with many I've quoted here, like political gossip akin to celeb tabloid rags. It should also be pointed out that this leak of classified information occurred alongside the publication of the now infamous Trump dossier/opposition research done by Michael Steele. &gt;According to a senior U.S. government official, Flynn phoned Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak several times on Dec. 29, the day the Obama administration announced the expulsion of 35 Russian officials as well as other measures in retaliation for the hacking. What did Flynn say, and did it undercut the U.S. sanctions? The Logan Act (though never enforced) bars U.S. citizens from correspondence intending to influence a foreign government about disputes with the United States. Was its spirit violated? The Trump campaign didnt immediately respond to a request for comment. Tidbit: &gt;The FBI and other intelligence agencies have had the dossier, too, since late summer. Their investigation remains open, it appears. The following day, January 13th, Democrat senator Chris Coons comments to [CNN](URL about the illegally leaked classified information: &gt;Sen. Chris Coons said Friday that it ""seems very suspicious"" that President-elect Donald Trump's pick for national security advisor spoke to Russia's ambassador to the United States on the same day the Obama administration announced sanctions against Russia for alleged hacking during the presidential election. The same day, New York magazine [reports](URL &gt;On the same day that President Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the U.S. and imposed other sanctions in retaliation for the Kremlins alleged attempts to influence the presidential election, Donald Trumps incoming national security adviser, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, spoke on the phone several times to Russias ambassador to the U.S, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius reports.Whats unclear is why. The narrative continues. Within the next two months the media suddenly brings back up the previously reported information of Flynn's company working for a firm owned by a businesman who was born in Turkey as if it's THIS SHOCKING BREAKING NEWS INFORMATION! FLYNN IS A FOREIGN AGENT! They bring back the information about Flynn's trip to Russia as if it hadn't been in the public sphere for months. Now, skip ahead to January 24th. From testimony before Congress we know Flynn was interviewed by the FBI that day. We now know the following about that FBI [interview](URL &gt;**The FBI interviewed Flynn about the December calls with Kislyak and determined that he wasn't intentionally trying to be deceptive about the nature of what was discussed, according to US officials briefed on the investigation. But investigators have been investigating Flynn's business ties after he left the government and before he joined the Trump administration.** [Another article:](URL &gt;Officials said this week that the FBI is continuing to examine Flynns communications with Kislyak. Several officials emphasized that while sanctions were discussed, they did not see evidence that Flynn had an intent to convey an explicit promise to take action after the inauguration. **U.S. officials said that seeking to build such a case against Flynn would be daunting. The law against U.S. citizens interfering in foreign diplomacy, known as the Logan Act, stems from a 1799 statute that has never been prosecuted. As a result, there is no case history to help guide authorities on when to proceed or how to secure a conviction. We know now that on January 26th and January 27th Yates contacts White House counsel about Flynn. The media spins the blackmail story regarding Flynn, inferring Russia could possibly blackmail Flynn. We don't know WHY until this month when Yates testifies. She testifies that her sole concern about Flynn and why she contacted White House counsel was that Flynn's conversation with the Russian ambassador in December could be used as blackmail against him by the Russians because he had lied to Pence about it. So her logic is that Flynn, in the military for decades and at the top levels of government for years, could be blackmailed into doing something criminal solely because he lied to Pence about it. Cooooooooome on. Does that make logical sense to anyone? We already know Flynn passed the January 24th FBI interview. To the hack. CNN even [accuses](URL RT, Russia Today, a state funded news agency, of even being involved with the hack, without proof: &gt;The Russian government-funded news outlet that US intelligence agencies say played a key role in disseminating stolen emails intended to damage the candidacy of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Flynn is forced to register as a ""foreign agent"" because of the media hurricane, even though his agency's work with the firm had been previously known and reported by the media before the election. &gt;Flynn`s lawyer explains: Kelner said Flynn registered because his work could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey. Tidbits: &gt;Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign government or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department, according to the AP. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the Justice Department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. So what do we have here? Someone hacked into DNC servers and weren't detected for a year. The DNC hired a private security firm, CrowdStrike, to investigate. Immediately, fingers pointed to Russia. The FBI was and has never been allowed to independently look at the DNC servers to verify and we know now CrowdStrike has [backed away](URL from many of its former claims, even refusing to testify before Congress about the hack. The names of the supposed two Russian intelligence agencies involved were actually made up. ""Revelations"" about Flynn were things the media had previously reported about. Ask yourself, have no other previous upcoming administration official before an inauguration ever talked with a foreign government official and talked potential policies? Of course they have. Flynn was just recorded and had the conversation illegally leaked by the Obama administration. "

(A 4th brother and wife of one of the Awan's are also believed to be involved). &gt;Originally installed in congressional positions by Greg Meeks who is widely regarded as the most corrupt member of congress. I will preface this discussion by stating you will find some variation in the numbers cited. I believe that is because I quoted from stories as the case was developing. The Daily Caller was the primary source for most of the news on the net. I tried to be as accurate as possible with the facts quoting the sources I found. I am posting this because I want answers, it is not a definitive work. I do, however, believe the breach is every bit as consequential as the hillary email server and the CIA Wikileak. [Why isnt the MSM interested in the Awan Brothers: the three IT specialists fired for rooting through House Democrats sensitive files?](URL [Who are the Awan IT Staff that hacked House Intelligence Computers? And Why Wont the Media cover this Evidence-based Story?](URL I know a bunch of shills will tear me up screaming, ""ya got no proof,"" but indulge me in a conspiracy theory. I think the greatest disservice the MSM had managed to perpetuate is the fallacy that other than the obvious connection of all these people there is otherwise no connection between these events. Let's assume for the moment that the items described here are patterns of political belief and criminal activity. They aren't individual acts, but on going criminal conspiracies. Let's not look at this as an isolated event. While I'm detailing the actions of the Awan brothers. I believe, but can not prove, those action may have been perpetuated in concert with other individuals at work in the under belly of the government. It's almost as if disparate groups come in contact occasionally when their objectives overlap. As I stated, I have no proof of this, but it stands to reason the flood of cyber attacks and leaks may have overlapped through the individuals linked in the different events. For example, Debbie Wasserman Schultz was an integral player in the DNC Hacks and also introduced the Awan brothers to Congress. Is there a connection? Maybe, maybe not. It is not that far fetched, this has happened before, see the [Silverman group](URL Silverman associated with the [CPUSA](URL and knew [Jarretts father, Dr. James Bowman](URL and through [three degrees of separation](URL used by the NSA is directly connected to [Valerie Jerrett](URL If it is good enough for the IC to open an inquiry why can't we indulge in some similar speculation.  The First anomalous fact is the Media. Why have they largely ignored the issue. Before you cyber trolls jump on me, I would like you to consider two facts. Congress deals with very sensitive and classified material all the time. The Awan brothers could never have had a secret clearance for any other group than Congress. There is no news story there?  The Second error is the ""smoking gun."" The evidence is always covered up with a coincidence, a cover story if you will. While I believe the politicos in D.C. are pampered rubes, they do have a good support staff, and some have been trained to support clandestine operations. The rest have been hammered with political optics for the entirety of their career in D.C.. They are all trained to control optics and the dissemination of the truth.  The Third fallacy is the ""bad guy."" Why does everyone think an on going criminal conspiracy can be distilled down to a single criminal committing a crime rather than a pattern of criminal behavior with one or more groups profiting off the criminal activities. It is best to think of their actions like organized crime and should be prosecuted like a [RICO](URL case. An on going criminal enterprise by an organized group or groups of conspirators. ### The Media Why hasn't the media made this the top news story to at least go along with the Russian hack. Let's face it, the media doesn't care about the damage to the country, they only care about their partisan agenda. If they didn't they would cover stories damaging to the DNC. &gt;With a [$600,000,000 CIA contract](URL you would think the Washington Post could afford an investigative journalist or two. Perhaps CNN will take up an interest as this rabbit hole runs deep and wide. Don't hold your breath. Snowflakes and ""journalists"" can call Trump a fascist, but there is nothing connecting an enormous breach of the United States Security Apparatus by as many as 80 Democrat members of Congress (past and present). We rail on about the Russians and Trump without specific allegations backed up with evidence, but the media avoids providing nightly updates about these 5 spies that have compromised congress. The answer is simple, the Awan Brothers are Muslim and the ""victims""/dupes are Dems. Dupes who in fact abused their position of responsibility to end up being compromised by their own ""trusted"" staff. Several of the Congressmen involved in the breach have gone so far as to blame the allegations on [Islamophobia](URL &gt;Meeks said he was hesitant to believe the accusations against Alvi, Imran Awan and the three other staffers, saying their background as Muslim Americans, some with ties to Pakistan, could make them easy targets for false charges. This story damages the narrative that Muslims are benevolent members of the government and Dems care about the country. It really shows the depth of the progressive aims to ""[fundamentally transforming the United States of America](URL This is where the conspiracy theory comes in. Give me a little latitude to connect the dots, and let's see where this trail goes... #[An Alleged Muslim Spy Ring - Is This Why Rex Tillerson Cleaned House?](URL &gt;The mainstream media seemed far more interested in obfuscating the details regarding the Tillerson terminations than they were in covering what could be one of the most dangerous intelligence leaks in years, of which there has been but a peep out of any major news outlet. Captain Joseph R. John (Navy-Ret.) has stated that he believes the Muslim Brotherhood [fifth column has infiltrated U.S. Government](URL and if he is correct, the Awan brothers could very well be a part of this infiltration. The media is [90% Democrat](URL and I would argue that in recent years the mainline Dems have gone hard left, almost Marxist. They have an almost suicidal pact with Islamists. Where does this scandal connect with Middle Eastern Islamists? &gt;One might well look at the set of circumstances laid out above and see in it a scandal that would make Watergate look like a petty break-in. One might then scratch his or her head and wonder  why on earth would the New York Times or the Washington Post, which incidentally just hired John Podesta (speaking of horrendous cybersecurity!) as a columnist, have virtually no interest in the Awans at all? &gt;Do Carlos Slim and Jeff Bezos, one might ask, really believe they cant sell papers with such a story to tell? ###The Smoking Gun [EXCLUSIVE: House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs Committee Members Compromised By Rogue IT Staff](URL &gt;[Fox News](URL is told the employees made unauthorized access to the House computer system. &gt;Further, there were instances where House information was discovered in an external cloud server. The contractors in question reportedly were sending and storing House-related information in that off-site server. &gt;That violates House rules and it puts the House at risk, a source familiar with the investigation said. &gt;It is unclear whether the access issues exposed the Houses networks to potential hackers or spying efforts by unfriendly nations or terrorist groups, at a time when Washington is on high alert for such cyber-activity. Actually the last statement has been refuted. It has been alleged that Imran Awan had achieved a privilege escalation through [Social Engineering](URL Essentially Imran through the political clout of the Congressional leaders he worked for managed to convinced the Capitol Hill IT staff to escalate the Awans to super user privileges to work on the ""Congressional Machines"" in violation of accepted practices on the network. One device in particular was the Wasserman iPad compromised in the DNC Leak. It has been also alleged they may have had Podesta's password. Since the Dems approved the privilege escalation it is now forensically difficult to determine if the Russians leaked the emails or the ""enormously trustworthy and drunken"" Awan brothers sold access to the DNC servers. [House Hacking Suspects Could Read Every Email Dozens Of Congressmen Sent And Received](URL &gt;Imran Awan bullied central IT to bend the rules for him so there wouldnt be a paper trail about the unusually high permissions he was requesting. And their actions were not logged, so members have no way of knowing what information they may have taken, the central IT employee said. After obtaining access to the Capitol server system, the Awan brothers could control all aspects of a congressman system. They sold and configured the hardware setting permissions and remote access to maintain the devices remotely. Essentially the keys to the kingdom. Through congressional requests they managed to completely compromise the network. They could read email, transfer files, install applications (i.e. key loggers). The latter reports that the systems and network were completely compromised. Beyond that, Imran had bypassed IT key loggers and reporting systems by gaining remote access directly to congressional computers. [House Hacking Suspects Could Read Every Email Dozens Of Congressmen Sent And Received](URL &gt;The central IT staffer said any suggestion that the brothers access didnt span the full gamut of congressional intrigue was silly because they were the ones giving out permissions. The problem is that once they bypassed internal security there was no [logging of their actions](URL House authorities set their sights on the possibility that a remote server had been used to transfer files off of Congressional members computers. The investigation revealed that Imran had been [stealing money, equipment, and over charging for services](URL In total for almost 10 years and almost 80 Democrat members of Congress were compromised. This is where things go hinkey. Rather than turning the case over to the FBI the case is turned over to U.S.C. Police. They are investigating the theft, not the data breach. Let's state that again... ###The USCP are investigation the theft of Equipment not the Loss Of Congressional Data.

I can only speculate, but it would mean that a FBI forensic team would have to comb through all of those congressional computers to determine the extent of the security compromise and data lost. The Dems just didn't seem up for the inconvenience of allowing the FBI investigation to go forward. The Awan Brothers had the keys to the kingdom. Physical security is paramount to cyber security.

And Why Wont the Media cover this Evidence-based Story?](URL #So let's get in to the basics of the case.  The size and scope of the breach has various numbers in the reporting. It appears that the case is still expanding. This is why quoted text may have conflicting numbers. Earlier articles were still revealing the scope of the breach.  The numbers vary in the reporting but four Pakistani Brothers, Imran Awan, Abid Awan and Jamal Moiz Awan, and 2 wives get an IT job in Congress. Their has been some mention of a possible unrelated party involved as well. &gt;Additionally, it was revealed that these employees were paid more than three times the salary of a normal IT worker, grossing upwards of $5 million dollars combined during their tenure as IT professionals. While the average government IT professional earns about $55,000 per year, Imran Awan was being paid $165,130, Abid Awan grossed $164,980 per annum, and Jamal Awan $157,577 according to government records. &gt;Soon after Imran began working for members of Congress, Imrans and Abids wives  Hina Alvi and Natalia Sova  also began receiving [congressional paychecks](URL The DCNF found. Imrans employers included two members of the intelligence committee, Indiana Democrat Rep. Andre Carson and California Democrat Rep. Jackie Speier.  From 2004/2005 Imran and his brothers work their way in to Capitol Hill staffer jobs to an unspecified number of Congressmen. The reporting ranges from 30 to 80 depending on the article cited. It appears that about 30 representatives added the Awan brothers to their payroll, but they may have done associated and work for about 80 representatives. &gt;Imran Awan has a longtime relationship with some members of Congress, including working for Meeks and Becerra starting in 2004 and joining Wasserman Schultz's office in 2005. The IT staffer position expanded to include more than 30 representatives, including work under congressional members who were members of top secret level congressional committees (DHS, Foreign affairs, Select intelligence committee). &gt;Although personal office computers are not supposed to be used for Intelligence Committee business or classified material, [accessing these computers](URL is a high priority for foreign intelligence services because of the information they could glean about the committees work from unclassified emails. Their is contested information that the Awan brothers did get access to sensitive and classified information. While the emails and internal correspondence would be considered sensitive, but I have yet to confirm classified information was compromised, however a lot of circumstantial evidence prevent me from ruling out the possibility. The brothers are suspected of serious violations including accessing members computer networks without their knowledge and stealing equipment from Congress, over billing congress for work and parts, transferring data to a remote server, and bypassing normal security protocols for IT staff. Their Democrat benefactors allowed the breech of policy for the sake of convenience.  The Awans operated an external server, which is against all protocols concerning secured government information. &gt;Further, there were instances where [House information was discovered in an external cloud server](URL The contractors in question reportedly were sending and storing House-related information in that off-site server.  The Awans had special access to the White House and for Visas.  Multiple Democratic lawmakers have yet to cut ties with House staffers under criminal investigation for wide-ranging equipment and data theft. ``Imran Awan, a longtime House staffer who worked for more than two dozen Democrats since 2004, is still employed by Rep. Debbie Wasserman (As of March 5, 2017) In my first [article](URL I glossed over the kidnapping of the ""stepmother"" not understanding the significance of the event. When I read the [Fairfax County Police report](URL it just didn't grab my attention. One fact I missed was the use of electronic surveillance to control the movements and actions of the stepmother. I also failed to understand the Awan brothers were trying to gain access to funds in Pakistan. &gt;Congressional staffers allegedly held their stepmother in captivity with violent threats in a plan to use her to access money stashed away in the Middle East. The staffers are suspected of using their positions to enrich themselves.  &gt;They kept their stepmother in sort of illegal captivity from October 16, 2016 to February 2, the relative said, telling her they were in charge of her life and said she was not allowed to speak to anyone. The fact that she did not speak English made it easy for them to take advantage of her.  &gt;The brothers bugged her house with hidden listening devices and told her her movements were under constant surveillance and conversations within the house and over the telephone were being listened to. They would repeat what she had told people to prove that they were really listening.  &gt;But as soon as Shah passed away, they came into the house and whatever documents were there they stole, a couple laptops which were their fathers property, and left for Pakistan. ###And left for Pakistan... ###This article proves a number of things that should be explored. ###The first would be the use of surveillance equipment on the stepmother. Yes, I will concede that they could have bought the equipment to watch their stepmother, but I believe that is unlikely. The skills to run a surveillance operation are beyond most IT techs. It's not that they couldn't figure it out, they just wouldn't have the equipment. While the price is dropping, running an effective bugging operation is expensive and time consuming. Let's consider for they moment the brothers had the equipment for other jobs and repurposed the equipment for their surveillance of the stepmother. This brings us to the first logical leap... How many of you have used an in-line key logger? It's a simple, inexpensive device that can't be detected by antivirus software. It operates outside of the OS plugged into the USB port then the keyboard is plugged into the logger. The only real problem is obtaining access to deploy and recover the device. This brings us to the break ins. Why did the Awan brothers break in to 20+ Congressional offices when they already had full admin and remote access to the computers. It has already been proven they could access/edit/delete all the Congressmen's email, files, everything. It is even possible to remotely format a system. They could even transfer data to a remote off site server. There was no reason to break in to the offices to recover data, so what were they after? I believe it was to recover something other than data. It only stands to reason they had to recover surveillance equipment and or Spyware installed in the offices and systems. They were running a bugging operation on congress and had to retrieve the equipment before they lost access to it. #The second is why did they run? Here is the second logical leap. They began controlling the movement of their stepmother on the 16th of October, 2016. No one at least in the Democrat party even entertained the possibility hillary would not be the next president. Even the pro Trump supporters had to admit he was a long shot until 9pm on election night. Almost everybody believed hillary would win and the bodies would stay buried forever. Imran was familiar with the clintons and it has been reported Imran was quite friendly with bill clinton. He was about to dramatically expand his sphere of influence. The Awan brothers had no obvious reason for consolidating their assets and running to Pakistan. They began their consolidation of assets some time before October 16th. This implies planning and fore thought. They knew something was coming. What could have been lucrative enough or dangerous enough to have caused the need to pack up shop and get out of town Was it the health of their father that caused the need to control the family assets? They were clearly attempting to get control of the father's, Muhammad Shah, assets and power of attorney here and later in Pakistan to ""inherit"" the family assets, but that would not have been cause to run. They could have acquired the assets and remained in the United States. It has already been shown they had enough clout to get past any problems the stepmother could have caused. That would not have required a break in to 20 congressional offices and a complete exodus of the United States. In view of the events we know that was an exaggerated response to events, or something else had to change. Was it the DNC hack? The wikileaks of email systems they protected? Was it the proposed changes to the security clearance for staffers that made them run? Could it have been the new policy of FBI background checks for staffers and the request for a Top Secret/Compartmentalized information request for investigation of staffers attached to the Congressional Intelligence Committee. Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and Rep. Jackie Speier recommended the Awan Brothers for their positions and asked for their [TOP SECRET (TS/SCI) CLEARANCE](URL This .pdf is a request for a budget addition of $125,000 to conduct background investigations for the highest level of top secret/compartmentalized information (TS/SCI) clearance for Intelligence committee staffers. This is speculation, but the Awan brothers were getting the brass ring. They had access to congressional data that would only increase with the clearance. This brings in an angle of the story I had found little published information on Nanoset Technologies, but what has been reported in r/TruthLeaks is the beginning of something solid on the Awan brothers web of business interests. ###Nanoset Technologies &gt;Nanoset Technologies were a government contractor that sells IT equipment to the government, but the Awans were officers in that company while they were staff, which is a conflict-of-interest {{ But it's also a way to get equipment with backdoors into the Congress }}  &gt;There is a well-known Bangladeshi doctor at the VA in Baltimore, MD [name redacted]. She was living with the Awans, and was doing business with the Awans--an odd mix of IT and Medicine. She became a CEO of Nanoset Technology while she was an MD at the VA, and the business listed is just a condo. How much biz did they do with the US Government? This would have been very lucrative for their business and open a whole new horizon of contacts and government pork they could bid on, why would the run? What would the investigation turn up? I have to admit I don't know the answer here, but it doesn't make sense. What I do know is we have not been provided a good reason for why they were planning their escape to Pakistan prior to October 16th, 2016. #The Security Clearance Prior to 2017 IT Staff could get access to Congressional computers systems with a simple FBI background check. Members of Congress could pencil whip this if they vouched for the staffer. [Do Members of Congress Have Security Clearances?](URL House and Senate staff members with a need to access classified information are required to obtain security clearances. The Office of Senate Security and Office of House Security, respectively, have oversight over the security clearance process for congressional staffers, and background investigations are conducted by the FBI. [Another Major Democratic Email Scandal the News Media is Ignoring](URL &gt;According to the [CIAs Center for the Study of Intelligence](URL There are no written rules, agreed to by both branches, governing what intelligence will be shared with the Hill or how it will be handled. The current system is entirely the product of experience, shaped by the needs and concerns of both branches over the last 20 years.  &gt;The House reportedly only required background investigations of House IT staff in 2016. These investigations were to be applied retroactively to existing House IT staff unless a member signed a waiver attesting to their trustworthiness and judgment. ###Is the FBI investigating this case? No, it was found to be in the Jurisdiction of the D.C. Capitol Police. As had been stated the U.S. Capitol Police are investigating the break ins of the congressional offices. Despite [Paul Ryan's](URL assurances, I wont speak to the nature of their investigation, but theyre getting the kind of technical assistance they need to do that, this is under an active criminal investigation"", How is D.C. Capitol Police the best investigative force to work the case? Are they actually better suited to investigate a Congressional Cyber Security Breach and track the suspects guilty of the Federal crime [18 U.S.C.  371Conspiracy to Defraud the United States](URL and, or apprehend the subjects in Pakistan? Despite media claims that no Classified material was compromised, if the information Idaho Republican [Rep. Raul Labrador](URL is correct when he said, ""This is pretty outrageous. These are people who had direct connections and access to the House, to intelligence information,... This is actually something that could directly affect the national security of the United States, and I have seen very little reporting, and apparently, the Democrats are not that interested. An argument could also be made that the Awan brothers violated [18 U.S. Code  793 - Gathering, transmitting or losing defense information](URL I'm not a lawyer, but it looks more and more like a federal case. If so, then why are D.C. Capitol Police investigating a crime that could have tremendous scope? So while [The FBI Is Building a National Watchlist That Gives Companies Real-Time Updates on Employees](URL for the rest of us, the word of a Congressional Representative who was also grandfathered a clearance just for getting in to the club can also recommend their staff for clearances. I understand elections have consequences, and our representatives need access to make informed legislative decisions, but through a funded campaign literally anyone can get a clearance. Like an enemy intelligence services wouldn't try to run for congress. At least a spy would have a better criminal record that many members of Congress. My point is the staff needs additional scrutiny and changes to staffing policy might need to be addressed. The staff doesn't need to be trusted by the representative, they need to be trusted by the country.

If so, Which One? Is it so hard to believe the very capable ISI could have sent in operatives to infiltrate the Congressional Intelligence committee. After breaking in to 20 congressional offices and leaving the United States under suspicious circumstances, is it absurd to consider a foreign intelligence agency might be attempting to compromise the House Intelligence Committee. We're building a circumstantial case but there is no meat on it. Where is the connection to the ISI, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Iranians? Where is the connection to any extremists? ###The following are informed guessing. I haven't found direct evidence to support this speculation, but have seen [circumstantial evidence](URL that points strongly towards ties to a larger group.

[Another Major Democratic Email Scandal the News Media Is Ignoring](URL &gt;Were these IT staffers part of a plot by foreign actors to penetrate the House of Representatives and its computers? There has been speculation by some conservative journalists and experts that they may have had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. A former CIA officer told me she worries that the three Awad brothers, who reportedly are Pakistani immigrants, may have ties to the Pakistani intelligence service, ISI. While the political and faction associations are very fluid and complicated in the Middle East, it can be boiled down to [Shia and Sunni](URL interests in a very Broad sense. Iran and Syria are Shia while Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Pakistan are Sunni and they are fighting for control of the new Caliphate. [This is very broad and in its application difficult](URL but essentially true. This Why it is important to identify the players. Could the Awan brothers have been working for the ISI or Iran? This would also provide some insight to the motivation of the theft of data. Were the Awan brothers supplying information to Iranians during the nuclear talks? That would really define their motives, but we are left with more questions than answers. [Syria's Other Foreign Fighters: Iran's Afghan and Pakistani Mercenaries](URL &gt;A major reason for the disparity is that most accounts of the Afghan and Pakistani troops fighting under the Hezbollah flag in Syria mistakenly tend to minimize their ideological motivations. However, the Shia foreign fighter phenomenon could have serious ramifications for South Asia, because it serves as a pretense under which Tehran trains and indoctrinates militant Shia populations.  Enter Dr. Ali al-Attar, an Iraqi political figure who allegedly has connections to Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed terrorist group. While this is not an overt connection, but much like political corruption, individuals committing these types of crimes attempt to be careful. While many ultimately fail, they think through their moves and are harder to catch. Most complicated crimes, organized crime, financial crimes, computer crimes, are not discovered through direct evidence, but are uncovered through a [pattern of behavior](URL Remember they got Al Capone for tax evasion not boot legging or murder. &gt;Update: New concerns that this may have been an attempt by a foreign Jihadist organization to penetrate the House computer system arose this week in reports by The Daily Caller and The Daily Signal that the Awan brothers owed money to Dr. Ali al-Attar, an Iraqi political figure who allegedly has connections to Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed terrorist group. ###Who Is Ali A. Al-Attar, M.D The first thing that comes up is he was [suspended](URL Proxy Highlight) from practicing medicine - Maryland Board of Physicians charged Ali A. Al-Attar, M.D., a physician licensed to practice medicine in the State of Maryland. Dr . Al-Attar's failure to cooperate with the Board investigation was said to be deliberate by the board. Currently Dr. Ali al-Attar is wanted for tax evasion and defrauding [the medicare system](URL After losing his medical license in November of 2010 Al-Attar got to know the Awan brothers well enough to provide them an unsecured loan for $100,000. I'm sensing a relationship there. &gt;[Philip Giraldi](URL a former Central Intelligence Agency officer, wrote that Dr. Ali Al-Attar was observed in Beirut, Lebanon conversing with a Hezbollah official in 2012shortly after the loan was made. While Al-Attar was born in Iraq his parents were Iranian. At various times during the Bush administration, beginning in 2002, Al-Attar met with then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz along with a cadre of other Iraqi dissidents opposed to [Saddam Hussein](URL to discuss the war, Al-Attar has also been accused of helping provoke the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. Between 2002 and 2012 Al-Attar became disaffected with American actions in Iraq and began to formulate plans with Hezbollah. This would be reasonable considering his Iranian heritage. How does this bring Al-Attar and the Awan brothers together. This is another fact I glossed over not understanding the true significance of the brothers car dealership Cars International A, LLC, referred to as CIA in court documents. [How Radical Islam Penetrated The U.S. House of Representatives](URL &gt;And it is very interesting how the car dealerships finances were strangely interwoven with those of the U.S. House of Representatives. A car-dealing associate who was owed money by the brothers, Rao Abbas, also a Muslim, was placed on the congressional payroll. &gt;Abbas is listed as the IT professional for former Democratic Representative Patrick Murphy, a then-member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and its Subcommittee on Department of Defense, Intelligence and Overhead Architecture and (irony alert) Subcommittee on the NSA and Cybersecurity. Imran actually got Democratic Representative Patrick Murphy to place Rao Abbasi on his payroll. It is likely that Rao simply ran the dealership and got paid for being a part of the Awan crew. This seems like fraud to me. Isn't the FBI supposed to ask politicians about the misappropriation of funds? We'll come back to Rao in a moment. &gt;Imram later acted as [owner since CIA](URL was considered family business by the Awans, Abids one-time business partner, Nasir Khattak, said in court documents. The car dealerships finances consisted of byzantine transfers in which staff and cars were often swapped between it and a dealership next door, Khattak said. Lets look again at the car dealership, CIA (Cars International A). The records show a [confusing tangle of sales](URL and trades, but despite the 5 million the brothers took in from their work as congressional staffers, the brothers were constantly in debt. Imran brought in about 150 grand a year between himself and the 2 wives also brought in 6 figure salaries. Now we have Hezbollah-Connected Dr. Al-Attar putting cash in to the dealership after fleeing the country. At about the same time he is meeting with a Hezbollah leader, and Hezbollah gets busted for laundering drug money with used cars and consumer goods from China. The documentation for the business was in shambles and Imran maintained control of the dealers license. In essence, Imran was able to front for Hezbollah in their auto trading. Also while heavily in debt Imran was able to mass a portfolio of real estate properties. &gt;In addition to his other jobs, [Imran is a real estate agent](URL and Khattak is also a realtor who obtained the cash from Al-Attar and passed it through bank accounts used for real estate deals in Fairfax County, Va. &gt;Having lost my and Abids collective investment of $500k due to Awans mismanagement, [CIA] was further in debt $400k to other creditors, Khattak said in a lawsuit. While it is obvious Imran had some fairly sloppy business practices and was predatory to his partners he also was well suited to launder funds for Hezbollah. Imran had obtained the licenses necessary to support what had by this time become a model for moving money throughout the world. Several arrests have been made showing Hezbollah buys used American cars, ships them to Africa for sale or trade for drugs. At the same time Chinese consumer goods are being shipped to South America to trade for drugs in South America. Money is made from the transport and sale of drugs in to Europe from South America and Africa. The profits are then used to buy more vehicles in North America and consumer goods in China. The money is then laundered by banks like the Lebanese Canadian Bank with some of the money being siphoned off to pay for further terrorist activities. Beyond supporting their terrorist activities they also expand their allies and support in Africa, Central, and South America creating an international presence. It may be a coincidence that Imrans businesses model gots ideally in to the current standard fir money laundering by Hezbollah, but it is an amazing coincidence if it was accidental. ###[Hezbollah laundered money with used-car sales, U.S. says](URL &gt;NEW YORK (Bloomberg) -- Lebanese Canadian Bank and two Lebanese exchange houses helped launder more than $480 million for the Hezbollah terrorist group in a scheme that involved buying and selling used cars, the U.S. said in a civil complaint today. &gt;Federal prosecutors filed a lawsuit in Manhattan claiming the defendants took money from Lebanon to buy used cars in the U.S. and sell them in West Africa. Here is where I begin to speculate. Imran, at this point, has infiltrated or highest levels of security and at the very least has the ability to run the most compromising surveillance operation of the Democrat party, the Congress, the United States government and intelligence initiatives in history. The story of the break-ins makes the hillary server small potatoes. hillary may have opened foggy bottom to the world while she was sec state, but the Awan brothers gave congress to the Iranians, the Pakistanis, or given his predatory business practices, both of them. Then while Imran is compromising Congress he also builds a business that integrates perfectly in to Hezbollah's business model. What if Al-Attar was a fictional partner. The Keiser Sosei as it were for the business. Insane right? There is no way it's possible the business partner who hasn't been seen in the United States since 2010 didn't even exist right. The money trail is there. There are documents, loans, paperwork. Are you sure? [EXCLUSIVE: House Dem IT Guys In Security Probe Secretly Took $100K In Iraqi Money](URL &gt;Abid claimed the Iraqi doctor may never have existed. If as suspected, all of this is a charade, particularly if it is learned the mysterious Dr. Al-Attar doesnt exist or didnt sign the documents, then the whole matter rises to a higher level, he said in court documents. ###I want you to remember as quoted above... &gt;Abbas is listed as the IT professional for former Democratic Representative Patrick Murphy, a then-member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and its Subcommittee on Department of Defense, Intelligence and Overhead Architecture and (irony alert) Subcommittee on the NSA and Cybersecurity. &gt;By 2009, the family was simultaneously managing a full-time car dealership in Virginia, with Abid running day-to-day operations after contributing $250,000 in startup cash. It was called Cars International A, LLC, referred to as CIA in court documents. &gt;Imran boasted unusual clout among House Democrats, and was even pictured conversing with former President Bill Clinton. After Rao Abbas, who was owed money by the dealership, threatened to sue amid allegations of deception and theft, Abbas appeared on the congressional payroll and received $250,000 in taxpayer payments. ###And Debbie Wasserman Schultz refuses to fire Imran Awan.

We have 4 brothers and 2 wives start doing work for congress. Imran gets a job with Rep Gregory Meeks. The next year he also getting Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Jackie Speers to put him on their payroll. From there he manages to work in his brothers and Rao Abbasi on to the congressional payroll for an, as of yet, unspecified number of Congressmen (Somewhere above 30) Imran is pulling down somewhere around $150,000 and the others are getting between $100,000 and $150,000 apiece. Three times the normal salary for other staffers. How ya feelin' about your tax dollars now? Most likely, the brothers ran a social engineering hack to bypass security protocols and compromised congressional data security. What does that mean? They asked for passwords and access to computer systems and networks, and their congressional clients handed them the access. Additionally they most likely ran a surveillance operation and compromised a number Congressional Representatives. The brothers also established the frame work for Hezbollah to launder money for various items including narcotics to fund world wide operations. Either they did support Hezbollah or stumbled on the perfect operation. Incidentally the operation is perfect for support for Iranian intelligence to follow the progress of the Iranian deal. Yes, I know Imran arrived in 2005, but these operations progress and evolve as opportunities present themselves.

This is in regards to [this CNN article](URL I see a ton of misinformation in regards to what this likely is... a lot of people suggesting things that are just fundamentally incorrect (like morse code with ARP over the public internet). I think where this is confusing people is that the CNN article tries to dumb down the tech side of things, and in doing so confuses a number of terms (ie: confusing ""ping"" with DNS lookup). What I *think* is being reported (maybe it's misreported), is that the company which provided the DNS nameservers for trump-email.com was either compromised, leaked, or provided logs in response to a subpeona, detailing the DNS requests made to trump-email.com Based on this quote, I suspect it was a subpeona or some sort of really impressive state level traffic monitoring. (I'm just going to quote from the CNN article) &gt; Last year, a small group of computer scientists obtained internet traffic records from the complex system that serves as the internet's phone book. Access to these records is reserved for highly trusted cybersecurity firms and companies that provide this lookup service. This quote seems to make evident that requests made to that mail server were extremely rare, since they had only seen two DNS lookups to that mail server from a whole country. &gt; But Dyn (presumably URL which has a major presence on the internet's domain name system, spotted only two such lookups  from the Netherlands on August 15. This is alluded too with the defense: &gt;The bank told CNN it is now trying to identify the person or entity who disseminated this internet traffic. ""We believe that DNS traffic in mainland Europe was deliberately captured - in a manner that is unethical and possibly illegal -- in order to manufacture the deceit,"" it said. So either someone is logging all DNS traffic in Europe, which maybe they are, but that's a ton of data... or far more likely Dyn just logs requests. Regardless of how the data was acquired, according to CNN's sources it was obtained. It sounds to me based on this article that somehow there exists a log of DNS requests made to mail1.trump-email.com . Why would someone make a DNS request to mail1.trump-email.com? Pretty much just to send or receive mail. If someone wanted to send mail to mail1.trump-email.com, they'd have to look up the IP address associated with that subdomain. If you wanted to verify the mail being sent from mail1.trump-email.com is valid, you'd also want to do a DNS lookup. Regardless though, it's extremely hard to imagine why you'd look up the IP address for a mail server (mail1.trump-email.com) if you didn't intend to do something involving mail. &gt; Publicly available internet records show that address, which was registered to the Trump Organization, points to an IP address that lives on an otherwise dull machine operated by a company in the tiny rural town of Lititz, Pennsylvania. If that's true, then that means the DNS records were changed since then. There's no reason to believe that is not true, since it's very likely the DNS was changed for this domain as recently as March 7th, 2017 (URL , see the serial). I think this is the most damning evidence that I don't understand why it's being overlooked: &gt; As noted, **Alfa Bank alone represents 80% of the lookups**, according to these leaked internet records. That's pretty incredible. If this mail server was being used for sending mail traditionally, you'd never see such a high percentage of DNS lookups from one source. This is because *practically every* mail server will do a DNS lookup to verify mail it receives. That means that 80% of the mail from trump-email.com 's mail server was either being sent to alfa bank or sent from alfa bank to trump-email.com. &gt; Far back in second place, with 714 such lookups, was a company called Spectrum Health. Spectrum is a medical facility chain led by Dick DeVos, the husband of Betsy DeVos, who was appointed by Trump as U.S. education secretary. Without knowing how many 714 lookups is relative to the total, that doesn't say much; however, the fact that they know it's exactly 714 strongly suggests the traffic was logged legitimately or snooped. &gt; Together, Alfa and Spectrum accounted for 99% of the lookups. Wow. That's incredible. So essentially 99% of email to or from mail1.trump-email.com was between these 3 organizations. &gt; The corporations involved have different theories to explain the server activity. But they haven't provided proof -- and they don't agree. Alright, let's get into those theories now... &gt; Alfa Bank has maintained that the most likely explanation is that the server communication was the result of spam marketing. Bank executives have stayed at Trump hotels, so it's possible they got subsequent spam marketing emails from the Trump Organization. Absolutely not possible. Unless the trump organization *sends 99% of their email marketing* to these two organizations, that explanation is dead in the water. &gt; Alfa Bank said it brought U.S. cybersecurity firm Mandiant to Moscow to investigate. Mandiant had a ""working hypothesis"" that the activity was ""caused by email marketing/spam"" on the Trump server's end, according to representatives for Alfa Bank and Mandiant. The private investigation is now over, Alfa Bank said. No, for the same reason. &gt; Cendyn is the contractor that once operated marketing software on that Trump email domain. In February, it provided CNN a Trump Organization statement that called the internet records ""incomplete"" and stressed that they do not show any signs of ""two-way email communication."" For certain it's difficult to know which direction(s) email was flowing from, but that's irrelevant. &gt; Spectrum Health told CNN it ""did find a small number of incoming spam marketing emails"" from ""Cendyn, advertising Trump Hotels."" But it pointed to emails sent in 2015, long before the May-through-September 2016 time period examined by scientists. They should have *at least* 714 emails from this time period (sent or received), most likely *a lot more*. &gt; Spectrum Health said that it ""has not been contacted by the FBI or any government agency on this matter."" Sounds like the no one needs to based on these sources claiming this level of information. This source in the article is close: &gt; ""If it were spam, then a lot of other organizations would be doing DNS lookups. There would be evidence of widespread connectivity with devices,"" said L. Jean Camp, a computer scientist at Indiana University who has studied the data. Which is what I'm saying. Think about it. When a mail server sends or receives an email, it will almost certainly do a DNS lookup on the mail server which it is sending to or receiving from. If the trump organization was sending even a relatively small amount of mail in marketing campaigns, these two organizations could not represent 99% of the total DNS lookups. Are we supposed to believe that this marketing campaign went to like 40 other companies (1%) total in all those months? &gt; But Alfa Bank starkly denies ""any dealings with Cendyn."" And, it says, it's unlikely that it received any emails from that server. ""Mandiant investigated 12 months of email archives and it found no emails to or from any of the IP addresses given to us by the media."" That's pretty crazy if this *bank* is doing DNS queries that they don't know why they were taking place. &gt; The bank told CNN it is now trying to identify the person or entity who disseminated this internet traffic. ""We believe that DNS traffic in mainland Europe was deliberately captured - in a manner that is unethical and possibly illegal -- in order to manufacture the deceit,"" it said. This to me screams illegitimacy. How the information was obtained is besides the point to whether or not it is credible. How do you both say that no mail was was exchanged but yet complain about how the logs were obtained? Want to know my theory (without having the logs or historical DNS records for this domain)? I'd be willing to bet the TTL for the DNS record for their mail server was set to an hour. This means that the mail servers exchanging mail to/from trump-email.com likely cached the DNS record, allowing them to send/receive *far more* email than the individual DNS queries add up to. If the 19% from Devos' organization was 714 lookups for the mail server, that means there we're talking about roughly 3,570 *hours* of mail being exchanged if the TTL for the mail server's DNS was 1 hour). So we're talking about 148.75 *days* of mail being exchanged. &gt; From May 4 until September 23, the Russian bank looked up the address to this Trump corporate server 2,820 times -- more lookups than the Trump server received from any other source. May 4th - September 23th is 142 days. Both mail servers (trump-email.com doesn't look itself up) would have to maintain separate DNS caches. To me it sounds like the Devos system was sending mail relatively periodically, and the alfa bank server was exchanging mail with trump's organization practically 24/7. It seems likely to me that dyn.com was subpoena'd as a part of an investigation, and they provided this information freely to the US govt. --- [This is a popular theory people reference](URL I do not agree with it (why would you want to know a mail server's IP to sync a database); however, they seem to have access to the data I do not have access to. &gt; When averaged over months, these events charted an average time between connections to be 3660 seconds, or 1 hour and 1 minute. Really points to the idea that the DNS record for the mail server had a TTL (time to live) of 1 hour (3600) seconds, so after that record's cache expires they have to do another one to re-check it. "

There are many more articles beyond these, but what it looks like is the Shadow Brokers or some associated individuals pulled off a series of bank heists prior to releasing the applications to the open market. That also open the [question of what the NSA](URL was doing with the applications? They could have have been tracking ""suspects"" but it seems they could have also been moving money for any reason they chose without records being left in the banking system. The possible exploits were only exposed after a series of bank robberies exposed the power of the tools the NSA had developed. It seems once again crimes have exposed the government's illicit powers concealed by the intelligence community (IC). It is entirely possible that the tools were used legally and only to expose private records of terrorists and spies under FISA warrants, but who knows. The only thing that exposed these exploits was the theft. Kinda makes ya wonder, huh? The evidence and the different styles of hacking listed in the articles about the bank heists suggests that an initial group stole some NSA hacking tools and pulled off the Bangladesh heist. They may or may not have done Ecuador or the Philippines but it seems that at some point the exploits were sold on the open market, but that does not exclude some clandestine deals with other groups that also have employed the exploits. Once the initial 81 million was stolen they distributed the exploits to other groups who may have also attacked the SWIFT system and other targets to make forensics on nation state level zero day attacks that much more difficult. Several groups attempting independent attacks increased the attack vectors making identification even more difficult. It also appears that the hackers may have targeted banks that had the Trojans installed initially. So why would they go for relatively small scores when they essentially owned the SWIFT system. Could the hackers be attacking networks already infected with the Trojan. It really makes sense when you think about the banks they hit. The NSA installs the Trojans to ""observe"" suspected transactions. The hackers obtain the exploits, found the Trojans phoning home and used them to own the infected systems, modified the attack vectors to transfer money. Why not skip the phishing attack when there was already infected banks. Take the path of least resistance that leads back to someone the American government would never admit lead away from the hackers. Of course that means anyone including the IC could have manipulated transactions, but hey that wouldn't have been a robbery would it. Really the tools could have been used to track transactions, but they could have facilitated the IC surreptitious movement of money to fund operations. In all reality it was very clever, make a score, don't get greedy, prevent the creation of a M.O. to narrow investigations and identify the perpetrators. But identifying clever when they managed to steal exploits from the NSA and could use the exploits to attack the banking system. Just the fact that they can't be identified means they are pretty slick and the exploits are not for the novice user. There were some skills at work here. What else was done with the exploits and who are they?

Not enough room. I made a blog on Wordpress to help organize them all. I will post that at the end of this with mods permission. I have videos, pictures, and articles. I worked so hard on this for you guys, so I hope it all looks good to you. I have lies from every single news organization almost. Proven lies too. Not just ""I think they are lying"". A lot of it deserves more context, which I gave on my Wordpress, but will be less here because of room. I archived everything on the Wordpress too in case they delete anything. So let's start, don't want to waste room. Elon Musk being lied to about what Neil Armstrong and Eugene Cernan said on 60 minutes. [Video](URL Proof that the 60 minute reporter lied: [here](URL Here is 60 minutes apologizing: [here](URL ____ [Here](URL Is a video of 60 minutes pushing for soundbites. ____ [Here](URL is a video of Tucker Carlson having a guy named ""Dom Tullipso on his show"". The guy claimed to be an anti-trump protester, that paid people to protest against Trump. Turned out the guy was trolling and it was all a hoax. His name isn't even real. The Washington Times, TownHall, Inforwars, Truthfeed, and Gateway Pundit on this guys story, before realizing it was a hoax. Some of them did updates, but The Washington Times just changed their whole story (have the archive before and after on my wordpress), and some didn't update at all. ______ CNN Chris Cuomo said it was illegal to possess the Wikileaks documents [here](URL This is a complete lie. The First Amendment offers the same protection to the media as to the rest of us, including possessing illegal documents, as long as you werent involved in the original illegal hack. [here](URL is the proof of that. ______ CNN covers unfolding crime stories happening in two different cities from the same parking lot.

[Here](URL is Telsa proving he is lying, with graphs and everything. _____ CNN calls Assange from Wikileaks a pedophile without any evidence backing the claims: [here](URL I have a lot more [here](URL and by a lot more, sadly I mean tons and tons more. You can just go to the top link ""Media lies"" and it will show ""videos"", ""pictures"", and ""articles"". Click any of them and go to February and then it will show you everything. I wanted to organize it so it's easier to read, and you don't have a never ending scrolling page. If you have any type of video, picture, or article of the media lying or showing extreme bias please link them below and I will review and add it to the site. I'm sorry btw for the Wordpress not having an actual domain, I'll get it eventually. If you see anything on the site that is wrong, please tell me, I worked hard on it, and want it to be perfect! I will continue to update as much as I can too. Anytime I find anything, and plan on doing my own research in the next couple of days on stories I know that are complete lies, but need to get all the sources proving it. Also, any ads on the Wordpress are not mine. They are Wordpress ads. If you want to get rid of them use Ublock or Adblock of course. Enjoy. Edit: Oh, and if anyone knows how I can archive videos, I'd really appreciate that. I can archive all the links, but I don't know how to archive videos. I'd hate for any of the videos to be taken down and lost forever. Edit 2: Hey guys, I really appreciate all the kind words. I worked hard on this, so really I do. I'm doing this just to push information out to everyone. On all sides. I wanted people to realize that it doesn't really matter what side you are on, we have a huge problem with the MSM. I think there is nothing more important then Freedom of Press. I'm showing all the lies, but I will admit that there is another side where journalists do care. Some put their lives at risk for us to release information. For that they are nothing less than heroes. However, the side of the MSM that doesn't care at all about us. That lies to us. Uses us for profit or to push their agenda, they are doing a great disservice to the world. I don't know if anything should change, laws, regulations, ect, but I do know that we need to start keeping our eyes more open. We need to start questioning everything always. No matter what side of the political spectrum we are on. No matter where we live. No matter who we are. We need to start questioning everything, I believe more so now then ever. The MSM have become great magicians at deceiving us, and we now see more of them than the heroes. The biggest way we can fight back against this is just calling them out. Letting people know when the MSM lies. So please question everything, and share any information you find with everyone. I plan on making updates every week or so on my blog, with new MSM lies. I will continue to do research. I will continue to post their lies. I will use everything in my power to make sure that this information gets out to as many people as I can. Thank you guys again for the kind words, and remember please share all information you have on the MSM, for it's our responsibility that they don't get away with lying. "

Even before Capitol Police told chiefs of staff for the employing Democrats Feb. 2 that the Awans  including brothers Imran, Abid and Jamal, and two of their wives, Hina Alvi and Natalia Sova  were suspects in a criminal theft and cybersecurity probe, there were multiple signs that something was amiss.

However this is not true as seen when reading further: &gt; The CIA **made these systems unclassified**. &gt;Why the CIA **chose to make its cyberarsenal unclassified** reveals how concepts developed for military use do not easily crossover to the 'battlefield' of cyber 'war'. They were never classified or protected in the first place, they were kept from the public in the following manner: &gt;The CIA has primarily had to rely on **obfuscation to protect its** malware **secrets**. But now with a huge announcement from Wikileaks these exploits are no longer a secret. &gt;**'Cyberwar' programs are a serious proliferation risk** &gt;While nuclear proliferation has been restrained by the enormous costs and visible infrastructure involved in assembling enough fissile material to produce a critical nuclear mass, cyber 'weapons', once developed, are very hard to retain. &gt;Cyber 'weapons' are in fact just computer programs which can be pirated like any other. Since they are entirely comprised of information they can be copied quickly with no marginal cost. &gt; How **the CIA dramatically increased proliferation risks** They did it on purpose, same tactic as they did with terrorism. Create and fund terror organisations, then use those as an excuse to take away freedom. Why release it now Wikileaks? &gt; In Febuary the Trump administration has issued an **Executive Order calling for a ""Cyberwar"" review** to be prepared within 30 days. They want to influence Trump to crack down on internet freedom by creating this threat. The Wikileaks article is full of fear mongering, very important to make people afraid. &gt; Once a single cyber 'weapon' is 'loose' it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike. *Edit: Im no longer sure of the above comments, the Trump ""executive order on cybersecurity seeks to consolidate responsibility for protecting the government from hackers"". Seems to be largely aimed at government internal security. Trump wants to make government bodies responsible and accountable for their cyber security as stated by him:* &gt;I will hold my Cabinet secretaries and agency heads accountable, totally accountable for the cybersecurity of their organizations which we probably dont have as much, certainly not as much as we need, *Edit: Its not entirely clear to me yet whether this is a jab at internet freedom or a sincere effort to inform Trump of the deep state's cyber warfare capabilities. I realized this second angle just now so apologies for the title.* In any event it would behoove all of you to read the wikileaks article yourself and to not depend on rehashed stories from the media, read it yourself and ask yourself what the implications are for internet freedom. Either this wikileaks release is a CIA operation to destroy internet freedom or wikileaks is trying to strengthen US cyber security and fight against the deep state. Its hard to say conclusively at this point but keep these two possibilities in your mind when reading any further developments on this so you can adjust your worldview accordingly. "

This organization is essentially George Soross counterintelligence program. My sources tell me that in recent years Deibert has become disillusioned with his funders. Hes an idealist and a libertarian, but he has realized that a great deal of the citizen activism he has been supporting are Muslim Brotherhood fronts. He is starting to realize he has been a pawn and has scaled back his involvement in recent years. Recently, he published a huge takedown of the FBIs report on Russian hacking. I have heard some say the report was rushed out by the administration in order to deliver a blow to the Russians before Trump took office. While tying Trumps hands may be an admirable motive, I find it hard to swallow the idea that the U.S. defence and intelligence community, were so rushed that they were incapable of producing anything but such a badly constructed report.

Long known as a middleman between Putin and former Putin deputy Igor Sechin, who also happens to be Rosneft's chairman, Erovinkin was alleged to be one source for info in everyone's favorite piece of slander fiction, the Steele dossier. Of course, Erovinkin's death occurred prior to the wide release of the dossier, but not before it was known to at least US intelligence. I read of his death among a slew of Russian hysteria articles, along with allegations his death was originally ruled a homicide, but later softened to the usual ""heart attack."" Early articles were of UK origin, such as the following, before some left-leaning US media latched onto the story, adding suspicions along the way. URL This is but one of several prominent Russian official deaths to occur since the election, along with some firings and treason arrests of Russian cybersecurity guys (from I believe Kaspersky Labs). Anyway, as usual with such ""suspicious"" deaths, old age and more banal explanations are plausible, so I haven't automatically taken stock in the conspiracy angle, and I've barely noticed anyone on this sub do so either (this seems reserved for the Seth Rich's of this world). On a whim I tried to find out more about the guy and about his death, but only found the following as far as a legit Russian source in English. They reference a life.ru report as their source, Russian-language only. URL Naturally, I thought good places to look would be RT and Sputnik News, as they are far-reaching mouthpieces of Russian-related current events. While state-owned, they have been described as ""basically CNN,"" carrying bias but surely not wholly government-controlled. At both sites, I did simple searches for ""Oleg Erovinkin death,"" figuring that the sudden death of such a prominent figure close to both Putin and Sechin would receive some sort of hero's tribute in state-affiliated media outlets...I got zero results, nothing. I shortened it to just his name, and, also got nothing. Totally unmentioned in both headline and article texts in either of these prominent Russian news outlets. I instantly recalled that old widely-shared photo of Stalin standing by a Soviet official next to a well-populated dock, and how, following the guy's state-decided purging, the photo was edited to remove him entirely in classic Orwellian inspiration. URL Such a comparison is likely no shock for Putin or Erovinkin, as both were KGB before FSB, and maybe things haven't changed as much as we'd like to believe. Food for thought. "

The Russians were first found to use cyber warfare with a DDoS levied against the Georgian forces to cripple their communications. URL &gt;As it turns out, the July attack may have been a dress rehearsal for an all-out cyberwar once the shooting started between Georgia and Russia. According to Internet technical experts, it was the first time a known cyberattack had coincided with a shooting war. The Russians obviously have the ability to engage in cyber warfare, but did they hack the DNC, Podesta, and hillary's email server? The hack of the DNC needs to be considered with the hack of a Vermont power. The reason is the unusual similarity of the ""Ukrainian"" malware used to pawn the DNC and found Vermont power laptop. The real failure of the media is their inability to objectively report on a story that damages their accepted narrative. The media also throws around words like conspiracy and fake news. While there is no hard evidence to link any hacker to the attacks, the media seems to think the assumptions by the same beurocrats that found hillary innocent of obviously criminal activity also are certain the Russians hacked the DNC. How do you know that to be true? The biggest hole in this theory is that the Russians were using Ukrainian Malware v.3.1.7 while the current version is v.4.1.1b. By the way both versions are available on the Internet for download if you take the time to search for them. In finding it hard to believe the Russians arn't astute enough to write their own payloads. The only battle tested cyber army on the planet will put to use an Outdated Ukrainian payload, they wouldn't even consider updating it to the newest version? Oh, and to really nail down the media's take on the incident the exact same software is found on a disguised laptop associated with the Vermont power grid.

They claim Rich was so disgusted with the Clinton campaign corruption and the DNC cheating Bernie Sanders that he gave up the goods on the Clinton campaign. What are the odds of winning six coin tosses in a row? Then there is the unsolved murder of a DNC staffer, actually a computer tech with a specialty electronic voting. Yes I know Snopes has called this a conspiracy theory, and what are the odds of a DNC staffer with access to the emails and a true belief in the American system and Berney's actually gave them to Julian Assange. It's way more probable that the Russians hacked the DNC with outdated Ukrainian software. URL URL URL URL URL URL Here is another alternative, couldn't the Russians be hacking the DNC, but Seth Rich also gave the emails to Julian Assange or to someone else, that doesn't change the fact that the emails are real and if anyone takes the time to read them they are damming. This is the real problem with the Democratic Party. When Nixon lied, the Republicans turned their back on him and despised him for the disgrace he brought to the office. Ole BJ Clinton getting disbarred and impeached wasn't important, he was the Teflon prez. It didn't matter that obama lied about Bengazi because he won in 2012. It didn't matter that hillary advised the access of her office and ran a secret server releasing classified material to, well to anyone, even guccifer. That doesn't matter because she sports abortion, illegal Imagration, muslims, and gun control. Dems don't hold their leaders to account for their behavior in office because the means to the ends arn't important to modern Dems.

One official described the conclusion that this was intended to help Trump as the consensus view. URL The Story is a rehash from stories published in July; alleged Russian-linked hackers are from the groups Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear: &gt;Guccifer 2.0, the hacker behind the recent Democratic party email leak, is not a single operator but Russian cybercriminals designated Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear by investigators who have invaded the White House and the Bundestag between them, according to leading cybersecurity firms. URL What is interesting is that they are rehashing this old story when they don't think it influenced the outcome: &gt;A second official familiar with the report said the intelligence analysts' conclusion about Russia's motives does not mean the intelligence community believes that Moscow's efforts altered or significantly affected the outcome of the election. URL Greenwald has decent article on these new leaks: URL In my opinion, the MSM would only rehash an 6 month old news story by using anonymous sources to push an agenda.

(See how voco works here and cross reference with the voice in Hannity interview: URL As well as a sudden influx of CTR-sounding comments giving credence to it. Example ""Lots of excitement that he's alive now, this is legit!!! Super excited."" These comments immediately received tons of upvotes the speed of which could only indicate bots. But even more telling is that the words they put in Assange's mouth are implicitly confirming the CIAs narrative.

They need just enough from him but not too much that it would give away the fact that it's engineered.) Craig Murray is not authorized to talk on behalf of WikiLeaks, Assange said sternly. That the site FindingAssange.com is assigning the label of ""legit"" to what is clearly a forged interview also leads me to believe that the whole purpose behind the site was to stir us toward the Hannity interview and try to put to rest rumors that Assange is dead or captured, and worse, to make the fake ""Assange"" say things that are implicitly confirming the CIAs propaganda."

Framed by Soros to escalate war with Russia and subvert U.S. Democracy.,55,58vfgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/58vfgz/russians_not_behind_wikileaks_framed_by_soros_to/,2016-10-23 08:50:26,"This is a copy/paste from my original thread in /r/the_donald which was censored. Please help me track down how far this corruption goes. I want to warn you that this is long so to start off let me give you the TLDR; **When Soros and the DNC learned that they had been hacked, they immediately needed to devise a plan that not only discredited the leaks, but framed a narrative that would support their candidate Hillary Clinton. They used the Guccifer 2.0 account and their corrupt media to place blame on the Russians (and Trump). Below I'm going to connect the dots for you and reveal why Soros is manipulating our election.** Now for the details of how they created a narrative to squash Trump and escalate war with Russia. * If you watch this video, you get an inside peak to the Russian mindset. URL After watching that video you should be asking yourself, ""what does the Russian government have to gain with such a high risk move?"" * Wikileaks has been around for a while, and the hacks have been occuring for sometime * Donald Trump is not a Russian Plant and there would be no way of knowing he would win the Republican Nominee. He also received no direct help from Wikileaks or other hacking groups during the primaries * 16 Other Republican Candidates were a part of the primary, most like Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina were very Anti-Russia * The Russians have no way of knowing if Trump is pro-Russian. All they have is his word, since he has no track record to run on for policy decisions. * The Russians didn't know that Hillary Clinton would employ Brownshirt Tactics and rig the DNC to win the Democratic Nominee. If they did know, they would have idea that Jame's O'Keefe would blow the lid off it. Wikileaks started leaking information in June. Well before there was enough forward facing credible evidence to support the corruption claims. O'Keefe Videos URL URL **Now Let's Talk Hackers** Wikileaks has a perfect track record and has targeted the Clintons as early as 2010. They and other actors knowingly took advantage of the lack of technical security within some key servers. You're starting to see those leaks now. We also know that Wikileaks and Assange never reveal their sources. In the passed the U.S. government has had whistleblowers. Some examples are Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden. Another possibility could be **Seth Rich**. URL There's also been other high profile hackers in the passed like the original Guccifer and Anonymous. These hackers work independently from any one government. Hackers are notoriously hard to trace and can leave plenty of miscues on their trail. There's no way of knowing who was responsible for leaking this information. Unless of course someone comes forward to claim responsibility for the hacks. Enter **Guccifer 2.0** If you're not familiar with Guccifer 2.0, they are shoddy, unreliable, and produced nothing of any real worth. Their leaks consist of mostly forgeries, publicly known information or previous hacks. Guccifer 2.0 showed up on the scene claiming to be responsible for providing Wikileaks with the hacked DNC files within a week of the drop. No one has any previous knowledge of this person, but they claim to have hacked the Clinton Foundation, DNC, and other systems. If you read this article or as I would say, propaganda, a few things stand out. URL Making those emails public, say cybersecurity experts and US intelligence officials, is what shifted the hack from another Russian cyber-espionage operation to a game changer in the long-simmering USRussia cyberwar. Using the well-established WikiLeaks platform, as well as newly invented figureheads, ensured that the leaked emails got maximum exposure. Within 24 hours of the CrowdStrike report, a Twitter account under the name @Guccifer_2 was established and began tweeting about the hack on the DNC. One of thefirst tweets claimed responsibility for hacking the DNCs servers, and in subsequent private messages with journalists, including BuzzFeed News, the account claimed that it was run by a lone Romanian hacker, and that he alone had been responsible for hacking into the DNC servers and, later, the Clinton Foundation, as well as senior members of Clintons staff. The account offered to send BuzzFeed News emails from the hacks and appeared to make the same offer to several US publications, including Gawker and theSmoking Gun. Julian Assange, founder of the online leaking platform WikiLeaks Steffi Loos / AFP / Getty Images Within the week, WikiLeaks had published more than 19,000 DNC emails. Though WikiLeaks would not reveal the source, Guccifer 2.0 gleefully messaged journalists that he had been the source of the leak. Few bought the story  a language analysis on the Guccifer 2.0 account showed it made mistakes typical of Russian speakers, and when asked questions in Romanian by reporters in an online chat, Guccifer 2.0 appeared to not be able to answer. Meanwhile, metadata in the docs, such as Russian-language settings and software versions popular in Russia, ledcybersecurity experts to believe that not only were the emails leaked by Russia, but that Guccifer 2.0 was an account created by the Russian state to try and deflect attention. Why would a hacker working with Wikileaks who never reveal their sources ""gleefully"" contact the media and tell them they were responsible. They would simultaneously leave plenty of evidence behind they were Russian, despite the first Guccifer being Romanian. They would also leave behind forgeries, misinformation, to distract from the real leaks, yet be quoted as the source for Wikileaks in news articles. A few more key phrases from that article. Wikieleaks is described as a ""well established platform."" Guccifer 2.0 is described as a ""Newly Created Figurehead."" Who just happens to be conveniently Russian. This works perfectly for discrediting the leaks, matching Hillary's No-Fly Zone rhetoric, helps continue to push a Trump-Putin narrative and distracts from the real leaks and future leaks. Other redflag like articles pertaining to Guccifer 2.0: * URL * URL **Enter the Media** URL Here you have DNC Interim Chain Donna Brazile immediately trying to tie the leak to the GOP and presidential Nominee Donald Trump. ""Theres one person who stands to benefit from these criminal acts, and thats Donald Trump,"" she said in a statement Tuesday night, adding that Trump has ""embraced"" Russian President Vladimir Putin and ""publicly encouraged further Russian espionage to help his campaign."" Trump claims his remarks were meant in jest and that he has no knowledge of who hacked the DNC. Brazile also urged people to use ""extreme caution"" when accessing the documents, cautioning that they may contain malicious espionage software. She said the DNC legal team is reviewing the documents to confirm their authenticity, and warned that ""it is common for Russian hackers to forge documents."" In one swift interview Donna Brazile who is proven to be corrupt by giving debate questions to HRC is telling you not to look at the emails because you'll get spyware. Just like CNN told you it's illegal to look at them and you can only learn through the media. Just in case you do look at them, be aware that some are forgeries (Only Guccifer 2.0's, which they always push forward when other reputable leaks happen). Whenever there is a REAL leak, they always conflate it with fake ones and false flag accounts like Guccifer 2.0 (who they tie to Russia). URL Notice the last part of that article. The reporters also noticed that this time around, Guccifer typed in broken English and mainly used emojis. In the past, Guccifer typed in near perfect English. URL I want you to focus on one character in that article. **Deray McKesson** URL The manufactured outrage of BLM due to the fake Guccifer 2.0 leaks comes from a guy who lives in a house owned by wealthy donors to none other than George Soros' Open Society Institute. McKesson has also visited with Obama around July 13. Just over a month before the fake leaks. This brings us back to other leaks. Like DCLeaks which were confirmed to be real by Colin Powell. **DCleaks shows Soros trying to destabilize Russia** Read these articles. This is important. URL URL **If you haven't seen the Ex-KGB defector explain how to subvert a nation. I suggest you red-pill yourself right here.** URL This got me thinking. I think that Russia was never intended to be painted into a big bad enemy this election cycle. I think the issues were going to be mostly social bullshit, but Trump changed the narrative there. He blew the lead off a lot of big problems, and then you had a series of attacks in Europe and the U.S. combined with the explosion of the great migration out of the Middle East. This is a huge problem for the Democrats now, especially since we know how they were created. Which is also why Barrack Obama is trying to squash ISIS asap, to erase that stain on the last 8 years. The Democrats can't focus on the problems they created, so they try to deflect and distract. Read this wikieleaks Podesta email. URL Let's not forget the ""Great reset"" Clinton had with Russia. That ultimately left to this quote. Last week, he dismissed criticism of the vote by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as part of US efforts to weaken Russia, and on Thursday he upped the ante by accusing US special forces of being involved in the killing of deposed Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. ""Who did this?"" Putin said. ""Drones, including American ones. They attacked his column. Then - through the special forces, who should not have been there - they brought in the so-called opposition and fighters, and killed him without court or investigation."" A spokesman for the US military said the claim was ""ludicrous."" In a related aside, Mr Putin said John McCain, the US senator, was losing his mind, probably because of the torture he suffered as a prisoner during the Vietnam War. Putin was responding to remarks McCain made in October, when the former US presidential candidate said the killing of Col. Gaddafi should make ""dictators"" like Putin ""nervous."" Signalling that President Barack Obama's much publicized attempt to ""reset"" relations with Russia was now barely alive, Mr Putin added: ""Sometimes it seems to me that America does not need allies, it needs vassals. People are tired of the dictates of one country."" Russia has apparently been threatened by the Obama/Clinton administration for quite some time, and surely doesn't want a full blown war. They do see the destruction and wake that we've left in the region though. I don't doubt they pursue their own interests where they can. It seems super dangerous for them to get involved knowing the chance Hillary could win. She already made anti-Russian decisions as Secretary of State and had used anti-Russian rhetoric during the primaries. That's a big, big gamble and escalates tensions further. That is unless they believe because of the strain on our Alliances and terrible leadership of the passed 8 years we can not contest the Russian interests anymore in the ME and they don't fear retribution (no one wants war). Another, much more realistic option is they feel like the U.S. is screwing things up and poses as a very strong threat towards Russia and can't let Hillary become President at any cost (further destabilizes the world with her bad decisions and creates more hostility towards Russian interests and ultimately their stability which would result in War). In my mind its scenario two, but Russia would never take a risk this big to try to manipulate the election and is unfortunately at the mercy of the U.S. **This is why it is up to us Patriots. There is a global ploy to subvert our glorious Nation. Do not let Soros steal this election. Do not let them escalate war with Russia. They are criminals trying to manipulate you and bully their way to power. All of this is connected and a well concerted effort to remove your freedoms.** I believe the Clinton Foundation and other more serious leaks are coming. Stay Nimble, look for discrepancies and false flags. ALWAYS question the narrative, and get out and vote! "

Now they want attention. **Background** Authenticity of the leaks: 2 months back, The Shadow Brokers claimed to have hacked the Equation Group and set up an auction for the stolen package for about a million dollars in bitcoins (this was misreported everywhere as 1 million bitcoins). They posted in [a now deleted tumblr page](URL ([retrieved from archive.org](URL note the PGP keys) and [twitter](URL releasing a few files for free to confirm the authenticity, and [they've been confirmed as authentic]( URL &gt; On Monday, a hacking group calling itself the ShadowBrokers announced an auction for what it claimed were cyber weapons made by the NSA. Based on never-before-published documents provided by the whistleblower Edward Snowden, The Intercept can confirm that the arsenal contains authentic NSA software, part of a powerful constellation of tools used to covertly infect computers worldwide. &gt;The evidence that ties the ShadowBrokers dump to the NSA comes in an agency manual for implanting malware, classified top secret, provided by Snowden, and not previously available to the public. The draft manual instructs NSA operators to track their use of one malware program using a specific 16-character string, ace02468bdf13579. That exact same string appears throughout the ShadowBrokers leak in code associated with the same program, SECONDDATE. &gt; SECONDDATE is a tool designed to intercept web requests and redirect browsers on target computers to an NSA web server. That server, in turn, is designed to infect them with malware. &gt;SECONDDATE plays a specialized role inside a complex global system built by the U.S. government to infect and monitor what one document estimated to be millions of computers around the world. Its release by ShadowBrokers, alongside dozens of other malicious tools, marks the first time any full copies of the NSAs offensive software have been available to the public, providing a glimpse at how an elaborate system outlined in the Snowden documents looks when deployed in the real world, as well as concrete evidence that NSA hackers dont always have the last word when it comes to computer exploitation.

""When I came forward, NSA would have migrated offensive operations to new servers as a precaution,"" he suggested  a move that would have cut off the hackers' access to the server. &gt;As for who is responsible for acquiring and leaking the code on the Shadow Brokers' site, Snowden says ""circumstantial evidence and conventional wisdom"" suggest Russia. &gt; King's College London cybersecurity expert Thomas Rid tells NPR's Mary Louise Kelly the same thing. There's no hard proof, he says, but the capabilities required and the timing of the release suggest Russia.

According to this Russian propaganda site, Putin wants him dead or alive: URL Reddit founder /u/spez tried to counteract this by normalizing scores, on a per-sub-reddit basis, so no single sub-reddit could spam with bot votes (announcement &amp; discussion) * They immediately countered by creating multiple subreddits * It was very easy to identify these subreddits (e.g., r/WayOfTheBern), which popped up immediately after /u/spezs algorithm change. Despite being new with few subscribers, every post got thousands of bot upvotes. * Bernie Sanders own subreddit never promoted much Trump content, suggesting these sub-reddits were a direct result of the propaganda machine. A good way to identify Russian-dominated sub-reddits is search by domain rt.com: URL These subreddits came up: r/The_Donald, r/GreenParty, r/WayOfTheBern, r/texas, r/conspiracy, r/podemos (Spanish sub), r/worldpolitics, r/WikiLeaks, r/DNCleaks, r/TheNewRight, r/Libertarian, r/NeverHillary, r/POLITIC, r/uncensorednews, r/EndlessWar, r/altright, r/ChristiansAwake2NWO, r/governmentoppression, r/worldtoday, r/Soros, r/Sorosforprison, r/obamascontroversies, r/Political_Revolution, r/1984isreality, r/badgovnofreedom, r/ConspiracyFacts, r/SargonofAkkad, r/ronpaul, r/WhiteRights, r/collapse, r/WesternTerrorism, r/AmericanPolitics, r/Intelligence, r/uspolitics, r/paleoconservative, r/IslamUnveiled, r/Free_Assange, r/wikidecentralized, r/The_Europe, r/altnewz, r/cults, r/HillaryForPrison Theyve even entered subreddits like r/SandersForPresident. Example posts: * ""Media and Clinton Camp Quickly Try To Distract People from the Content of the DNC Leak by Blaming it on a Russian Conspiracy."" * ""This is why Bernie keeps talking about working with the Russians. Super important, as it shows Hillarys disingenuous flouting of foreign policy effectiveness, and how messed up the media situation is."" In 2013, RT.com was banned from r/news for spamming (was dominating the sub with 10% of the submissions): URL Discussion on r/The_Donald botting: URL **Instagram** 375K Russian bots promoting Trump: URL **Twitter** During 2nd debate, 900K Russian bot tweets, compared to 200K HRC/CTR bot tweets. Theres two categories of bots * Alt-right trolls * Russian bot accounts pretending to be patriotic Americans Ironically, most Trump supporters arent even on Twitter. Tricking the Twitter trending algo: &gt; Lets say you had a hashtag you wanted to get trending. You have a thousand bots (or Russian Trolls) and a popular account like Ricky Vaughn. You have the bots start using the hashtag, they start flooding twitter until it gets a high count (but not in the top 20 trends) then have a real person, Ricky Vaughn, start pitching the hashtag to his followers. Here is where the window of timing kicks in: within minutes, Ricky Vaughn can have something trending, but before he gets the hashtag to the top 15 you have almost all of the bots automatically delete their tweets with the hashtags. Youve now started a trend quickly and have had it associated with Ricky Vaughn and not a 1,000 odd bots or Russian trolls.* **WikiLeaks politically aligned with Russia** A friend who contracts with the White House on cybersecurity told me that the **DNC hacks were done by Russians**. But due to political reasons (since we also hack Russia regularly), US Government cant accuse them officially. Hillarys offhanded conspiracy-sounding comment about Russian hacking was true: URL * The hackers who spent at least a year lurking inside the Democratic National Committees computers dont appear to be just any cybercriminals. Theyre suspected in a number of high-profile attacks against the US and other Western countries going back almost a decade. Researchers first detected Cozy Bear in the mid-2000s and Fancy Bear in 2010. * With Fancy Bear we have medium level confidence its **GRU**, which is **Russias military intelligence agency**, and with Cozy Bear we have low level confidence its **FSB, the Russian federal security service**. * We, too, practice cyberespionage and  were not bad at it. I think its a good idea to at least think about the old saw about people who live in glass houses shouldnt throw rocks, said Clapper, stressing the need to draw greater distinctions when it comes to the types of cyber threats. * Intel chiefs draw distinction between digital espionage and malicious hacks Assange seems to be inappropriately aligned with Russia: * Assange has held interviews on **Russia Today**. * He has not released anything on Russia, despite their bombing of Syria. * He asked: Why criticize Russia, a bit player on the world stage, compared with countries like China and the United States? * Every man and his dog is criticizing Russia, Assange said. Its a bit boring, isnt it? There was an attempt by John Kerry &amp; CIA to get Assange to cooperate. John Kerry asked Ecuador to cut his internet. CIA gave veiled threats of imprisonment and tried to smear him with child molestation via a front company. I read tons of DNC/Podesta emails from Wikileaks. Yes, U.S. media (New York Times and others) is pro U.S. establishment, and is a propaganda machine. Yes, there was unfairness at the DNC towards Bernie. Yes, Hillary makes money off her political standing. But their biggest sin is that theyre very bureaucratic and ineffective. The cronyism isnt actually criminal. In politics, trading favors is a standard practice. No man rules alone. You must deal with power structures, or you will not accomplish anything. Trump may be more independent than HRC, but he is already resorting to these practices, and its pretty normal stuff: Trumps Potential Cabinet Fills Out With Washington Insiders The propaganda around Wikileaks encourages distrusting DNC, Podesta, and Hillary. These are patriotic leaders who on balance are trying to help our country, even if we disagree with their policies or their bureaucracy. Its our right to vote them out, but its also important to understand that Russia is manipulating our opinion for doing so through propaganda. **Silicon Valley insiders to the rescue** Reddit, Facebook, Buzzfeed, and Twitter founders all supported HRC. These guys are all clued into US government &amp; intelligence. Buzzfeed helped with a smear campaign against Assange for example. Always the contrarian, Peter Thiel is one of the few SV leaders who supports Trump. As chairman of Palantir, he jokes: Is Palantir a front for the CIA? No, the CIA is a front for Palantir. Heres the Palantir dossier to the CIA against Wikileaks, ironically released by Wikileaks: URL By the way, given most of these insiders are good people, and most of them support Hillary Clinton, it makes me think **HRC is not actually corrupt**, but a patriot. Given Peter Thiel basically is in the CIA and supports Trump, **Donald Trump is probably also a patriot**. Our politicians are not that bad. **Russian global strategy** Putins goals: * exploit disunity in order to undermine NATO * block US missile defense programs * revoke economic sanctions imposed after the annexation of Crimea Putins strategy (source): 1. Recognize that a segment of people in Western Societies are unhappy because theyve lost status as a result of globalization and neoliberal economic policy. Despite overall global inequality decreasing, intra-national inequality has increased. 2. Promote/fund right-wing/nationalist populist groups in Western countries that feed off of this unhappiness. 3. Watch as nationalistic, anti-neoliberal populism leads to dysfunction of teamwork between Western countries. (Brexit, breaking up the EU, making the USA non-interventionist.) 4. Take advantage of this power vacuum to expand Russian interests in former USSR states (Georgia, Ukraine, Estonia, Poland, Moldova, etc.). Its working globally USA: URL * Distributing DNC emails on social media amplifies hard feelings over Bernie Sanders loss to Hillary Clinton. It creates stress division, confusion and cynicism among Democrats and Americans * everything from Twitter bots to pump up the popularity of news, to trolls based everywhere, to slickly produced conspiracy theories blended with real analysis * I think the Russians have picked up that across the West there is a widespread apathy amongst voters and mistrust of politics and government, said Matthew Sussex of ANUs National Security College, who studies Russian foreign and security policy. Anything you can do to increase that distrust serves Russian interests. * using leaked information posted online to terrorise politicians. * Despite all of this subversive activity, democracies defenses against information war are weak. Democracies arent in the business of telling their citizens what to think. The Internet allows propaganda to directly reach citizens, making it harder for mainstream media to debunk false stories.

How troll armies work on the inside: URL * The e-mails indicated that members of the brigades were paid 85 rubles (about 3 US dollars) or more per comment, depending on whether the comment received replies. * Some were paid as much as 600,000 roubles (about US $21,000) for leaving hundreds of comments on negative press articles on the internet, and were presented with iPads. * 22 of 60 countries examined have been using paid pro-government commentators to manipulate online discussions * St. Petersburg Internet Research Agency, which employs at least 400 people in 2013. hired young people as Internet operators paid to write pro-Kremlin postings and comments, smearing opposition leader Alexei Navalny and U.S. politics and culture * Each commenter was to write no less than **100 comments a day**, while people in the other room were to write four postings a day, which then went to the other employees whose job was to post them on social networks as widely as possible. * such practices create a chilling effect on the few independent media outlets that remain in the country * One Twitter bot network was documented to use more than **20,500 fake Twitter accounts** to spam negative comments after the assassination of Boris Nemtsov and events related to the war in Donbass * commentators sometimes leave hundreds of postings a day * To avert suspicions, the users sandwich political remarks between neutral articles on **traveling, cooking and pets**. * Overwhelm comment sections of media to render meaningful dialogue impossible. The effect created by such Internet trolls is not very big, but they manage to **make certain forums meaningless** because people stop commenting on the articles when these trolls sit there and constantly create an aggressive, hostile atmosphere toward those whom they dont like. The trolls react to certain news with torrents of mud and abuse. This makes it meaningless for a reasonable person to comment on anything there. Leaked files exposed troll den was strictly regulated by guidelines: * Any blog post written by an agency employee must contain no fewer than 700 characters during day shifts and no fewer than 1,000 characters on night shifts. * Use of graphics and keywords in the posts body and headline is also mandatory. * Bloggers are also provided with technical tasks  keywords and talking points on specific issues, such as Ukraine, Russias internal opposition and relations with the West. * On an average working day, the workers are to post on **news articles 50 times**. * Each blogger is to maintain **six Facebook accounts** publishing at least three posts a day and discussing the news in groups at least twice a day. * By the end of the first month, they are expected to have won 500 subscribers and get at least five posts on each item a day. * On Twitter, the bloggers are expected to manage 10 accounts with up to **2,000 followers** and **tweet 50 times a day**.

The site is labeled a Russian propaganda site in the above list. This **former US Congressman** is now distributing Russian propaganda through his personal website. **Hiring left-wing American media personalities** In addition to co-opting the American right-wing, it is also co-opting the left-wing, by **literally hiring them** for Russia Today. Ed Schultz is a left-wing former **MSNBC** personality. Many saw him as the liberal answer to Rush Limbaugh.

Source: URL **Promoting left-wing Occupy Wall Street** This is Russia Today covering the protest: URL The Kremlin isnt liberal or conservative. Its just trying to: * create division between liberals and conservatives * make Americans distrust their government &amp; media **ZeroHedge, an American finance blog** ZeroHedge.com is a financial blog that gets 46M monthly visits, with visitors primarily from **US, Canada, UK, Australia, and Germany**. It has been outed as a Russian propaganda platform: * Founded by Daniel Ivandjiiski, a Bulgarian-born former hedge-fund analyst who was barred from the industry for insider trading by FINRA in 2008. * The website is registered in Bulgaria at the same address as that of Strogo Sekretno, a site run by Ivandjiiskis father, Krassimir Ivandjiiski  formerly KGB. * They turned high-frequency trading into a big political issue. They found a hack (Eric Hunsader) and kept spreading his lies until Michael Lewis wrote a book about it and completely legitimized it. * Zero Hedge has grown from a blog to an Internet powerhouse. Often distrustful of the establishment and almost always bearish, its known for a pessimistic world view. Like posts entitled `Stocks Are In a Far More Precarious State Than Was Ever Truly Believed Possible` and `Americas Entitled (And Doomed) Upper Middle Class` * Zero Hedge has the MO of a Soviet agitprop operation: it reliably peddles Russian propaganda and very often links to Russia Today. * Lokey said: I cant be a 24-hour cheerleader for Hezbollah, Moscow, Tehran, Beijing, and Trump anymore. Its wrong. Period. * he was pressured to frame issues in a way he felt was disingenuous, summarizing its political stances as Russia=good. Obama=idiot. Bashar al-Assad=benevolent leader. John Kerry=dunce. Vladimir Putin=greatest leader in the history of statecraft. * Source: URL **Frances rising nationalist party linked to Trump and Russia** Marine Le Pen is president of the National Front party of France  a nationalist, conservative party thats gaining power in France. (wikipedia, dailybeast, nytimes) * Presidential candidate in France, currently neck and neck for the lead on the first ballot * Her party has received a **$11.7 million loan from a Russian bank**, as an apparent reward for her far-right partys support of Russian stances in the Ukrainian conflict * Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder and retired leader of the party, has also taken a separate $2.5 million loan from an obscure Cyprus-based holding company called Vernonsia Holdings Ltd. via a Swiss bank account. The holding belongs to Yuri Kudimov, a former **KGB** agent who ran another Russian bank called VEB Capital, the financing arm of the Kremlin. * She has proposed **breaking Frances relationship with NATOs command in favor of a new alliance that would include Russia**. * Her father, Jean-Marie, has long had ties to Russias ruling officials. In recent years, Le Pen family members have been frequent visitors to the Russian Embassy. * Shes anti-USA and says: the process of **demonization of Russia** is taking place at the level of the EU leadership and at the wishes of the US, which is trying to create a unipolar world * Pro-Putin: **I admire Vladimir Putin**. He makes mistakes, but who doesnt? * Ranked second-most influential member of European parliament, after president of that parliament * Runs similar campaign as Trump, against illegal immigration: Europe cant welcome everyone We would be pleased to take them all in our boat, but its not big enough. Well all go to the bottom. While investigating the subreddits with heavy activity from rt.com, I found r/Le_Pen: Its the r/The_Donald of France. You see a similar language as r/The_Donald * France. Upvote so when people Google France Le Pen shows up. MARINE * Brexit, President Trump. I have total faith in Le Pen. Godspeed navigators! **PEPE** They use the same mascot, Pepe, as r/The_Donald * We Have Your Back **HAUTE ENERGIE**  French version of **high energy** phrase on The_Donald. * **CUCK**. Lets make sure when people google CUCK, they see this picture at the top  Cuck was used by r/The_Donald for anyone who supported Hillary. **Steve Bannon** and these guys are collaborating * I answer yes to the invitation of Stephen Bannon, CEO of @realDonaldTrump presidential campaign, to work together. * URL * Marion_M_Le_Pen is Marine Le Pens niece: URL Whos Steve Bannon? * **Trump Administration**s newly appointed **Chief Strategist** and Senior Counselor * Previously, Trumps campaign chief * Executive chairman of the conservative website Breitbart News * Co-founder of the Government Accountability Institute, where he helped orchestrate the publication of Clinton Cash Vocabulary shared by r/Le_Pen and r/The_Donald : * The_Donald: **God King**; Le_Pen: **Goddess Mother** * brigade * high energy / French: haute energie * cuck / cucked (weird Le_Pen uses this term a lot too) * based * kek * rare * centipedes * BTFO * shitpost * trigger SJWs * navigators * anti-globalist Most of this vocabulary comes from 4chan.org, a site with 106M monthly visits. Its an anonymous English-language imageboard website, with a primarily **US, UK, Canadian audience**. Russian trolls have probably been dominating 4chan for a while, and the alt-right movement started in 4chan. * The alt-right is a loose group of people with right-wing ideologies who reject mainstream conservatism in the United States. The writings of the group are largely Internet-based and are found on websites such as 4chan and 8chan, where anonymous members create and use Internet memes to express themselves. (URL * During the presidential debates, a group of 4chan users urged others to skew online polls by repeatedly voting for Trump on online polls. The bogus polls were cited by Trump, Hannity, and Limbaugh. So Trump, Le Pen, and Russia are possibly linked. Both Trump &amp; Le Pen ran similar platforms on conservative nationalist parties in France &amp; USA * Pro-Putin, pro-Russia * Anti-war, anti-NATO * Anti-immigration Both Trump &amp; Le Pen are supported by Russian propaganda troll armies using similar memes via r/The_Donald and r/Le_Pen Trump and Le Pen parties are working together via Trump Administrations Steve Bannon Le Pen uses Russian funding through banks owned by former KGB **Conclusion** Do I think Trump is a Putin puppet? The evidence around Le Pen makes me pause, but I dont think theres enough evidence to make a call. It could simply be that Trumps promise to get America out of expensive wars is what Putin wants. Hillary was more hawkish against Russias bombing of Syria, so Putin didnt like that. So it would make sense for Putin to use his troll army to support Trumps election and WikiLeaks to hurt Hillarys chances. Russian propaganda is dividing our country, feeding both the left and right. This is what Russia wants us to think: * Trump supporters are racist! * Trump protesters are violent! * Government is corrupt! * Media is corrupt! By pretending to be patriotic Americans posting this content on social media, theyre using social psychology as a weapon. Thinking your fellow Americans think this way influences your own opinions, more than any logical argument. It has a real effect of changing American opinion, and pretty soon, we all actually start thinking this way. I know our government also spreads propaganda. The ideology is indeterministic. But at least, the propaganda is more optimistic. At best, this means the top channels for online political discourse are now heavily polluted by Russian trolls and bots, and we have to be careful. Even our personal Facebook feeds are polluted with propaganda shared by our unwitting Facebook friends. It takes effort to distill truth from fiction. So take everything you see online with a grain of salt. At worst, this means people actually engage with the propaganda, and are brainwashed or slightly psychologically terrorized. There are studies that show that watching TV exposes your mind to triggers (sex, tension building up in a TV show, terrorist attacks) and immediately reduces your willpower, increasing your chances of overeating, smoking, or whatever existing addiction you have. This Russian propaganda is even more pernicious because on top of the normal fight or flight response, it encourages an ideological shift towards indeterministic pessimism. Metaphorically or even literally, this makes people want to drown themselves in opiates (video games, weed) because the real world seems dark. It definitely doesnt make anyone believe in the future, believe they can trust their neighbors, or believe they can engage with government in a deterministic optimistic way. But theres hope. Psychology says that being aware of goal contagion or propagandas presence is actually a form of counteractive control, and with this awareness, seeing more propaganda actually strengthens willpower against its message. So hopefully, all this research helps with that. UPDATE: Facebook &amp; Google are fighting back on fake news already: * URL * URL (**original Medium post** with better formatting &amp; sources: URL"

The email shows Clinton specifically telling Morgan Stanley that the Simpson-Bowles commission put forth the right framework for dealing with fiscal challenges. She also said the Simpson-Bowles framework and the big elements of it were right. As the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reported in 2011, that commission proposed a plan to cut benefits for the vast majority of Social Security recipients, weaken the link between a recipients benefits and past earnings (which could undermine public support for the program), and, despite the claims of the co-chairs, fail to protect most low-income workers from benefit cuts. --------------- Edit: added information from an email about a speech on Isis - not a paid speech **THROWING SHADE AT ARABS** Email Discussion about including disparaging comments about Arabs in Clinton speech on ISIS: ""We can throw some more shade at the Arabs, though.

""We now have a John Anzalone memorial paragraph in the speech."" (john anzalone is a Clinton's pollster, I think this is supposed to be a joke) URL -------------- Edit: added information from an email about Israel - not a paid speech **ISRAEL** This email is from a Clinton surrogate who spoke with Netanyahu. We discussed possible economic initiatives to help the Palestinians, like more Palestinian investment in Zone C, and/or an agreement to limit settlement expansion to the established blocs that under the Clinton parameters would be in Israel after any negotiation. Abu Mazan continues to talk about retiring, as he has done for years, but seems more serious now. There is no obvious successor if he leaves, other than the guy in jail. (Added Marwan Barghouti) Israel Arabs are a real problem. The government had to dismantle the northern branch of the Islamic Association because they were radicalizing the Israeli Arabs, who are 20% of the population. But the Prime Minister and the Defense Minster, and certainly the military and intelligence community, want to keep the PA. There is still intelligence sharing on radicals, but when Israel asks them to arrest the radicals they identify, they refuse, and ask the Israelis to do it, and then protest the arrests. But this is all part of a scenario of cooperation. However, if the PA takes Israel to the International Criminal Court, this would be a huge problem and a potential game changer in terms of their relationship with the PA.

250,cybersecurity,conspiracy,Anyone else think Anonymous is a CIA founded group?,16,4c6z57,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4c6z57/anyone_else_think_anonymous_is_a_cia_founded_group/,2016-03-28 07:06:09,"I believe the CIA, Mossad, FBI, or some other shadowy alphabet government agency could not only be behind the information we've been seeing coming out of wikileaks - but they could also be behind, or encouraging, the internet group ""Anonymous"" which seeks to 'defend anonymous free speech'. Former Pakistani General: CIA, Mossad behind WikiLeaks Reports TEHRAN (FNA)- A former Pakistani army commander said that the disclosure of classified documents by the whistleblower site of Wikileaks is a US plot to create rift among friendly and neighboring states. Whether or not wikileaks and anonymous were created by the CIA, or were hijacked by the CIA, or were legitimate operations that the CIA is using to steer public opinion, there is little doubt in my mind that the groups are, indeed, catalysts for something greater than their stated purpose. Google CEO Eric Schmidt has said anonymity on the Internet is dangerous Arguing that anonymity on the Internet is dangerous, Schmidt had reportedly said, ""In a world of asynchronous threats, it is too dangerous for there not to be some way to identify you."" He also said governments may eventually put an end to anonymity. ""We need a (verified) name service for people,"" he said. ""Governments will demand it."" It's dangerous to not be able to identify me? Why? Where is the danger in that? Governments will DEMAND that internet users be identified? Why? Where will this demand stem from? Last summer the FBI quietly established a special working group with U.S. intelligence and other agencies to identify and respond to cyber threats against the United States. The bureau's justification for next year's budget, in which it has requested an additional 70 agents and more than 100 support personnel for its cyber division, says the task force ""seeks to address cyber intrusions presenting a national security threat."" The budget justification says the task force will ""develop a global view of information warfare activity; identify intelligence gaps; create a strategic framework to develop operations; de-conflict investigations and operations (and) generate timely intelligence."" Obviously the infrastructure for seeking out these online threats to ""national security"" has been in place for a couple years now if not more. All these letter agencies need now is someone or something to shed a public light on the cyber threats America is facing. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff told a bloggers' roundtable last month that cybersecurity was ""the one area in which I feel we've been behind where I would like to be."" ""The general public is not aware (enough) of the threats,"" he said. ""People need to be sensitized to potential vulnerabilities"" Wikileaks is the perfect opportunity to get the public aware about the threats we face from the cyber domain. But where did their documents come from? Anyone can submit information to wikileaks. If the info is from Private Manning, how did a private get access to so many classified documents? Did someone maybe have foreknowledge that he would do what he did? Something doesn't add up, but let's forget about that, because according to a Rasmussen Poll, the Majority Of Americans Believe WikiLeaks Committed Treason. Now whether or not the poll is accurate is another question, but don't let that stop you from believing that these internet 'bad guys' need reigning in. Not only does our country have classified information being sent around the globe via the web, risking our national security, but a second cyber threat has popped up in direct response to dealing with the first! MasterCard.com has been taken down after a second distributed denial of service attack by Anonymous. MasterCard's payment processing systems were affected during the first DDoS attack on Wednesday, with many consumers reporting that they were unable to pay for goods online. Businesses reported a corresponding drop in trade during that first attack. You mess with classified information, and sure some citizens might get upset over the principle of the matter - but they'll move on with their life. People have short memories. You mess with their money, though, and watch out. There's nothing a consumer society will condemn more than those who try to put the brakes on their consumerism. Can't buy gas? Can't play on e-bay? Can't Christmas shop? ""It's those evil internet hackers, the anonymous ones. Damn that anonymity to hell."" The people, and the government, soon will be seeking... no, DEMANDING, the END of internet anonymity. And for what? What purpose does it serve? A much-cited 1995 Supreme Court ruling in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission reads: Protections for anonymous speech are vital to democratic discourse. Allowing dissenters to shield their identities frees them to express critical, minority views . . . Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority. . . . It thus exemplifies the purpose behind the Bill of Rights, and of the First Amendment in particular: to protect unpopular individuals from retaliation . . . at the hand of an intolerant society. To sum this all up, whether or not there are alphabet agencies involved in this recent internet wikileaks/anonymous drama that's been unfolding before our eyes, we need to remain very vigilant about what direction these events are taking us. I do believe there are tyrannical forces at work around the world, not always successful, but they are exerting their influence on people, on governments, and on corporations. To destroy anonymity, and thereby reducing open dissent, would be a step towards an Orwellian police-state. Could there be other motives to destroy net anonymity? Sure - I'd love to hear some ideas. All you have to do is find out WHO BENEFITS? Follow ""the money"" as it were. And I'll leave you with this. Secrecy is the cornerstone of all tyranny. Not force, but secrecy...censorship. When any government, or any church, for that matter, undertakes to say to its subjects, ""This you may not read, this you must not see, this you are forbidden to know,"" the end result is tyranny and oppression, no matter how holy the motives. Mightily little force is needed to control a man who has been hoodwinked... Contrariwise, no amount of force can control a free man, a man whose mind is free. No, not the rack, not fission bombs, not anything. You cannot conquer a free man; The most you can do is kill him. - Robert A. Heinlein, If This Goes On, 1940 "
251,cybersecurity,conspiracy,"Why is the Air Force's Cyber R&amp;D Budget Skyrocketing""? (nextgov)",6,47mlue,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/47mlue/why_is_the_air_forces_cyber_rd_budget/,2016-02-26 12:09:54," It's an annual puzzle for the Defense Department, congressional appropriators, defense contractors and hackers: Calculating how much money the armed forces should spend on protecting weapons systems and warfighting documents, along with attacking adversary networks, can be like taking a shot in the dark. Consider, for example, the Air Force fiscal 2017 cyber budget for research, development, testing, and evaluation released earlier this month. The branch wants to *nearly quadruple the current $7.7 million purse* for defending networked aircraft, launch systems, satellites and data -- requesting $29.4 million next year. In the request, the Air Force has proposed doubling down on funding to disrupt foreign systems, asking for $25 million in 2017 for cyber offensives versus $12.9 million this year. Air Force officials provided a vague rationale for the figures. ""The additional funding supports the DOD and Air Force cyberspace strategic objectives of increasing cyberspace capabilities,"" Air Force spokeswoman Karen Roganov told Nextgov in an email. Keep in mind these research and development expenditures *show just one portion of overall Air Force cyberspace funding*, she said. The top-level line item for cyber -- $4 billion  reflects measured ""increases across the entire spectrum of cyberspace capabilities,"" Roganov said. The inability to publicly say how these billions of cyber dollars will strengthen America's military breeds cynicism and waste, according to some former Defense Department personnel and experts. ""At some point, the questions will start coming about what it actually means to fly, fight and win in cyberspace,"" Robert M. Lee, an active-duty Air Force Cyber Warfare Operations Officer who has led multiple cyberspace intelligence programs, and Thomas Rid, a war studies professor at Kings College, say in their 2014 RUSI Journal article ""OMG Cyber!"" The Air Force also *has plans to triple spending on cyber espionage*. The 2017 cyber intelligence budget requests $18.52 million, up from the 2016 level of $6.57 million. This money would benefit cyber-snooping initiatives across the Pentagon, where the proposed collective cyber budget is $7 billion, Air Force officials said. The cyber surveillance account ""includes activities in cyberspace conducted to gather intelligence that may be required to support future operations, including offensive cyber operations or defensive cyber operations,"" Roganov said. These efforts focus ""on tactical and operational intelligence and on mapping adversary cyberspace to support military planning."" A problem of overpromising on cybersecurity permeates the military, the ""OMG Cyber!"" authors say. ""Key to the effective functioning of military services is OT&amp;E  organization, training and equipment; *but the primary output has been HC&amp;C  hype, confusion and contracts,""* Lee and Rid say. ""The DODs investment strategy leaves a bitter aftertaste for its own operators: money seems to be available in abundance for contracts, but money is tight when it comes to career and skill development."" To its credit, the Air Force is leading the way among the services in how it produces cyber personnel, the ""OMG Cyber!"" writers say. The branch's 2017 funding proposal seems to back their opinion. The billion-dollar Air Force cyber budget would rise by $200 million in 2017, in part, to train offensive and defensive cyber teams. The extra money would also fund ""next-generation platforms and strike packages"" for the code warriors, Roganov said. URL"

What Happened **Federal law enforcement officials recently informed us that theyve been investigating cybersecurity crimes involving the theft of information from Scottrade and other financial services companies.** We immediately initiated a comprehensive response. Based upon our subsequent internal investigation coupled with information provided by the authorities, we believe a list of **client names and street addresses** was taken from our system. Importantly, we have no reason to believe that Scottrades trading platforms or any client funds were compromised. All client passwords remained encrypted at all times and we have not seen any indication of fraudulent activity as a result of this incident. Although **Social Security numbers, email addresses and other sensitive data were contained in the system accessed**, it appears that contact information was the focus of the incident. The unauthorized access appears to have occurred over a period of several months between late 2013 and early 2014. We have secured the known intrusion point and conducted an internal data forensics investigation on this incident with assistance from a leading computer security firm. We have taken appropriate steps to further strengthen our network defenses. What Happens Now **Federal authorities had requested that they be allowed to complete much of their investigation before we notified clients. In coordination with them, we are now able to alert you of this incident.** We are fully cooperating with law enforcement in their investigation and prosecution of the criminals involved. Notices like this one are being sent to all individuals and entities whose information was contained in the affected database, and we have included here information about steps you can take to protect yourself. Information about this incident is available online at URL and we will update that web page if new data becomes available. What You Can Do As always, we encourage you to regularly review your Scottrade and other financial accounts and report any suspicious or unrecognized activity immediately. As recommended by federal regulatory agencies, you should remember to be vigilant for the next 12 to 24 months and report any suspected incidents of fraud to us or the relevant financial institution. Please also read the important information included on ways to protect yourself from identity theft. We encourage clients to be particularly vigilant against email or direct mail schemes seeking to trick you into revealing personal information. Never confirm or provide personal information such as passwords or account information to anyone contacting you. Please know that Scottrade will never send you any unsolicited correspondence asking you for your account number, password or other private information. If you receive any letter or email requesting this information, it is fraudulent and we ask that you report it to us at phishing@scottrade.com. Be cautious about opening attachments or links from emails, regardless of who appears to have sent them. Identity Theft Protection As a precaution, Scottrade has arranged with AllClear ID to help you protect your identity at no cost to you for a period of one year. You are pre-qualified for identity repair and protection services and have additional credit monitoring options available, also at no cost to you.

Your phone automatically connects to it. Now, that tower's radio waves send a command to your phone's antennae: the baseband chip. That tells your phone to fake any shutdown and stay on. A smart hack won't keep your phone running at 100%, though. Spies could keep your phone on standby and just use the microphone -- or send pings announcing your location. John Pirc, who did cybersecurity research at the CIA, said these methods -- and others, like physically bugging devices -- let the U.S. hijack and reawaken terrorists' phones. ""The only way you can tell is if your phone feels warm when it's turned off. That means the baseband processor is still running,"" said Pirc, now chief technology officer of the NSS Labs security research firm. This isn't easy to accomplish. It's a highly targeted attack. But if you are really concerned about the government's ability to reawaken your phone, here are some things you could do. Recovery mode. Put your phone on what's known as Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) mode. This bypasses the phone's operating system. Every phone has a different approach for this. It's fairly easy (albeit cumbersome) for iPhone users. Plug it into a computer with iTunes open. Hold down the Power and Home buttons for 10 seconds (no less) then let go of the Power button. Wait for an iTunes pop-up. That's it. For Android users, recovery mode varies by model. Android Magazine has a great tutorial here. Create a barrier. Use a signal-blocking phone case. You can buy them (Off Pocket, HideCell) or even make your own -- assuming you have the patience to do so. Pull out the battery. Without a power source, the phone can't come back on. This is the best, most surefire option. It's also, annoyingly, no longer a choice on most top-of-the-line smartphones. The iPhone, HTC One and Nokia Lumia don't have removable batteries. Luckily, the Samsung Galaxy and LG G3 still do. Silent Circle, a company that enables top-end private communication, kept these issues in mind when it co-created the Blackphone. It has a removable battery. It uses PrivatOS, a stripped-down version of Android that reduces tracking. And because spoofed cell towers can target its antennae too, Blackphone's makers are working with chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA, Tech30) to develop their own custom, more secure baseband chip.

Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, [wrote](URL to the director of the FBI asking for more specific information about the FBIs current use of spyware, in order for the Senate Judiciary Committee to evaluate serious privacy concerns. &gt;The leaked emails [show](URL that the FBI has been using Hacking Teams software since [2011](URL apparently for the secretive Remote Operations Unit. &gt;Its long been reported that the FBI has deployed malware in investigations, but details on the agencys efforts are thin, with the tactic only surfacing rarely in court cases  such as one instance last year when the FBI [spoofed](URL an Associated Press article to get a target to click on a link. &gt;The FBI [reportedly](URL develops its own malware and also buys pre-packaged products, but the relationship with Hacking Team has not been previously confirmed. &gt;Hacking Teams spokesperson, Eric Rabe, said in a statement that we do not disclose the names or locations of our clients and we cannot comment on the validity of documents purportedly from our company. &gt;The director of the Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation in Florida told The Intercept that it does not have plans to purchase any product from Hacking Team. The Manhattan District Attorneys office said, It would be an overstatement to say that our office is planning to purchase this type of software. This company is one of several in the industry whom weve requested meetings with in order to keep pace with rapid technological advancements in the private sector. &gt;The CIA declined to comment, and ICE said it does not discuss law enforcement tools and techniques. (The Intercept will update this story if other agencies named in the documents respond to requests for comment.) &gt;The leaked emails show that U.S. agencies worried about the legality and perception of Hacking Teams tools. &gt;Hacking Team refers to its U.S. clients by [code names](URL The FBI unit is Phoebe (initially f-client, but one employee complained it sounds like an antivirus), the DEA is Katie, and the CIA, which appears to have sampled, but not bought Remote Control System, is Marianne. &gt;In 2011, a representative of the DEAs Office of Investigative Technology told Hacking Team that its budget request for Remote Control System had been denied because it was considered too controversial, according to an [email](URL We are working on the foreign angle, the DEA said, according to Hacking Teams U.S. account manager. &gt;I imagine Katie [DEA] is referring to the fact that they as the DEA could buy RCS for other countries (Colombia) where its less problematic to use it, an employee [replied](URL in Italian. &gt;The purchase [did go through](URL in 2012, and it appears to have been used mainly in conjunction with Colombian law enforcement. &gt;As one email [explained](URL Katie will be administrator of the system, while the locals will be collecting the data. &gt;They are saying if this works out, they will bring it to other countries around the world. Already they are speaking of El Salvador and Chile. &gt;Robotec, a company that manages Hacking Teams sales to several Latin American countries, also [mentions](URL clients in Colombia using DEA funding. &gt;Local police in the U.S. also had their worries. Florida law enforcement told Hacking Team this year that the software [could create legal problems](URL without the ability to have minimization of the calls and messages  (ie. deleting portions which are not relevant to the search.) &gt;In 2013, San Bernardinos district attorney wanted to go to a judge to obtain a warrant targeting a known bad guy even for a trial run of the software. If the systems [sic] proves itself in this live trial, and the judge is convinced of both its value and proper protection of privacy, they would then move into the purchase phase, one of Hacking Teams U.S. business partners, from the security giant SS8, [explained](URL &gt;One of the concerns of this segment is that the HT product is too powerful, Fred DAlessio, who [sits on the board of SS8](URL and is identified on [LinkedIn](URL as a senior advisor to Hacking Team, [wrote](URL about local agencies. They have also said, their biggest challenge is getting the lawyers and the District Attorneys to agree on what they can do legally. &gt;Christopher Lee, a spokesperson for the San Bernardino County district attorneys office wrote in an email to The Intercept that the office had never purchased the Cicom software described in the article. Nor have we ever had a relationship with the company listed in the documents or any other company providing these services. &gt;Hacking Teams FBI contacts worried that the spread of Hacking Team software around the country could cause word to get out (as has happened with technology like [Stingrays](URL the devices that police use to track cell phone location.) If San Bernardino gets exposed, they might also expose Phoebe, Hacking Teams U.S. point man, Alex Velasco, [wrote](URL in September 2013. &gt;The FBIs use of Hacking Teams software also informs the public debate about the growing use of encryption to protect Internet communications. FBI and other top U.S. law enforcement officials [have been calling for a law](URL that would provide for a backdoor into commercial encryption technologies  something privacy advocates and many cybersecurity researchers see as a undermining Internet security. &gt;Hacking Team claims that its software offers a way around encryption, obviating the need for a backdoor. Vincenzetti regularly sends out articles about the encryption debate to his email list with a plug for Remote Control System. &gt;Last February, he [wrote](URL that law enforcement and security agencies could use technologies to ACCESS THE DATA they need IN CLEARTEXT, BEFORE it gets encrypted by the device and sent to the network and AFTER it is received from the network and decrypted by the device itself. Actually THIS IS precisely WHAT WE DO. ##The Buyers &gt;The push into the local district attorney market, for which the company [considered San Bernardino a pilot](URL appears to have been facilitated by SS8, a massive California-based security company that markets to law enforcement agencies in the United States and abroad. (Rabe denied that SS8 is working with Hacking Team, despite emails between the companies.) &gt;The local market could be lucrative: a [budget](URL for the district attorney in New York that Hacking Team proposed in April totaled $760,000 in upfront license fees, and another $382,000 in services and maintenance. &gt;As with so many other surveillance technologies that were originally created for the military and intelligence community, they eventually trickle down to local law enforcement who start using them without seeking the approval of legislators  and, in many cases, keeping the courts in the dark too, said Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist of the American Civil Liberties Union. &gt;The DEA, FBI and Army bought Hacking Teams software through a company called Cicom, which for several years served as a middleman for Hacking Teams U.S. business. The DEA and Army contracts to buy Remote Control System through Cicom were first [revealed](URL by the advocacy group Privacy International this spring. &gt;Reporters noted that Cicom shared the same corporate address in the United States as Hacking Team, but when asked about the connection by Ars Technica, Hacking Teams U.S. spokesperson Eric Rabe [said](URL I cannot confirm any relationship between the company Cicom and Hacking Team. &gt;Alex Velasco, Cicoms general manager, has in fact been a consultant under contract to represent Hacking Team to clients in North America since 2012, company emails show. The relationship ended in March, after Hacking Team accused Velasco of scheming to market competing products, according to an [internal investigation](URL commissioned by Hacking Team. Velasco declined to comment to The Intercept on the allegations, because he is in legal proceedings with Hacking Team. &gt;Hacking Team was also in talks in 2014 with the FBIs National Domestic Communications Assistance Center, a secretive unit [formed](URL in 2012 and focused on interception technologies. &gt;Velasco claims in an [email](URL that the group came to them after Citizen Lab, a research group at the University of Toronto focused on Internet technology and human rights, [published](URL a highly critical report on Hacking Teams global sales. If anything good came out of the Citizen lab articles is that it brought them to contact us to see if it was true, he wrote. Thank you Citizen Lab!! &gt;Its not clear from Hacking Team emails what Army component bought an RCS system in 2011, but it was based at Fort Meade and apparently sat unused for years. &gt;According to a 2013 [email](URL from Velasco, they purchased a system right before they got their budget cutThey were never given permission to pull an internet line to their office to install the system. (ridiculous but true!) &gt;Hacking Team was in the midst of negotiations for a new FBI contract from Cicom after Velascos firing, but the agency decided to go with another vendor due to budget timing issues, according to an [email](URL from Phillipe Vinci, Hacking Teams vice president for business development. &gt;Besides, the product was seen as a nice to have by FBI, but they confessed they were using it for low level types of investigations. For critical operations, they were using another platform, wrote Vinci. He said the FBI wanted more ability to go after users of Tor, the anonymizing web browser; those users accounted for 60 percent of its targets. &gt;But Hacking Team appeared determined to continue its conquest of the U.S. market. &gt;There will be a process to have HT Usa Inc. accredited, [wrote](URL operations manager Daniele Milan. He pledged to stay in touch with the FBI, marketing new features, and identifying problems to resolve for them (in exchange for $$$). &gt;While Hacking Teams emails reveal the company to be stringent about selling only to governments, the company officials appear to worry less about how its technology is used once it gets to those customers. &gt;Responding to concerns raised by the district attorney of New York in 2013, Hacking Teams chief operating officer Giancarlo Russo [wrote](URL that all the consideration regarding the legal framework cannot be addressed by us. &gt;Instead, he was more concerned about local customers ability to use the product effectively. If you buy a Ferrari they can teach you how to drive. They cannot grant you will be the winner of the race, he wrote to his colleagues in English. If Beretta sell you a gun, the most peculiar and sophisticated one, they can teach how to use it. They can not grant you are going to shoot your target properly on the field."

Also, I encourage you to try this at home. I originally posted these thoughts in another thread and I'm just compiling them here for concision and clarity. Here is the gist of it: Today's events are possibly a false flag operation to garner public support for wide and sweeping changes to the structure of the internet and access to information in the United States. A patriot act for the net if you willwith the goals of SOPA and other unpopular internet reforms included in the bill. United Airlines would be an ideal candidate in such a strategy, as 9-11 and the company (United 93) are associative with security threats. Plus, the NYSE and the WSJ.com are cyber equivalents of the towers. Senator Bill Nelson wasted no time in pushing such an agenda as he tweeted this shortly after the NYSE story broke: &gt; Three major computer malfunctions on same day give appearance of an attack, serve as reminder Congress must pass a cybersecurity bill Another potential bonus in using this tactic is that those that would label this a cyber 9-11 false flag would be more easily dismissed as the concept of 9-11 truthers is a pre-existing reference frame to play off of. Additionally, regardless if it was a false flag or notif I worked in any way for the beneficiaries of the changes proposed in the SOPA billnow would be a good time to launch a public relations campaign pushing for such legislation as you could easily dress up the changes in the language of cyber security. Not only that, one of the largest internet communities that might have actually been able to mobilize opposition to such a bill (Reddit) has just divided up it's user base among a few different websites (Empeopled, Voat, etc.), and the one remaining site with reliable servers that connects this community together (Reddit) is willing to play ball in suppressing certain news stories.

With the ramp up in all forms of media lately, from the *Russian Hacker Cyber Attack*, the Clinton email thing, all the cyber legislation that was passed in November and December, the presidential memoranda and addendums to cyber tools, the FCC net neutrality rules (400 page document nobody has read), the NSA/Snowden stuff being in the spot light all the time, the *North Korea cyber attack*, and then combining these line of thinking with the electric blackouts and rumors of EMP/nuclear/NORAD relocation rumblings I've heard, I think the next one will be Stateside and it'll be cyber, knocking out electricity grids or something stupid, and the USG will be able to do another emergency drill for preparedness. In the past few years we've seen these exercises, with metropolitan mocks in Boston (thanks, Tsarnaev), as well as rural manhunts (Eric Frein, thinking of you). How about one on an even bigger scale? Who knows? We have CISPA back waiting in the House, too, by the way. Remember the coverage of CISPA in 2012?

But I can see the next Event be *cyber* related, affect electricity grids or other important infrastructure, and be blamed on a boogey man hacker group and they'll get their CISPA. It took a year to get Americans to be OK with bombing Syria through the ISIS beheading PR campaign. What makes you think another PR campaign hadn't been going on along side it?

Well, I'm not done thinking, but like a small pebble in one's shoe, this one is annoying and irritating, and I have to talk about it. &gt;I may end up talking about it again, but for now I have to stop thinking, take my shoe off, and remove the pebble. In short, I to talk about this. And I'm sure that, once one sees the title of this article, one will see why it's been one of those ""stone in the shoe"" articles: [The Air Force Might Have To Protect Money Laundering in Space](URL &gt;Now... did you catch the implications of those opening statements? Indeed, these were the statements that were the stone in my shoe, so to speak, and I found them to be an irritable confirmation of ideas I've been advancing, along with former HUD Assistant Secretary Catherine Austin Fitts. &gt;Indeed, when I first advanced this idea some years ago on the recently deceased George Ann Hughes' The Byte Show, I thought I was the only one thinking what I was thinking, and I was reluctant even to talk about it on George Ann's show, until she persuaded me. &gt;But when I heard Secretary Fitts saying and thinking almost exactly the same think some time later, I began to wonder. So here's the irritating stone-in-the shoe that this article posed (and poses): ""If youre looking for the ultimate in physical security for your future assets, look up, way up. Growing fears about cybersecurity and the rapidly decreasing cost to access space has given birth to a new class of startups offering satellite-based data centers impervious to all physical hacking. ""What sort of information is so valuable that the average person needs to protect them in space? One answer: money. Even space vaults need guards, and in this case the brunt of that job will go to U.S. Air Force. ""But putting digital money into space-based data centers not only puts it out of reach from thieves, its also out of jurisdiction from law enforcement. In other words, the Air Force could one day soon be on the hook to protect a hive of money laundering in space."" &gt;Now, I don't know the author of this article, Mr Patrick Tucker, from Adam, and I highly doubt that he ever heard my wild and woolly ""high octane speculation"" about money leaving the planet altogether, nor Secretary Fitt's variation on the idea. That said, you'll note that what he has said, boiled down to its essential abstracted ""quintessence"", is the following: 1. Money, since so much of it now exists in the form of electronic data, can now move off planet, and be vouchsafed in satellites; 2. part of moving money of the planet in this fashion, might be in the form of sophisticated money laundering operations; and finally, 3. the military would inevitably be drawn into protecting such ""orbital vaults"" and hence may unwittingly (of course! or as I would prefer, perhaps ""wittingly"") be protecting such operations. &gt;Years ago, when I first began exploring the possibility of a ""hidden system of finance"" in conjunction with Mr. Richard Dolan's idea of a ""breakaway civilization,"" and in conjunction with the idea of a decades' long black projects development of secret technologies (from weaponry, to propulsion, medicine, bioengineering, materials science, and even, if I may be permitted the term, ""psychophysics""), I realized that such an idea meant that any conventional financial or economic modeling which did not factor the existence of such a system into its analyses was doomed to be a highly flawed analysis. &gt;This was born home during the 2008 bailouts, and the ""quantitative easing"" which followed it, when financial analysts began predicting hyperinflation was just around the corner. I recall similar predictions from the Reagan administration era. It did not show up, and still hasn't. So like an electrical engineer confronted by power going in at one end of the circuit, but not appearing in sufficient amounts at the load end, I came to the conclusion that the ""juice"" or money was being bled off, and going somewhere else, and that one possibility may have been space, either in the form of tribute (Ms. Fitts' idea), or trade. &gt;The idea may not be as wild and wooly as it sounds. After all, if we can trade bits of information that are exchanged electronically as money, chances are, another more advanced civilization might do so as well. &gt;Granted, they might be so advanced as to view our ""electronic blips"" as being about as advanced as having to carry around sacks of coins before the rise of the widespread use of paper money. But different types of money have always circulated at the same time, as it does now. &gt;But in any case, the article does advance the notion that money, rather than being transferred or cleared via space based assets, might be stored there. In other words, it might simply be moved off world. &gt;And he has raised yet another fascinating possibility, that this activity would the the ultimate way, the most sophisticated way for those with the power, influence, and technological expertise to do so, to launder money. And of course, hiding your assets in satellites (or elsewhere), is the perfect way to have a hidden system of finance. &gt;In other words, perhaps we're once again being ""prepared for a future"" that already exists, and perhaps this article could be taken as confirmation - at least in a general way - that the idea of all that liquidity, which should have shown up as hyperinflation long ago, hasn't, because the load end of the circuit is no longer on this planet at all. &gt;And that raises all sorts of other ""high octane"" possibilities. Of course, there's lots more to ponder in this article, which is why it's going into one of my permanent archive folders. &gt;And of course, there's one final possibility that the article suggests, and that is, the data that can be stored in satellites, can also be stored on space probes on, say, the surface of the Moon, or Mars... if someone needed, perhaps, to make a withdrawal at one of those ""branch banks""..."

Unfortunately, the newest Senate Intelligence bill is one of the worst yet. &gt;Cybersecurity bills aim to facilitate information sharing between companies and the government, but their [broad immunity clauses](URL for companies, [vague definitions,](URL and [aggressive spying powers](URL make them secret surveillance bills. &gt;CISA marks the [fifth](URL time [in](URL as [many](URL years [that Congress](URL has tried to pass ""cybersecurity"" legislation. [Join us](URL now in killing this bill. &gt;The newest Senate Intelligence bill joins other cybersecurity information sharing legislation like Senator Carper's Cyber Threat Sharing Act of 2015. All of them are largely redundant. &gt;Last year, President Obama signed [Executive Order 13636 (EO 13636)](URL directing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to expand current information sharing programs. &gt;In February, he signed another [Executive Order](URL encouraging regional cybersecurity information sharing and creating yet another [Cyber Threat Center.](URL &gt;Despite this, members of Congress like Senators Dianne Feinstein and Richard Burr [continue to introduce bills](URL that would destroy privacy protections and grant new spying powers to companies. ##New Countermeasures and Monitoring Powers &gt;Aside from its redundancy, the Senate Intelligence bill grants two new authorities to companies. First, the bill authorizes companies to launch countermeasures (now called ""defensive measures"" in the bill) for a ""cybersecurity purpose"" against a ""cybersecurity threat."" &gt;""Cybersecurity purpose"" is so broadly defined that it means almost anything related to protecting (including physically protecting) an information system, which can be a computer or software. The same goes for a ""cybersecurity threat,"" which includes anything that ""may result"" in an unauthorized effort to impact the availability of the information system. &gt;Even with the changed language, it's still unclear what restrictions exist on ""defensive measures."" Since the definition of ""information system"" is inclusive of files and software, can a company that has a file stolen from them launch ""defensive measures"" against the thief's computer? &gt;What's worse, the bill may allow such actions as long as they don't cause ""substantial"" harm. The bill leaves the term ""substantial"" undefined. &gt;If true, the countermeasures ""defensive measures"" clause could increasingly encourage computer [exfiltration](URL attacks on the Interneta prospect that may appeal to some ""active defense"" (aka offensive) cybersecurity companies, but does not favor the everyday user. &gt;Second, the bill adds a new authority for companies to monitor information systems to protect an entity's hardware or software. Here again, the broad definitions could be used in conjunction with the monitoring clause to spy on users engaged in potentially innocuous activity. &gt;Once collected, companies can then share the information, which is also called cyber threat indicators, freely with government agencies like the NSA. ##Sharing Information with NSA &gt;Such sharing will occur because under this bill, DHS would no longer be the lead agency making decisions about the cybersecurity information received, retained, or shared to companies or within the government. &gt;Its new role in the bill mandates DHS send information to agencieslike the NSA""in real-time."" The bill also allows companies to bypass DHS and share the information immediately with other agencies, like the intelligence agencies, which ensures that DHS's current privacy protections wont be applied to the information. The provision is ripe for improper and over-expansive information sharing. ##Overbroad Use of Information &gt;Once the information is sent to any government agency (including local law enforcement), it can use the information for reasons other than for cybersecurity purposes. The provisions grant the government far too much leeway in how to use the information for non-cybersecurity purposes. &gt;The public wont even know what information is being collected, shared, or used because the bill will exempt all of it from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. &gt;In 2012, the Senate negotiated a much tighter definition in Senator Lieberman's [Cybersecurity Act of 2012.](URL &gt;The definition only allowed law enforcement to use information for a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, an imminent threat of death, or a serious threat to a minor. The Senate Intelligence Committee's billat the minimumshould've followed the already negotiated language. ##Near-Blanket Immunity &gt;The bill also retains near-blanket immunity for companies to monitor information systems and to share the information as long as it's conducted according to the act. Again, ""cybersecurity purpose"" rears its overly broad head since a wide range of actions conducted for a cybersecurity purpose are allowed by the bill. &gt;The high bar immunizes an incredible amount of activity. Existing private rights of action for violations of the Wiretap Act, Stored Communications Act, and potentially the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act would be precluded or at least sharply restricted by the clause. &gt;It remains to be seen why such immunity is needed when just a few months ago, [the FTC and DOJ noted](URL they would not prosecute companies for sharing such information. &gt;It's also unclear because we continue to see companies freely share information among each other and with the government both publicly via [published](URL reports, [information sharing and analysis centers,](URL and [private communications.](URL ##A Fatally Flawed Bill &gt;This fatally flawed bill must be stopped.

On Thursday, the Intercept revealed a secret U.S. and British intelligence operation that gave the nations spy agencies the ability to monitor a large portion of the worlds cellular communications, even if they were protected by encryption. The operation, apparently undertaken five years ago, gave the agencies the ability to break the codes used to encrypt phone calls, text messages, and other data sent on more than 450 wireless phone networks around the world. This was the easy way: Attack a NATO [member country] company, and gain the keys for everybody, Nicholas Weaver, a senior researcher at the International Computer Science Institute, told The Daily Beast. But it wasnt the elegant way. If the GCHQ wanted to target individuals and was willing to wait a day or two to decrypt a new target, they could have set up a pipeline where the GCHQ asks the Netherlands, which asks Gemalto to provide the keys for a set of targets. If they wanted to just target some countries, they could have also just targeted recipient [telecommunications companies], rather than a NATO company. But that would require more work: having to compromise a dozen companies rather than just one."" URL US &amp; UK hacked SIM card manufacturer URL "

Considering the amount of attention it has gotten the last two times, it will only distort anyone hearing or caring about CISA which is on its way to the senate floor. I think this may have been intentional seeing as even if there is a sufficient rallying behind stopping CISPA for a third time CISA will pass through unnoticed. For any who don't know or havent heard: [CISA] (URL - was proposed very recently after the sony hack [CISPA](URL - Was reintroduced in the last few days."
