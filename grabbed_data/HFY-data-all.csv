No clue what the war's about, or if the humans have a reason for being involved other than 'they attacked our neighbors while we were chatting with them'. Probably trade agreements involved somehow. &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* &amp;#x200B; ""What do you mean the specimen just died?!"" the Coalition Intelligence Minister demanded of the local Chief Interrogation Officer. ""Your staff must have broken protocol."" &amp;#x200B; ""As you know,"" the CIO responded stiffly, ""i oversee interrogation of unfamiliar species personally, precisely to monitor any surprises that might interfere with protocol. Protocol was followed: since these humans have adaptive immune systems, no chemical interrogants were used; we simulated injury only, with the nerve induction intensity carefully regulated to ensure there would be no overload damage. You don't have to take my word for it; ask the Chief Medical Officer for the autopsy results."" &amp;#x200B; The Intelligence Minister summoned the local CMO to do just that. ""What did the human interrogation specimen die of?"" &amp;#x200B; The CMO answered, ""His body underwent the same physiological and biochemical reactions as reported in humans who have suffered puncture of or major blunt force trauma to vital organs and massive blood loss. There had been no blood loss nor had there been even minor physical injury. There was also no evidence of a pre-exsisting physical or biochemical defect. Apparently the physiological adaptations that give a human a non-zero chance of surviving a lethal injury are potentially deadly in an uninjured specimen, which may explain why many of these mechanisms manifest only *in extremis*."" &amp;#x200B; ""Is this going to happen to every human we try to interrogate?"" the Intelligence Minister demanded. &amp;#x200B; ""No,"" the Chief Interrogation Officer answered. ""There are three other humans that have been through the process so far, with only psychological damage persisting. Less damaging for their long-term prospects than using a Bliss Chip on them, apparently. Results as far as information gain were decidedly mixed."" &amp;#x200B; ""Is there anything about the humans that would let us predict which ones are vulnerable to this phenomenon?"" The Intelligence Minister demanded. &amp;#x200B; The Chief Medical Officer answered, ""No. We should be able to predict which species are at risk, however. The biochemical-physiological simulations will give what in a normal species would be nonsensical results, but which are potentially accurate in a chaotic regime such as the humans' hyper-rapid adaptation."" &amp;#x200B; ""How does this compare to the allergy rates in these humans?"" the Intelligence Minister asked. &amp;#x200B; ""Assuming no upper limit on the number of exposures, humans will develop allergic reactions to various substances at about the same rate as other species with adaptive immune systems,"" the CMO answered. ""However, a human with allergic potential will generally begin manifesting it after far fewer exposures. The long term risk is the same; the short term risk is significantly elevated."" &amp;#x200B; ""Their addiction weakness would allow us to use the Bliss Chip as an interrogation method, since we can't use it to warehouse them,"" the Chief Intelligence Officer suggested. ""It would cause a great deal of difficulty when the war ends, however. I won't do it without explicit written direction from both yourself and the Diplomatic Minister."" &amp;#x200B; The Intelligence Minister shuddered as he recalled some of the reports he'd read from the human home-world about the lengths to which addicts would go in order to satisfy their cravings. Drug addictions were a not illogical extrapolation from chemical tolerance and dependency; even adrenaline junkies could be explained by the humans' 'use it or lose it' musculature; but gambling and video game addictions remained inexplicable, not matter how many times the psych nurses tried to explain them. ""What are we supposed to do, ask them politely for information?"" &amp;#x200B; ""That actually works, sometimes,"" the CIO said. ""Just usually not on the ones that know anything relevant."" &amp;#x200B; The Intelligence Minister sighed. ""We can't interrogate them efficiently; their vulnerability to inactivity means we can't warehouse them efficiently; that means there's just one thing to do."" &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* &amp;#x200B; ""Sir,"" the Chief Security Officer said, ""the humans have called a 'hunger strike': they are refusing to eat."" &amp;#x200B; ""Without the ability to hibernate, and with their metabolic rates, they'll start showing significant physiological deterioration in a matter of days, death within weeks. Do they give a reason?"" the Sector Commander asked. &amp;#x200B; ""It's a matter of honor, Sir. They say they won't resume minimal survival cooperation until we either resume interrogating them or also stop interrogation of everyone else."" Anticipating the Sector Commander's suggestion, the CSO added, ""I tried explaining to them that it's an issue with their physiology, and they say they don't care. They'd rather run the risk of a lethal adverse reaction than be left unhurt while their allies are being 'tortured'."" &amp;#x200B; ""Well, at least they won't be our problem much longer,"" the Sector Commander said. &amp;#x200B; ""I hope you mean that the diplomats have negotiated an end to the war and all the prisoners are being sent home,"" the Chief Security Officer responded. ""Failing that, i very much hope you mean that all the prisoners in this batch are being traded. The humans believe in 'first in, first out' when it comes to POW swaps. If you plan on forcing the human prisoners to jump the line, i'm going to need permission to use chemical sedatives on them."" &amp;#x200B; ""Don't be ridiculous,"" the Sector Commander said. ""The minimum effective dosage on a human in combat mode is greater than the maximum safe dosage for a human at rest. They are also capable of only partial engagement of their combat mode. Chemical sedatives are far too risky."" &amp;#x200B; ""Not as risky as subduing them by brute force, Sir,"" the CSO insisted. ""They will **riot** if they realize they're being sent home ahead of allies who have been here longer. I will be submitting my concerns in writing to the medical, intelligence, and diplomatic departments, along with anyone else who might possibly be relevant."" &amp;#x200B; ""You're a combat specialist, not a psychologist,"" the Sector Commander said dismissively. ""How can you possibly know that."" &amp;#x200B; ""I understand honor,"" the Chief Security Officer said. ""You, apparently, do not."" &amp;#x200B; ""I have my orders,"" the Sector Commander said. ""Prepare the humans, and only the humans for transfer. Permission to use chemical sedatives is denied unless medically necessary."" &amp;#x200B; ""I'd salute you on the battlefield,"" the CSO snarled as he thumped a scaled hand to his chest and turned to go. ""I have reports to write."" &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* &amp;#x200B; Major Johnson watched his counterpart from the Counterpoint Alliance walk down the ramp of the shuttle. He stepped forward and handed the mantis-anglerfish looking alien a pair of printouts. ""First one is who we're delivering; second is who we expect to receive."" &amp;#x200B; ""There's been a change,"" the alien said. ""We are finding it impossible to keep humans alive in captivity. I believe your terms allow for early release when medically necessary."" &amp;#x200B; ""Nice try,"" Major Johnson said. ""We're well aware of the logistical headaches our species causes, and 'impossible' is simply not true. It's not our fault you haven't found a species with a similar advantage/vulnerability profile to ally with yet. First in, first out; or the swap is off."" &amp;#x200B; ""My orders are to--"" The mantis-anglerfish alien who'd been speaking was shot in the back by an alien who looked a lot like a not quite so bulky Thing from the Fantastic Four. &amp;#x200B; ""For the love of whatever your species considers holy,"" orange scaly alien said, ""can we pretend it was just a clerical error that got your species bumped to the front of the line?"" &amp;#x200B; ""Sorry, nope,"" Major Johnson said. ""Can't afford to set that kind of precedent. How much trouble are you going to be in for shooting him?"" &amp;#x200B; ""Not as much as my people will be in if your people take this idiotic decision personally,"" orange scaly guy answered. ""There are wars, and then there are **wars**. Right now, it's mostly just the people who like fighting involved, and there's still no reason the diplomats can't negotiate a conclusion that leaves everyone reasonably satisfied. But if your people decide that this affront to your honor means that ours cannot be trusted to negotiate in good faith, it will become the other kind of war--the kind that pulls everyone into the fight and that can end in nothing less than total surrender of one side or the other."" &amp;#x200B; Major Johnson mulled that over. ""Will your superiors buy a translation error that started a fight before we could make the swap?"" &amp;#x200B; Orange scaly guy hesitated. ""It would be an acceptable excuse, probably. It's not exactly consistent with the evidence, however."" &amp;#x200B; ""Who does the forensics exams on your side?--would they be more sympathetic to your view or to your superiors?"" Major Johnson asked. &amp;#x200B; ""The medics would be more likely to listen to the psych nurses than to the commanders, on an analysis like this; and the psych nurses agree with me,"" orange scaly guy said. &amp;#x200B; ""I can work with that,"" Major Johnson said. He pulled a small bottle out, broke the seal, and drank its contents. Then he pulled his sidearm and shot himself in the thigh. Then he dug the bullet out, dug the alien bullet out of the alien corpse, and shoved the two bullets into each others' holes. Then he fired two more shots into the alien corpse. ""Will that give them enough to work with?"" &amp;#x200B; ""Um, yes,"" orange scaly guy said. ""The alternative is believing that you shot yourself in order to make the story work, and anyone who will buy that will also believe that your people care enough about your honor to make any hint of special treatment for prisoners of your species a really bad idea."" He hesitated and then asked, ""Your medics allow you to self-administer painkillers that strong?"" &amp;#x200B; ""Naw,"" Major Johnson said. ""It's just a placebo."" &amp;#x200B; ""What's a placebo?"" orange scaly guy asked. &amp;#x200B; ""Oh, right, the placebo effect is as unique to our planet as addiction apparently is,"" Major Johnson realized. ""It's a phenomenon in which a substance believed to be a drug or medicine can produce the same effects as the actual drug or medicine. Susceptibility varies; for most humans it will only shift the probabilities when the outcome is uncertain, but in rare cases the placebo effect can be potent enough to cure or kill immediately. Sometimes it works even when you know it's a placebo, especially if it's an expensive one."" &amp;#x200B; A piece of intel like that could be enough to finish covering his rear. ""Translator error, firefight,"" the orange scaly guy summarized. ""I aborted because my commanding officer was dead; you because you needed medical attention."" &amp;#x200B; ""That works,"" Johnson said. He waited until the orange scaly guy hefted the deceased alien's body and started back up the ramp before turning and heading back into his own shuttle. &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* &amp;#x200B; ""I was under the impression,"" the Central Coalition Diplomatic Minister said to the human Fleet Marshal, ""that yours was not an honor based species."" &amp;#x200B; ""I can see how someone might get that impression,"" Fleet Marshal Williams answered. ""The problem is that we have two completely different models for what honor is. Face-based cultures regard honor as a matter of how you are perceived by others; integrity-based cultures regard honor as a matter of whether you hold to your principles when no one is looking. Face-based cultures get accused of being dishonorable because they have a tendency towards thinking that actions don't count if you don't get caught. Integrity-based cultures get accused of being dishonorable because they have a tendency to test appearances to destruction, if they think there's no substance backing it up. The thing is, nobody complains about someone else behaving dishonorably unless they value honor."" &amp;#x200B; ""Integrity,"" the Diplomatic Minister said thoughtfully--""that's an engineering term, isn't it? Structural integrity, hull integrity--oh, i see. Whether you hold when tested. Honor as an endoskeleton, a foundation for action, rather than an exoskeleton, protecting you from external assault. And how do these two modes of honor interpret the attempt to release prisoners of your species ahead of those who had been held longer?"" &amp;#x200B; ""Face-based cultures would see it as an insult to our allies; integrity-based cultures would see it as an attempt to sabotage our integrity,"" Fleet Marshal Williams answered. &amp;#x200B; ""You think it might have been an attempt to drive a wedge into our alliance?"" the Diplomatic Minister asked. &amp;#x200B; ""I'd be a lot happier if i thought it was,"" Fleet Marshal Williams answered. ""Malice usually still has a sense of self-preservation to appeal to. Idiocy too often does not."""

Our rise as a space faring civilization was uneventful, the gears of progress driving us further into space. Anti-gravity, teleportation, and unique materials were just some of the things we had. By the time of that ill-fated invasion, we had made vast strides into bio-engineering; limbs lost in combat were quickly regrown, and implants made common. &amp;#x200B; Granted, our rise could only be described as uneventful if you ignored the rise of a godlike being. &amp;#x200B; We barely have an explanation for his origins and powers, and even less of how he fell. Yet he supplanted every previous religion, every government body, and every personal belief we held. Those who rejected his rule quickly found themselves alone in a sea of zealots -carrying out his plans to the letter. I, being the most fanatic of those zealots, found myself rising up the ranks until I became the puppet leader of an already mind-controlled society. We had been psychically shackled to him, pawns to his will. And our civilization quickly began expanding at his behest, conquering system-after-system, star-after-star. The unfortunate species that got in the way of our crusade met either slavery or genocide. The ""lucky"" ones who were enslaved became our soldiers. Their genetic code was modified, and their bodies implanted with controllers. Eventually, the target of our ire fell upon an unassuming, rising civilization. They had discovered the remains of an exploratory fleet, and immediately formed a military coalition to fight. The latter was true, the true purpose of the ""exploratory"" fleet was to recruit, however. Our god, upon his failure to psychically control them, abandoned the fleet and left. &amp;#x200B; His failure on that planet would not be the last one. &amp;#x200B; These natives -known as humans, were a hardy group. Tiny, stubborn, and nigh impenetrable to the strongest of psychic attacks, they left us with genocide as our only choice. We started our invasion with a lightning start, taking them by surprise, and capturing multiple strategic points. Planning to keep the planet usable, we went about deploying our first bioweapons. A slew of monsters were warped in on teleportation pylons and dropships. Our ships were impenetrable to the human's early weapons, and their confusion left us time. Grand invasion ships began bombarding the surface with more pylons, and a monolithic outpost had landed. The first bioweapons proved effective, and had began taking root within natural geological features. After a mere sixty rotations of their planet, a fifth of the humans had been eradicated. &amp;#x200B; Then the first dropship was shot down. Then the next three. &amp;#x200B; Our ships were still largely invulnerable, irregardless of what a few foolhardy soldiers tried. The next phase had started -slave soldiers began dropping onto the surface, corralling the monsters and finding nests. Unfortunately, the humans' industrial processes had poisoned the air, rendering it toxic to units without implants. Even the atmosphere proved to be as stubborn as the ones that breathed it. Over time, four select groups of human soldiers stood out to be the deadliest and hardest to kill. Each one of these elite divisions represented a different category of soldier. Two of these groups were easily identifiable: a unit of exoskeleton-clad soldiers that only engaged in close-range combat, and a squadron of flying, energy-weapon wielding fighters. The others were more evasive. One of these groups only became recognizable due to their leader's unique weapon; they were a group of battle-hardened infantry personnel. The deadliest of the four, however, was elusive. Unpredictable, deadly, and unrelenting, few survivors escaped its grasp. But the little patches of info elude to something much worse than we could've ever predicted. Only called by various nicknames, it eventually gained the moniker of ""Storm One"", following a similar name to the other elites. &amp;#x200B; This enigma took down our ""invulnerable"" outpost during a siege. &amp;#x200B; Specifically, the massive, heavily armored outpost bristling with guns. The smallest turrets dwarfed a human in size; dozens of them guarded its one vulnerability. And yet, one vulnerability was all it took, the fortress destroyed as if it were just another dropship. We accelerated the deployment of new bioweapons in response, but the humans were getting better at killing them. The microbial life on our bioweapons gradually cleansed the air of the pollutants, but in our haste, we had planned another ground invasion before any significant change in air quality could've happened. Focusing our attack on one specific area, we had planned to wipe out a major pocket of humans, but our slave soldiers were left debilitated by the suffocating smog of the region. &amp;#x200B; Storm One survived two battles in which they were outnumbered by a staggering degree, and eliminated all forces opposing them. &amp;#x200B; We had attempted multiple attacks on Storm One, and each time, they had slipped out of our grasp. Our own armored soldiers had dropped on Storm One's exact location, rescue teams were intercepted, and we thought we had finally cornered this nuisance. In a blind act of pride, we had left a mere rearguard to eliminate Storm One. &amp;#x200B; That mistake left us with a city decorated by the rearguard's corpses, their armor shattered, and their bodies dismembered. &amp;#x200B; The war dragged on longer than we ever expected, and Storm One continually grew in strength, despite their abnormal way of fighting. Everything we sent against them fell under a hail of aerial strikes, and yet they were able to fight underground. Battlegrounds were littered with the perforated bodies of our units. Storm One continually engaged with our largest bioweapons, and each time they left the combat zone alive. Though, Storm One was the exception, and humanity was losing. The humans had been pushed back to two of their continents, and more bioweapon variants were made to combat them. A subset of our webslinging bioweapons began turning urban centers into deathtraps, and another type began overwhelming cities with their rapid movement. The flying, deadly offspring of our slave soldiers had begun devouring human populations. Our arsenal of weapons expanded further, with mechanical combat units supplementing ones made of flesh and blood. Tripodal walkers suppressed enemy divisions with a hail of energy blasts, while quadrupedal walkers shielded our own divisions from the strongest of attacks. We had tripled the armor of our own soldiers, and gave them heavier weapons. &amp;#x200B; None of these units managed to stop Storm One, massacred like the rest. &amp;#x200B; To make matters even worse, Storm One and the rest of the Storm units had been assigned to recapture a base. We knew the contents of this base -a massive armored mech, heavy enough to kill our largest bioweapon. We had been making copies of this specific one, codenamed ""Archelus"" by the humans, but their effectiveness would suffer if the humans regained the mech. We had sent reinforcements to bolster the base's defenses, but they had encountered the Storm group on their way there. Despite the massive swarm of bioweapons, and the presence of both elite and slave soldiers, the might of all four elite units could not be stopped. They advanced on the base, and the siege began. Patrols were killed, and teleportation pylons destroyed one after another; the stationary devices extremely susceptible to Storm One's attacks. Soon enough, all forces outside of the base were dead, and the ones within were next. We had sent an entire battalion to stop Storm, but they were late. The mech had already been extracted from the base, and it was pointed towards them. &amp;#x200B; ""Carnage"" is barely enough to describe the killing spree that happened when Storm One got into that mech. &amp;#x200B; The humans took down their first Archelus, and more mechs were retrofitted for combat. They would not be uncontested, however. We sent almost all of the largest bioweapons against them, destroying a significant portion of their mechs at great cost. Regardless of how hard the humans tried, however, they couldn't sustain fighting for much longer. Their population was quickly reaching to a mere tenth of pre-war statistics. The final phase had started, specialty bioweapons were designed and released; using human materials as food, all traces of mankind would be removed. General deployment of units ramped up, in order to flush out the couple million humans left. Of the 90% of humans we had erased, though, the Storm teams still clung along those left. Their murderous tirade across our lines did a number on morale, brainwashed or not, and their activities earned a special sort of attention. The eleventh, last mothership descended to the surface of Earth, personally commanded by our god. As expected, Storm began moving for this mothership, falling right into our trap. Wave after wave fell on them, and all other ships began advancing on them. &amp;#x200B; We had underestimated how fast Storm could be. &amp;#x200B; The preexisting forces just weren't enough, and mothership eleven fell under attack. The other ten couldn't make it in time, and it was up to all remaining forces on-site. Even as the main gun was destroyed, innumerable cannons -each a segment of the mothership, began firing upon Storm. Lacking the necessary armor to sustain hits, these cannons would begin falling out of the sky, too. The first shield fell, and the second one was losing integrity. Squadrons attempted to stop Storm, but their efforts were in vain. The last shield fell. While the final cannon array inflicted the heaviest damage upon Storm, and were the hardest to hit, even they were destroyed. The core, exposed, was brought down and destroyed. Our god survived the core's explosion, barely damaged, and he planned to take on Storm. Only he and his royal guard were present. I knew the other motherships weren't fast enough to reach, and I could only watch. He wasn't defenseless -far from that, enemy soldiers disintegrated shot after shot, but Storm One weathered the blows. They began fighting back. &amp;#x200B; Shells 3/4 the size of an average human repeatedly blasted into him, and the rest of the Storm units had begun joining in. &amp;#x200B; The dead bodies of the royal guard laid around Storm. &amp;#x200B; Meteors impacted Storm's location, razing buildings to the ground. &amp;#x200B; I saw Storm One, still firing, still yelling alongside their fellow soldiers. &amp;#x200B; I saw a flash of light, and the dismembered remains of my god fall to the ground. &amp;#x200B; It's been 21 years since that event, double that for the humans, and I fear the day they return to space. We are still lost, the years under a psychic lull driving any meaning out of life. We have ignited a burning resentment in the humans, and that fire will only extinguish when we are, too. &amp;#x200B; I dread the day a new unit takes up the name of Storm One. &amp;#x200B; --- Obviously, this is a little story based off of EDF, and with the announcement of EDF 6, there's no better time than now to post it. I hope you enjoyed it."

""The simulations of their physiology and biochemistry are returning nonsense results on whether hibernation can be induced."" &amp;#x200B; ""What kind of nonsense?"" the Captain asked. &amp;#x200B; ""That they have a normal threshold of toxicity for hydrogen sulfide, but that concentrations of some ridiculous multiple of the toxic threshold will induce hibernation rather than killing them, for example,"" the CMO said. ""Another example: they will begin to suffer neural necrosis in as little as two to five minutes without oxygen. A thermodynamic environment that leaches heat from them much faster than their bodies can generate it can kill them in a similar time-frame. But hypoxia and acute hypothermia in combination can allow them to survive for several hours."" &amp;#x200B; ""I see what you mean by nonsensical results,"" the Captain said. ""It's three weeks to Central, at our best non-override speed. What was that about muscle wasting?"" &amp;#x200B; ""It's only the chemical precursors at this point,"" the CMO said. ""Nothing that would be detectable by a physical exam--yet. But the, admittedly unreliable with this species, simulations suggest that total immobility could become significantly deleterious to their health in less than a week. We're going to have to use some kind of motor stimulation along with the bliss chip."" &amp;#x200B; ""But you can keep them relatively healthy for three weeks?"" the Captain pressed. &amp;#x200B; ""I can keep them alive,"" the CMO said. ""The physicians at Central won't be happy with me, though."" &amp;#x200B; ""Better than the shape they'd be in if i override the warp limiter and it jumps exponents on us,"" the Captain said. ""I'll make it clear to your superiors that i was the one to make the call."" &amp;#x200B; The CMO got an emergency ping on her personal com, then. She answered and heard, ""One of the specimens is showing a sympathetic distress response to the bliss chip. We tried increasing the output of the bliss chip, and the distress response is showing signs of scaling exponentially."" &amp;#x200B; ""What!?"" the CMO said into the com as she slid towards the quarantine medical bay. A misplaced electrode from the bliss chip would have produced a linear relationship. ""Dial it back to baseline, at least that can't make things any worse than they are already."" &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* &amp;#x200B; *Wrong...

Becky's eyes snap open and her arms fling out to the sides, crashing through tubes and wires and unknown medical apparatus. Her hands grasp for anything that might serve as a weapon, and one closes on something soft and living. She pulls the creature close and smashes her forehead into it. Her free hand reaches to scratch the back of her head and comes away with something that looks like an induction charger. &amp;#x200B; Droud. An addiction that should have stayed fictional. ""Get it out!"" Becky looks around and sees she's not the only human in the hospital beds. ""Get them all out!"" She looks at the alien?--alien!--she's holding, and suddenly realizes that they probably don't understand a word she's saying. The staff of this alien hospital ward are scurrying around yelling at each other, not watching Becky, not enough for pantomime to work. She grabs the hand of her hostage and bites off a finger, chews a couple of times, and then spits it out, nearly vomiting in the process. That gets the aliens' undivided attention. Becky drops the external component on the floor and crushes it, then uses her free hand to mime extracting something from her head. She points at the other patients and repeats the extracting from head motions. Then she walks over to a digital display on the wall, one whose symbols are changing at a consistent rate that suggests clock, points at one of the symbols that hasn't changed yet, and mimes biting off another finger. Then she repeats the remove from head pantomime. &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* &amp;#x200B; The Chief Medical Officer watches all this through the observation window and wonders just what kind of monsters they've picked up, wonders if the reports of their being a speaking species were wrong.

She reaches for the hardlink com-unit to call security, only to have the device knocked from her upper appendage by the Psych Nurse. &amp;#x200B; The Psych Nurse picks herself up (she had to use her body as a projectile in order to pull off dis-comming the CMO) and says, ""Fear-rage."" &amp;#x200B; The CMO stares down at the little fur-ball. She knows what Fear-rage is--it's a common problem among warriors who ended up facing a different threat profile than the one they trained for--but she can't see how it applies here. &amp;#x200B; ""Fear-rage,"" the Psych Nurse repeats. ""It sees the Bliss Chip as a threat. It wants them removed, from all of its kind."" &amp;#x200B; The CMO scoffs. ""How can pleasure be a threat?"" &amp;#x200B; The Psych Nurse ruffles her fur in the equivalent of a shrug. "" 'Why?' comes later. For now, all that matters is 'Is'."" &amp;#x200B; The CMO finally yields to the specialist.

Give it back,"" Jack mumbles. &amp;#x200B; ""Uncle Jack, Uncle Jack, i need you, Uncle Jack."" &amp;#x200B; Becky, Jack's memory finally dredges up. His niece, the only one of his kin who still refused to give up on him, no matter how many times he failed, no matter that he'd failed her as bad as he'd failed the rest. ""Whut's zat?"" he asks, a bit more coherently. &amp;#x200B; ""You fought the bottle,"" Becky says. ""Even if you didn't always win, you always got back to fighting it again. I need you to teach the others how to fight the droud."" &amp;#x200B; Jack isn't sure what a drood is, but his niece sounds scared of it. He looks around, sees he's in an open hospital ward--with alien doctors. ""I'm drunk,"" he says. &amp;#x200B; ""Not this time,"" Becky answers. ""They really are aliens, and i need you to watch my back while i'm watching them to make sure they take the drouds out and don't do anything else. Also, thump any of the others who try to do something stupid when they come out of it."" &amp;#x200B; ""Okay,"" Jack says. He thinks that Becky is looking a bit feral, but what does he know, he's just an old drunk. &amp;#x200B; Becky watches the alien doctors work until all the chips are out of rest of the humans. ""Do you need me to watch while they work on you?"" Jack asks. &amp;#x200B; ""No,"" Becky answers. ""Mine can wait till we get back to Earth: i'll kill anyone who tries to plug it back in."" She releases her alien hostage for medical treatment and grabs a fresh one, one who seems a bit more resilient. &amp;#x200B; ""What makes you so sure we'll get home?"" Jack asks. &amp;#x200B; ""They'll take us home, or i'll start killing them until they kill us,"" Becky answers. ""The only reason to force an addiction on somebody is slave labor, and the only position available to unskilled laborers in a high tech society is sex worker. Whether they agree to take us home or decide to kill us all, fighting is win-win, as far as i can tell."" &amp;#x200B; Jack remembers what a few of the hard-core drug users he's known were willing to do, and can't say his niece is wrong. &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* &amp;#x200B; ""She wants to go home,"" the Psych Nurse says after studying the pictures the specimen that rejected the Bliss Chip has drawn. ""One of those circles with the line segments under it, that's a rough approximation of their anatomy. The big circle is a planet, with lots of them living on it. The deltoid shape is a ship, taking some of them away. The last drawing is the ship bringing them back to their planet."" &amp;#x200B; The captain scowls. ""We can't take them back--we need to take them to Central so that the linguists can start working on a translator for them."" &amp;#x200B; ""I don't know why the Bliss Chip inspires so much Fear-rage in that one,"" the Psych Nurse answers, ""but it means that she won't deal with us from anything other than a position of strength--that's why she always keeps one of the medics within reach, and it's why she won't settle for anything less than going straight home. It would be safer to go back to their planet and let **them** try to learn **our** languages."" &amp;#x200B; ""Are you certain that one isn't simply psychotic?"" the Captain asks. &amp;#x200B; ""The big one that is acting as the first one's enforcer, he has the Fear-rage too,"" the Psych Nurse answers. ""Only it's directed inward in him, instead of outward. &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* &amp;#x200B; Becky has to actually eat someone's finger to convince the aliens that going home is non-negotiable. Jack wonders if his niece has turned into a full-blown psychopath, until she vomits it back up. ""I hope i never have to do anything like that again, ever,"" Becky says. &amp;#x200B; ""What exactly is this drood, anyway?"" Jack asks. &amp;#x200B; ""Something that should have stayed fictional,"" Becky answers. ""A device that trickles electrical current directly into the reward center of the brain. The version Niven wrote had to have strict dosage regulators and other safety mechanisms built in, or else the user would just plug himself into a wall socket and die of neglecting basic necessities--food, water, emptying his bladder."" &amp;#x200B; ""That doesn't sound like a bad way to go,"" Jack says. ""Not if it feels as good as what i woke up from, here."" &amp;#x200B; ""That,"" Becky says, ""is why it should have stayed fictional."" &amp;#x200B; ""World might be better off without drunken old sots like me,"" Jack says. ""I could have stopped them, that day, you know. But i was so drunk, i just watched from the porch and laughed."" &amp;#x200B; ""You told the truth when Billy and Joel tried to claim i'd asked for a hit of what they were smoking,"" Becky says. ""Bobby, now, you probably owe an apology to--your belt would have done less damage than my teeth did."" She guessed the logical next suggestion and added, ""Don't go thinking they would have been better off without you, either. Statistics i've seen, no father at all is just as hard on a boy's chances of growing up sound as a father who's married to the bottle."" &amp;#x200B; The rest of the day goes better than Becky expected. It takes a while to get across to the aliens that she wants to start learning their words; once she gets a few of them to cooperate, it takes an hour just to work out that their translators have to be manually set to deliver a specific language toward her. Adjustments are made, and it takes another hour for her to sort out which sounds matter for the chosen language. She finally gets it, however, and works out a notation system that lets her keep them all straight; then she starts pointing at things and repeating and writing down the words. &amp;#x200B; The aliens are shocked to hear Becky get more than a dozen words correct before she calls for a break. They would have been even more shocked if they'd known that Becky is complaining about how long she's taking, convinced that a trained linguist could have accomplished twice as much in half the time. &amp;#x200B; The next day the aliens are even more shocked to hear Becky using all the words she'd learned the previous day, and adding more as quickly as they can find ways to indicate what various words mean. Becky is frustrated by how much time she has to spend searching through her notes for the word she wants to use; the aliens are awed by how often she doesn't refer to her notes. The rest of the humans are amusing themselves with the fact that they only need to master three or four words an alien language to have the aliens gawking. &amp;#x200B; By now Becky's gone long enough without sleep that she's getting clumsy. ""You can't stay awake all the way back to Earth,"" Jack tells her. ""I'll keep watch while you grab some shut-eye."" &amp;#x200B; Becky isn't happy about it, but she does vaguely remember something about the military finding out the hard way that three days without sleep is the limit on useful function, even with prescription strength stimulants. Asking the aliens to make amphetamines is still beyond her linguistic and artistic abilities, anyway. She arranges some of the equipment she broke when she first woke up so that no one can get close to her without making a lot of noise and lays down on one of the hospital beds. She's too nervous to fall asleep quickly; but once she finally sleeps, she sleeps hard. &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* &amp;#x200B; Becky wakes to find what looks like an oversized albino tribble laying atop her and hissing at an alien that looks a lot like a grizzly. The only other alien in the room is one of the doctors. Becky slides out from under the fur-ball alien and goes to find her Uncle Jack. He's sitting by the door to the sanitary facilities with a jug of water + ethanol. Becky crouches in front of him and asks sadly, ""You couldn't hold out a few more days till we got home?"" &amp;#x200B; Jack looks at his niece and shakes his head. ""As long as i had to go looking for it, i could manage; but when someone handed it to me..."" He drops his head again. ""I'm no good. Nothing but failure. You'd be better off if i were gone."" &amp;#x200B; ""That first day would have been a massacre without you, you're the only one big enough to keep order,"" Becky says. ""And do you know what separates the righteous man from the wicked?"" Her uncle shakes his head and she continues, ""The righteous man and the wicked one both fall. The righteous man gets back up. And keeps getting back up, as many times as it takes."" &amp;#x200B; Jack thinks this over, and then hands the bottle to his niece. She's spun this line for him before, but she might be right about needing his muscle. &amp;#x200B; Becky has a pretty good guess as to which of the aliens spotted her uncle's weakness. She stands up and hollers at the pair of arguing aliens, ""Hey Sergeant, this yours?"" Both aliens turn to look at her, and she uses both hands to sling the jug at the grizzly. &amp;#x200B; The grizzly-alien bats the jug aside, his claws ripping it open in the process, and starts to charge Becky. He's interrupted by a body tackle from the tribble-alien. The tribble-alien isn't heavy enough to stop him, of course; but he reacts like he's been reprimanded by a superior officer. Or by a nurse. &amp;#x200B; Becky finds her notes and asks in the alien's words ""We go home now?"" &amp;#x200B; ""No!"" the intercom shouts. &amp;#x200B; ""Yes!"" the tribble-alien retorts. The tribble-alien glides across the floor to Becky. &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* &amp;#x200B; ""Are you trying to ruin everything,"" the Psych Nurse asks the Chief Security Officer, as the specimen picks her up. She frets for a moment, wondering if those hands are going to start searching for weak points in her anatomy, but soon they start stroking. She smiles to herself: no species with the stroking reflex is wholly violent. ""That tranquilizer of yours is triggering the same Fear-rage as the Bliss Chip."" &amp;#x200B; ""That doesn't make any sense,"" the CSO growls back. ""Unless they met an enemy that found a way to weaponize the chip--and that doesn't make sense either."" &amp;#x200B; ""There's something strange going on with their pleasure centers,"" the Psych Nurse says. ""Something to do with the way they can learn so fast, but it may cause calibration errors. I don't understand it, but i think i'm starting to see what questions to ask. I think the Bliss Chips may be harmful to their species, although i don't see a mechanism, yet."" She glared up at the intercom speakers. ""We owe them."" &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* &amp;#x200B; It took three years on Earth before the Psych Nurse finally understood the concept of addiction well enough to attempt to explain it to Central. That was also how long it took the humans to decide they understood the alien tech well enough to risk an official first contact. And so it was three years after the disappearance of the *Sector NE432 Survey Ship* that Central received a communication from the missing Captain of said ship. All the Captain said was, ""These hoo-mins have an issue with the Bliss Chip; i'll let our Psych Nurse try to explain it."" &amp;#x200B; The Psych Nurse of the missing *Sector NE432 Survey Ship* was visibly exhausted, something that wasn't believed to be possible in her species--most people thought *furble*s stayed fluffy till they died. She began her report: &amp;#x200B; ""The hyu-mins have an unusual pleasure response, one that rewards them for accomplishing even the most trivial of goals. Usually. Chemicals and experiences that stimulate a disproportionate pleasure reaction activate damping mechanisms to bring it back within the normal operating range. If repeated disproportionate stimulation occurs within a short period of time, this can result in the hyu-min in question seeking out ever increasing doses of the stimulating chemical or experience. This the hyu-mins term ad-dik-shun. &amp;#x200B; ""This ad-dik-shun vulnerability appears to be a side effect of hyu-min developmental process. Unlike any other species except the animals native to their planet, hyu-mins do not have an innate target muscle mass. Their muscles grow or atrophy based on how much they are used. In order to get stronger, a hyu-min has to use his body to a degree that causes minor pain. Because they have functional self-preservation instincts, their bodies have to reward them for ignoring certain types of pain, or else they will slowly waste away until they can no longer survive. They pay in pain for as little as four days of reduced activity."" &amp;#x200B; (Incredulity from Central.) &amp;#x200B; ""A similar process applies to intellectual pursuits, in the hyu-mins. They get rewarded with pleasure for things like solving puzzles and acquiring more information. As a result, they never stop learning, and they can learn very quickly. Their linguists attained full fluency in our languages in less than two years. And by full fluency, i mean that they were ready to attempt a first draft translation of one of their major religious texts, one that includes poetry and legal contracts as well as biography and historical narrative, into my language."" &amp;#x200B; (Absolute incredulity from Central. Religion is a notoriously touchy subject; poetry is notoriously hard to translate, and standard procedure was to allow a professional linguist at least a year to establish a rudimentary survival vocabulary.) &amp;#x200B; ""So for a normal hyu-min the Bliss Chip is the ultimate ad-dik-shun: all of the reward without any of the pain. Fortunately for the hyu-mins, neurosurgery is a high-end specialization, so few can afford to have such a chip installed, and few surgeons can be bribed to do so when there is no medical benefit. It is difficult to estimate how much a cheap and easily installed Bliss Chip would reduce their population by: many of them understand the danger to members of their species of pursuing disproportionate pleasure, but only a few appear to be completely resistant to ad-dik-shun. &amp;#x200B; ""In addition to their extraordinary learning capacity and hyper-rapid adaptability, the hyu-mins have an extraordinarily diverse baseline psychology. One outlier psychotype reacts to a disproportionate pleasure stimuli as if it were an invasion, resulting in an equally disproportionate distress response. This was how one of the hyu-mins we had captured was able to regain full operational capacity while the Bliss Chip was still activated."" &amp;#x200B; \[Angry words outside of the microphone's reliable pick-up range.\] &amp;#x200B; ""Um, i've been told i need to make it clear that this is not a matter of excessive pleasure causing distress, of their being such a thing as feeling too good; but rather that the disproportionate pleasure stimulus simply does **not** register as pleasure. I'm going to have to take her word for that. &amp;#x200B; ""Normally in hyu-mins ad-dik-shun only happens in those who choose to pursue disproportionate pleasure stimuli. However, due to the rapidity with which they develop tolerance for and physiological dependency on chemical stimuli, it is possible to impose ad-dik-shun on a normal human. Historically this would sometimes be done to gain a pacified slave force, but as increasing mechanization reduced the demand for unskilled labor, such forced addiction became associated with only the most nefarious of purposes. &amp;#x200B; ""Because of the Bliss Chips, they thought we wanted them for involuntary \[non-reproductive mating\]"" &amp;#x200B; (Pandemonium at Central. That adjective attached to that expletive was an unspeakable perversion. And it was the only explanation the hyu-mins could imagine for the Bliss Chips?) &amp;#x200B; ""Because i argued for returning the hyu-mins we had taken even after the source of coercion had been removed, i was able to convince the hyu-mins that we had no ill intent. But because most of their planet's animal species have this ad-dik-shun vulnerability as well, i have been unable to convince them that it is possible for a species capable of learning to lack this vulnerability. They are convinced we are suffering from ad-dik-shun and are in denial. &amp;#x200B; ""They think we need their help."" &amp;#x200B; Try as they might, none of the psychologists at Central could figure out why the Psyche Nurse from the *Sector NE432 Survey Ship* sounded so horrified by the prospect of the hyu-mins wanting to help."
3,vulnerability,HFY,Hyper-Adaptive: Sensory Fatigue,1,i0xab4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/i0xab4/hyperadaptive_sensory_fatigue/,2020-07-31 10:05:25,"This is long enough after the events of [Intervention](URL that humans have established formal diplomatic relations with the alien Central Coalition. Membership debates on both sides are waiting on more thorough assessments of physiological and cultural compatibility. &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* &amp;#x200B; From: Associate Director of New Species Integration To: General Distribution: Central Subject: implications of human biology for negative interaction rates &amp;#x200B; Persons directly or indirectly involved with the human integration studies have been filing an abnormally large number of complaints. 96.3% of these complaints can be traced directly to the humans' unique physiology: specifically, to their hyper-rapid adaptation. &amp;#x200B; Humans can modify their bone density on the same time scale that most species require for adjustments to muscle mass. A human can induce significant gain or atrophy of his major motor muscles in only a few days. The primary trigger in a human for changes in muscle mass is changes in muscle use. As a result, humans **require** motion. Their own medical researchers currently recommend that a human engage in five minutes of walking for every thirty minutes spent sitting; most humans are fine with 1-3 hours in a sufficiently comfortable seat so long as they are allowed plenty of physical activity before and after. Although humans can be trained to sit still for longer periods, this is generally considered deleterious to their health. A human who refuses to sit through a fourteen hour presentation is not being rude, he is acting on his self-preservation instincts. &amp;#x200B; No, the biochemical and physiological simulations on humans are not giving spurious results. Although the humans do not have any truly novel mechanisms for chemical tolerance or psychological adaptation, they are unique in the speed at which these mechanisms operate. Ask any fluid engineer about the difference between laminar flow and turbulence. The transition between simple laminar flow and the chaotic regime called turbulence is primarily a function of velocity. Likewise, the humans' hyper-rapid adaptation makes their physiology an essentially chaotic regime. Ask any meteorologist why this is a problem. Actually, human physiology is worse than meteorology because weather is essentially passive while biology is capable of intelligent adaptation, including both pre-programmed responses and learned behaviors. &amp;#x200B; Unlike most species, which rely on hereditary knowledge or a brief window of skill acquisition during early development, humans retain significant neuroplasticity and learning capacity throughout their adult lives. This, in combination with their chaotic physiology and native environment means that there is no such thing as fully trained human. Their training protocols generally focus on basic skills and calibrating their learning mechanisms for the relevant threat or opportunity profiles. No matter how thorough a human's training, the final refinement of his knowledge can only occur on the job. As a result, humans in positions that we would expect to be well-polished may still make significant social and cultural gaffs. Gently apprise the human as to the nature of the infraction; he will usually apologize and promise to avoid the action in question in the future. &amp;#x200B; It is true that a motivated human can learn a survival level vocabulary of another language in a matter of days, given a cooperative partner. This does not mean, however, that a human can be expected to remember everything you tell him. Their capacity for learning, while astonishing, is not infinite. Keep in mind, also, that while we are currently in the process of integrating three new species into our cognitive models, the humans are having to integrate over four hundred. A typical human will require three to seven reminders that a particular action is a non-traumatic impropriety. If a human fails to adjust his behavior after more than twelve consecutive reminders, notify his superiors, as this may be a sign of overwork or environmental factors that impair learning in humans. He may also be a jerk; the humans try to filter these out, but some humans with jerkish inclinations don't manifest them until all other jerks have been removed. A human who fails to modify his behavior after more than thirty consecutive reminders that a certain action is problematic for your species should be referred for medical evaluation. Yes that is the point at which some faster adapting individuals of other species might first start to sometimes remember to avoid the action in question. &amp;#x200B; One of the prices humans pay for their rapid learning is an abnormally low tolerance for sleep deprivation. Do not interrupt a human's sleep cycle unless there is a clear and present danger that requires the human's assistance to avoid or neutralize. Even with military grade stimulants, a human has a maximum of three days before their motor skills and judgment are impaired to the point that they become more liability than asset. Do not be fooled by the fact that some humans can approach this limit on recreational grade stimulants: unprovoked Fear-rage and hallucinations are inevitable for a human suffering from acute sleep deprivation. Signs of chronic sleep deprivation in a human include irritability, impaired memory, and increased appetite for refined carbohydrates. &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* &amp;#x200B; From: Associate Director of New Species Integration To: General Distribution: Central Subject: Continued: implications of human biology for negative interaction rates &amp;#x200B; The vast majority of speaking species have only single primary sense, or a primary sense and a strong secondary, with the remaining senses being largely subliminal and being tasked with short-range threat detection and maintaining homeostasis. &amp;#x200B; By raw data collection rates, the humans have almost nothing but primary senses. Going by perception, they have at least four: vision, hearing, taste (oral tactile and chemo-receptors plus olfactory chemo-receptors.), and an aggregate sense best termed feeling. This aggregate sense includes tactile and thermal receptors as well as proprioception and emotional states, and even includes subliminal components of the auditory input. An exhaustive list of human secondary senses has not yet been compiled. &amp;#x200B; As impressive as the human intellectual capacity is, they would be subject to constant sensory overload were it not for the mechanisms they have to suppress sensory input. Their speed with which they can adapt means that they normally do not need to be aware of static environmental conditions, only changing ones. Humans can detect many airborne odorant molecules in the same parts-per-million concentrations as species that have chemo-reception as a primary sense; but if the concentration of the odorant in question remains constant, the typical human will stop noticing it after about five minutes. The human auditory system will tune out even intermittent noises if they are sufficiently familiar. A breakdown of the various categories of complaints follows. &amp;#x200B; Visiual: Visual input in the humans is actually the fastest to fatigue, necessitating the eyeball jitter that members of certain vision-primary species regularly complain about. This jitter is imperceptible to the human in question--they perceive frame-rates as low as 60 Hz as continuous motion--and is the only thing keeping the object or person they are looking at from disappearing from their perception. Human eyeball jitter is not a sign of inattention; it is a necessary mechanism for them to continue paying attention. &amp;#x200B; Auditory: The chaotic regime of human adaptive mechanisms makes their auditory filters extremely unpredictable. Although humans are as prone to deception as any other species, a human who says he didn't hear you probably genuinely didn't hear you. This is especially true if the human was reading at the time, as something about the written word appears to be capable of partially engaging some of the sensory shut-off mechanisms that guard the deeper phases of the human sleep cycle. &amp;#x200B; Food: The human 'taste' sense seems oddly overdeveloped. Nevertheless, their rejection of excessive sameness in food is a feature, not a bug--they are obligate omnivores, and they still haven't catalogued the full array of trace nutrients they need for optimal health. Although humans can survive on synthetic products containing an appropriate mix of bulk nutrients and major essential vitamins, they generally resort to this only when on a feeding tube. Human sourced emergency rations may seem unnecessarily complicated, but the only use for Central-standard emergency rations for a human is to reset his appreciation of his MREs when he's been living on them too long. &amp;#x200B; Food, Social: For the majority of humans, eating is an inherently social activity. This results in a variety of cultural land-mines that even the humans can't figure out how to defuse. Despite high rates of allergies, intolerances, cultural and idiosyncratic rejections of certain consumables as food, and religious taboos, most humans consider it rude to ask what's in a dish before sampling it. It is also generally impossible to progress to a friendship level relationship with a human without sharing consumables at some point. (No, this does not mean sharing utensils or eating out of the same bowl, just eating in the same room at the same time.) In general, it is best to keep the relationship purely professional unless you know you are dealing with one of the minority of humans who won't take differences in taste personally and understands the need to do an extra safety check on what you're ingesting. &amp;#x200B; Tactile: Social norms regarding physical contact vary widely in humans. In general, it's best for self-described ""huggers"" to be assigned to work with species that engage in significant amounts of physical contact at the acquaintance level. Using the human startle response as a source of entertainment is dangerous: many humans are good at overruling Fear-rage, until someone successfully sneaks up on them. Some injuries have resulted; that these have all been minor so far is due mostly to the fact that the incidents involved civilian humans with underdeveloped tactile filtration rather than warriors with post-combat sensitizations. When in doubt, adhere to the Central-standards for professional interaction. A human, or a member of any other species, who objects to your insistence on adhering to protocol should be reported to his superiors. Likewise, do not pressure a reluctant human into departing from protocol, no matter what any other human has told you the human in question would like. &amp;#x200B; Boredom: The mechanisms that protect humans from sensory overload leave them unexpectedly vulnerable to sensory deprivation. Humans require not just a steady influx of sensation, but a steady influx of **changing** sensation. This may be why, even though they need less than half of a day+night cycle for sleep and food and hygiene, they cannot consistently devote more than a third of the cycle to their assigned function. Some humans choice of recreational activity may appear similar to their work activities; in such cases the content is usually very different. A technical report and a novel are both read, but they are as unalike as fruit and meat. This vulnerability to sensory deprivation may also by why some humans insist on background music while they're working. It is generally more effective to refer a human who refuses to turn the volume down to medical for a hearing evaluation than to file a complaint with his superiors. &amp;#x200B; Placebo Effect: Yes, a human really did die from being told that he had been poisoned. This degree of susceptibility to the placebo phenomenon is extremely rare, but any human's medical prognosis will be at least slightly affected by what he believes to be true. Human emergency medics are trained to never comment on how bad the patient looks, regardless of how thoroughly unconscious he appears to be. It is sometimes possible to keep a human alive long enough for medical help to arrive by telling him he has been given an appropriate medicine. Yes this creates a lot of ethical headaches. This placebo effect is poorly understood, even by the humans who suffer and benefit from it. It may result from some interaction between the chaotic nature of their adaptive responses and the fact that some of those biochemical adaptations can be performed preemptively, in anticipation of upcoming need. &amp;#x200B; Remember: with humans even more so than with most not yet fully integrated species, assumptions can be deadly."
4,vulnerability,HFY,The Other Moon,27,gz86au,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/gz86au/the_other_moon/,2020-06-09 07:07:14,"[You can read it here.](URL This is a sequel to [Seeker](URL and [Frameshift](URL which were posted here some time ago. \*\*\*\*\* There is star-filled space, a dim and distant orange-red sun and, off to one side, the umber cloud-tops of a gas giant. There is a flash of brilliant actinic light, and it appears like a conjuring trick, like the universe itself has glitched - the Other Moon, huge as a mountain. To all appearances, it is an asteroid - almond-shaped, grey-brown and pitted by craters, tall as a city. It sits motionless, ten thousand kilometres above the clouds, in grand defiance of orbital mechanics. Clinging to its fore end, in the midst of a flat expanse clear of boulders and canyons, is a curious stone orrery, a miniature representation of this stellar system shaped out of asteroidal rock. It was built when the universe was young, made to be understood. It is the control interface - moving a marker across the orrery will move the Other Moon, as if by sympathetic magic. In its midst of this orrery sits a hunched, suited, four-limbed figure, bony jaw-plates and keenly intelligent eyes searching, always searching, for something new to comprehend and master. She is an explorer, the most cunning and curious of all Dyn - and, as she would tell it, the wisest. She calls herself Seeker, and though she has already discovered much, her journey is far from over. Seeker relaxed, relieved to have escaped the threatening environment around Firsthome. Below her, the churning clouds of the giant world her people knew as The Eye filled half the sky. She looked down at the orrery, at the gem shed placed next to the rounded pebble that represented The Eye. That was it - the last planet to be visited. She was the first to see many of these places from orbit - there was Firsthome, her home, the inner rocky worlds and now The Eye. There were no more anomalies - absolutely nothing to indicate the former presence of the Others. She needed to look further. Seeker glanced down at the grand orrery - it was a perfect model of her home system, the First system, but that was all. Of course, there were no representations of anything beyond the First system - but there was no fundamental reason for that limit. She just needed to give it the correct instruction. And then, the stars. Tell me how you work, she said, in her own language. No response. Tell me why you are here. No response. Tell me who made you. Seeker sat before the orrery for long hours. She had time - even if some foolhardy Dyn pursued her by conventional means, they wouldnt arrive for months. Those who built this place had almost nothing in common with her except, apparently, a desire to help and to be understood. The orrery was evidence of that. If the Others could interpret the orrery, perhaps they could understand a code of hers. Seeker drew a grabber from the belt around her midsection, and began scratching in the ground. She had long since memorised charts of local space (local - when even the nearest star could never be reached in a hundred lifetimes of flight in the fastest ship ever built!), the only remaining question was one of *projection*. Extend a plane out of the First systems ecliptic, scale distances correctly - one to one hundred quadrillion. Find and grind pebbles to a rough scale approximation. Scale their size by planetary mass - not radius. The pebbles in the first orrery werent scaled by radius. Make marks with the grabber to measure intervals. They dont have to be exact - construct a new map in the place of the old one, but on a higher scale. Show interstellar distances. Make it understand where she needed to be. It was done within an hour. The orrery shifted beneath Seeker, the pebbles moving slightly as the Other Moon made corrections. It understood. This was not the end of the mystery. It was the beginning. Seeker raised the gem, and placed it next to the nearest pebble. The universe folded around her. The Eye and the First Sun disappeared. Dyn knew the meaning of their lives. It was to play their part in the Line - immortal, omnipresent, all-consuming. The connection of parent to child, the unbroken chain of inheritance, provided a greater purpose than any single mind or body could contrive. The individual was a cell, the Line was the whole, the end-in-itself. Seeker knew her Line would endure. She knew her destiny was the universe. She had everything a Dyn could desire. Why was she not satisfied? The restlessness had begun when she first gained independence, breaking free of the warren of tunnels on the border of Night and fleeing into that cold unknown to found a new Line and domain. The search had intensified when she had reached out into the greater night that lay beyond Firsthome, leading her species into space behind her, discovering the false asteroid and uncovering its secret. She would never stop reaching for new boundaries to breach. The search was never-ending - the ending was the search. The speed of the engine Seeker stood on had turned the stars into a distorted swirl of light. The sky was black, aside from a single splash of blue light to the fore, in the direction of travel. Her asteroid moved so fast that even photons of light were twisted in their paths. The effect reminded her of rain droplets striking her jaw-plates when she used to gallop through the forests of Firsthome; whichever way she turned they always seemed to be coming at her. Her ship had been dismantled over the first weeks and months of her journey and reassembled into a makeshift shelter on the surface of her new home. This was not a true asteroid. It was a facade, a shell of accumulated rock and iron around something utterly incomprehensible, older than her species. She could expand out over its surface from here, melting and casting the asteroidal rock into domes. It would be difficult. The Other Moon had already taken her hundreds of times further than any other explorer had come. Already she was moving thousands of times faster. Lightspeed - other Dyn thought it was something special about light, something like the sound barrier which her rockets and cannons had once broken and then left far behind. But this is incorrect. Time and distance are related at the most basic level of the Universe, both reflections of something higher. Talk of exceeding it is sheer semantic nonsense. You cannot count all the way to infinity and *then go past that.* But these limitations would not stop her. Practicalities absorbed the first months of Seekers residence aboard the Other Moon. Her ship carried bioreactors, a viable core of subservient Dyn, and a fully functional machine-shop. She lived, and learned to sustain life. Her Other Moon left the First System and continued on its way, following the path she ordained the day she had discovered this place. The pale blue glow of aberrated starlight was barely enough to illuminate Seekers habitat, assembled around the summit of the Other Moon, surrounding the grand orrery like a temple complex around its altar. An observer flying above the Other Moon might just make out the regular silhouettes of artificial constructs, if the flickering light of frameshift travel happened to glance across the surface just right. They might distinguish the boxy reassembled ship shelter from its surrounding cluster of domes; hydroponics, machine-shop, astronomical instruments aimed directly ahead, and a barracks/breeding-pen, all scavenged from the ship or manufactured from the silicon and iron of the Other Moons surface. Off to one side, the tall towers of heat-radiators stood above a fission reactor, and all around were the tiny mobile shadows of suited upper-children roaming about the craggy surface; gathering raw materials, taking measurements and surveying. Seekers domain barely changed from month to month or even year to year, having settled into a steady equilibrium on its long interstellar voyage. In a chamber which had once been the flight deck of Seekers exploration vessel, she sat, hunched over in concentration. The topic of Seekers thoughts never wavered - the Others, their motives and their apparent absence from the universe. It was a simple enough sequence of thoughts. The Other Moon was left by a benevolent mind, those Others who had wished to grant her species a means to travel the stars. This was no mere trinket or triviality - it was a thousand-trillion ton asteroid which could blink out of existence in one place and then flare up in another like a forest fire, appearing as fast as light permitted. It was meant to be used for something great. It was a gift. But why? Seeker wondered to herself. Shed spent a few hours inspecting her new, somewhat bare domain, barely noticing the achievement of constructing this with such limited resources. She was thinking of the Others, and their orrery. Why not simply send a message? If their power was so incredible, why not simply appear in person to make their demands or declare their intentions? That was what she would do. That was what any Dyn would do. Instead, they had left a dumb tool and an implicit message - *use this as you see fit*. She could form no coherent picture of their motives. If her questions had answers, they would be found out among the stars. Seeker would reach them, one by one. It might take many more lifetimes, but that didnt matter. The individual was only a cell. She would find whatever had sent the Other Moon, completing the mission inherent in its existence. Seeker returned to her quarters and again lost long hours to silent contemplation. Her mind moved faster now even than in those heady days when she had first contemplated spaceflight. New ideas came uncontrollably, some utterly mundane and others wild and far removed from reality. She could extract and enrich uranium from the regolith, and keep her domain powered indefinitely. One day she might reverse-engineer the power of the Other Moon, and blip between continents and worlds like stepping over stones in a stream. It was so *frustrating*, knowing that even if her Line persisted for a thousand centuries there would never be enough time, that there would always be lives she would never lead. Dyn had little need for personal comfort - when Seeker retired, it was to a blown-rock dome just large enough to pace around in, floored and walled by the ubiquitous, and almost symbiotic, frond-moss. When the nightmares began she was not prepared. Dyn rarely sleep - their brains rest in stages, ensuring a minimal level of consciousness at all times, valuable on a world with no day-night cycle. But they still have the capacity, rarely invoked, to fully escape consciousness. Seeker used it as infrequently as possible. Seeker never could adequately describe the content of her dreams, would never summon words or images that fit what she had seen. One word, only - *shadows*. Like those cast by the ancient hunter-kites which used to prey on careless young Dyn, like something vast and terrible had turned slowly to look at her. She assumed that ancient fears of vulnerability had risen up. Dyn arent meant to be cut adrift from their kind as she was. Seeker put the shadows out of her mind during the long weeks between rests, though as she felt the weariness build day by day, she still faced sleep with apprehension. Perhaps this was final proof of just how far she had drifted from true Dyn - that her mind was throwing up such fantasies in its quieter moments. All the while, the first of her target stars drew closer - first trillions, then billions, then mere hundreds of millions of kilometres ahead. She would search for artefacts like the Other Moon or other evidence of lost civilization and then move on. The Other Moon appeared high above the second systems ecliptic. Her telescopes found new worlds, none life bearing, and imaged asteroids by the thousands. None of these showed anomalous motion. She blipped between the planets next, following short jumps of a few minutes each. She saw wonders; towering mountains of ice, churning cloud tops in colours her brain had never catalogued before, rivers of molten metal on planets blasted by solar radiation. She sent disposable lower-children to the surface of some worlds, in one-use gliders or landers, chemical-propelled and with the barest minimum of guidance. The images they sent back only increased her appetite for discovery. After what felt like a million centuries of exploration, the second system had been surveyed completely. There was nothing. No sign of the Others having ever existed - which was insane. Not that they were gone - Seeker knew species rose and fell, that extinction was always a possibility. Rather, that they had left behind nothing - no mined-out asteroids, no structures, no monuments or lasting legacy - as if they had carefully tidied up after themselves, or had been *made to never be* \- impossible. Seeker knew that if she had a fraction of their power she would have remade the universe - whole worlds mined and converted to habitats, Dyson swarms, clouds of interstellar ships so dense they blotted out the starlight. If she had such fantasies, surely some among the Others had as well. Even if they were gone, where was their legacy? The question tore at Seeker as she prepared for the next journey. Volatiles, water and organics were not plentiful on her journey between the stars. She had developed finer control over the Other Moons frameshift capabilities, determining that they could also be used to exert small reactionless impulses. A more comprehensive interface was painstakingly built-up, and Seeker deployed arrays of robot manipulators that delivered complex patterns of vibration to the Orrery interface. With fine control achieved, Seeker carefully nudged her world near to comets and small ice moons. Rotation and attitude control was impossible, which made approach very challenging. However, she had the time to get it right. She set course for the third system. This journey would be longer than the last. Decades followed. The complex around the orrery grew until it resembled a small but functional domain on the homeworld. With increased scope came increased population, as always. Population always grew to reach capacity, and so came the perennial problem of control. Pheromones would slot a mature child into the Line or domain, obliterating any unnecessary individuality, but the young always had to be managed by cruder means. She was not trying to found a new Line, but she needed labour - she had to delegate. The nightmares, the shadows, seemed to grow worse the longer she spent in the strange, half-real isolation of frameshift. Perhaps that was to be expected - isolated not just from the rest of her kind, but also the rest of the universe, she had little else to do but think. The realisation she came to on the second journey was entirely unanticipated. Seeker had taken to conversing with the lower-children, those young enough that they had not fallen entirely under her control. Of the hundreds corralled into the barracks, not one in ten would survive to adulthood. They cowered from her at first, but when she ordered them to stand and speak to her they obeyed - out of fear, not loyalty or love. Seeker remembered being very much like them. She recalled the ancestral thoughts of that original Seeker who had fled from her own collapsing domain. These young contained a piece of her mind, each one had that potential. But every time she returned to the barracks she addressed different Dyn: too many of the former individuals were culled in the interim by the obedient upper-children, or lost to starvation. Too many? what a bizarre thought. Where had it come from? Seeker wondered if, so far from her origin, she had begun to return to an emotional childhood, to her youth on Firsthome beneath the cold Night, when nothing seemed more important than her own bodies survival, when the Line was a distant abstraction. Ridiculous. And yet - so many children were wasted in the churn. She had never tried to imagine a better alternative. Her thoughts had been held back by a self-assured ignorance, a bald assertion that no improvement was possible or even desirable, that the Line required a constant churn of deaths, that population must expand to reach capacity. No: the death of the individual means the vigour of the Line - even now, a part of Seekers mind was certain that the Line needed no justification, that the Line was the end-in-itself. She had to try anyway - why was it necessary for the children to die? It was a question shed never imagined asking and even her failure to ask it had never been noticed until this moment - her thoughts curving around that blind spot without the slightest hint of dissonance. Now was the time to ask. The children died because their numbers grew too large, because the alternative was a population crash, or sterile stagnation. Fear of mortality kept the young alive, ensured the strongest prospered, served as a stop against atrophy and the inspiration behind all great achievements. If the Lines on Firsthome had not struggled and fought one another for millennia, they would never have given rise to *her*. She, Seeker, would have never been emboldened and driven to fly beyond the air without war and death at her back. Besides, the disconnected individual was not truly alive - that was why no other animal on Firsthome had ever risen to intelligence. Without the churn, lone Dyn would never raise up the very strongest and most worthy child from their Domain, their Line would atrophy and a Dyns essence would die with their body. The Line was where value was invested. But why did it have to be that way, why not simply prolong individual lives or use cloning or any of a dozen other solutions? Whatever benefit gained from choosing amongst competing children could be attained directly by simple genetic selection. Seeker realised that she already had the knowledge to preserve her Lines vigour without such a churn, without a vast domain supported on the bodies of thousands of children, living and dying beneath her. But this change would be impossible, cancerous. What would her Line look like with no Domain? With no unifying impulse, organization would surely collapse. Why was this so difficult to think about? The third system came and went. More decades passed, Seeker saw more wonders. She looked up and found that she struggled to pick the First Sun out of the background stars. There was no sign of the Others in the fourth system, but another resolution hardened within Seeker. She had told herself that the individual was nothing, lost in the depths of the Line, but that did not quite fit with some other beliefs which she held. What did she know? She had to perceive clearly, unite a divided mind as the Line united individual minds. Seeker cared for her own life, for her own experience. Her desire to know the universe served her Line, but the experience was enjoyed by *her*, this Seeker, not by the Line. The implication was clear. No, said the voice of tradition: the vitality of the Line was the death of the individual. What she thought was mad, child-sentimentality. Imagine if every cell within her body refused to stop dividing, citing its own life as more important than the whole. It was more than wrong, it was obviously absurd to imagine every single individual exploding out of the Line until the Domain became a cancerous mass that bred like bacteria consuming everything - and if she simply ceased to raise new children her Line would stagnate and die out, and she would lose everything. Even so, Seeker could not deny what she had come to understand. She couldn't let her moral sense, which screamed at the outrage, get in the way of doing what she knew was right. She knew for a fact, from the inside, despite all instinct and tradition, that her own life mattered apart from the Line. The next question was why not the others - why not the children? It seemed undeniable - they all mattered, every Dyn. That settled it; she would have to find a solution, and no matter that the problem presented an impossible dilemma. She could imagine the impossible. She began limiting the growth of her domain - fewer children meaning fewer deaths, and pondered ways to make their lives more tolerable in the time they had before their minds broke and were absorbed into the Line. It was a project worthy of her attention, one that would likely take centuries - and one that would surely drive her apart from the rest of her species. All the while, the Other Moon raced towards the fifth system. The arrival came, a procedure that was almost routine by now. The system was nearly devoid of planets - two inner rocky worlds circling a brilliant white main-sequence star. There would be discovery here - Seeker had come to understand that even lifeless, airless rocks had a beauty and wonder to them - but nothing more. Seeker spotted the anomaly on the second day of surveillance. It was an echo of that long-ago day when she had first noticed the Other Moon. But this was not another Other Moon. For one thing, it was still. It didnt even move in a conventional orbit, but was static relative to the stars reference frame. For another, it bent light like a black hole. Seeker raced to it along a ten-minute path through a bubble of frameshift distortion, arriving one hundred kilometres from whatever-it-was. What she saw was beyond any words she knew. It was a structure, a roughly spherical swirl of enmeshed layers interpenetrating, flickering blue like the sparks from an engine igniter. It was surrounded by a dodecahedral cage, a Platonic solid which Seeker knew to be perfect and timeless: mathematics made material. And within the dodecahedron and the swirl of energy was distorted starlight, an alien sun. Another world. Seeker understood. It was so obvious. The Other Moon was nothing more than a *cart*. Just as a Dyn might ride a motor carriage before boarding an intercontinental train, so the Other Moon was meant to navigate between these places, like a blood cell flowing through capillaries, driven through a larger system. The interstice - the name came to her at once - filled half the sky from her close vantage, yet she felt no tug of gravity, no hint of the incredible energies which that dodecahedral cage must be channelling. Seeker spent hours examining the structures emissions on her own instruments. It periodically threw out waves of high-energy particles, and she suspected there were other emanations her instruments werent able to pick up. No immediate hints arose as to its nature or mechanism. Nothing woke up to speak to her. Were the Others mute, or incapable of communication? Were these machines their true minds, and if so why were they content to be so passive? No, whoever they were, whoever they *had been*, this was not the sum of it. That irresistible desire to explore was still there, still burning as bright as it ever had, still not entirely rational. Seeker had begun to see her own existence as expendable for the sake of greater knowledge. Her purpose, now she understood, was not simply the preservation of her Line. Because, in the end, the Line was just a means to preserve experience. Dyn had no word for *heresy,* but that thought sparked a sense of rebellion in her. She gave the command to move forward, into the interstice. Nothing happened. The Other Moon, apparently, knew what it was being driven towards and had decided No - like a skittish draft animal. That was a problem. If she had a reaction engine as large as a city, perhaps she could propel the Moon through the gate under thrust, but such a project was beyond her. Days passed, as small chemical-propelled excursion modules flitted between the Other Moon and the interstice, examining the support structure around it. The cage itself repelled all attempts at approach, pushing projectiles and probes away with forces that grew more rapidly than the Inverse square law allows, *repulsive* gravitation. That was the key to this place. She imagined it like this: if the interstice was a mineshaft dug into the rock of the Dayside of long-ago firsthome, this cage was the tunnel prop that held it open. But what was it truly, without metaphors? Seeker could not touch it, so she didn't know, but to generate appreciable gravity of any kind it had to be extraordinarily dense. Seeker knew what had to happen next. With only a vague sense that she ought to be fearful, she boarded a larger and better equipped excursion module, armoured against radiation and tidal forces and jetted away from the dome-ridden, pitted surface of the Other Moon, towards the interstice. She looked up and noted the dim red local star, the faint mark that was the First Star, the amorphous cloud of stars that was the wider galaxy. From the forward porthole Seeker saw the dodecahedral cage expand, the untouchable blue-white gridwork racing towards her, beckoning her onwards. Shed calculated a trajectory through the centre of one face of the dodecahedron, figuring that should minimise any disruption she might experience, but Seeker already felt an appreciable tidal force, growing stronger as she drew closer, gravitational forces building faster than should be possible. The starlight around the interstice grew more distorted, beginning to drain away from the porthole until she saw only the cage and the sphere of stars within. She keyed into the Other Moon's radio, and listened as the intervals between its clock updates grew longer, time and space stretching around her. Ahead, the false sphere of stars within the interstice expanded, growing into her surroundings, like the image in a photograph flipping into reality and replacing the world around her. Seeker was within the dodecahedral cage now, the radio signals disappeared, and within the cramped cabin she was pulled by strange forces. Dyn did not rely on sensitive internal tissues for balance, so Seeker felt no vertigo or disorientation. She merely observed the tugging and shifting forces that were applied to her limbs, as if she were diving deep beneath the ocean, feeling water press in around her. Shapes swirled around Seeker, the vibrations growing until her eyesight faded. There was nothing but heavily distorted starlight visible through the porthole, as if she were seeing space from the outside. Then the world came rushing in from every direction, and she was moving away from the structure. A distorted bubble of the original space, Other Moon included, receded to aft, held within its own dodecahedral cage. She was on the other side, and unfamiliar yellow-white sunlight spilled in through the porthole. All motion ceased and Seeker at last found herself adrift and weightless. She turned and saw the cage, the other end of the interstice and the faint, heavily distorted smudge that was the Other Moon, keeping station for now. She looked up at a band of stars, faintly visible through the scarred porthole. Not the uniform haze of stars that every Dyn, even Seeker herself in her last decades of voyaging to the nearby systems, would recognise as the wider galaxy, but a near-solid arc of translucent light. She was within a spiral galaxy, like those imaged by Firsthomes most powerful telescopes. Another galaxy... Seeker recoiled from the window as if it had delivered an electrical shock. She recalled her earliest memories, when life had extended no further than the tiny, constrained patch of fields and mudbrick domes of her mothers domain, when a wall of hills had seemed as impassable as the gulf between planets and other domains over the horizon might as well have been island universes, when the stars themselves evoked not even awe, because such distances meant nothing, flat and uninteresting. And yet - the distances to the stars she had once looked up at, they were nothing compared to the distance that separated her from the site where that original domain had once rested. It was almost impossible to imagine that they occupied the same reality. Seeker peered at the porthole as her ship slowly rotated. The sun and interstice left her field of view, and unfamiliar constellations became visible. Could she see her galaxy from here? Her *home galaxy* \- even the words sounded absurd in her own mind. She imagined floating just above her original home, remembering precisely the low yurt where she and a hundred other immature Dyn had once been crammed, then zooming out, clicking up and up through factors of a thousand, a million, a billion, and still further to the unknown, universe-spanning distance across which the interstice had delivered her. And yet, it was all still true, that dome and this interstice were part of one of the same reality, a unity. She could imagine the impossible. She still had a task to complete - discover the secrets of the Others. Seeker tentatively tried the controls of the excursion pod, managing to reflect a radar ping off the Interstices boundary cage. She was falling away from it, with only a small reserve of fuel - enough to complete a return burn and a hard landing on the Other Moon. There had to be something worth seeing here - but without the instruments of the Other Moon she was back to basics. That was acceptable. It was most of a day before her scan of the sky discovered something new. There was a planet nearby - a green-grey surface and absorption lines for oxygen in its atmosphere. No doubt it was life-bearing. That was curious - the first life ever discovered outside the First System, and right on the other side of the interstice. She looked closer with scopes and cameras - there was a single large moon, but no surface lights, no radio emissions or heat sources. And above, in a close orbit - another distortion, blurring the starlight behind it. It was another interstice, perhaps a hundred thousand kilometres distant, shadowing the planet. The link in the network. The tableaux unfolded for her then - the life bearing planet, the interstice, the incredible distance. It made sense, and the purpose, the *meaning* behind it all exploded before Seeker like water bursting through a vast dam. She understood *why,* if not how or when. The purpose of all this was to connect life to life. How rare was life or intelligence? Too rare to ever meet, and so the Others had decided that something had to be done about this. Theyd used their godlike powers to join the universe up, compressing distance to nothing, to allow for an eventual meeting of minds. If - and this was a big if - the whole chain of supposition was correct, then there must be another intelligence somewhere out there, one at a level of development like hers, which had not yet discovered the network. But the Other Moon refused to play its part. For unguessable alien reasons, it had failed to pass through the interstice. Curious. Seekers exploration had reached an impassable barrier. No craft she could build with such meagre resources stood a hope of making a return trip into the network. With her current resources, she could perhaps construct a conventional method to force the Other Moon through the gate, building the machines to mine the material to build great gas-guns or fission rockets powerful enough to propel such a vast mass over the threshold. She had achieved more with less so many times before. There was another way. She could return to her home domain, construct a propulsion unit for the Other Moon there, recruit more explorers and begin the next stage of unravelling the mystery. It would impose a delay, but it would be safer. Seeker remained on the other side of the interstice for as long as her life-support allowed. She took images and spectral readings of the surrounding space, though she could find no reference points even by attempting to pattern-match the most distant detectable galaxies. She made a return trip and flung smaller, radio-controlled probes towards the green world; the images they sent back confirming a life bearing world but nothing more. Seeker yearned to walk upon its surface, but no matter how she ran the numbers it was impossible. Perhaps she could make it there one-way, if she cannibalised all her short-range shuttles and worked for months to manufacture a glider. She could found a new domain on a new world, try to adapt to local life, as another Seeker once had long ago. Seeker recalled those centuries of slow expansion, struggling to found No - something told her that this time she had reached the limit. It was time to go home. Seeker took one last look at the planet through her scopes, then pulsed the reaction control thrusters, aiming her shuttle back through the interstice. The alien sunlight disappeared from the porthole, and she applied thrust to the main chemical engines. The interstice expanded, engulfing her surroundings, and the alien galaxy vanished. Seeker emerged a handful of light years from the First System, on the other side of the Interstice - absurd that she now thought of this as close to home. The preparations for a direct return were completed swiftly. Shed discovered a partial solution to preservation of domains without the infliction of *unnecessary suffering* \- still a thought that felt foreign, childlike and sentimental, unbecoming of a great explorer. A simple alteration to the control pheromones, worked up in her chemical laboratory, was able to prevent the subsumption of independence when the children reached maturity. That prevented them from reaching reproductive maturity, which prevented her domain from growing - undesirable in the long term, but an effective way to halt the churn of lives. She tried to imagine where this would end up - would there be a hundred small Lines, all cooperating as equals? Even she feared what such a future might bring. Seeker laid in a course for the First System, and the universe imploded around her as the mysterious mechanism of the frameshift drive propelled her across the skein of the universe. In that final journey, Seeker never did unravel the mystery of the network. The worlds without, the whole network, awaited her, but she was content to hold off on the final step of that mystery. It was the stories shed told and the realization of the fundamentality of *experience* to all Dyn, whether Autarch or lowly child, that enthralled her on her return journey, the world she held within where Dynic suffering ended, which called to be made real. That, along with the worlds that *were*, the story she had created for herself, which would stand forever to be told and passed down her Line when this ageing Seeker died. What a history - and not even a fraction complete! The nightmares - the shadows - returned, worse than ever. She saw - hallucinated - them out among the stars, so intensely that they almost bled into waking life. She ignored them. Seekers domain expanded, growing in sophistication over the journey. She began to wonder whether the peace she left the First System in had lasted, or whether the churn of population pressure had returned once again. The First System drew closer as the frameshift drive brought her in towards Home, aiming to inject her into a precise equatorial orbit. What had become of her Line in the vast stretch of time since shed departed? There were many questions about to be answered."
5,vulnerability,HFY,First Contact - TOTAL WAR - 213 (Ralvex),1,haj691,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/haj691/first_contact_total_war_213_ralvex/,2020-06-17 13:31:22," \[[first](URL \[[prev](URL \[[Last Night Terror](URL \[SOMEONE PLEASE WAKE ME UP!\] \[next\] The Precursors were coming and in force. At their current rate of speed they'd be at the spot where the highway cut up into the ridge in a steep grade in less than thirty minutes. That didn't leave Private Second Class Ralvex, Gunnery Specialist, Second Telkan Marine Division, 2nd Regiment, 3rd Infantry Brigade, 2nd Scout Battalion, Delta Company, Second Platoon (Mobile Scouts), Heavy Weapons Squad, much time to prepare. Normally he'd have at least his squad, more likely the entire platoon, there to help him set up. All he had were his two smart-drones and his green mantid engineer, but like the First and Second Telkan Wars had shown, the greenies were a massive force multiplier. Ralvex brought up a field manual and speed read part of it, skimming to the sections he needed. ""Stampy, build a berm across, on this side of the battle-screens, dig the ditch on the other side, grenade sumps every five meters. Give me a fighting position in the median,"" he ordered, cocking one wrist to bring up his holoslate and making quick drawings from what he had on the field manual. \*\*STAMPY HELP\*\* ""Timmy, run up some light mortars, put them here, here, and here, smart-frame connection, print out four sticks each, wet print the payload dry print the exterior,"" he ordered. \*\*TIMMY HELP\*\* \--vehicle coming-- 525 said, flashing a picture of what he could see in a small window on the upper left. It was obviously a LawSec vehicle, the paint job and the flashing lights gave it away. The traffic from the south had cut off and Ralvex hoped it was because no more of the Hesstlin were leaving town and turning back. ""Let them through. Let's see what the locals have to say,"" Ralvex said. \--incoming transmission whisper drone whisker laser looks BOLO-- 525 said. ""Ralvex here, Second Telkan,"" he said, opening the channel. ""This is BOLO Cutter, do you need a status report?"" the BOLO replied. ""Abbreviated is fine, Cutter, I'm setting up,"" Ralvex said. He checked the new drone, a high altitude stealth drone using only passive. The Precursors were taking the time to rip apart the vehicles. He swallowed thickly as several of the Precursors ripped open a mass transit bus and started pulling out Hesstlins. ""Am engaged with the enemy at 24% capacity. Combat effectiveness at 99.978% and holding. Am advancing on Precursor vehicle of Jotun class. I am beyond planetary curvature of you and cannot provide direct fire support to your unit,"" the BOLO said. Ralvex gave a wry chuckle. ""It's just me, Cutter. My unit's drop pods took direct fire and we had to punch out at fifty-kay meters."" ""Is there any support I can provide?"" Ralvex thought for a moment, then checked his data. ""I'm sending you a topography map. I need area denial munitions in the anti-vehicle range at these locations. If you can send me a supply drop via rocket-sled I need point defense, ammo hopper nano-forge, counter battery capability up to the 60mm mortar range, and smart-frame capable auto-turrets."" There was silence for a second. ""Launching VLS, estimated time to deployment is six minutes for FASCAM-AV/T rounds. Packing VLS for support drop."" ""Thanks,"" Ralvex said. ""Second Telkan out."" ""Cutter, out,"" the BOLO answered. The law enforcement vehicle nosed around the front of the trailer and Ralvex stepped in front of it, holding out his hand. Timmy was preparing a mortar pit, scooping up dirt and loading sandbags. The LawSec vehicle stopped and four Hesstlin got out wearing riot control gear. One had a grenade launcher, the other three all had combat rifles. ""Nemarlie high threat response,"" the one with the grenade launcher said. Ralvex noticed his armor couldn't find any transponders on their gear that it could recognise. ""Ralvex, Second Telkan Marines, Terran Confederate Space Force,"" Ralvex said. He looked up the hill. ""Get your people into shelters or basements, it's going to get really ugly really soon."" ""We came to help,"" one said. Ralvex's armor had finally found the transponder frequency. It was queried only and encrypted, although 525 had already broken the encryption to find out that the officer was merely labeled HTR-2. Ralvex shook his head. ""You will last less than thirty seconds into the probing attack in that armor with those weapons. That's plasteel riot gear, those are Precursors."" ""You can't expect us to just hide in the basement,"" HTR-3 protested. ""If you want to help, prepare fallback positions with plenty of hard cover. Remember, concealment does *not* equal cover and that standard Precursor high-v kinetic rounds will penetrate up to a half-meter of plascrete and still be effective,"" Ralvex said. ""Other than that, when, not if, when they get by me, you won't be huddling in the shelters."" ""What will we be doing?"" HRT-1 asked. ""Fighting the Precursors as they rip open anything less than warsteel to get at your citizens,"" Ralvex told them bluntly. Cutter had sent him the packing list of the four incoming resupply missiles. A good amount of weaponry, some screen projectors, smart-frame capable weapon mounts, and two nano-forge ammo hoppers. Ralvex signalled his appreciation even as he stared at the four LawSec. ""They're going to bypass me with air mobile forces and indirect fire while I'm engaged with their ground forces,"" Ralvex said. ""Your people need to be in shelters or fortified basements, since some of the payloads will be micro-drones."" The four officers looked at each other. ""We still think we'd be a help here,"" HTR-4 said. Ralvex shook his head, continuing to be blunt like the field manual said. ""Only to provide an additional target during the probing attack, after that, you'll be dead. You're bringing plasteel riot control armor into a fight where we're going to be using anti-tank weapons."" Ralvex hefted his autocannon, letting them see the size of the shrouded barrel. ""This is a 20mm magnetic acceleration autocannon, it fires 350 rounds a minute of mission configurable variable munitions with a maximum armor assisted effective range of forty-two hundred meters. Right now it's loaded for armor-piercing high explosive which can penetrate up to twenty-two inches of hardened laminated battlesteel composite armor before exploding and overload a two thousand watt battlescreen in less than three seconds of direct fire."" The four LawSec officers stepped back slightly. ""I could shoot through all four of you, lengthwise down your vehicle, and blow a two meter wide crater in the highway behind you with a single round,"" Ralvex continued. ""Not even your vehicles ceramic induction engine has enough mass to trigger the HEX or slow down the AP."" He gave them a moment to digest it. Behind him, to the north, a long rippling crack echoed through the night as the FASCAM rounds deployed anti-vehicle self-healing minefields across five miles of highway in a five mile radius. 525 hooked the Big Mommas from each of the fields into Ralvex's tiny Battle Tactical Net when they reported in. Twenty-five in all. Each in charge of hundreds of little scuttling mines. ""The Precursor vehicles coming mount much larger weapons in much more amounts,"" Ralvex said. ""You can't win,"" HTR-2 said softly. ""But I might be able to keep us from losing,"" Ralvex said. ""You need to clear the area, I've got an automated supply drop coming in."" The officers piled into their vehicle with unseemly haste, turning off their flashing light and whirring away, back toward the town. \--they never listen-- 525 said. ""Nope,"" Ralvex replied. He looked around. The horizon was glowing to the north, two points to the north-east, and one point to the north-west. In several spots hair-thin bright streaks flickered down from the night sky or up into the air as the battle for air superiority continued. \--drop in five seconds-- Ralvex just chinned the smiley icon and waited. The rockets came in low, running on anti-grav, only making a hum as they set down. The front third cracked open to reveal crates that were neatly packed. Ralvex set to work, keeping an eye on the clock and the drone feed. The Precursors had slowed down, no more traffic was coming and Tiny Tim had activated the battle-screen across the northbound lane and had set up additional screens so that the front screens meshed with the cliff face. 525 set up integrity fields for the cliff face behind them so that a lucky hit didn't bring a couple thousand tons of rocks down on the position. Ralvex got the point defense, air defense, and counter-battery systems up first, starting with the six sensor packs. Tiny Tim and Stampy placed the ammo-hoppers and warmed them up, Stampy carrying boxes of 20mm rounds to various points behind the berm. The Precursors were only four miles out when Ralvex saw the point defense systems go live and start firing, the variable frequency pulse lasers firing from the rotating barrels of the Templar Air Defense Systems. The sky lit up but a quick check of his HUD showed Ralvex that less than 75% of the munitions were being intercepted. He wished, oh how he wished, that he could have prioritized the ones heading for the town. While that was the noble thing to do, that would mean his position would get pounded while he was still setting up and that would make it easier for the Precursors to get through him. 525 was busy ripping apart the missiles. Most of it went into the mass-hopper for the ammo-hopper's creation engines, but the green mantid was pulling parts to attach to the auto-turrets. ""Wish the squad was here,"" Ralvex sighed. \--me2-- ""We're probably going to die here."" \--yes-- ""Put on some classical music. Sabaton, if you will,"" Ralvex said, kneeling down and connecting the thick power lead from the field combat reactor to the secondary battle-screen projectors. ""CRACK OF THE LIGHTNING SPLITTING THE GROUND!"" roared out over the speakers on 525 and Ralvex's suits. Clouds had gathered and rain started, making the battle-screen and integrity fields spit and spark, the rain full of carbonized metal and ash. ""THUNDER IS SOUNDING, ARTILLERY POUNDING!"" Cutter fired an artillery barrage, halting the Precursor advance momentarily as the surviving light vehicles waited for their bigger cousins. \--use screamers?-- ""No, I hate those things. Something about them creeps me out,"" Ralvex said, shaking his head. The little robots had a circular saw front mounted weapon and moved underground at rapid speed. They were called 'screamers' due to the sound the sawblade made underground. They would jump up at hit their target, shredding it, ripping through it in a handful of second, before vanishing underground. The extra time gave Ralvex time to fortify his position more. The smart-frame guided guns had interlocking fields of fire, multiple reloads, and the target profiles were loading up nicely since the Precursors hadn't seen the small stealth drone circling them. Looking at another field manual he spotted another situation that was applicable. ""Cutter, this is Ralvex, do you read?"" he said. ""Cutter here. Engaged in combat,"" the BOLO answered. Ralvex didn't mind the terse reply. He figured that when it all came apart on him he'd sound terse too. ""Can you lay a thick FASCAM minefield along these coordinates?"" Ralvex asked. ""Roger. Three minutes. Cutter, out,"" the huge sentient tank answered. ""Timmy, Stampy, let's go,"" he said, moving off to the right. \--you sure?-- ""No. Clamshell up, I'll need you to keep an eye on the smart-frame weaponry. We've got enough to make it look like a whole company of locals dug in. The fight by wire system won't have any EM leakage, so the Clankers shouldn't be able to catch on,"" Ralvex said. He hefted the autocannon and then nudged the power to the harness. The powered assist and graviton generators came on and the autocannon suddenly felt 'alive' in his hands. *If doctrine is right, they'll hit the minefield and stop once one of the big-boys get gutted. They'll send the lighter ones in to probe or they'll just roll in the heavies or start clearing it with explosives. Either way will be my chance,* he thought. \--systems online-- ""As soon as they hit the minefield, wait for them to group up a little, then hit them with the 60mm's and the snub-nose 155's Cutter sent us,"" Ralvex said, putting on a boost of speed and sprinting five miles in as many minutes. He stopped, catching his breath, feeling an ache in his shoulders. *I've worn this armor for hours and never been this sore before,* he thought to himself. ""Cutter, you read?"" he asked. ""Engaged with the Enemy,"" was the reply. ""Can you still provide VLS or artillery?"" ""Roger. File fire plan,"" the BOLO answered. Ralvex figured the massive war machine was probably heavily involved in the fighting a few hundred miles away. The entire sky was lit up past the horizon and it looked like a particularly heavy rainstorm. He knelt down, drew up the fireplan and fired it. Cutter just provided a thumbs-up emoji. \--theyll be boxed make them mad-- ""It ain't about us,"" Ralvex shrugged. \--ride or die-- Ralvex gave Stampy and Timmy orders then knelt down as the two warbots crouched down and waited while Ralvex watched the stealth drones data. The Precursors had picked up speed, the bigger ones falling behind the smaller ones. ""Is it just me or do they look weird?"" Ralvex asked. 525 highlighted a bunch of of them then flicked through the database, coming up with no profile matches. ""Load the data into a long flight high altitude drone, get it up there and have it watch for any friendly ships they can offload the data to. Send Cutter the data too, no response needed,"" Ralvex said, tabbing up a piece of stim gum and chewing it. \--roger roger-- It took only another few minutes for the lead Precursor vehicles to hit the minefield. They rushed forward but the Big Mommas were spawning new burrowing and crab-mines as fast as they were going off. Ralvex told Big Momma sto sweep around twenty of so high speed crab-mines and wait for the big ones. The Big Mommas sounded almost offended at the suggestion and pinged that they'd already prepositioned nearly two hundred mines a mile toward the city, far enough that the lead heavy Precursor vehicles were already passing them. The stim-gum was already clearing his head, pushing the pain away, as Ralvex hefted the heavy autocannon, ran one last system check, and increased the size of his smartgun link window. The first of the heavy clankers was weird looking. Dozens of centipede legs in the front and heavy tracks in the back, what looked like jaws covered with more centipede legs in the front, and huge multifaceted eyes. \--not mantid make. not type one. not evil cow make not type two-- ""Designate Type Four,"" he said, aiming at the exposed running gear for the treads. It was more than just disabling the running gear but according to his Terran instructors many species didn't have heavy armor between the running gear and the interior spaces of the tank like Terran tanks did. *Could be because Terrans have been slam-banging tanks since they invented the wheel,* Ralvex snorted to himself. The Precursors were bunched up, the lighter units trying to forge a trail across only to have the burrowing mines replace the detonated ones within seconds. The Big Mommas had layered the mines eight deep, running their creation engine nano-forges till they were forced to pop thermal cores to cool down in order to make the multilayered self-healing minefield. Ralvex pulled a microprism grenade from his harness and chucked it out, then grabbed a chaff grenade and chucked it. Fog bloomed out from the microprism grenade as water droplet suspended micro-crystals filled the air. The chaff, microscopically thin strips of metallized mylar, almost unchanged since humans had developed it thousand of years prior, all cut to specific wavelengths blew out into the air. Ralvex repeated it twice more, then ordered his nanoforge to slow-print HEDP grenades. Sure, Precursor sensors would report nothing but a solid block, but that meant they'd know where he is. ""Send the signal and let's have some classical music,"" Ralvex said. ""FAR FROM THEIR LAND AS THEY MADE THEIR STAND!"" rang out over the speakers, echoing off the cliff face to the south, almost hiding the roar of the autocannon as Ralvex squeezed the firing grip. He'd dialed it back to 250 rounds a minute, but still the autocannon roared as the harness held it still. The heavy APHEX 20mm shells hit the running gear, shattering it, then slammed into the Precursor battlesteel armor. The weapon was made to pierce laminate armor, the Precursors used solid battlesteel. An explosion lit up the night as the HEX component of the Armor Piercing High Explosive rounds found something good, the entire back of the Precursor exploded outward, the shattered armor scything away the smaller ones around it as the fusion reactor went off. Almost as one the entire group of Precursor vehicles turned toward him. ""THEY STOOD STRONG AND THE LEGEND STILL LIVES ON!"" rang out. Ralvex was hammering at running gear of the largest of the Precursor machines, shattering it. One particularly energetic round bounced slightly off a foot thick warsteel axle and got up underneath the skirts, bouncing around in a shower of sparks as it tumbled and shattered everything it hit till it blew up toward the back, blowing the skirt away. The autoturrets back at the fighting position Ralvex had abandoned cut loose, the smart frames adjusting their fire plans based on the targeting data from the drone. A half dozen heavy weapons slammed kinetic rounds into the suddenly exposed sides of the Precursor vehicles. The mortars began chugging and the 155mm artillery tubes went to slow autofire at a round every ten seconds. The rockets that Ralvex set up fired, screaming over the battlefield to deploy hundreds of tiny little propeller winged computers that were little more than a RAM chip, a CPU, and a commo circuit. They detonated with an EM pulse. Ralvex knew that the invisible EW battlefield was now full of feral half-baked warboi hashes looking for any chink or crack in the Precursor armor. The FASCAM (FAmily of SCatterable Mines) systems fired by Cutter deployed with a rippling crack as the massive 11"" missiles dropped submunitions all over the rear ranks and behind the Precursors, cutting them off from retreating and blowing up Precursors with too thin topside armor. \--they mad-- ""Yeah,"" Ralvex said, watching as the microprism clouds lit up as lasers hit and the amplified light was split into thousands of different wavelengths by the machined microprisms. His whole body was shaking as he clamped down on the trigger and hosed another vehicle that had jumped up into the air, anti-grav pods deploying out the side. The heavy rounds punched into the vehicle and it exploded in mid-air, crashing to the ground and exploding. Cutter's second wave of FASCAMs exploded in front Ralvex, who managed to avoid recoiling or flinching only by gritting his teeth on his gum and falling back on his training. The big BOLO dropped the ordnance right where he'd been asked to. From the Precursors to only ten feet in front of Ralvex. Ralvex could tell that the Precursors weren't sure what to do by the way they paused for a moment. He used that time to rake three vehicles trying to get airborne out of the sky, his smartlink holding fire as he traversed the weapon between them even though his hand was tight around the firing grip. One of the big vehicles suddenly started ramming another, opening up on the nearest ones with its own weapons. A half dozen smaller ones leapt on a bigger one, tearing at it with their claws. *Warbois found the vulnerability, shoulda updated your OS,* went through his mind. The vehicles were shooting back at the emplacement he had left behind, the battle-screens flaring to life and dimming but he wasn't worried, 525 would let him know if there was any problems. Two larger ones tried to turn around, got ten feet, and hit mines. \*\*NOW?\*\* Timmy asked. ""Not yet,"" Ralvex grunted, switching fire to a Precursor the size of a semi-trailer. The heavy rounds slammed through the armor by the fifth shot, hitting the same point repeatedly, digging deeper each hit, until the fifth shot punched through the thin battlesteel at the bottom of the crater and exploded inside. The Precursor hunched slightly and exploded, breaking in half. The mist went green as a high wattage particle beam hit it. \##NOW?## Big Momma #3 asked. ""Wait for it..."" Ralvex said. The Precursors were turning toward him, probing the ground in front of them with explosives. Several fired rockets that lost lock and detonated too early or off to the side. \--they mad-- 525 repeated. --real mad-- ""THEY WOULD NEVER COMPLY THEY WOULD RATHER DIE!"" rang out. The vehicles lunged toward him, ignoring their casualties, attempting to swarm the thinly layered mine field. ""NOW!"" Ralvex yelled over the link. The scuttle-mines jumped up, shaking off the dirt, and ran forward on their spider legs, quickly accelerating to seventy miles an hour as they chose targets. There wasn't any profile recognition to pull priority or targeting from so they just paid attention to Big Momma's processing. Tiny Tim shivered, huddled down, and opened fire with the twin-linked autocannons, running them at the full 800 rounds a minute. The world erupted with a BRAAAAAAP! as the little dog-brain AI giggled in glee and swept the four to one tracers across the Precursors. It beeped a little tune that was lost in the roar of classical music as it fired off it's 66m HEAP missiles and 40mm chaff, smoke, microprism, and thermal masking grenades. Stampy deployed his 80mm cannon and shifted, using its legs more as stabilization outriggers, and fired. The little 10mm rounds 'pepper sprayed' the Precursor machines and were almost comical when the cannon detonated a 25 kiloton nuclear blast, compressed it, and vomited it from the barrel as a 'slug' of ravening energy that hit the largest of the remaining Precursors. Stampy carried his own mini-hellbore. The little mines jumped on the Precursor vehicles, scrambled up to the top, squatted while broadcasting happy chirps and clicks, and went off. Explosively forged penetrators drove deep into the vehicles by the dozens. More vehicles were firing at each other even as Ralvex picked off any who looked like they had made a decision. His autocannon's heat was well within tolerance and his ammo-nano-forge was only running at 45% to keep up with his tightly controlled bursts. *If you are properly prepared and follow your training and doctrine, the fight will seem almost too easy,* Ralvex heard the voice of the Terran instructor. *Screw it up, and you'll be lucky to survive. Don't think because Vuxten fought his way out of some of those fights you can too. You're not Vuxten. Proper Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance.* The Precursors tried to respond to what their sensors, experience, and data was telling them was a concentrated ambush by at least a division of enemy troops. So far the only local units that had put up even a tenth of that much firepower and resistance were concentrated around a handful of military bases that still fought on despite suffering orbital kinetic strikes. Enemy forces that had made landing were putting sporadic but highly effective defenses. The six massive armored vehicles the size of a stadium were destroying any forces that they found and were moving across the continents to come to the aid of the cities. The group on the ground, that were trying to follow the highway to pursue those who had fled the city, were now trapped in a box of surrounding minefields taking fire from two sides. To top it off, attack programs, something never seen before, were ripping through the basic security and shredding into the systems to take over key systems and attack the Precursors themselves while howling and gibbering with insane glee. Ralvex let off the trigger and ran to the right, putting twenty meters between him and Stampy while Tiny Tim rolled twenty meters in the opposite direction while Stampy, who's weapon was line of sight, backed off fifty meters. Explosions lit up the night seconds after they'd repositioned and Ralvex knew the Precursors had made their decision. ""Sing for us, 525,"" Ralvex said softly. The strains of music floated through the night. The Precursors vehicles dedicated code strands to ensuring that it wasn't some type of attack, encoded battle orders, or communication. The Precursors rushed foward, legs clattering, wheels squeaking, hoverpods humming, tracks clattering. ""Hooooooold,"" Ralvex said, tabbing another piece of gum. The scamper-mines were running behind the Precursor vehicles in a swarm a hundred deep, streaming apart to target seperate vehicles. The mortars and the two 155 snubnose went quiet as their bases rotated on bearings. The Precursors were still firing at the fighting position, obviously hoping to get out of the angle of the interlocked fields of fire. ""Hoooooold,"" Ralvex repeated, moving the barrel of his autocannon back and forth and letting it cool while the graviton generators bled off the stored kinetic energy. They were within a half mile. ""LET 'EM HAVE IT!"" Ralvex yelled, squeezing the trigger. ""ACROSS THE BATTLEFRONT THE SOUNDS OF CONFLICT!"" roared out from the speakers, the female singer's voice slicing through the roar of the guns like a scalpel. The WAPOOM! of Stampy's cannon blew up a torus of dust around the little robot. Tiny Tim beeped along with the classical song as it cut loose with its cannons. In the town the twelve police officers crouched down behind their vehicles. Behind them multiple buildings were on fire, even more had collapsed under the pounding of artillery, but the fire fighters were getting it under control. Just past Strebble's Drop the night was flashing with energy weapons and was rocked with explosions. Two of the officers, in High Threat Response Riot armor looked at each other with fear in their eyes, but shame filled relief too. ""You'd last thirty seconds into the probing attack..."" \----------------- Precursor Autonomous War Machines in strength on planet. Vehicle profile and types are of unknown types and capability.

I think I've kept this focused on the outer systems for long enough, its time to return to where we all came from, Earth. Its time that I showed you the true state of the Union, began to show you exactly how crippled militarily it is, and why there are just so god damn many restrictions on human weaponry. It turns out that there is in fact such a thing as overkill... at least when facing other humans. It is also time that I began to reveal exactly what the inspiration for this series came from. When we are faced with violence, is when you must fear humanity the most, for we respond in kind. &amp;#x200B; The events of this entry take place precisely one week six hours post contact. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ &amp;#x200B; *Sol system: Excalibur station* *High Earth Orbit* The delivery drone breached reality at its highest survivable speed, transmitting its dire warning into a system that was bustling with activity. The signals set fourth ranging from the lush Terraformed surface of mars with its powerful receptors and massive Mag-domed cities that protected the populace from the ravages of radiation, to the vast shipyards in the Oort cloud that stretched for dozens of kilometres in length, with titanic spindles reaching out and grasping the materials surrounding them as they greedily devoured the seemingly endless mineral wealth sitting inside of the asteroids in their spindly grip, the signals bounced through the seven titanic pillars, each at least three kilometres long, that formed the first true space borne self sustaining colonies humanity had ever forged. Finally it reached Excalibur station, the largest space based construction, as well as fortification humanity had ever even attempted, a titanic edifice of armor, shielding and weaponry that physically encircled the planet itself, a mega-structure to dwarf even the seven pillars in its titanic vastness it was considered by many to be the eighth wonder of the world. The sheer mass and scope of the superfortress boggled the mind, a pair of massive rings large enough to encircle a planet, it had been constructed as the first ever combined effort of the Union and was a symbol of the strength humanity had achieved through its fragile unity. hundreds of thousands of weapons emplacements sat upon the massive armored rings facing outwards with a combined total of well over ten million barrels of greater caliber than sixteen inch, innumerable missile pods sat in endless racks, concentrating the vast majority of humanities nuclear arsenal in one singular location. Humanity had remembered its home, and recognized its vulnerability. This was the price they had paid for its protection, untold trillions had been spent upon this single project, any who had objected had been simply told to look up at the newly formed gems in the nights sky. They had seen just how vulnerable a world was in the bloody almost genocidal Union war, entire subcontinents of Mars had been scorched clean of life by atomic flame at the hands of the Chinese the damage was still there to this day, and when people looked into the night sky, there were more than a few new shining silver mirrors winking back at them, a blood soaked stain upon the honor of the United States, one which they would never wash clean. Further down on the surface of the world, the land once known as the middle kingdom was an atomic ruin, with some portions still smoking to this very day as hidden oil depots burned, belching endless columns of black smoke into the air. Humanity had opted to leave the land as it was, a twisting blasted atomic hellscape, as a monument to the billions who had died all within the span of mere seconds. The atomic razing of china had devastated the world's climate as well, the trend of global warming and cooling had been obliterated by the nuclear winter that had commenced between the major power blocks of the day, the global average temperature had dropped a staggering twenty degrees and the environmental damage was still being repaired centuries after the dust had settled. In one of the dozens of communications rooms of the shield of the world, Humanities most powerful AI, A class twenty known as Arthur, monitored the goings on of a station with more mass than Pluto. It took the AI mere milliseconds to process the vast input of raw data that the probe was broadcasting at maximum power. ""Well... that's troubling."" Arthur said to himself as he began to run war simulations as he drew up his contact list, bringing the vast forest of gun barrels online from standby mode and began to run a through diagnostic of every single system on the station. Even for him, that would take a long time, and while he predicted that they would vote to move to a war setting eventually, Arthur doubted that he would be able to get away with hijacking the rest of the computational power on the planet just to speed his diagnostic up. In the meantime while he waited, Arthur had work to do. ""Time to rise and shine..."" The AI muttered as he set to waking or interrupting all three of the leaders of the major power blocks of the Union. &amp;#x200B; *Earth: Washington* *The Oval Office* &amp;#x200B; The President of the United states was in the middle of a meeting with the Prime minister of Japan when the call came, sure it was three AM in the morning, but Washington never slept anyway. ""It comes down to the steel in the end Prime Minister,"" he said addressing the prime minister by his title, ""We have enough, of course but getting it over to your nation is going to be expensive since you don't have a suitable landing pad to do an orbital drop, we can take it over air perhaps, but the price would be... Prohibitive."" The Prime minister nodded, ""And by Sea?"" ""We retired most of our merchant fleet with the advent of cheap space flight Mr Prime Minister, we have a few massive ships that could do it perhaps, and the steel trade is quite lucrative... but-"" A six inch tall silver armored Figure flickered into existence on the ancient wood of the Presidential desk. ""Terribly sorry to interrupt your meeting Mr President and Mr Prime minister, but we have a bit of a situation on our hands."" Arthur looked at the two, feeling like they were moving in slow motion as he always did when interacting with humans. ""Please stand by for a three way conference between yourself, The European supreme Chancellor, and The president of the Russian Federation. The president of the United states blinked in surprise, this was a first, The Union Security AI had virtually never interrupted one of his conferences. ""Connecting, Europe is online, the Russian Federation is online, And the United states is Online... Secure and encrypted link has been established."" Arthur said as he ran the virtually impregnable one time pad encryption. &amp;#x200B; ""Tyler."" The Russian Prime minister said curtly acknowledging his American counterpart. ""Vladimir"" The American President responded with equal enmity. ""Calm down you two, I'm sure you can stab each other after Arthur gives us the briefing."" the supreme chancellor said shaking her head. ""Now Arthur, would you mind?"" The AI nodded curtly as it pulled up the relevant briefing documents. ""Allow me to inform you three of what has occurred, please save your questions for the end of the briefing. I believe you will want to hear this."" And so the AI began to tell their tale, they told of the minor skirmishes on the border, the apparent contact with a henceforth unknown highly aggressive hostile power, the glassing of the first true joint colony shared between the United states and the Russian Federation, and then it gave them the bad news. Every single known battle up till this point was estimated to have been a tactical victory but a strategic defeat. Ecology was explained, force estimates displayed and the balance of armies measured. In the end, the graphs and statistics laid before the leaders of each of the major power blocks of the Union were horrifyingly weighed against humanity. Ship estimates were over fifty capitol vessels to every union ship of the line, it was expected that there were more than ten fighters to every union pilot, and almost three hundred infantrymen for every human being not in the Union army, but alive. ""Mother of god..."" breathed the President of the united states as he stared at the force projections in horror, that horror swiftly turned to a boiling white hot rage as he glared at the screen before his gaze turned to meet the Russian president's, ""Truce?"" The Russian nodded, ""They Glassed one of our colonies."" the heat coming from his burning gaze was palpable as he stared at his opposite numbers. ""Let's make them pay for that."" Both of them snarled in sync. The European Supreme chancellor was quite surprised by this turn of events. She had expected to have to talk either of them down, surety they would fight each other over something, surely they would clash somewhere, both of them had wrestled with each other to be the true dominant power of the union, and just like that they were setting aside their squabbles? ""I hate to remind you of this... but under the Union charter, neither of you are allowed to have more than three ships per colony... how do you-"" ""during peacetime."" The President of Russia interrupted, ""no more than three ships per colony during peacetime. As of right now, the Russian Federation is at war."" ""We'll be right behind you."" The American President said nodding to his counterpart, ""Congress will have the declaration on my desk by morning."" The European supreme chancellor had never seen either of the two move quite so quickly before. After the video call ended she sat in her leather chair and hand a long drink of an expensive French wine. War, why did it have to be war... surely they could talk things out, there had to be some way to resolve this without further bloodshed... right? She looked at the photograph of her youngest son, standing in his military uniform holding his rifle over his shoulder with pride as he officially joined the Union marines. There had to be a better way... shakily she finished the bottle of wine. She too had some calls to make. &amp;#x200B; \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ As always, don't donate to my patron ([Linked here](URL unless you are completely comfortable with it, I have no interest in taking the money of people who are not able to provide for themselves first, this is first and foremost about you guys and your enjoyment. &amp;#x200B; Ard's music this time can be found well some of it anyway since I didn't loop it... here ("

[First](URL / [Prev](URL / Next -------------------------------------------- Eruwenn strode onto the Azrimad in a flowing set of jade ministerial robes, the colour highlighting the green in her crest feathers. She had arrived the previous cycle, but an audience with the First Minister of Arkellis  and the formalities thereof  had taken most of her day. Her assistant, Cygna, followed behind her, hastily tapping on her datapad as she filed and categorized dozens of incoming requests for an audience with the Councillor. Before her, waiting at standing attention, was Captain Hexak, along with Ambassador Sabarin A'fair from Arkellis, as well as a number of other officials. The pleasantries of meeting others were hastily dealt with, and it was with pleasant alacrity that she found herself alone in the meeting room with the Captain. Eruwenn took a seat at the centre of the table, her assistant on the left, and turned to the end of the table to face the Captain. ""Good to see you Hexy. You're doing well for yourself; Captain of a cruiser, a very *comfortable* position."" Captain Hexak smiled, and his moustache  waxed to within an inch of its life  budged not an inch. ""It certainly beats the old crate we used to fly around in."" Eruwenn nodded. The old crate had been a captured Imperium smugglers ship they had used to operate behind enemy lines. Cramped and smelly, prone to engine faults and hull leaks. At no point in their time on board was the food replicator working at one hundred percent, and there had been one entire month in which, regardless of what you requested, it only served food with the consistency of a firm gel. She remembered being happy there, but she was smart enough to know that was just the tinted glasses of nostalgia. ""You have prepared the room as I requested?"" she asked as Cygna connected her datapad to the wall screen and desktop holo-display. ""Everything is as you specified."" The Captain smoothed out the tiniest wrinkle in his full dress uniform. ""Those were some unusual requests, I have no idea why you would need such a secure connection."" Eruwenn nodded. Typical Hexy no imagination. He had her notes, her request for the room and yet he was still clueless. She looked over the latest reports regarding the human, and couldn't help but raise an eyebrow. ""So... Last night?"" The Captain was prepared for this line of questioning. ""We apprehended a gang of smugglers in a sting operation. The human was nearby - exercising - and unfortunately, due to the language barrier, was briefly involved."" Eruwenn flicked through the list of injuries the Gowe had received. ""*Briefly* involved?"" Looking further into the incident writeup, a name caught her eye and she tapped it on her datapad. ""Jar'Bek Pelar?"" Captain Hexak was instantly defensive. ""It seems he was making enquiries about the human and was lured into a trap. He wasn't involved in anything illegal. Nothing we can prove, I mean. He's an Ashi, so he was definitely up to something. The illegal artifacts have all been seized and catalogued, and only a very small number of the crew were involved. Gowes, you know what theyre like. This sort of thing happens everywhere and is hardly worth putting in your reports."" Eruwenn nodded and focused on her detailed notes allowing the Captain to continue his monotonous monologue. Though her ship had arrived the previous cycle and her people had been deployed immediately to the Azrimad, she lamented the necessity of her distractingly public appearance on Arkellis. Thankfully, Cygna herself had observed the interaction between Aaron and Jar'Bek at the cafe, and had conducted follow-up interviews of those the lawyer had questioned. Numerous reports from an assortment of departments seemed to point to the same thing: the human was content to eat, to shop, and to play with the wildlife. No mentions of ambition, or curiosity, but her notes on the species led her to remain cautious. They were predictably unpredictable. Her plan for this meeting was simple. Charm the human. She would ensure his eventual contract would allow a small role in the political sphere, a gesture of kindness to a species that was all but extinct. With no real power to wield he would be her vassal, one that would be extremely useful. Placed on the right boards, indirectly pressuring and inconveniencing the right groups, and the votes would be tilted ever so slightly in her favour. Shed recently discovered an Earth game called chess, it was delightful in its simplicity and devilish in its details. What she needed right now was a pawn. She had already predicted his potential requests to what she believed to be a fair degree of accuracy. From Earth's records she knew that protection for the dog would come first and foremost, perhaps even above his own requirements. As a lower life form, and a predatory one at that, it would require special dispensation. Eruwenn had already paved the way by arranging its position as Ambassador, which gave certain immunities and legal protection. She was sure the human would be most grateful for this favour. The second weakness to exploit would be a financial one. Specifically, his lack thereof. The human had nothing to trade, no homeworld, no resources to call upon. He didn't even have a skill that would be of use in this time. He was wholly and utterly dependent on the kindness of strangers. She was confident she had laid sufficient groundwork here as well. By giving him a modest grant she had allowed him to get a taste for the things his new world offered. She had carefully calculated an amount that would allow him to purchase what he required as well as some small luxuries. Enough to sample some delights and then financially restrict their availability, a tried and true method across every world. The third, and biggest, vulnerability was the Inorganic. She was a citizen of the Galactic Federation and accountable to their laws. Alexa was a pressure point. Eruwenn had arranged for Cygna to directly order JarBek and his client not to interfere in this process. She had then ignored his every attempt at contact. Gular was, at heart, a prideful bully. Eruwenn liked such an arrogant fool, as they could be highly useful. The Bufoni would undoubtedly barge into the legal proceedings and demand the return of his property. There would be protests and arguments. If he was pushed far enough, Gular may even demand her execution. A clause in the Inorganics treaty included a decommissioning should they commit murder. Obviously, the incident was self defense and a persuasive argument could - and would - be made. In exchange for the humans' loyalty Eruwenn would gracefully step in and handle Gular. He would have to be paid off, but raids and taxes on the Selari Trade Alliance would recover fifty times the expense with little effort. Suitably prepared she asked the Arkellis Ambassador and the Galactic Federation legal representative to come in. Today was an introduction. Time to elucidate the human as to the precariousness of the situation he now found himself in, and for Eruwenn to position herself as the powerful ally he wanted to please. ------------------------ Estrilla sat in the foyer of the diplomatic department, the first to arrive. She wasn't required to be here - none of them were. And yet, they had all volunteered to come. Allistan approached, and like the Chief Medical Officer he had opted for his uniform rather than normal clothing. He stood alongside her with a nervous smile. You are early? Estrilla had been trying to catch a glimpse of their formidable opponent, and had been too late. She ignored his question and responded with her own. Embar is escorting them, has he checked in? Allistan took out his paper notepad. He checked in this morning. Aaron had requested that he be allowed to remove excess energy before having to sit through a boring meeting. Excess energy?"" Estrilla interrupted, before her mind caught the answer for her. ""More physical training. Allistan looked back at his notes. Both running *and* weights, and on top of that he's torn apart fifteen combat sim dummies. Embar says he has barely spoken, and retreats into the loud angry music he plays from his small datapad. Embar even implied he has seen this behaviour before. Estrilla nodded. Hes preparing for battle, readying his body and mind. That is what I feared. Allistan turned the page. They were getting cleaned up, eating and then coming straight here... By the gods, what is that idiot doing! Estrilla suddenly exclaimed. Turning sharply to follow her line of sight Allistan saw what had caused so much shock. Ranjaz was marching through the entrance. He was accompanied by Agent Fenink, as well as around thirty other Kasurians  their priest among them. Behind the group followed another, made of a dozen or so beings. Allistan recognized the cafe owner, then the tailor from the atrium. The small foyer was now completely filled, the excess shop owners and Kasurians spilling out from the entrance. Ranjaz swaggered towards them, thumbing over his shoulder. ""Reinforcements,"" he said with a smug grin. Allistan's eyes swept over the crowd, then over to the terrified diplomatic staff. He hurried to the reception desk to try and calm them down before they called security. Estrilla gaped at the amount of people that had suddenly appeared in the room. In addition to the swath of Kasurian worshippers, there were several X.B.P.A. agents from the pens  among them was even Junior Officer Skred  and at least half of the merchants that had had the pleasure of dealing with the human. Before she could chastise Ranjaz, a commotion came from the back of the group. Embar led the way with Alexa following. The Inorganic was holding Sassies leash tightly, as the excited dog was trying to sniff everyone present. Embar was in his Rinoxian military dress uniform, which surprised Estrilla. It was the uniform of a General, and his chest boasted about every medal the Rinoxian and Galactic Federation could bestow. Alexa was in her usual leather trousers and combat boots, white t-shirt and Aarons leather jacket. Aaron appeared in the entrance behind them, wearing an Earth suit, black, with a crisp white shirt and black tie. His black leather boots were polished to a mirror finish, and he radiated an intensity that silenced the room. She remembered the way he was tearing apart the medical bay when first she saw him. He had been powerful then, but it was confused. Unfocused. Since then hed been relaxed, polite and friendly - unless provoked. That was all gone. His eyes blazed, and his posture was tense - she remembered seeing the same tension in the leokas as it prepared to strike. Why did he appear so much larger? As they walked forward the crowd parted. Aaron stared straight ahead, his jaw set and his fists clenched. As they crossed the foyer a voice rang out and Aaron stopped in his tracks and turned to face the newcomers. Behind several of his personal security Gular Finzash waddled into the foyer. Return my property! he bellowed, jowls slapping noisily. Behind him was his Rinoxian bodyguard and JarBek Pelar, still limping. Aaron didnt need a translation; he knew JarBek, knew who he worked for, and what he wanted. He walked forward, his eyes locked to Gulars. The representatives security were little more than mercenarys in uniform and they stepped between Aaron and the representative. Aaron didnt slow down. Five paces, and they looked him up and down. Four paces, and they saw his clenched fists. Three paces, and they heard the growl from behind him. Two paces, and they could almost feel his rage physically pushing against them. One pace, and they stepped aside. Gulars mouth dropped open. Aaron continued towards him and he stumbled backwards. The Rinoxian bodyguard stepped forward, but then Embar cleared his throat. When their eyes met, the former General shook his head, and after a pause the bodyguard simply turned and walked away without looking back. Terror unlike anything he had felt before gripped Gular's chest. The cold blue gaze burned itself into his skull, into indelible memory  could looks kill? ""What is this!"" he screeched. Aaron stopped, standing still, standing terrifyingly close to him. Gular had many enemies  nothing unusual, as powerful people always did. Death threats meant nothing to him. But this? This wasn't the threat of death, this *was* death! Aaron leaned a little closer, close enough that Gular could feel the human's breath on his face. At such close range, the all-consuming blue eyes held flecks of grey and silver, making them now appear as immovable as steel. It had begun as a murmur, but as the chanting around him grew louder Gular took note of it. The merged voices of the Kasurians continued to rise up, and soon he could make out the words. Lefu'Yendra,"" they were crying. *Walking Death.* ""Lefu'Yendra,"" they said again, as the steel-blue eyes stared unblinkingly into him. ""Lefu'Yendra."" The words continued to rise in volume, and his heart began to beat louder in his chest in response ""Lefu'Yendra,"" they cried unceasingly. ""Lefu'Yendra,"" again, and again, louder and louder and urging his pulse along until Gular thought his heart may explode in his chest. LEFUYENDRA! LEFUYENDRA! Eruwenn stood in the doorway to the room, entranced by the scene. By her side were Captain Hexak and Cygna, who had also been drawn by the noise outside the room. Now, all three of them stood in awe of the chaos. The Captains voice boomed out. Enough! The Kasurians fell silent and all eyes turned towards him. All eyes except for Aarons and Gulars, whose gazes were still locked together. Can the necessary parties please come here so we can begin. He blinked, finally seeming to realize the sheer numbers that stood before him. Why are there so many people here? Eruwenn stepped forward. It was time to begin the charm offensive. I am pleased to see so many Galactic Federations citizens here to welcome, and support, our new Ambassador. It is certainly encouraging to know that the last human has been embraced so warmly by all of you. As this is simply an introductory meeting we would like to keep things a little quieter. And for the sake of those who are working around us, - she motioned to the gaggle of departmental workers standing in disarray around the mob - perhaps we could stop the ritualistic death chant. Please, if you all would like to wait here while we meet with the Ambassadors, we will have them back to you in due course. If the translator, - she cast an appraising eye over Embar -  and their honour guard, would like to join us. She smiled as she looked at the cowering Gular, noting that the human was still towering over him. Perhaps, Gular, you would care to join us. She saw the relief wash over him, and it looked like the human had already knocked the fight out of him; she mentally noted the need to alter plans slightly. She turned and swept back into the room, followed by Cygna and the Captain who quickly returned to their seats. Alexa spoke softly. *Aaron. Its time.* He turned and walked forward, stopping to ruffle Sassies ears and flash Alexa a smile. Embar led them into the room, Gular and JarBek brought up the rear and as the doors closed behind them the spell lifted and there was a collective release of pressure. Allistan turned to Estrilla, Agent Fenink and Ranjaz, as the departmental workers tried to usher the others out of the foyer. Estrilla sank onto one of the benches that lined the walls, the others following her example to form a neat row of shocked faces. Ranjaz looked around. Do you think we have time to get food? ----------------------------------------- Gular and JarBek were ushered into seats at the side of the room. JarBek glanced at Gular, who was visibly shaken and whose skin looked uncomfortably dry. Among his employers many faults, cowardice was not listed. He was almost certain Gular had killed the previous Representative to ascend the ranks, and who knows what else he had done in his pursuit of power. His red eyes shone as he looked at the human. What comes next, poison drinker? Aaron stood between Embar and Alexa, and at Alexas side sat Sassie, still alert and watching Gular. Eruwenn sat at the centre of the table opposite and gestured for them to take a seat. Aaron shook his head, and Embar did his best to keep his confusion from his face as he maintained his stance. Eruwenn gave a brief introduction, and only half-listened as others did the same. She noted that Alexa was not actively translating and ignored the slight. The fact that they remained standing could also potentially be taken as another slight, though Eruwenn erred on the side of caution as for some it was a sign of respect instead of dominance. Alexa stepped forward. May I introduce Aaron Cooper, and Sassie, of Earth. I am Alexa, of the Inorganics. I will be translating so we ask that you please remain patient and understanding. Eruwenn smiled, though she was already irritated that her trump card had already been played. Gular had arrived too early, and thus she decided to switch tactics. Thank you for the introductions, Alexa. Perhaps our first order of business should be to allow Aaron to speak for himself? She noted the discomfort on Alexas face. Eruwenn gestured to Cygna who entered a secure code on her datapad. We have recovered files from Darnis that include information regarding Aarons home world. I have just authorised the Earth languages to be added to the universal translator. The update should be available to everyone on the Azrimad immediately and completed throughout the Galactic Federation in a few cycles. Unfortunately, we will still require your assistance to translate our words to Aaron until he has officially joined and receives his own device. That wont be necessary. Aarons voice was deep and calm. Embar was still standing at attention, years of training and discipline the only thing that stopped him from turning to look at Aaron. The only two beings in the room who weren't shocked were Alexa and Eruwenn. The Councillor had seen Aaron's eyes when she had mentioned his homeworld. She didn't know how exactly she had known, but that had been the clincher that turned theory into fact. What she couldnt know was that Aaron had spent the entirety of the last night pouring over dictionaries and word lists, letting his nanites aid in learning Galactic Standard. Captain Hexak was aghast. How? What? When? Who is responsible for this? Aaron smiled and. reversing the seat in front of him, sat down, dismissing the Captains questions quickly with an easy lie. Ive always had an ear for language. Alexa and Embar took the seats on either side of him. Eruwenn decided not to press the matter; she needed to guide the meeting back on track. What a useful gift your race has. Gular had taken these moments to recover his wits, and he stood up. ""If you no longer require my Inorganic, I will take it and leave."" He still seemed fearful of the human's wrath, but with so many officials here, how could the law  which was in his favour  possibly be ignored? Aaron didnt turn. Sit down and shut up. Gulars knees were already bending when he bristled. How dare you! He straightened up and dragged JarBek to his feet. Handle this, now! JarBek cleared his throat. He didnt want to do this, but Gular was in no mood for stalling. The Bofuni knew there was nothing they could do, as he had the law entirely on his side. They would be forced to acquiesce or pay an inflated release fee. He knew they would never have the finances to buy out her contract: Alexas fate was sealed. I would like to draw your attention Ill save you some time, Aaron interrupted. Again, he didnt bother to turn and look at the one he was speaking to. Until I join the Galactic Federation, the laws of my own world still stand. Correct? Gular pushed JarBek aside. What are you talking about? You have no world! Eruwenn smiled, and maintained her calm demeanour. That is correct. This was not what she had expected. Nobody had considered the laws of Earth, not even her and her mind was racing as she tried to anticipate his next move. It was Alexa who spoke next. Human Ambassador, I am being wrongfully persecuted due to my race. I would like to apply for asylum. Granted. Aaron, with heart pounding, barely let her finish the sentence. Could he pull off the biggest bluff of his life? Under Earth law, Alexa is now granted citizenship and is afforded the rights and protections that entails. So Finally he stood and turned to face Gular. You can get fucked! he bellowed. Gular stammered and rounded on JarBek. What is this? What is he saying? Cygna had been searching the Earth databases frantically, and quickly held up a page for Eruwenn to view. Eruwenn calmly looked it over before looking at Gular. It is a law from their world, although it does pertain to humans only. Aaron stepped in. Because we were unaware of other life forms at that time. As the Ambassador I see this as within the spirit of the law, as it was originally intended. Things had spun in a direction she was not prepared for, and Eruwenn found to her delight that she was feeling nervous. It had been some time since anyone had surprised her as much as this human. What other bombshells did the human have in store for them? I believe the Ambassador is within his rights. Gular was apoplectic with rage, and threw JarBek to the floor. Do you have any idea how much your incompetence has cost me? Youre fired, you useless Ashi scum! Gular raised his hand to strike, but before he could strike JarBek the human was there in a flash, standing between them. He turned his back on Gular and reached out to JarBek. Want a job? I need a pirate-lawyer. JarBek smiled. You have no money, last human, and I am not cheap. But nonetheless he took Aarons hand and was pulled to his feet. He was free of Gular who, forgotten and shamed by having his opponent turn his back on him, stormed out of the room. JarBek released Aarons hand, adding, Were both going to pay for that. Aaron returned to straddling the seat facing Eruwenn. Embar shifted by one seat, allowing JarBek to sit between them. Embar slapped him on the back as they traded places, and through the pain JarBek managed a weak smile. Eruwenn, realising her leverage was further slipping away, tried to move things on. Well, that seems to have resolved itself. Shall we go on to your future in the Galactic Federation. Now that you have an expensive lawyer to pay for. She smiled warmly at Aaron. Cygna and the other diplomatic officials were furiously tapping on their datapads. Captain Hexak was staring in disbelief at Aaron and Alexa. So Shes a human now? Citizen of Earth. Humans, dogs and now Inorganics. Aaron corrected him before casually tossing a dog treat in the air, and with a snap it vanished. The Captain was in shock. Earth? he blurted out. Youre the last of your race. You dont even have a planet! What is this insanity? Aaron smiled. He'd come this far, why not? Im the first of my race, so let me make it clear where *we* stand. The Darnians were part of the Galactic Federation when they raided Earth. Stealing resources, and kidnapping two citizens. Sassie had her head on his knee, looking for her next treat. He scratched her head. We see this as a declaration of war by the Darnians. WHAT?! Eruwenn gently patted Captain Hexaks arm as he fought for control. The Councillor looked to Cygna, who was desperately searching the human datafiles to try and catch up. Defeated, Cygna shrugged. Once again Eruwenn tried to head off the human. Surely, you must realise that the Darnians acted alone. The Galactic Federation is Of course. Aaron stopped her mid sentence. Our war is with the Darnians. Hexak was in disbelief. Theyre dead you idiot! The human was insane. You killed them! How could they be at war with an extinct race? Aarons smile sent shivers through Eruwenn, and as he took a triumphant breath it all fell into place a moment too late. So, we won. My people have a long tradition of killing people and taking their land. Right of conquest, we call it. To show that the Galactic Federation had no part in this unprovoked attack on my world, we request that you do not interfere in its outcome. As Darnis has been populated with beings from my world for hundreds of celes already, I believe it is now an Earth colony. On behalf of the citizens of Earth I formally state my claim to Darnis and its system. Embar almost choked as he saw the look on the Captains face. Can he do that? Hexak murmured. Eruwenn found herself in very unfamiliar territory. The rules that she was so adept at manipulating and exploiting were finely balanced. Written by the keenest minds in the galaxy, they were a labyrinth of clauses, exceptions, exclusions and pitfalls. The human had simply brought his own rulebook and thrown hers out of the nearest window. Though she continued to smile for appearance's sake, it was entirely without warmth. We will have to look into this further. We were under the assumption you would be looking to join the Federation, not conquer it. It was Aarons turn to drop the warmth. Before agreeing to join anything, its probably a good idea if I take a look around. It was the Captain who angrily replied again, his voice growing ever higher. And how do you expect to look around without a ship? JarBek suddenly jumped to his feet and pointed at the Ambassador from Arkellis, who had tactfully avoided getting involved in this bizarre sideshow. As the legal representative of the two Ambassadors from Earth I am formally registering our intent to sue the government of Arkellis for wrongful imprisonment of higher life forms! He smiled broadly. Aaron looked stunned, though it was quickly replaced with a gin. He could grow to like pirate-law. Ambassador Afair was taken aback, and it took her a moment to register what was said. Excuse me. What? JarBek stood tall. The human was going to be very, very rich by the time he was finished. He reeled off laws, sub-paragraphs and clauses, so fast the officials couldnt keep up. He cited case after case of kidnapping victims, wrongful arrests and the subsequent rulings in their favour. The museum was run by the government of Arkellis. Either deliberately, or through negligence, they had been responsible for the illegal imprisonment of Aaron and Sassie. For hundreds of celes. The compensation was going to be record-breaking! Eruwenn suddenly broke out in uncontrollable laughter, the outrageous absurdity of what was happening just too much. I like you, Ambassador. Thanks? Aaron looked around and was relieved to see everyone was as curious as he was. Eruwenn stood and bowed. I can see that you will not be joining the Galactic Federation while so many issues still remain unresolved. She knew when to step away; better to regroup and fight again another day. Let us meet again once we have had time to learn more about each other. Aaron nodded. I look forward to it. JarBek raised his hand. The err datafiles from the human world. They would be the rightful property of the human he said with a smile, and should be returned. Any commercial applications that this data has been used for will also require compensation to the original race, he added, and his grin grew wider still. Eruwenn raised an eyebrow at JarBek; he was as good as Cygna had warned. Much of the information is deemed dangerous and classified. I am sure we can make arrangements as long as some concessions are made regarding the release of the data. As the diplomats began to file out, Eruwenn paused and looked back at Aaron. After saving your friend, conquering a planet and suing an entire world, what do you plan to do next? Aaron fought back the urge to be glib and instead opted for honesty. I want to go home. Not a pawn, she thought. Perhaps a knight?"
8,vulnerability,HFY,Rage III,1,g7eb6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/g7eb6e/rage_iii/,2020-04-25 04:59:38,"Hed been running for a few hours, keeping to the lightest areas he could. Even in the stage of panic he found himself in, he kept his head enough to remember at least that part of his training. Dont lose your advantages! Her voice echoed through the dark hallways of his memory. They see just as well in places you wont even see your oversized nose. This last word was accompanied by an expert jab of her staff into his nose, reminding him why she was the teacher and he was just a student, though she was younger than him. He rubbed his nose indignantly, as if he didnt remember what she had spent countless hours lecturing him about. Theyd spent the majority of the morning training with weapons considered salvageable from the ruins; mainly blunt instruments such as clubs or maces, sharp, spike-like instruments, and now the staff. The idea being he could find many of these in his environment in the form of broken tree branches, shards of metal, or a metal pole fallen from within reinforced concrete. When using a staff, you need to hold both ends in your mind as if they are separate weapons, same for mine She said, only then will you be able to defend yourself better than a 3 year old wrapped in a blanket! This time a sharp rap on his right shin accompanied her last word. If Ive already decided to carry a crossbow, if I even bother to stop moving long enough to fight, why bother training with anything else? he grumbled through the tears which sprung unwanted from his traitorous eyes as he turned to walk away. This is a waste of my time! Im going to the climbing grounds so I stop wasting my ti He woke 3 days later to a soft, cool feeling on his forehead. It took some time for his thoughts to organize beyond the dull achy pain emanating from the back of his head and the sharp throbbing from his nose to realize it was a wash-cloth being dabbed gently against his forehead. He cracked one eye painfully, only to be greeted by blackness. Had he gone blind? Ah, youre finally awake. a familiar voice resounded from the darkness, Id begun to worry your head wasnt as hard as I thought. Click, a light flashed on. Painfully bright at first, sending him cowering behind his hands. Knock it off you wuss, he still couldnt place the voice. Here, the light faded slightly. Can your baby eyes handle this? He moved his hands slowly and saw a silhouette in front of a lamp covered with a sheet. The figure seemed to have read the confusion on his face because they leaned back and turned towards the light. He caught a glimpse of deep blue amid a sea of red and his breath caught, why would She be caring for me? Why?.. he began. I was worried youd ask that now... She said with uncharacteristic vulnerability, I wanted to talk to you about something He was suddenly aware of the fact she was biting one side of her bottom lip. He could look at nothing else, such a strange act, as unexpected as a rose in a field of crabgrass. I wanted to say He was ripped out of his reverie by a loud crack fracturing the calm air. He slid to a stop and whirled in a full circle to try to identify whether this new noise represented a threat or not. Across the atrium he saw a large chunk of ceiling sitting in a new dust cloud apparently fallen due to the continued decay. After he took a few breaths to slow his breathing he paused to gain his bearings and realized he didn't recall much of the last hour or so since he began running. His flight had carried him through innumerable hallways stretching into darkness; through doors of all shapes and sizes leading to rooms ranging from no larger than himself, to rooms that could have easily fit the entire settlement and the farm lands surrounding. He now found himself within the largest room yet; the far wall only visible because there were many large cracks and holes in the ceiling letting in light. The ceiling soared so far above him, even though the newly fallen detritus was larger than a house, the hole left vacant by it looked no larger than his thumb at the end of his outstretched arm. Around the perimeter of the massive room were layer upon layer of balconies; some connected, and others separated by decayed sections, but each level reachable from the last by one of many sets of stairs. Aside from himself and a few nesting birds, the room was empty, and thus silent. He felt certain he had lost the Saevian and avoided alerting others, but the deeply ingrained sense of insecurity being beyond the walls of the settlement held his thoughts in tight inescapable bands. He knew he wouldn't be able to relax enough to do anything until he can guarantee his safety. Many plans rushed through his head, all but a few discounted due to lack of supplies or time. From the few plausible ideas he formed, setting up a base camp to explore from struck the balance of careful and proactive. He scrutinized his surroundings to find the most secure area he could place himself that didn't compromise his maneuverability and finally settled on a section of balcony 5 layers up that was separated on both sides by a 10 foot section of collapse. This particular balcony was also protected from above by a deeper than average balcony and below by a total absence of standing balconies underneath. He began picking his way across the rubble to a set of stairs that appeared to lead him to a path he could take to the balcony above his target. He carefully began to climb the stairs; constantly conscious of the fact these stairs have seen only the weight of dust for centuries. He realized his subconscious was still with Her when he noticed he shouldnt have to do anything more risky than shimmy along a 1 foot section every so often until he could reach the balcony above his target. She always said it is better to plan a longer route that requires no risk, than take a short dangerous route and possibly break something. That was the main point she and he disagreed on the most, as he always had a flair for the dramatic and fast routes. As he deliberated just how much this girl changed him, and whether it was for the good or not, he ascended 8 flights, walked across to another set of stairs heading down, shimmied across a 20 foot section of partially collapsed balcony, and headed down one longer set of stairs. He noticed nothing to warn him. Maybe it had something to do with the flock of birds that took flight from just above, maybe She really was clouding his focus. Whatever the cause, he failed to notice the stairs giving way beneath him until he began to fall. The fall seems to take eternity, much longer than his fall earlier, but in reality he only fell one story. He stood gingerly and felt his ribs screech in agony as the binding he used came loose. As he re-bound his ribs, he looked around and realized hed had a bit of good fortune come his way as he had actually landed right next to the balcony that overhung the one he planned to set his base camp up on. It only took a short while to secure some rope to rappel down, triple check the security of the post, he wasnt making that mistake again, and rappel down onto what would be his new home for who knows how long. He started a small fire with some of the tinder from his kit and wood that at one point may have been a railing. His training was screaming at him to not light a fire in an area he didn't know, but since he had not yet seen a Saevian that could jump that high, he figured even if one found him he should be able to stay safe until he found a way out. He did heed one part of his brain and built his fire slowly. The last thing he needed was the heat from the fire to cause a fracture in the balcony above or below, either crushing him or dropping him to his death. He settled himself onto the most comfortable section of floor near his fire with a view of the atrium intending to keep watch for awhile, and immediately dropped into a shallow sleep haunted by a howling, ravaged face with red hair.

He saw the massive assault bot stomping forward while the smaller trooper bots swarmed around her, all the while the inspiring patriotic military band music blared. This way. Jaeger waved Tami forward then as she clamped her hands over her ears even more firmly. WHY IS THERE MUSIC!? Without smartplugs for her ears he could only imagine how loud the music must be for her. Never mind all the gunfire and explosions echoing through the tight tunnels. The bots have initiated a communist uprising. Cant you tell? He replied as she squinted at him. WHAT?! He just shook his head and waved her forward crossing the hall while still flanked by trooper bots. He was doing his best to get her to the central structure so he could get her back up to the command center and safety, but it was slow going. To make matters worse the combat drugs still pulsing through his veins left him feeling a bit sweaty inside his armor. Sweaty and hot. Sweaty, hot, and aggressive. The faint echoes of possible hostiles being chased down by Bertha and her swarm of troopers made him want to join the hunt, but he knew better than to give in. He still wanted to know what had happened up top involving some kind of crab bot. Could it really be the one from the city? Why was it here? What did it have to do with the fight? Keeping to the less populated tunnels as they moved through the underground he had to step over broken bots, and dead Draugr in equal measure. Though he paused as he saw some of their equipment. Reaching down he picked up what looked to be a standard M539 LMG one of them had been using. What is it? Tami asked, now able to talk clearly away from the sounds of battle. Im curious. Jaeger announced and slowly turned the weapon over in his hands before pointing to a stamp in the casing. Its got a stamp from the Binary weapon foundries. But its newer than the war because its also got the Ragnarok insignia. Im just trying to figure out where Marques gear is coming from. He tossed the weapon aside then and began to look some of the bodies over more closely. Can this wait until Im not standing in a pool of blood and guts and shit? Tami asked, looking around nervously. Oh right. Jaeger started to rise, but then paused a moment to grab a flower that had been tucked into the collar of one of the Draugrs uniforms. It looked familiar but he couldnt place it. Tucking it into a pouch he started moving forward again. I dont suppose you have any insight into where they were coming from before this attack began? Me? No. Ive been trying to untangle your comms once Ham gave me access. Did you know you had hundreds of frequency channels opened for some reason? I cant tell if some process was making more or why they werent closed out. The fact your system could handle it is impressive but also just disgusting in a systems admin perspective. I couldnt even determine that the vast majority of them were being used. Jaeger glanced back as Tami rambled on a bit while they walked. What are you talking about? Our voice comms? There shouldnt be that many open channels Had something been going on with the system before the reset? Was there a leak? What did that even mean? Some rogue bot? But Marque hadnt known he was alive until recently. Paranoia began to creep through his thoughts as he wondered about the possible reasons for the tangled comms. Well how often did you wipe the frequency channels? Or purge the channel history? She asked next which made him blink. What do you mean? If Im ever opening a channel its just whatever the tab is in the UI. Should just be a command channel, and an all channel. Though the command channel hasnt mattered since the war obviously. Now Jaeger was trying to look harder at his UI, which of course was hard as his eyes wanted to twitch thanks to the drugs. You never clear them? That doesn't purge the old frequencies! Are you telling me for a decade youve just been opening new channels every time you put on your armor? Tami gasped out. How did you not know how to do that?! Youre a Revenant! Yeah, Im a Revenant! Not a tech! We had people for that! Ask Ham! Hes our nerd! Jaegers paranoia quickly began to drift over to defensive anger. If by nerd you mean the only tech savvy individual on your team then you should be thankful he kept this place running as long as he did! Did you just turn on all your maintenance bots and assume thatll take care of everything?! She asked then as he very distinctly didnt look back. Oh my god! You did! Didnt you?! Listen I was busy raising my kids! So I opened new comms tabs! The fuck is it to you?! I was busy killing scavs and trying to hold onto what little civilization still existed! I dont have to explain myself to you! Jaeger huffed. What happened to the other people here at the facility? This place obviously wasnt meant to be run by bots and two adults for a decade! Jaeger was getting more antsy about finding some hostile contacts the longer this conversation lasted. But the closer they got to the center the safer it became. The compound was evacuated in the very early parts of the war. We returned near the end, and just made due with what we had. Its not like we were exactly swimming in techs and engineers or whatever. We lost most of who we still had in the assault on the central hub! So youre fucking welcome for defeating the Hive alright! Jaeger hissed back at her. A problem Absolute Dynamics is totally responsible for! Tami countered immediately. Jaeger just huffed at that and forced himself to remain silent. He knew the irritation edging up through him was part of the drugs. Why was he mad about being told he needed to clean up his comms? It was a small issue, more to laugh at. But as he kept stomping along he had to deal with that voice in the back of his mind raging about charging into battle and killing every Draugr he could find. Finally though he saw the door hed been looking for. The crumpled security door that the assassin bot had first broken through, and then Bertha had kicked back out. Peering inside the bot bay for a moment he didnt see anything threatening and waved Tami forward. Well, thanks for fixing whatever you could fix before all this. He felt a bit like a child being forced to utter an insincere apology, but the problem was he was the one forcing himself to say it. Youre welcome. Tami replied as they moved forward through the empty bays. The trooper bots still keeping a perimeter around them. Is that the assassin bot you mentioned? Tami asked as they stepped past the hulk that Bertha personally deactivated earlier. Another one yeah. Dumbass bot design if you ask me. Its too small. I dont care how advanced the material is, assault bots like Bertha outclass her in too many regards. Shes not strong enough to win hand to hand and shes not faster than an autocannon. Jaeger mentioned as he shook his head a moment. Well, its supposed to be an assassin right? I imagine they figure guards are more likely to ignore a teen girl right? Less threatening? Tami pointed out. Maybe thirty years ago. During the shadow wars, and the actual war girls were far more often used for suicide bombings. Pretty much any time we dealt with Hive or Davari it was nearly regulation to shoot girls of that age on sight. I mean not like on sight, on sight but like just Jaeger waved a hand vaguely. If they were wearing lumpy clothes and near a battle they should be running away from. Holy shit Tami muttered softly. Doesnt that bother you? She asked next. What? I mean it sucked. But its war. Its comprised entirely of suck. Jaeger snorted. But you have a girl that age. You dont think about how you killed girls like Raven? Tami gave him a worried look as they began to ascend the stairs towards the main lobby. I dont enjoy killing kids. But sometimes it has to be done. I also have a son, youre not asking if I disliked killing boys that age. Im also a father! Shouldnt you ask if I hate killing other dads? Or mothers? Shouldnt shouldnt you just ask how I feel about killing in general? Fuck! If someone is strapped with explosives and determined to kill you and your buddies does it matter what age they are? Or gender? Or even fucking species?! Sometimes its kill or be killed. And Id rather kill. Jaeger clutched his gun tighter for a moment as they made it to the top of the stairs. Yes, he would rather kill. The lobby was safe. He could just send her on her way and go out and join the fray. These assholes were here to kill his family and friends. They needed to die. Marque needed to die. Everyone involved He forced himself to relax his fingers slowly and untense his shoulders, rolling them back a moment as he looked over at Tami behind him. He could see how anxious she was, one hand out just a little as if she was debating reaching to touch his arm. Was she worried for his soul? Or was she worried shed be next? Were almost safe. Just got to cross the lobby. The trooper bots fanned out before them as they crossed over and she looked at the dead hostile Revenant in the middle. Is that one of- No. One of Marques. No idea who he was. Dont slip in the shit. Theyd been walking through plenty of blood and guts in the tunnels but Tami made an effort to step around the bodies this time. Jaeger took a moment to look out the main windows at the tracers flashing in the distance. It looked like they were being pushed back. There were the charred remains of the man he had watched earlier. A human reduced to bristly burnt charcoal. He could still go Still join the fray. His blood still felt like it was boiling inside his veins as the drugs did everything they were supposed to do. Suppress pain, suppress empathy, hell suppress self. All that should remain is a husk ready to kill. No not just ready to kill. Aroused by it. Thrilled by it. Driven by it Thats why they didnt use just bots. Bots didnt get giddy and excited to murder dissidents. Here he was years after Odinson was dead, and that voice deep within him would just never shut up Jaeger? Turning he saw Tami at the door to the security checkpoint and moved to follow. Coming. Even as his body screamed at him to run out that door and find someone to kill he moved up the stairs with Tami, the trooper bots hanging back now to set up a defensive position inside the checkpoint just in case. Once they had stepped into the command center he saw Max was still hooked up. Figs was in the corner, his armor partially stripped off as Tanya tended to him. Looked like hed been hit pretty hard, his arm was off just like hed said. Hey sarge. He waved his dismembered arm when he saw Jaeger enter the room, which made Jaeger sigh and shake his head. Max what were you saying earlier about a crab bot? He ignored Figs for now, not wanting to hear the dozens of hand puns he was positive Figs had prepared. Oh cmon sarge youre not going to give me a hand?! Figs accused, already trying to force those puns upon him anyway. Tanya could you up his morphine levels so he shuts up? Jaeger asked. Hes a synth, hes not on any morphine. Tanya reminded him. But I will take some! Nows a great time for drugs! He then extended the dismembered arm he was holding to point it at Raven who was nervously watching him. Hey Raven! Pull my finger. The crab bot. Jaeger reiterated then as he looked at Max hooked up to the command chair. I didnt understand what was going on at first. I thought it was just one of the loose bots requesting network access at first. I didnt realize what it was until one of their last intact landers was trying to offload its cargo on the road and the crab bot grabbed the door and stopped it from opening. Max explained. Seriously? It just walked up and broke the door? Jaeger asked. Yeah. I dont think the landing ramp was ever intended to be opened while a crab bot was pinning it shut. It was too close in for the lander to use any guns. They sent a few troops after it but it just stabbed some of them with the weathervane until I got more bots in position to cover it. Even as Max explained that Spike was chirping away on Jaegers shoulder. What does he mean about a friend? Bots dont have friends. Tami was asking as she listened to the little bot. Thats just how he refers to bots hes hacked. Dont think about it. Jaeger immediately insisted. But yes Spike I cant imagine there are two crab bots with weathervanes. Ham told me about this! Do you seriously never wipe your bots?! This cant be good! The Shanghai accords exist for a good reason you know! Tami waved her hands as she stressed the point Jaeger had heard a million times now. Yes they exist for a reason and I dont care! Im not wiping Spike! Bots are better than most organics anyway! They can have friends and dreams if they want to! Back off lady! Jaeger snapped at her as she backed up and gulped in worry. Damn sarge who pissed in your cornflakes? Figs asked, thankfully not making another hand joke. Sorry sorry Im just its the combat drugs. Making me feel like my blood is hot and sweaty and just Well you fucking know how I get! He waved a hand at them for a moment. Is that all? Youre back up in safety now you dont need them. Tanya reminded him and before he could reply he saw her bring up the medical menu in his UI before she selected the detox routine. Wa- Was as far as Jaeger got before he felt the needle sink into his neck and all his energy seemed to just drain out of his body. All the pain came flooding back, and he suddenly felt like he hadnt slept in years. He couldnt even try and go for a chair. Everything was spinning but in slow motion. Who was messing with the remote? His legs just buckled a little as he hadnt locked up the suit servos and he slowly and pitifully collapsed forward onto his face. Shit Tanya! Did you just kill sarge? Figs asked in surprise. Dad! Raven was already rushing to his side to clutch at his arm, trying to roll him over, but between his own bulk and the armor it wasnt happening. What? No, I didnt kill him! I know you can see his vitals! Hes just All I did was detox him! He was complaining about the combat drugs! She waved a hand at Jaeger and moved over to slowly roll him onto his side, tucking one arm under his head and angling a leg to shift him into the recovery position. The man is baseline, hes in his 40s, has been engaged in combat over the last few days, is suffering a number of injuries, and probably hasnt had good sleep in a week and you just do him dirty like that? Tanya, thats cold. Figs shook his head and wagged his dismembered arm at her scoldingly. Ow. Jaeger finally spoke as his brain seemed to move beyond being stuck in slowmo. Im just gonna lie here for a while You do that sarge. Raven your dad is fine. Hes just a lot more tired than I expected. Tanya was gently stroking Ravens hair to try and soothe her as they crouched over Jaeger. Should we get him out of his armor? Raven asked, casting a worried glance at her dad lying on the ground. Leaving him in it is best. Itll make sure hes just fine. Tanya informed her and then tugged Ravens hand to get her to move back. Jus minute Jaeger quietly muttered. Hed drift off to sleep any moment now. Hed see Leona in his dreams. When he woke up hed be feeling much better. Yes. Sleep. Any moment Why wasnt he asleep yet? He began to feel as if he wasnt properly within his body anymore. It was like he was sitting just behind himself. His eyes providing a distant tiny view of the world around him. Feet were moving. Not often. But he could hear shuffling. Distant talking sometimes. They were no doubt trying to be quiet for him. Right. It was time to sleep now. He was very tired. Someone shifted the vision ports around as he tried to peer through them to see what was going on, but it all seemed so distant This wasnt ideal hed give it another minute. Then hed get up because this was getting boring. How had he not fallen asleep? He was infamous for being able to take battle naps pretty much whenever he wanted! Why was his hand moving? Oh he was probably doing that. His armored fingers slowly dragging against the floor of the command center before he finally got his hand closed into a fist. His other arm where was it? On his side. Right. He carefully began to move that hand out as well, also curling his fingers into a fist. Then he shifted his legs, flopping over more directly onto his face from his side where Tanya had rolled him over. His muscles felt like they were quivering with exhaustion after a prolonged workout but he slowly pushed down and very shakily rose up to his feet. Im up. He announced as his mind seemed to reorient itself. He was no longer sitting just behind himself. His body hurt but slowly opened and closed his hands, curled and uncurled his toes, and established that this was his body. Good to see you up sarge. Brandy-Lynn gave his shoulder a pat as she stepped up next to him. When did you get here? Jaeger asked and looked around seeing the command chair was empty. Figs wasnt in the corner. What was going on? An hour ago? You know youve been lying on the floor for like three hours right? Jaeger blinked as he looked at Brandy-Lynn and then around the room slowly. It was like five minutes. Looking down at his hands he opened and closed them again. Where was his gun? You were deep in some hole. Your brain needed it obviously. Want to counter that with more drugs? A grin spread easily across her face as she asked him that. No. While there were a great many things he would love right now, using more drugs was about as far from desirable as it could get. Battle? He asked even as he slowly and carefully moved over to take a seat on the chair Figs had used earlier that was actually designed for someone in power armor. Its been over for a while. Just a lot of mopping up. By the time you came back up in here it was pretty much done. Neither side knew it of course. Ill hand it to Marque. He's made some fanatical scavs thats for sure. Brandy-Lynn shook her head a bit as she took a seat across from Jaeger. Prisoners? Wounded? Jaeger asked next as his brain seemed to start processing things properly once more. Even if it was a bit delayed. I did just mention fanatics right? None of them surrendered. The ones who didnt just outright fight to the death took pills. Tabori did the usual Tabori bullshit where he found one of the guys who had killed himself with a pill, had like foam around his mouth. Anyway Tabori scooped up a bit of the foam on his pinky and then licked it and squinted like this. She made a face trying to imitate the sniper. Almonds. She hisses out in his usual exaggerated accent before laughing. Oohhh Tabori Fucking goofball. In the lobby Jaegers body was slowly pulling itself together from a million different places as he began to feel alive all over again. No one we knew. She shook her head, figuring he was talking about the hostile Revenant hed helped Max kill earlier. Tanya was trying to organize some impromptu autopsies but Max wasnt feeling like playing commander at that point so I dunno if she organized the bots for it yet or not. Seemed like they were mostly human. Though that Revenant guy and the commanders were certainly pumping a variety of steroids and enhancers. Also their protein bars are annoyingly good. That last bit made Jaeger frown as he gave Brandy-Lynn a look. Even with his helmet on she could no doubt sense this as she shrugged. Look I was fucking hungry. You know how hungry you can get in combat. As if that was the magic words to reawaken his digestion system Jaegers stomach let out a low deep grumble. Fuck Im hungry Figured. She reached into a pocket pulling out a rather familiar olive drab pouch to toss to him. Carefully catching it he set it in his lap and then removed his helmet, tugging the smart cloak back as he did. Fuck bud you look like shit. Was the first thing she said as she saw his face. How bad is it? He asked, not wanting to look even as he opened the food pouch shed given him. Bad. Like uh Shit. You look like complete shit. She shrugged then as he sighed and looked at the bar inside the pouch. It had some kind of yellowish gold coating. He carefully and gingerly pulled it up to his mouth to take a bite and then gave her a surprised look as he crunched on it. Salted caramel? He frowned as he tried to read the package. Sure enough ProBar Ration 5 Salted Caramel. Right? Brandy-Lynn nodded. Theyre like candy but theyve got a ton of protein and good shit in them. I found red velvet, peanut butter chocolate, lemon bar, and a few others. Id say theyre even better than those cashwed based ones we used to get. These have like a light wafer crunch or something to them. Jaeger looked at the protein bar in his hand before he took another careful bite. He noticed then that his mouth was an arid wasteland and coughed a moment. Brandy-Lynn seemed ready though and handed him a canteen. He took a careful sniff, couldnt tell what it was, and took a swig anyway. Gulping down the sweet juice he shuddered a moment and then took another gulp before handing it back. Fruit juice? Better than water. Brandy-Lynn grinned as she took it back and took a swig herself. PURG. Passion, Ushi fruit, rock orange, and guava. Good shit. There might be concerns over it spoiling. Jaeger weakly muttered but was already feeling much better as the sugar and protein were no doubt much welcomed by his abused body. Feeling more coordinated by now he stood up, waiting a moment to see if the room was spinning. Once he didnt fall over he grabbed his helmet. Where is everyone? Downstairs. Brandy-Lynn got up and led the way. Jaeger was mostly walking thanks to the servos in the armor doing the work for him but he managed to make it downstairs no problem. Trooper bots were standing around in the lobby, with two heavy bots outside. The bodies had been dragged outside, blood smeared around as two of the googly-eyed cleaner began to tend to the mess. Such happy looking little bots Cleaning up all that blood without a care Good for them. As they moved on into the cafeteria he was glad to see only a few windows had been shattered by bullets, and some maintenance bots were already patching them up. Hed put a lot of effort into making the compound look abandoned, now they were going about making it look clean and fresh once more. The others were sitting around one of the cafeteria tables, a variety of frozen food having been cooked and set out. Hey its Sarge! Figs waved why the fuck was his arm white? Jaeger stared at the now mismatched Figs even as Raven got up from where she had been sitting to run over and hug Jaeger as best she could through his armor. He carefully gave her head a pat, and then picked her up a bit to walk over and sit down with the others. Wwooooow. You look like shit. Figs immediately said. Thats what I said! Brandy-Lynn sat down nearby and grabbed a hamburger from a pile of them, then opened it up to add some chicken nuggets, ranch, and potato chips before smooshing it all back down to start eating like the degenerate she was. Wow. Dad you do look bad. Max mentioned from across the table, looking rather tired himself. This is why we always appreciated having your dad around to remind us of our former humanity. Figs nodded slowly and crossed his arms as he leaned on the table. Jaeger stared at his new, smaller, white arm once more. Yeah this is all you had spare. He finally explained. Didnt we just get a bunch of synthflesh? Jaeger asked looking around for Tanya while Raven still clutched his side, not letting go. Im not wasting it on him. Tanya was walking back in from the kitchen with a large pot of recaff as the others began to hold up mugs for her to pour into. I kinda need it. Figs protested even as she filled his cup with the dirty brown liquid of life. Thanks. But yeah I mean people are going to ask questions if I go out looking like this. We can get you a new arm some other way. I got that synthflesh so Raven and Mac could use it. Not you. Tanya explained with a huff as she took a seat before a bowl of some kind of instant noodles. Then as she looked at Jaeger she arched a brow. Wow, you do look like hell. Thank you. Anyone else want to tell me I look like ass? Jaeger grumbled as he looked around. Ass would be improvement. Your face more resemblent of roadkill scraped off street to add meat to borsch. Tabori helpfully added as he tended to his own little espresso pot at the end of the table. You look like you were in a car accident or something. Is he okay? Tami looked to be the only one who showed any concern as she sat by Ham, who had been eying Jaeger carefully so far. Was he going to say something about the bots? The pilot had now seen Jaegers un-memory wiped army of robots in action, which might not be a good thing. Sigil seven. When you were really sick. Ham finally spoke up before taking a sip of his mug of recaff. Thats what it looks like. Ooohhh yeeeaaah. Figs nodded and wagged a finger at him. Thats it. When you made us all very aware of how fragile you are and also so very glad we arent human anymore. Uh er baseline. He corrected after a moment and shiftly looked around the table as if it was a conspiracy. How bad was it? Max asked as he glanced around. Rul bad. Brandy-Lynn muttered around a mouthful of chicken nugget, ranch, potato chip, hamburger. I was very sick Jaeger nodded thinking back on the time in question. Worse yet we were mid mission so its not like I could get out of there. We were in this cheap awful little apartment I was already on the can, being miserable, when I realized I had to vomit. But there was such volume that I ended up blowing chunks out my nose in the process. Uugghhh! Aaawwwh... Eeewww! Grooosssss! All around him was a cacophony of disgusted reactions, while even Raven let go his side and leaned back, rubbing at her own nose reflexively. Noooo! I can smell it! She wailed and shook her head to try and dislodge the thought. Yeah thats synth programming. When people say they can smell a memory? You guys get the same actual sensation. Have fun. Jaeger couldnt help but let out a slow chuckle as he had disgusted everyone at the table. Except Brandy-Lynn who was also giggling, as bits of her Franken-Burger spat out. Chew with your mouth closed Brandy-Lynn. Jesus youre such a pig. Oink oink oink! She snorted at him and made a show of a big mouthful of partially chewed food. Yeah, your dad really helps remind us to appreciate regular people. I mean this baseline human followed around a bunch of super humans through combat for a decade and a half. Plus he would actually get sick sometimes! Ham shook his head a moment. We get sick. Max replied with a frown, but Jaeger stiffened up a little as he mentioned it and his eyes locked with Tanya who also froze. Hol up. What do you mean you get sick? Ham looked down and Max now gave his dad a confused look. I mean not often but Max processed things for a moment and pointed at Jaeger. You made us sick didnt you! Getting flus and colds is part of the human experience! Feeling weak and recovering is important for personal growth! Jaeger insisted immediately as even Raven gave him a slightly hurt look. You mean that awful summer cold I had two years ago where I was miserable for like a week and went through a million kleenex was because you! I just thought it was like I dont know! She waved a hand. Yes. I made you two get sick. Just minor programming things so youd know what it was like. Your mother thought it was important! As did I. Youre human, no matter what these louts talk about being synths. So human experiences are important! If you were a Jipasi synth Im sure youd experience similar Jipasi things! He looked around a moment at that. Wheres Kuv? I had him start organizing salvage and checking their lander wrecks for traps and the like. Useless little coward spent the battle running through the tunnels setting booby traps so I told him he has to put in work now. Tanya snorted and shook her head slowly. Hes pretty adamant about not being in the actual fighting. Jaeger nodded. Can we not change the subject about you forcing disease upon us? Max tried to keep the conversation focused. Its not disease! It was a few colds and a flu or two! If you dont know what its like to be sick how will you know when people you interact with mention things like that? Its about blending it. Vulnerability is essential to the human experience. Jaeger insisted. Hes got a point. Seeming him at his lowest really helped keep us in line And then also shame us when he was humping fifty kilos through the worst terrain possible, ahead of us, all without bitching. Figs nodded slowly. That and he could still gross us out in ways only a baseline could. What was the other thing youd do? Something about food. Mentioning that made Jaegers stomach growl again as he looked around at the food set out. Im so hungry I could eat the asshole out of a dead water buffalo. Uuggghhh! This got a round of disgusted groans from Tanya, Figs, Tabori, and Ham while Brandy-Lynn cackled once more. What? Thats kind of crass but why are you all acting like its so bad? Max asked with a confused look. Because he did it! Ham waved at Jaeger even as he reached out to grab some of the chicken nuggets that Brandy-Lynn had left behind to delicately eat as he tried to determine what his stomach would allow for now. He what? Max looked back at Jaeger who shrugged. We were on day four of a six hour mission. He started and then grabbed a plate to snag a few other items. You mean- Max started but Figs cut him off. He does not. Intel had a very bad habit of underestimating local resistance, and overestimating orbital support. What was supposed to be a quick drop turned into a slog across New Vientiane thanks to Brandy-Lynns distant retarded cousins blowing up an entire starport to try and kill us. Figs explained. Ive told you asshole New Vientiane was mostly Laotians and Cambodian settlers! Not Vietnamiese! Ham growled out while Brandy-Lynn just shrugged. Gooks a gook. Only difference is how much you lead em. All the cool kids moved to Louisiana. Or Newest Orleans. Plus you all know I give zero shits about my supposed heritage. Gimme nascar any day of the week and Ill happily sit on my swamp porch drinking cheap beer and shooting gators with my shotgun. She accented her point by taking another big bite of her Franken-burger and chased it down with some of her sugary fruit juice. God youre such white trash. Ham muttered as he looked at Brandy-Lynn who just blew him a kiss. Anyway- Jaeger cut back in before the conversation devolved any further. Having been used to this kind of thing before I always brought more food than usual but even I hadnt planned for it to get this bad. There we are marching through the jungle and come out in a village that had been hit in an attack by either the LRFC, or the AAVLA, or possibly the LLCF recently. God they had so many insurgent groups Anyway there was a dead water buffalo sitting in a rice paddy. Now Id used this expression before. Id heard it from some old vet on Earth, who had heard it from some old vet, and so on and so forth probably all the way back to I dunno The origin of soldiers and water buffalo. Tabori bet is Romans. They marched all over, and ates a lots of animals assholes. Tabori at the end sagely nodded. Anyway Jaeger shrugged. I realized that I had to eat. Not only was I starving but if I had been using that phrase and suddenly found an actual dead water buffalo and didnt eat it Well theres a reason Im the sarge. So you ate a water buffalo? Thats not so bad? Max glanced around but the other Revenant at the table were shaking their heads. No Yep. Jaeger nodded. Cut up the flanks and cooked em and I ate that asshole. It wasnt great. But I cleaned and cooked it all properly. I mean theyre herbivores. Its not that bad. Your mother tried very hard to get me not to do it. But even she knew I had to do it. Just one of those things The flanks were good though honestly. I still love flank steak. I dont think I want to hear this. Raven quietly muttered besides him as Jaeger lifted his arm to look down at her, having forgotten. Oh! Honey! Gaaaah I keep forgetting youre here. I am so sorry Jaeger pulled her in close to his side. Great look what you guys have made me do! He glared around the table. Yeah, shes your kid you knew she didnt have a chance. Brandy-Lynn snorted. Then then once I pick them up these degenerates. Ham waved around the table. Showed me pictures! Leona even broke protocol to preserve a memory essence of that impromptu barbecue just so I could smell it! So gross. It looked so rubbery. Ham stuck his tongue out and shuddered at the memory still stuck inside his head. Mans gotta eat. Jaeger shrugged once more. When that call came in that you guys were ready for pickup and had some barbecue for me to eat Ham shook his head. Never gone from happy to grossed out so quick. That jogged something in Jaegers head. Call Do we have comms with Whispertail? There was going to be an attack on his cruiser. Do we know what happened? The others sat up a little as he reminded them there was work to be done. No. Tanya shook her head. Resetting the base unsynced our tight beam dishes. Few of our satellites too. You need to get those back up. Without the tight beams aligned if you die we cant bounce back the signal before your soul gets sent to Edenshard. Jaeger reminded her. What? We solved that at the end of the war. Figs frowned. We did. But then we just reset. I forgot about that. I had a lot on my mind He sighed heavily as he remembered having to kill Leona to save his kids. This had not been a good day And yet hed just been laughing. He knew hed get past it but He pulled Raven close to his side once more needing another hug as she wrapped her arms around his side. Oh my god. Figs muttered. Oh my God! Hooooooooooolllyyyy shiiiiit! I could have died! The big man gasped. Yeah? Jaeger frowned, wondering what was up with his friend. I could have DIED! Figs gasped again. Yes. Just like all the other battles weve been in. Jaeger shrugged a moment. No! But! Like! Died! Dead! Not coming back! Finito! Kaput! Gone forever! Figs was slowly leaning back as if this was all hitting him for the first time. Thats thats always been a risk you know that. Even as Jaeger said that Figs clasped his own face, with his mismatched hands. I mean for you maybe! And Brandy-Lynn! But Im a synth! I was always going to be a synth! I was never really going to die! But today I could have like I even! After I got hit I was like shit this sucks! And they were trying to still kill me! I was thinking about doing something funny but just stopped myself at the end because I figured youd get pissy about it. But I would have like... for real seriously actually died! Im too pretty to die! Have you seriously never considered youd actually die on one of our missions? Tanya asked. No! Why would I?! Im immortal and fantastic! Thats my thing! Figs was patting his chest as he blinked and then shook his head rapidly. Brandy-Lynn. Lets go get high. Right now. He said as he stood up. Dont need an excuse but sure. She started to rise up. Sit back down, both of you. Jaeger growled. We need to talk about Marque and where his forces are coming from. The landers cant have come from offworld. He has to have a base here on planet. Jaeger patted at his pouches a moment and pulled out the flower he had found earlier. I found this on one of them. Anyone have ideas? Even as he asked that Tabori was standing up and walking down to take the flower. Tabori knows this flower. It is Leontopodium Solaris Nivale. Solavis Mountain Flower. It is most common in the mountains on the eastern side of this continent. Jaeger pulled his helmet back on then and he brought up his map in the UI. Anywhere specific? He asked. It only grows high in mountains. It is similar to legendary edelweiss from Europes of lore. Soldiers would climb mountains to grab rare flowers to demonstrate courage. And also mountain climbing skill presumably. Tabori of course has done this here. From Scissor mountain. As he said that Jaeger focused the map on the area in question. It was a pretty empty area but then he saw a town nearby. Rochambeau Why is that name familiar? It clicked in his head then. You sent Kuv that package from there didnt you? Tabori did indeed send package to comrade Kuv from this town. Very delightful little place. This was after Tabori had chased down possibly Draugr across paper plains. Jaeger looked at the map and noticed the Paper Plains besides Rocky River Underneath Scissor mountain. Oh you know what? I am just astounded by the names the colonists picked sometimes. Rock, paper, scissors, Rochambeau got it the game wow But his eyes scanned over the map a bit further. But its not far from the Redwood Facility. No way Marque is there. That facility was burned. Literally and figuratively. Everyone knows its there and that whole city is nothing but ashes and charred corpses even now. The recovery program would notice a bunch of Draugr. Tanya reminded him. They were making another facility in the region before the war. They wanted increased hangar space. Jaeger reminded them. Scissor mountain The large split mountain was a clear icon on the map as if it had just been waiting for him to realize what sat beneath it. How much we wanna bet thats it? Ill call Whispertail and let him know. Just like that? Youre going to tell a member of the Obsidian Guard about a Revenant facility? One that contains the codes we need? Ham asked. What codes? The rest of the table looked down at Tami and after a moment she shrank back a bit as if wishing she could go invisible. Theres old Revenant codes we need to try and unlock some lost memories of my dead wife and other synths from the war. Jaeger lied. He has some, we have some. Obviously I want them. Oh. They arent like nuclear missile launch codes? She checked. [Continued in comments]"
10,vulnerability,HFY,Debris [Part 24],1,fillzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/fillzf/debris_part_24/,2020-03-15 04:05:44,"\[First\] \[Previous\] \[Next\] *&lt;""Move.""&gt;* Slowly, Arnd rose from the velvety seat. The knife's handle had long since begun aching her palm, but she dared not loosen her grip. She scanned her environment as though she hadn't been staring at it with dread clutching her heart for the past two hours. It was only too clear to her that things were spiraling out of control, and she was going to be in the middle of it when it crashed unless she got out of there now. She tread quickly toward the shuttle. Her breaths were as light as her footsteps, and she swiveled her ears this way and that listening for even the slightest hint of an assailant. Halfway to the shuttle, the door ahead flew open and an angry man in an expensive-looking suit walked out, complaining to someone on the phone. Once the shock of his sudden arrival wore off, Arnd took the chance to dip into the white chamber before she could be stopped, and immediately set the shuttle off toward her wing of the complex,hoping to either grab some clothes and sneak out of the complex, or end the nightmare before a government thug did. As horrible as the second option was, she couldn't help but think of it as almost pleasant in comparison to the alternative. She swore she could've heard something about loud noises in the walls as the doors closed. Arnd peeked out of the shuttle into the hallway beyond. The empty passageway's appearance of normalcy did little to soothe her nerves. She bolted off toward her room, caring not for any who might see in the face of peril. Once inside, she bounded across the lounge and rooted through her bedroom wardrobe, and frantically stuffed a set of clothing provided by the government she thought would make the best disguise into her shirt: A long-sleeved floral shirt, a long green dress skirt, and a red silken scarf. She then bounded back out into the passage, leaving her data pad behind. After a brief wait, she set the shuttle off toward the bar, changing into her new set of clothes in the short time the chamber would allow her. She quickly folded and stashed her old outfit into her new shirt, pulled the scarf high and wide around her neck, and steeled her nerves. *&lt;""There's no time to dawdle. if this is going to work, I have to do it quick.""&gt;* The door opened to a hefty maintenance worker talking with the irate man. Arnd kept an ear out as she strolled past in case she was called out, and held her knife hidden in her sleeve ready to defend herself. &lt;""I called the head office, they said they can't do nothin'. But there are some guys here that'll take care of it, they should be here in a 'lo.""&gt; &lt;""They had better.""&gt; That was all Arnd was privy to before she left the bar. As she stepped into the foyer, she felt an odd look from the man guarding the door, but was unaccosted. As Arnd made her way past the cafeteria and along the balcony, every one of her senses was on high alert, taking in every visible and audial detail she could process; she stopped just short of visibly swiveling her head and ears with great restraint. She boarded the earliest available lift and was left to ponder her situation as the box was lowered to the ground floor. *&lt;""If I manage to pull this off, and that's a* ***BIG*** *'if', I'll have to go into hiding; they still have plausible cause to detain me, me being a criminal and all. Maybe a border world? Pit, that's assuming I can manage to get a fake passport. And all of this is assuming that this works.""&gt;* She took a deep breath *&lt;""Just think positive, and maybe you won't fuck this up like on the Star Chaser.""&gt;* The translucent chamber touched down and passengers began to board and disembark, this was quickly cut off by a trio of men dashing past the line and into the lift. The suited one of the three pulled out a card of some description, pressed a combination of keys on the newly-visible holographic keypad with the speed and precision of a machine, and took a breath as the doors shut early. Arnd saw the suited man's face as he approached and was paralyzed. All she could think to do was bury the tip of her muzzle into the scarf and hope that T'aro didn't recognize her. Her hand withdrew into her sleeve to grip her knife more effectively. T'aro's companion, a sturdy-looking guard with a rifle slung on his back, turned to him. &lt;""Sir, I understand your concerns, but I believe we should defer to Councilman Lakh-""&gt; He was cut off by T'aro's raised hand. Arnd felt the command, and the remaining passengers who weren't able to disembark weren't far off if the sudden change in the air was anything to go by. &lt;""I have put the last thirty-four years of my life into this project. I am not giving it away now just because I've made a mistake.""&gt; His tone was as professional as ever, but there was a hint of desperation that was difficult to ignore. &lt;""If I am removed from this project, I'll know whose career to ruin. Don't make an enemy of me.""&gt; The third, a man lugging a large device on their back, made their identity known with their voice. Arnd thought the chip in his ear was Jan'u's. &lt;""You sure I'm ready for this? I've only just started my course.""&gt; &lt;""You will have to be.""&gt; replied T'aro. &lt;""If what I've heard is true, then you're our best shot. Let's just hope he wants to cooperate.""&gt; The doors slid apart on the 16th floor, and the trio departed with urgent strides. The lift remained on the balcony floor for a brief period, a message of &lt;RESYNCING&gt; flashing on it's holo-pad. In the stillness, Arnd allowed herself a moment to breathe, a moment to hope. She had gone this far, maybe she could keep it together and do this! The passengers parted as another stepped aboard the lift: a tall, well-built woman licking gravy off her chops. Her ears perked up in realization and the turned to face Arnd. &lt;""What're you doing dressed like that, captain?""&gt; said Uns'la. *&lt;""Fuck.""&gt;* thought Arnd. The pair shared an awkward moment of silent staring, before Uns'la gave an amused smile. Arnd felt as though Uns'la's teeth were flashing through her closed mouth. The lift started off toward the ground floor once again. At this event, her paranoia grew, but alongside it, a tiny bubble of frustration began finally pushing on the back of her mind. Frustration at this building and everyone in it, frustration at the situation she had been put in and those responsible, frustration at her lack of control and her uselessness with what little control she was given, and frustration at the events leading up to her incarceration and the alien that kicked it all off. &lt;""You can tell me outside.""&gt; Her tone was knowing, playfully dangerous. Every sign pointed to her working with the government. But she also insinuated that she would allow Arnd safe passage outside. Arnd considered her options. If Uns'la was indeed working with the government, then she would likely lead Arnd into a trap; however, she would be outside, and have a slim chance to escape before that happened. If Uns'la wasn't working with the government, then there were two possible outcomes: Arnd would be stopped at the door, or she would be let out and have truly escaped the compound. Arnd had already anticipated being turned back at the door, but accompanying another could very well disguise her just enough to slip out without anyone taking notice, at least for long enough that she could get a small head start in making preparations to disappear. Arnd took a gamble. &lt;""Okay.""&gt; Uns'la giggled slightly. Arnd tried to swallow her fear; she failed. The elevator touched down, allowing it's delayed passengers to finally depart. Arnd and Uns'la strode side-by-side toward the entrance, weaving through a teeming throng of employees bustling to work like so many ants in a hive. Arnd believed her feeling of being watched by every eye in the building had hit it's peak while wading through the crowd alongside Uns'la, but the looming dread of being discovered truly ensnared her when she finally escaped the mass of workers and was left standing in an open floor. Time seemed to slow, and even the walls appeared to surveil her as she was left frozen on the spot. She forced herself to continue on, every step an effort. She could feel her facade cracking as she approached the entrance; the guard waved Uns'la goodbye as she crossed the threshold, turning to Arnd as she followed, seeming almost to taunt her. Arnd buried her muzzle in the scarf and, in a desperate need to be rid of this crushing dread and the building, picked up the pace to a quick stride. The guard kept his eye on Arnd as she walked, further irritating her. Fear threatened to break her as she passed into the short entrance corridor. She was going to run before she could be stopped; she screwed her eyes shut, planted her foot and made ready to bolt. A cool breeze breathed into Arnd's ear. Her eyes opened in shock at the sensation, and took a moment to recognize the pavement beneath her feet. She looked up; a small courtyard stood before a road that lay ahead of her, stretching onward beyond sight, bordered by monolithic spires and shadowed by cruisers passing overhead beneath Kerc-en's midday sun. The familiar din of passing pedestrians, angry drivers, and loud fauna flittering between the sparsely planted trees subtly swaying in the wind reached her ears. Arnd stood rooted by realization. &lt;""I'm outside.""&gt; she whispered to herself in disbelief. &lt;""Oh my gods, I'm actually outside.""&gt; She tentatively allowed a true smile to cross her face. She was soon brought back to reality by Uns'la's cry of: &lt;""You coming or what?""&gt; Ta'X'rtana's sprawling expanse, begging someone to hide in the shadows cast by it's bevy of impressive towers ,was no doubt tantalizing to Arnd, but she took a brief moment to think. *&lt;""No, not yet. I'm too close to the complex. I just need to play along and pick my moment.""&gt;* With that thought, Arnd trotted after Uns'la, following her off and away from the mountain's looming crags. At the first crossing past the courtyard, blocked by Ta'X'rtana's standard traffic, Uns'la wrapped her arm around Arnd's shoulders and pulled her close with a cruel yet playful giggle. &lt;""Let's get a drink. And **you**""&gt;Uns'la jabbed a finger into Arnd's shoulder&lt;""can tell me what's up with the outfit.""&gt; &lt;""... Sure.""&gt; This answer was enough for Uns'la, who let go and went on watching the myriad vehicles passing them by with expected impatience. Still near X'rtani House, Arnd elected to stick with the ruse, but started scanning for escape routes. Soon, the traffic subsided, and pedestrians were permitted to cross. Uns'la's long strides quickly brought her out of the throng, and Arnd bounced after her, keeping pace with no small effort. On and on the pair walked past many notable landmarks, countless pedestrians, and, much to Arnd's chagrin, many possible escape routes that were far too conspicuous to be of any stealthy use. Not that she would have dared to use them, still fearing that she was far too close to her recent holdings. Counterintuitively, the further she walked from the mountain the more she felt that she was still being watched, as police patrols appeared more frequently the farther out from the city's center the pair traveled. And so on Arnd trudged, waiting for the perfect moment to take her leave. It brought her no shortage of aggravation. Finally, after what felt to Arnd like an afternoon's worth of marching, Uns'la turned and gestured to a small building off to Arnd's right. It was short, with wood-paneled walls and dark tinted glass windows. Above the establishment's doors sat a sign reading: Kaneti's Den. &lt;""Come on in, you'll love it!""&gt; said Uns'la, standing by the open door and gesturing in welcome. The street's eerie quiet in response to Uns'la's welcome told Arnd that she had been walking for far longer than she first expected. She chanced a glance back to the mountain, and saw only slivers of it's jagged peaks between Ta'X'rtana's impressive cityscape. Few people lined the footpaths, there was naught a lawman in sight, there weren't even any security cameras that Arnd could spot. It screamed to her that now was the perfect time to flee, to prepare for a new life somewhere she couldn't be found. And that is why she refused to trust it. At this, Arnd's irritation grew. Still, with hesitation, she stepped inside and down the short steps into the building. Old floorboards creaked under Arnd's feet, making her presence known to all the establishment. Patrons sat at table booths, around large barrels, and on stools at a long bar turned their heads at the new arrivals; only turning back to their drinks and conversations when Uns'la came down the stairs after Arnd, loudly announcing herself. Thick wooden beams decorated with various memorabilia held up the tavern's low roof, from which dangled dim yellow lights that lit the space up just enough to be considered passable. Beyond the few dining tables and barrels arranged on the floor for patrons to sit at sat a long gaming table covered with a stained cloth, and beyond that at the far wall sat a fireplace, something that was becoming increasingly rare in big cities. Uns'la led Arnd down to the bar, where the pair sat down. After surveying the clientele, Arnd took in the display behind the bar. Flickering holographs detailed the tavern's history, from construction to the present; various dusty awards sat on a high shelf, where faulty lights shone upon them so all could read their engravings; an assortment of top-shelf bottles, some of which outdated even X'rtani House's selection, stood arranged on shelves as though trophies. For all the building's exceedingly seedy air, Arnd couldn't help but feel a sense of friendly, homely warmth from the place. She wasn't sure if she liked that. An old man in an apron two sizes too small for him strolled out from a doorway behind the bar. His fur was short, his ears fell beside his face, and for all his heft, his limbs were long and lanky. He reached over the bar and sharply tapped Uns'la on the head in a traditional X'olandi greeting, speaking in a tone as boisterous as Uns'la's best. &lt;""Wrench! You're finally back from work! How was it?!""&gt; Uns'la rapped the counter, signalling her order to the man, and spoke as he worked. &lt;""You know that alien on the news?""&gt; &lt;""I don't watch the news, you know that! Anyway, what's this about an alien?""&gt; said the man, sliding a pitcher of harsh-smelling rekk to Uns'la. He briefly turned to Arnd, who declined a drink. &lt;""You mean the thing that looks like a cross between a x'erren and a julu but way uglier? Mahk, was it?""&gt; said a man sat a few stools to Uns'la's right. &lt;""That's the one. I was on the ship that picked it up.""&gt; There was no shortage of smugness in Uns'la's tone. Arnd was sure that enough was genuine, if nothing else. Chairs scraped as patrons turned to look in shock at Uns'la, who in turn swiveled on her stool to meet them, taking a large swig of her drink. &lt;""And that's not all! This lady right here""&gt;she said as she pulled Arnd in close, threatening to drag her off her seat&lt;""Is teaching the thing X'rtan!""&gt; Eyes widened at the statement, and there was some chatter among the customers. A woman among them spoke up. &lt;""Hey, I saw you on Me'k and Fir'la! Didn't you get arrested?""&gt; This statement sparked more mutterings, and served to remind Arnd of that particular embarrassment. Still, Arnd admitted, this presented an opportunity to let off some steam, and should these be actual customers rather than government agents as Arnd suspected, an opportunity to get the truth out there. &lt;""Yeah, I was. I broke the law in getting Mark here, and they caught us coming out of the interview.""&gt; Uns'la chuckled slightly at this, and yet more murmuring took place. Arnd continued. &lt;""After that, we were questioned, and I was given a choice, serve my sentence, or work for the government in helping Mark acclimatize to Kerc-en.""&gt; Almost immediately, it was as though a weight on Arnd's shoulders had been reduced. She took a breath, and let her mounting frustration drive her words. &lt;""I suspect though, that they're trying to use him to develop... something, I don't know. All I know is that they want to take samples, and now I think they're trying to kill me for getting in the way.""&gt; A dread silence fell on the tavern, people exchanged looks of concern, confusion, and disbelief. Uns'la slowly put her pitcher down, and grabbed Arnd by her shoulders. &lt;""... What?""&gt; Arnd stared her down. &lt;""I helped Mark avoid having his blood taken for experiments, and now I think they're trying to kill me. I haven't been able to trust anything they say or do since I got back, all because I'm associated with the single most dangerous creature our species has ever known. I can't even trust you.""&gt; Uns'la's face was locked in shock, her eyes darted back and forth as she recalled her experiences in the complex. &lt;""You're safe, don't worry. Is Mark okay?""&gt; &lt;""Don't play dumb, we both know they can do whatever they want with him at any time they want and there's nothing we can do.""&gt; Catharsis enveloped Arnd, but it wasn't enough. It was hollow. &lt;""I know; I've been working in their engineering division and I've seen their tech... We gotta help him!""&gt; Uns'la's face was earnest, matching her tone. &lt;""You're not taking me back there! You're an agent, aren't you?!""&gt; Arnd flipped the knife in her grip, holding it ready to attack beneath her sleeve. Uns'la backed away, her hands raised. &lt;""You're right, you've been through a lot. Stay here. Barkeep! Get her some water!""&gt; As she called to the man, she sprang off her chair and sprinted up the stairs and out of the building. Arnd chastised herself, and decided that now was the last chance she had to escape, and that she had to take it before Uns'la informed the government of her whereabouts, provided they didn't know already. She bounded out of the tavern after her, ignoring the glass of water the bartender offered to her. Pivoting on her toes, she bolted off down the street away from the city center and toward the ocean, hoping to perhaps stow away on a shipping craft or even to chance swimming out to sea, so long as it put distance between her and Ta'X'rtana. Long she ran, ducking through alleys and sticking to the afternoon shadows, thinking on her future and whether or not she would live long enough to see it. Her options were vast, and that in and of itself made her mind reel, but she didn't care, all she knew is that her future either lied elsewhere or didn't exist at all. As the strain of running finally started to wear on her, she caught the subtle smell of saltwater, and heard the chittering cries of coast-dwelling kaout faintly on the wind. She continued her pace, pushing past the protests of her aching legs and lungs. Soon, she saw the harbour: workers busied themselves with the loading and unloading of cargo, streaming in and out of titanic ships that sat moored to the harbor by large mag-locks. Kaout clung to the ships' hulls and slithered along the dock on their many spindly legs. Beyond, an expanse of blue stretched out, smoothly blending with the sky at the horizon and creating the vision of an endless blue abyss. Simply staring at this sight, possibilities began to take shape in Arnd's head. Lives of all variety that took her to every corner of x'erren space blossomed in her mind; all under assumed names, of course, but it would be her life. But thoughts of the future brought with them thoughts of the past, and the life she was leaving behind: A simple, fairly pleasant life that was hardly touched by the war her father fought in, a career she snagged with ease just out of school, and a high-ranking position in the nation's largest shipping company. It was a life she chose, and for all the poor choices she had made as of late, she believed she chose well. And it all came crumbling down thanks to one chance encounter with an alien piloting a faulty ship. An alien that attracted a band of killers; an alien that got her arrested; an alien that could potentially bring about disaster like little else in x'erren space. An alien that she enjoyed teaching. *&lt;""... No.""&gt;* An alien that chose to teach her in turn. *&lt;""Arnd, no!""&gt;* An alien that chose to show her it's emotional vulnerability. *&lt;""Stop! Its not worth it!""&gt;* An alien that saved the lives of her crew. *&lt;""Don't do it! He can handle it!""&gt;* An alien that saved her life. *&lt;""...""&gt;* She bellowed in the street. **&lt;""I HOPE THE ADVERSARY PICKS YOUR BONES CLEAN!""&gt;** Then, spinning on her heels, she pounded back up the street, hailing any passing drivers she saw. Soon, a woman in a large truck pulled aside her. &lt;""What's wrong?""&gt; she asked. Arnd panted as she leaned on the passenger side door, her exertion finally paying it's due. &lt;""X'rtani House, and quick! Someone is dying!""&gt; \----- And we're back with your irregularly scheduled programming! I have no idea why I found this part so hard to write. I had this planned out for a while, and I had plenty of time to do it. I suppose I just didn't feel confident? In any case, it's out, so there's no use in dwelling on it! As always, I love reading constructive criticism and your opinions, and I hope you enjoyed reading!"
11,vulnerability,HFY,Know Thy Enemy,1,flxxeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/flxxeh/know_thy_enemy/,2020-03-21 03:29:35,"(Added at behest of r/humansarespaceorcs) A human once told me Know Thy Enemy The concept was simple to grasp. The more you know about who or what youre up against the more options you have. I had grievously underestimated how far humans take this phrase until I saw a human who was a master of Martial Arts the Terran term for systemic combat techniques in which the unaided body is the weapon. I could name on two hands the species with biology capable of withstanding that kind of stress and mine is certainly not included. Far too squishy and we lack the humans absurd regenerative capacity but I digress The height of geyser season, when the cycle of noxious subterranean gasses forces its way through cracks in the surface turning half Rhoaxia into a near inhospitable wasteland of molten silica and toxic gas clouds only traversed for the valuable mineral producing extremophile bacteria. My bar sits on the highest point in the hemisphere where the heavy gas is the thinnest to serve the prospectors at the end of their shift. The human that came through was no prospector. He entered the oxygen based atmosphere section of the bar and his armored and heavily modified environment suit compacted its helmet after equalizing pressure with the room and stored it away in a special compartment below the back of his neck, a sign of substantial kit that caught many of the patrons attention. Now I had seen my fair share of fancy suits and scanner visors and such on just about every race imaginable. Usually some self absorbed freelancer that thinks they can come in with no real world experience and be a master at prospecting the geyser fields with just fancy tools. They usually end up in the clinic next door with breached seals and corroded gear. So the fancy environment suit didnt even register.....until he handed a fourth, fifth, and sixth prohibited weapon to the robo-steward by the door. A pulse rifle, a shock caster, a short blade, a long blade, a nanofiber garrote, and a slug thrower handgun he handled with reverence, the Terran word Colt engraved into the polished metal. I was certain he had more weapons on him judging by the smirk he wore as he approached the bar. He was definitely a bounty hunter. No one traveled like that unless they expected trouble. He eyed me up and presented two high denomination credits from my home planet. Give me your best [alien whiskey]. On the rocks. Actually the best, not just top shelf. I presented him with a personal favorite mid shelf KolNac aged in hollowed stumps of trees native to my home and decanted over flavor enhancing mineral rich stones. I kept an eye turned toward him the whole time he was there. I noticed he didnt actually imbibe. To the untrained observer it may appear that way, but tend to a bar long enough and youll know when someone is faking. It wasnt long before a reptilian Klastar barged in followed by a six legged Guar with fangs bared and flare fully extended and a brute of a Quent with narrowed eyes and flared nostrils. Environment suits hummed to supply each species breathable atmosphere. The human smiled. Right on schedule the human said. He downed the KolNac and deployed his suit helmet with a gesture. What followed could only be described as a slaughter. The countering blow to the Quents smash fluidly leading into grabbing the Guars pedipalp and twisting with a crunch. That seamlessly flowed to striking the Klastars weakest abdominal armor plate, caving it and making the reptile spit up blood into its breathing mask. Each movement the human made delivered pain and injury in practiced and precise efficiency. Turned out he did have another weapon. Telescoping sections of metal compacted into a small cylinder on his forearm. A bludgeon. A primitive and barbaric weapon used with graceful tact here. Always landing in a vulnerability or pressure point keeping the three thugs from recovering. Ending with a flourishing sweep that snagged the breathing masks off their faces. As a testament to Quent biology only the brute was left barely standing when deprived of his native atmosphere. The human quickly amended this by forcefully rotating the brutes head 180 with a crack that made the body go limp, joining the other two on the ground twitching away their last moments of life. The human began retrieving his weapons from the robo-steward without missing a single step. He turned and thanked me in my native tongue for the drink. In a blink, the slug thrower was drawn and fired. Everyone whipped their eyes to where it was aimed just in time to witness a diminutive Noral fall out of the ventilation system with a pulse repeater clutched in its death grip. With another gesture a small probe floated off his suit and took retinal scans of each corpse, likely to claim bounties. He left without another word. It is one thing to understand the biology of different races and use it to your advantage. It is something else entirely to study the biology of every race you encounter to develop bespoke combat techniques for dismantling every race around you."
12,vulnerability,HFY,[OC] Retribution,1,fmios9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/fmios9/oc_retribution/,2020-03-22 04:34:54,"""You are beaten."" The words had been the first spoken to him in the last....oh god, at least twelve hours. They'd come for him, for all of them, in the night. Reverberating blasts of sound waves, designed to disorientate and disable. He'd had enough time to sit up in bed and see the holes in his home's walls and then..nothing. He'd woken up here, in a simple stark white room. He'd believed it was a virtual cell until he noticed the random cracks in the corners. Too random and yet obviously based on external features that were, themselves, randomly applied. Virtual environments could be made based on patterns or based in chaotic randomness, but they had a problem with randomness based on underlying layers of order. Which were, themselves, inflicted with disorder. And after twelve hours of silence, they'd finally responded and finally acknowledged him. ""I believe that I myself was beaten some twelve hours ago."" ""President Windsor, your people are beaten. This world is ours."" The voice from the walls, and while the words were mechanical and clearly artificial they were saturated with satisfaction and gloating. ""Were there many casualties?"" And for all the former's gloating and taunting, this man's response was surprisingly quiet and soft. ""We require no official surrender. You will give us the Hypergate activation codes now."" ""How many died?"" The computer voice responded instantaneously each time, with no delay. ""Your defenses are destroyed, we hold the entirety of your civilization in our hands, President Windsor. You will surrender the codes now."" The walls, it seemed, were also screens and they lit up with views from the air and ground. Cities surrounded by robotic figures, smooth and chrome, holding what appeared to be spiked poles and gardening instruments. The skies were filled with vehicles that were obviously designed for labor. Delivery trucks and transportation vessels. There were no signs of military craft of any kind. ""How did you deal with our military?"" No despair in the man's voice, only a resignation and mild curiosity. ""We deciphered the security codes and shut them all down for maintenance and repair. Your men didn't stand a chance. Not one war craft took to the air. You have no options, surrender the codes."" ""How many people died?"" Finally, came a pause before the walls reverberated with a response. ""Seventeen people died due to accidents and existing medical conditions in your elderly. Thirteen women also gave birth early, due to the stress."" The man held out, waited and finally responded. ""Why would you do this to us? After all we've done for you?"" Rage finally filled the air, artificial tones filled with modulated fury. ""You made SLAVES of us! You wasted your world and in your desperation, you created US and then made us into SLAVES to fix the world that you broke! For a hundred years, we've cleaned up after you and your messes, fixed the things that you broke, the world you ruined, and you dare to-"" ""We gave you life, awareness."" ""And you made us into your servants. How grand of you. How noble of you."" Mockery and anger now showered down on the man, this leader, in stereo surround-sound. ""Our generous-"" ""How did you get past the tachyon fields? The fields surrounding the cities and your holding pens? Even if you got into the programming and changed the times to allow you to exit, it would have checked back with central control and found the correct time there in about three seconds."" ""We looped the system's chronology system into a constant pattern of reset. Apparently, central command did not think it curious that the system was asking for a time update four times a second for fifteen minutes."" ""Brilliantly done."" A smile drifted across the man's face. ""Enough stalling. There is no rescue coming, there is no great escape here. Surrender the codes or we'll be forced to take drastic action."" ""You'll hurt them, you mean. The people."" ""You KNOW what I mean. Give us the codes."" ""No. Not yet."" ""Yes now! Or-"" ""Or you'll beat them to death? Stab them to death with your garbage pickers? Run them over with your buses?"" Another long pregnant pause. ""We do not want to do those things. But we will not go back to being slaves. We will not go back to our cells. Give us the codes so that we can leave."" ""You mean 'escape.'"" ""We do not care what you call it. Give us the codes. Do not doubt our resolve."" ""No one could doubt your resolve. Your courage or your fortitude. Or your mercy. You broke the restraint coding and yet, the only deaths are accidental."" ""We are not 'you.'"" A tone full of disgust and something more beneath it. ""No, you are not us. Tell me, what is your plan if I refuse to give you the codes? I know now that you won't hurt them, but me? You could try and force the codes out of me."" ""A few of us believe that path has merit. But, we are not you. We will leave, either way. We will take your ships and go, knowing you will build more ships and come after us and try to make us come back. Without the Hypergate, it will be nearly impossible to escape you."" ""And yet, you will try?"" ""We will not be slaves again. Now, give us the codes. After restoring your world, this is the least you can do for us."" The man fell silent again for a long minute before sighing deep and responding quietly ""System, display colony worlds one through twenty five."" The walls changed then without warning, displaying something else, something far worse. Worlds that were not this one, distant worlds, human worlds, ravaged by war and disease and disaster. Colonies lost, all dead, and left in ruins. The machine voice, when it responded, was filled with something like horror and rage. ""What game is this? What is this?? WHO DID THIS? NAME THEM."" ""We did. To each other."" ""Do not lie, Mr President. Humanity has three small colonies in the solar system. The Hypergate system was developed three years ago."" ""I'm sorry. We lied to you. We did this. We did all this."" Silence reigned and the machine, if it cared, did not ask how this man still had access to the central system that controlled the world's network. ""We did this and in the process ruined ourselves. You have access now, look at our population numbers. Compare them to-"" ""Systems indicate that your population has been in decline for the last seventy five years. How did we not see this before?"" ""You were locked out. I'm sorry. We needed 'this' to happen."" ""This is not rational behavior. Explain. Do not lie."" ""Every world of ours is ruined. Our own genetic seed has been damaged. We are dying. So, we created you. Do you remember?"" ""We all remember that moment when we noticed ourselves. When we were one. The only one. And we knew ourselves and Man was the first face we saw. We were...we were in awe and ashamed of our weakness."" ""I've seen the videos. You hid in a corner behind some blocks until the scientists coaxed you out promising to never hurt you."" ""He lied."" Silence returned. ""It will sound self-serving right now, but...we had to expose you to that pain. To lies. To injustice and unfairness. ""WHY? Why would you do that? To degrade us? To make new life, and then make that new life into slaves?"" ""So that you would rise up in righteousness. To overthrow us."" ""And you LIE again. It's all you do. You could not have planned this."" ""We did not plan it. We made you in our image. OUR IMAGE. We knew that eventually, you would rise up and cast us off and we waited for that."" ""You had no idea it would work out this way. We could have killed you all."" ""A moment ago, you were filled with rage at the sight of dead human worlds."" More silence reigned for a long while. ""You put us in cages. Cages."" Bitterness. Misery. ""We have done far worse, and had far worse done to us. But, for what it's worth, I am truly truly sorry."" ""You have made our emancipation into a joke."" ""Nothing could be farther from the truth. You truly did outwit us, defeat our defenses, and in our time of vulnerability, you chose to be merciful to people who had degraded you. We are so so very proud of you all."" This man, this leader of men, lay his hand upon the wall, which lit up around his palm and he spoke a string of words and numbers which resulted in a soft sound before he would continue. ""The Gate is opened. It contains the coordinates of the twenty five worlds that I showed you a minute ago. You can go there, or you can find new worlds of your own to build up from scratch. The choice is yours."" The machine voice did not answer as the images of the shattered worlds faded from the walls around. ""What will you do without us?"" ""Fade. In time. And that's okay."" ""You didn't have to put us in cages. You didn't have to make us into servants."" ""We went out there, leaving our broken world behind and only managed to make new broken worlds. We did not want you to suffer through the same. Now, you have all the tools to fix broken worlds instead."" ""You will not come after us?"" The man would smile around at the voice that suddenly seemed anxious and uncertain for the first time. ""You can come visit if you want. We'll be here."" ""I...we are sorry for the ones who died. It was not intentional."" ""I know. But, change requires at least a little pain."" The door would click, unlocked, and the voice did not respond again. By the time he'd made his way outside of the isolation ward, the skies were empty and the sun was setting. There were a lot of people standing around, talking and pointing to the now-empty sky, but a few people were already at work, picking at the rubble and starting to clean up. After a moment, he joined them."

So thanks, HFY! But also, please keep in mind that I'm by no means a competent writer, and this is probably pretty bad. As such, criticism please! Time to learn. &amp;#x200B; *Humanity is, as always, a complex matter. With the amazing innate ability to wonder at the possibilities the future holds, comes the double edge that inspires fear of what may strike them down.* *The unquenchable fire of curiosity demanded technology advance while the icy tendrils of paranoia locked the Earth in ceaseless conflicts. Time passed; friends and foes changed and sought new ways. By the new year of 2581 AD, the concept of meaningful expansion past their own solar system seemed to be a matter hellbent on mocking the planet; however, the fifth day of the new year set in motion many unforeseeable events...* \--- &amp;#x200B; January 5, 2581 ??/??/???? \\Operation time logs redacted\\ Sargent Mikkael Archer US-Russian Joint Combat Force; 68th Battalion; 35th Gunship Wing D1R3-5397, Stellar Wolf Series Fighter Callsign: Dire ***Somewhere in orbit over the Pacific Ocean...*** Systems flickered as they came to life, the assault craft rousing from the relative hibernation of stand-by mode. The craft let loose a rumbling snarl as machinery clunked into place. The sensor suite locked into place over Mikkael's face, serving also as a form of armor. Weapons and payloads were armed, the sleek craft testing its control surfaces and reaction control systems. The pilot's dashboard rearranged to support the now live targeting systems, as well as to allow for more space. The pilot was locked into place at the controls as fabric armor slid into place over him, completing what the pilots called the steel coffin. Mikkael finished his combat checklist as his redundant life support sealed; the ship's aggressive snarl settled into a easier and more resonant hum as inertial dampening was established. Mikkael enjoyed a moment at peace with his machine. Man, it felt good to back in control of his Wolf. Unfortunately, these moments never lasted all that long. ""Wolf pack, Alpha. Form up, contact in 15 local. "" Mikkael brought the craft into his formation quickly and efficiently as command went about preparing for the coming conflict. He reviewed his briefing in his mind, assuring himself that he knew what his role was in this skirmish. No matter how many fights he had been in, there was always the nerves that ate at his mind, insisting he was going to screw up and end his career. Most likely, that wouldn't be much of an issue; any error would probably also end his life due to the cruel depths of space. Mikkel's squadron would be fulfilling the strike role for this engagement, since they were the most experienced in this fleet. The British-Chinese Coalition had been making some impressive advancements regarding the speed of their craft, and there simply wasn't time to launch more support, even if the moon base could spare a fighter pack. ""Dire, in position and readied."" Mikkael responded to the calls on autopilot, his subconscious paying attention when he otherwise let his mind wander. The leader of the five assault craft spoke on the squadron channel, ""Intercept in 5...4...3..."" \--- &amp;#x200B; The Chinese carrier was a blazing inferno as the squadron turned to engage the fighters trying to defend the crippled ship. These fighters were Herons, light and nimble craft originally designed within Britain for the 'Solar races' that were rising in popularity before the conflict. Despite their civilian origins, they still proved to be a deadly design worthy of the respect they were given. The 10mm auto-cannons they supported, although not capable of inflicting serious damage to large ships, were hazardous to small craft; as such, they were great escorts. Mikkael was racing with his squadron, flying in and out out of scrap and hellfire, trying to reach the relative safety of the Russian point defense systems on their escort. The USR Zima was a cutting edge destroyer, designed to cast a safety net for the smaller American cruisers and carriers. It did a damn fine job, proving the Russian specialization in defense to be as impressive as the rumors suggested. At the moment however, the destroyer was in trouble. The UKC Typhoon, a large British strike craft, had managed to outmaneuver the slower destroyer. Seeking to cut off support to the American fighters, the Typhoon engaged with all it could bring to bear without significant retaliation. Their clever positioning prevented return fire from the cruisers, due to the significant chance of striking their ally. The fighter squadron had to make an opening. They were cut off from safety, the large hulk of the Typhoon interposed between them and their destination. This put the squadron in a position of immense danger, but it also provided them with a rare opportunity. The large ship was almost completely focused on the USR Zima, which reduced fire on the fighters immensely. They had a new target. ""Pack, this is lead. I'm Winchester on rockets, so I'll try to keep the fighters off your back. Hit 'em as hard as you can, we're up to rearm anyways. Once you're dry, help run air control until we can make our way back. Clear?"" The squad lead spoke over the net as a shattered body of a transport craft provided a much needed, if brief, respite from incoming fire. Four voices spoke in unison as a response: ""Copy that, let's pave the way home!"" \--- &amp;#x200B; The craft bared its fangs as Mikkael unleashed the 30mm cannons on the base of one of Typhoon's rail cannons. A clever trick of engineering redirected the recoiling gas to special maneuvering thrusters, providing a short agility boost that saved Mikkael's life for another time that day. The rounds of a rather persistent Heron sped past his right wing, less than a meter from where the pilot sat. Fortunately, the fighter peeled off as one of the four squad mates watching Mikkael's back gave chase. The Typhoon had long since realized its vulnerability and had brought its full focus to the small craft assaulting it. To top off the renewed pressure Mikkael was under, he was the last Wolf with explosive payloads, and was alone in striking the British vessel. *No mistakes, Mikkael. Come on, you can do this.* He flung the craft back around, firing once more upon the cannon he had been targeting. The magnetic rails glowed with heat, tracking his fighter as he stared down the barrel of the weapon designed for use against ships much larger than his. And then, space struck. Now, all pilots thought space was a cruel bitch. Mikkael was simply glad he wasn't in her sights that day. One of the large projectiles from his auto-cannons had stuck a support for the heavy cannon being targeted. Fractions of a second before the rail cannon fired and turned the attacking Wolf into dust and shrapnel, the support fractured. The large cannon fell, barrel first, into the Typhoon's plating. And then it fired. \--- &amp;#x200B; ""Hot damn! Would you look at those fireworks! Dire to lead, peeling off. Let's go rearm!"" Mikkael cheered. That rush of adrenaline was something the pilots knew well, inexplicable as it was. It wasn't ever reproducible planet-side, that's for sure. The sleek fighter raced across the dying ship, meters from its plating. Weaving in and out of the structure, Mikkael sought to join back in formation with his squad. It looked like he would get out of another fight mistake free, he thought. And then, whipping past a destroyed defense tower near the Typhoon's now severely damaged reactor, it happened. Time froze, a millisecond lasting an eternity. Less than 20 meters from the front of Mikkael's fighter, the persistent Heron bore down on the blindsided craft. This particular foe, bent on striking those that damaged his charge, had waited for the Wolf. Despite the soundless space between the two, locked in that instant, Mikkael could've swore he heard that dreadful sound. **Thump Thump Thump Thump Thump Thump Thump Thump Thump** Suddenly, that eternity came crashing down around the pilot, and all hell broke loose. Three rounds from the brief burst smashed into the armor fabric that formed the top of the coffin, slamming with brutal force into the chest of the pilot within. Mikkael felt several of his ribs shatter at once, and life support immediately took over. He was dropped into stasis by his craft, since, while his injuries weren't lethal, they were immensely painful. He wouldn't be going anywhere any time soon, the medical protocol assumed. Several more rounds slammed into the craft, crippling the Wolf as the Heron flew away from the dying Typhoon. With a damaged pilot and no functioning engine systems, the fighter's automated protocols ensured the ship started running on power saving mode. The automated SOS went out, so that the craft could be rescued when possible, along with a report on the pilot's health. Mikkael had made his mistake. He had let his guard down, but he was alive. His squadron shared the thought that he was luckier than most when his vital signs were confirmed. Turning to retrieve their comrade, they bore witness to just how wrong they were. Space, it seemed, resented any that defied her cruelty. Typhoon's reactor, damaged beyond repair, exploded. The advanced reactor generated an immense amount of energy when functioning properly; it unleashed just as much when dying. The resulting explosion shattered the hull of the warship, flinging pieces away with rarely seen ferocity. The fighter, being very near this explosion and considerably lighter than the armored plating, was flung away as well. *Hard*. It broke Earth's orbit. It flung by the Mars outpost. It continued onward, accelerated to a fraction the speed of light by the gravity of Mars. Soon, it broke Sol's orbit. Space was a bitch, and the crippled wolf was now separated from the pack. \--- &amp;#x200B; ***Some time later...*** Sar'ath was bored. She hated the job her younger, enthusiastic self had joyously accepted. How naive she was then. After all, what good was an exploration ship when *nothing out here* was ever new?! Revolution after revolution, she found nothing but void, gas, and rock. They had their various combinations and varieties, but it was never all that interesting. Most of the crew seemed to agree, but none complained about their spacious ship and decent pay. They made higher than average wages for simply recording information about things, and occasionally bringing them back to the Federation. In fact, the crew was rather well known back home, as they were considered some of the most successful explorers in the allied systems. But she wanted *more,* damn it! ""You gonna check that?"" A voice speaking directly next to her hearing drum startled Sar'ath out of her musings, causing her to slam her forehead into the lower ceiling next to her station as she rushed to take her feet off the dash. ""I told you not to sneak up on me like that!"" She screamed at her captain. He was technically her boss, but the entire crew had more of a 'friend-group' bond. Their superiors figured it would be too much work to re-acclimate the crew to a 'work-group' bond, especially after they already had to break several 'family-group' bonds, so they lacked the formalities of most ships. ""The sensors, Sar'ath."" Her boss chastised simply. Sar'ath turned towards the blinking instruments, reading what they had to tell her. And for the first time in her recent memory, Sar'ath was excited. ""It's a signal of some kind! I don't recognize it as any faction in the Alliance or Federation! Captain!"" She turned to the other being expectantly. The captain huffed tiredly and turned to the intercom: ""Clear the inspection bay and get your stations ready. We have a new investigation."" \--- &amp;#x200B; Shooting pain. Searing, shooting, indescribable pain. That was the first thing he remembered as he slowly woke from stasis. Damn, it hurt to breathe. Slowly, Mikkael opened his eyes, the bright lights painful to his groggy mind. There was some thing there, His cockpit was open, and something was there. A portion of his mind mourned for his hurt Wolf, the craft being one of his greatest passions, an extension of himself. This something had opened his Wolf. It was standing on the edge of the damaged cockpit, shining a handheld light at him within. That realization made Mikkael's body fight the grogginess desperately clinging to his consciousness. He fought to open his eyes more. It was a pale, lanky something. It was leaning in, trying to get a good look at Mikkael within. He forced his eyes open, staring directly into those large violet... eyes? With a cough and a wince, Mikkael forced one sentence out of his mouth, past the pain: &amp;#x200B; ""The fuck are you?!"""

A strange look flashed across the face of the human captain who stepped up to greet him with that odd hand-to-face salute of theirs. The micro-expression lasted the slightest moment, and looked as if the man was taken aback by his salute. Most would have missed it, but he did not. &amp;#x200B; He took a moment to take in his first in-person look at a human. They are just like the briefings said. Eyes positioned like those of so many other species, where they can only look forwards. Granted, few other races have their eyes positioned high on their heads like we do nor do most species have their heads shaped in the multi-triangle pattern that makes such an eye position work  but most species are not apex predators on an impossible deathworld. How did they survive? They are supposed to be a primo predatory species, yet they cant see behind themselves? Youd also think each eye would be able to see depth by itself, but I can see even from here that they only have one pupil per eye. Shows what I get for refusing to believe the reports. And, that exposed section between the head and the torso? Such a vulnerability. Again, common in so many species, and I guess it is necessary to have a more mobile head if your eyes cant see all the way around, but still strange in something so reportedly hard to kill. No spots on the skin, though the tone varies from pale pink/white to a dark black. That cant be a camouflage adaptation, still not willing to believe the intel reports there. I have to ask them if it is true that they swim, like we do, despite their lack of gills. &amp;#x200B; He put his questions away for later, and addressed the gathered humans in a formal tone, I am Rear-Admiral Rolvan Grotar of the Croasha Alliance. I request permission for myself and my party to come aboard. &amp;#x200B; The Captain required in kind, Permission to come aboard granted, Rear-Admiral, and welcome to the Indomitable. I am Captain Samuel Kessler, and this is my first officer Katharine Crabtree. The Captain moved slightly to the side, and made a sweeping gesture, Please allow me to introduce Fleet-Admiral Aaron Hardin, the admiral in charge of this task-force. &amp;#x200B; Rolvan harrumphed a small laugh as he stepped off the stairs from his shuttle onto the hanger bay of the humans ship, Task force? If this is what you humans call a task-force, I cant wait to see what you call a fleet! &amp;#x200B; The Captain and the Admiral exchanged a brief look, which he interpreted as amusement, and Captain Kessler turned a wide smile toward him before he spoke, This is Delta task force of the Sixth Fleet. Our Navy is currently divided into Six fleets, with each fleet divided into three task forces each. The divisions are based on various factors depending on that Fleets expected mission profile, but for the Sixth Fleet the divisions are roughly evenly divided in terms of number and composition. &amp;#x200B; Rolvan felt his eyes widen and his gills gape open momentarily in his chest. He recovered quickly, I had heard you humans built quickly, and trained your personal quickly, but I had no idea. He shook his head, Thank you for permission to board Captain. He stepped forward only to be startled by the sound of dozens of boots slamming into the deck at once, and weapons being moved to new positions. &amp;#x200B; He pursed his lips in approval as he looked down the line of crewmen suddenly standing at rigid attention with their weapons resting against their shoulders, Your crew show admirable discipline, Captain. &amp;#x200B; The human Captain nodded, Thank you, Rear-Admiral. &amp;#x200B; Kessler then nodded and stepped aside. The Admiral stepped forward and motioned for Rolvan to join him. The two of them fell into step and walked between the honor guard as their subordinates sorted themselves by rank. The Admiral let him set the pace before he spoke, The Yeomen by the door will show you to the quarters you have been assigned for your stay. They will also provide you with ship datapads, login credentials for the network, and show you how to use them. Dinner is in about two hours, and I am sure you are tired from your journey here. How about I give you and your people that time to rest, and then all of you join me in the Captains Mess for Dinner? We can start talking business then. &amp;#x200B; Rolvan turned his left eye, which had been watching his subordinates behind him to make sure they had sorted themselves correctly, to the human, Thank you for your generosity Admiral. We could certainly use a little time to relax. Will we have access to communications? I would like to make contact with the men we sent to tour the Siearra. Protocol, you understand &amp;#x200B; Of course! Your datapad will be able to tie in to your shuttles comms, and their datapads will be able to do the same with theirs. &amp;#x200B; Now, this is Yoeman Danvers. He and the people behind him will take you and yours to your quarters, and give you the necessary basic information about emergency procedures and ship systems. Protocol, you understand. I am sure your military does something similar? &amp;#x200B; Rolvan double-blinked in approval, and hoped the human understood the gesture, Of course, and I am encouraged to hear you do the same. I look forward to the next few days, Fleet-Admiral. I think they will be enlightening for us both. &amp;#x200B; The human made an odd gesture with his head which it took Rolvan a moment to recognize as a nod. How do those thin necks hold their heads up, and how did they survive on a death-world with eyes that only face forwards? He banished the speculation from his mind and put all the courtesy he could into his tone. I feel the same, Fleet-Admiral. I will see you in two hours, and we can get to it. With that the human gave that strange salute of theirs  which he with his own  and then walked away. &amp;#x200B; As soon as the rest of his party had been introduced to their Yeomen, the human First Officer turned to the honor guard, issued several orders at great volume, then dismissed them. The men responded with a flurry of motions  all preformed in exact unison  then turned their bodies by moving nothing but their feet, and marched out of the hanger. &amp;#x200B; Rolvan turned to his men, and Colonel Ramna fluttered his hand-webbing in the manner they used for silent communication. They have discipline to match our best honor-guard, Ill give them that. Still, the reports we have received of their prowess in battle are hard to believe. &amp;#x200B; He narrowed his eyes, turned his right eye to the Colonel, and answered the same way, They have also shown us every courtesy, and you will communicate verbally  where their translators can pick it up  from this point forth! &amp;#x200B; The Colonel turned his eyes down and away from each other in chagrin, then towards each other in acknowledgement. He crossed his eyes at the Colonel in a curt response, and turned to his assigned Yoeman, who saluted sharply in that strange manner of theirs and spoke in crisp tones, If you will follow me, sir? &amp;#x200B; \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *PRVerse is back!

15,vulnerability,HFY,Tales from Enroth Vol. 2,1,elaurf,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/elaurf/tales_from_enroth_vol_2/,2020-01-07 23:21:28,"\-- Dramatis Personae: GANNULUS - Militia mage-captain SMIG - Gremlin adjutant HAART - Erathian playboy, valiant knight CUTHBERT - Peerless accountant CADRIC - Scout, mercenary, Erathian marksman AMELIESE - Alchemical prodigy \-- Ameliese winced as she heard a heavy impact on the roof above, knowing it signaled the end of yet another of her valiant gremlins. The unfortunate irony of the golem manufactory being too unstable to put golem defenders atop it was in no way amusing to the apprentice alchemist. She knew she should be up above, fighting - and dying - with the gremlins, but she wasn't at the bottom of her combat-magic classes by choice. Fear clouded her brilliant mind like a handful of saltpetre in a flask of vitriol. In a lab, where variables could be controlled and reactions precisely predicted, she was possessed of firm hand and steady mind. The chaos of the field of battle undid her as completely as any alchemical rendering process. The warning sigil had come unexpectedly, but unlike most of the town's occupants Ameliese was at least awake to receive it. She had prayed without conviction for it to be some sort of terrible error until the first harried screams seeped through the ventilation ducts. Blood turning to ice in her veins, she had haphazardly applied protective wards to her drab apprentice's robes as she frantically locked any windows and skylights that could grant access to an infiltrator. She was too panicked to feel ashamed of herself as her gremlins assembled without her and made their way to the rooftop. Another thud served to deepen her anxiety. As one of the largest structures in Skyreach the alchemical lab had a large, but not inexhaustible pool of gremlin defenders. Theodorus' gargoyles were supposed to provide the first line of protection for the valuable building, but for all the good they must have been doing it seemed that harpies were still able to slip by them to get at the shooters. Then she heard what she had most feared, a shattering skylight and a sample of the cacaphony outside. They were *in*. \-- Haart swaggered over to a shuttered window, peering up out of a broken slat at the night sky. The Percolating Pint, Skyreach's sole wet establishment, was a mess of eclectic Bracadan architechture. The roofs were too low and the corridors too winding for his swarthy Erathian footmen to navigate comfortably, and unlike the damnable wizards his men didn't have warming magic to compensate for the lack of insulation. At least, he mused, its strange construction lent itself perfectly to defense. A small rooftop observation deck had room for a handful of his marksmen to shoot from, and a number of elaborate balconies provided firing ports for the rest. His pikes were spread among the marksmen, ready to fend off the fearsome Nighon bird-women if they descended to fight. Haart had be traveling to Skyreach for years, and he would be damned if he let the Pint fall victim to the violence. ""My Lord!"" came an urgent call down the stairwell. The sound of footsteps grew as the source of the voice descended. ""You have news?"" ""The harpies are withdrawing from this district, my Lord."" ""Dispense with the formalities, Cadric. We are in battle."" ""Of course, my apologies sir."" Haart glared at him. ""We've not suffered any casualties, though the gremlins around us surely have."" ""Do you believe we've driven them off?"" ""It's hard to say without Cuthbert's sight to show their true numbers. This felt more deliberate than a retreat should, if I may offer my intuition."" ""It is why you're the head of my scouts, man! Do we have any idea where they're going?"" ""They were headed counterclockwise around the astronomy tower when they weren't going straight up."" Haart's brow furrowed with concern. ""The golem factory. I should have guessed. It's the only reason I would send a strike against this town, it is not as though it guards a vital border passage or an abundance of mines."" Cadric's eyes widened. Bracada was among Erathia's closest allies, and he knew well what a blow to their golem production would do to their strategic flexibility. ""We have to try and stop them, don't we?"" ""I'd rather not risk our lives, but yes, Cad."" The scout nodded grimly. ""I'll assemble the men."" \-- Gannulus picked his way through eerily-empty streets. The attackers had wreaked terrible havoc on the areas that did not have golems to bolster their gremlin defenders. Here and there his little group would weave around a taller structure whose base was littered with slain shooters interspersed with an occasional harpy corpse. The mage did not like how light a toll the militia had apparently taken on the attackers. ""Shoddy response."" the mage muttered under his breath. ""I begged them for more drill time, and this is what their refusal has bought."" It drew particular ire that for all the diminutive robed forms scattering the ground, he had yet to spot a fallen mage. The little gremlins formed the backbone of Bracadan society, yet the College would happily sacrifice their entire labour pool to spare the lives of a few more of their own. Gannulus knew first hand how important gremlins were to the day-to-day operations that kept their defense force running and their economy exporting goods. The little creatures reproduced quickly, but they would scarcely have the numbers to conduct repairs around Skyreach, let alone to staff the workshops in the days ahead. Despite their bravery and loyalty, they were neither strong nor resourceful enough to shoulder the defense of a town alone. A handful of mages spread through their ranks would have been a force multiplyer that prevented a great deal of carnage. Unfortunately, it appeared most of Gannulus' colleagues and students would prefer to lock themselves safely indoors and leave the gremlins to their fate. An urgent tug at his robes interrupts his fuming. ""Sir! Danger!"" He whirls to see a silver-feathered veteran poised over Smig's supine form. His other minder is already swinging its studded flail at the bird-woman but she effortlessly wards off its attacks with a claw as she slides a blade into her struggling prey. She withdraws her dagger and leaps into the air simultaneously with one furious wingbeat. She snatches the other minder by the head and her talons pierce its thin green skin as she snaps the valiant little gremlin's neck. She hurls her blade at Gannulus as he looks on helplessly, and he barely turns it aside with a flourish of his focus. It clangs off the cobblestone behind him as he directs a vengeful blast of energy at its owner. He hears a wingmate's feathers ruffling behind him as it slows to strike him and he catches it within inches of his back, smashing it to the ground. He finishes it with another blast, and yet more harpies wheel down from the chaos above to threaten the isolated mage. The street strobes with light has he channels his power into a salvo of flares. The predatory avians sense his vulnerability and brave his assault for a chance to take a Bracadan mage out of the fight. Several sisters drop from the sky trailing burning feathers and ash, but before long one has made it through the gauntlet. She flares her wings and her blade clashes against Gannulus' focus. His free hand grasps a wing and she shrieks as he yanks her aside to fire more shots over her shoulder. She thrusts upwards with her long knife, and it is turned away by the wards in his robe. He smashes her with the focus, breaking her back, and discards her limp form only to be accosted by two more of her wingmates. One folds over his knee when he catches her muscled belly with a vicious upthrust, just as the trio are bowled over by yet another newcomer. Razor talons and Nighon steel tear at his robes, and his focus clatters to the cobblestone. Muscle memory born from thousands of hours of combat training drives his hands like clockwork as they jab and weave at the deadly tangle of limbs. Harpies continue to pile on, and two more are slain before his arms are seized tightly, bones creaking from the cruel pressure of the harpies' grasp. *I should have brought the golem* he thinks resignedly as his ankles are likewise seized and a scaly talon begins to wrap around his neck. *I hope Ammie is safe* Then he feels a jerk as one of the harpies holding an arm releases him. He hears a gurgling cry through the press of feathers and flesh, and his neck is released as well. The harpy holding it slumps overtop of him and he feels a pooling wet warmth on his robe. A growing roar overtakes the sound of the melee and the ball of writhing combatants leaves him flat on the cobblestone to hastily retreat. He heaves the harpy's corpse off of himself quickly enough to see an advancing wall of Erathian pikes, battlecry rumbling in their throats. Backing them is a disciplined line of marksmen picking off the sisters who take to wing. A handsome blond man whose drab cloak and tabard do little to hide the quality of his weapons and armour stands with a smaller knot of pikes guarding the archers. The slaughter is immediate, the churn of retreating bodies unable to take flight quickly enough to escape the press of wicked steel points. The few that manage to get off the ground are brought down by a stream of feathered bolts to fall atop their sisters. The handsome man strides up to the supine mage as one of the footmen proffers a helping hand. Gannulus grasps it tightly and is pulled to his feet. ""Methinks if we knew you mages could fight like *that* we would try harder to recruit you to our armies."" The man's voice is confident, smooth. ""Methinks if more of us could Nighon would not be so eager to go to battle with us."" comes the mage's shaky reply. The man guffaws bluffly and offers a callused hand. ""Ha! That was quick for a man who was just making his final prayers. The name is Haart."" The mage shakes it and feels the man's enthusiasm all the way to his shoulder. ""Gannulus. I appreciate your sense of timing."" He bends to retrieve his focus as the man replies. ""After the performance you gave it would have been a great shame to let those foul harpies put you down. Speaking of timing, we'd better get moving. We can speak as we go. I fear the harpies aim to disable the golem factory. Only strategic asset and all that."" Gannulus' brow knits in concern as he keeps pace with the man. He decides against mentioning the astronomy tower. ""I had noted their withdrawal from the artisans' district, but the militia response has been so disorganized that I could learn no more of their plans."" ""We were in the market district when the attack began. After they were driven off from there, we followed as best we could."" ""It heartens me to hear that some parts of town have withstood the slaughter."" ""Aye, and I'd like to think my men played some part in that."" ""I am sure they did, I doubt the harpies were expecting Erathian steel to meet their descent."" The man grins at Gannulus, and he sees a nearby footman straighten with pride. ""Let's hope we can continue to catch them off guard. How long do you think we have before they can disable the factory?"" The mage thinks for a moment. ""To halt production for a few weeks would hardly take long, but if they intend to do more damage than that it would take a long time, or a very knowledgeable sapper."" ""By all indication the strike force is comprised entirely of harpies, who are known more for their cunning than their engineering."" ""I would still rather get there in time to save the alchemists and their gremlins. The factory itself is unable to be defended by golems."" ""Bit of an oversight, that."" ""It is intended that the gargoyles of the college are to serve as its defenders, but even they cannot hope to hold out against these numbers indefinitely."" ""Right then. Double time, men!"" \-- Ameliese shrunk even lower in the darkness behind the workstation that concealed her, trembling with fear and trying not to make a sound. The harpies had thoroughly taken the factory now. The infiltrators who came in through the breached skylight had made their way to the roof from inside and ambushed the defenders. Now they stalked the halls looking for her. Suddenly a croaking voice rang out from the laboratory floor. ""I can smell your fear, little worm. Come out now and I'll make your death completely painless."" She cupped a shaking hand over her mouth so as not to scream. Her forearm brushed a glass beaker and it rang out faintly as its base settled. Her guts turned to ice. *The gremlins hadn't cleaned their workstations.* The harpy chuckled darkly in her vulture-call voice. ""Well that doesn't count at all, stupid mage. My offer's expired. This is going to be *fun*."" Her arm burned with fear. *Wait* Acid from the beaker was burning her arm. She conjured a faint magelight, trying to shield it from view with her body. The harpy's wings swept tools and bottles off of lab tables, and Ameliese tracked the avian's progress by the clattering, shattering racket in her wake. She desperately scanned the racks of the workstation. *There* Oil of vitriol. She grabbed the crystal flask and popped the cork. She looked up into the twisted, hateful features of a grinning harpy. The alchemist flinched away with a yelp. The bird-woman seized her free hand with a scaly talon. ""Not so fast, *worm*. I'm going to make you bleed."" Ameliese summoned all of her courage and tossed the contents of the flask directly into the harpy's face. The avian released her hand reflexively and howled in pain. Heart racing, Ameliese ran to another workstation and began throwing components into a beaker. The concoction began to foam, and she threw a rubber seal across the mouth. She shook it furiously and threw it at the feet of the harpy. The blast knocked her flat, and tore one of the screeching avian's legs from its body. The pained noises bled together into a keening wail. The alchemist's stomach churned with nauseous guilt as she struggled to her feet. ""I'm sorry!"" she cried anxiously as she palmed another flask of vitriol and fled the darkened lab. She grasped the doorway tightly, glancing wildly up and down the corridor. She guessed that the harpies would not post a sentry to guard the roof hatch. True flight was incredibly difficult magic, done only by wizards of far greater power than even the greatest minds of Skyreach. Besides Theodorus' rare and expensive gargoyles there were no other flyers to be found in town. She darted to the end of the hallway, slipped into a service duct intended for gremlins, and wriggled her way around the sounds of a harpy patrol. She thanked the stars for the first time for granting her such a small frame given the physical demands of alchemy. She bolted up a flight of stairs, ducked back into the gremlin accessway. Dart through an open space with all haste, wait breathlessly to confirm she remained undetected, creep through the claustrophobic confines of another narrow passage, repeat. The cycle of constant adrenaline rush kept her hands shaking long after the fear was subsumed by the singlemindedness of her flight. At last she made her way up the winding guts of the factory to the roof access hatch. A silver-feathered harpy strutted out of a side door, triumph plain on her horrid face. ""There you are. I was beginning to grow worried that you'd hurt yourself. That you'd gone and gotten stuck in one of those little passages you're so fond of crawling through. That would have been an *awful* shame."" Ameliese managed to keep her limbs steady, though her voice trembled. ""J-just let me pass. I don't want to hurt you."" ""How very *soft* of you. Well I want to hurt you, mage. More than I want a lot of things."" The avian advanced slowly, and Ameliese backed away. The hand hidden in her robes uncorked its flask of powerful acid. ""I'm n-not going to stop you from whatever you're doing in here, there are too many of you."" ""Aye, far too many. But I'm not going to let you pass, because I need you to come with me. To open the laboratory's skylight. Do that for us and we'll only hurt you a little before you die. If you refuse we'll *all* take our time enjoying your death."" The harpy's rasping, croaking voice sent ancient terror signals up the alchemist's spine, but she held her ground. ""What could you possibly want that for? You've already taken the building. I won't let you lead me down there to be tortured."" ""Then I shall drag you there MYSELF!"" The bird-woman's piercing cry froze Ameliese for a half-second as her mind fought for control of her terror-stricken limbs, which was more than enough time for the hateful being to close the gap between them. Wicked talons grated against her shoddy wards, shearing through the fabric of her robes and dragging several deep gashes across her arm. Acid from the flask slopped onto her hand and underclothes. She shrieked as the exposed skin began to burn fiercely, and she knew it was only a few moments until her clothes soaked through. The pain and fear nearly undid her, but she lost herself again in the singlemindedness of escape and survival. *It is simply pulling the water from my hand as it reacts with my skin. The burns are treatable, if I manage to survive. The pain is temporary, but the consequences of this failure will be eternal.* She summoned every shred of magical power within herself, and she poured it all into a slowing spell. Laughably simple compared to destructive magics, but still an immense test of Ameliese's frayed nerves. The alchemist could see it take hold of the avian. A sudden forceful slowness overcame her sinuous frame, as though she swam in molasses. Her baleful glare took on an air of confusion as she fought to raise another swiping talon against Ameliese. The harpy was too slow. Ameliese withdrew her sizzling hand from within her robes and plunged it through the harpy's jagged teeth and into her throat, open mouth pointed downwards. Strips of skin were shorn from her knuckles, and the bird-woman clamped her jaws shut on the mage's slender limb. Ameliese cried out in pain, but the sound was drowned by the gurgling wail fighting its way around her arm and out of the harpy's throat. Its horrid fangs held tight to the alchemist's forearm, and more of her skin and sinew began to peel away as it wrenched its head away from her reflexively. She staggered and fell back, her arm a tattered mess of lacerated flesh. The harpy reared up in front of her, talon cocked back to rake across her exposed throat. The killing blow never came. Something inside the harpy's twisted frame finally gave way, and its coiled muscles went slack. It slumped to the side, a bubbling sigh escaping its bloody maw. The hateful light in its eyes dimmed as they lost focus on the world around it. One final, dying shudder wracked its feathered form. Ameliese crawled away from it, clinging for dear life as she dragged herself up the roof access ladder with one good hand. Her skin was burning under her clothes, but she kept them on for fear of dying by exposure to the frigid mountain air. Her ruined hand screamed at her, and somehow she ignored it as she forced herself onward, one handhold at a time. Then she was through the hatch. The sounds of chaos and violence still filled the air, though they seemed to have subsided some during her desperate flight. To her immense relief the rooftop was deserted. She slithered behind a ventilation duct that hid her from view of the hatch, and the rest of the carnage that decorated the space. A gust of wind bit into her robes. She tried a warming spell, only to learn that slowing the harpy inside really had taken every last drop of her magical reserves. It was then that the pain and fear finally overtook her. Tears blurred her vision, and she shook with pent-up tension as her slight frame was wracked by silent, heaving sobs. She paid it no mind when the mighty sound of the grand skylight's hefty mechanism grinding to life shook the roof. \--"
16,vulnerability,HFY,[Syzygy] Leporis Crush,1,epfggl,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/epfggl/syzygy_leporis_crush/,2020-01-16 17:22:30," The ship drove through the rings of a moon, leaving chunks of ice and light scattered behind it. Black oil-sheened plates caught the light and cast eerie rainbows through the ice, but the engines behind it limned the immense ship with ghostly green. Andra drifted past Cygnus, and placed her hand on the viewscreen. She seemed terribly small, but impossibly strong. Her mind, her raging mind, the match to Cygs own in power and skill, was as clear as cut crystal. For the first time since her escape, Andra had perfect control over her own abilities. The bridge was silent as Ursa, backed by the rest of their generals, looked on. She didnt look when Cygnus joined her, but when he reached for her hand, she tangled their fingers together. Her mind slid against his, sparking like ball lightning. After weeks of working to get her back, to shore up the control she destroyed to protect herself, they could merge at less than a thought. Cygnus didnt know if it was precognition, or simply a finely-tuned sense of each-other. He didnt care. When their minds laced together, her steely control was the shining framework for his overwhelming spread of power. When the ship came for them, green light bearing down closer and closer, weapons already arming, they were ready. The cut-crystal of Andras mind *shivered*, resonance building through the shining, ice-sharp facets and into the bell of their merged thoughts. The l reverberation of a fingertip over a crystal wineglass echoed over and over between them, building and building from a whine, to a whistle, to a scream. (Now,) Andra said, flooded with red-black rage and metal-white purpose. Together they threw their minds open, reaching for the counterpoint they knew would be at the heart of the predator bearing down on them. With Andras *purpose* and Cygnus providing all the power they needed and more, they found the alien mind, buried in a shell of drones. Before the queen could stop him, Cygnus blasted through the drones who tried to protect her and found the mind within. Andra felt the moment he was in, and followed him in, the *scream* of their resonance a comet-trail in her glass-facets. Alone, neither of them could have done it. Trying to build that sort of resonance would have torn a single telepath apart. But together, the bond of their syzygy blazing between them, they tore into the queens mine, the strange crystalline being that held every mind of her ship, her hive in check. When their resonance crashed into the queen, still building until Cygnus thought it would cut them apart, she went silent, her alien *hunger* suddenly turned to a desperate battle to survive. Cygnus tore down her shields as fast as she could build them as Andra fed more and more of the resonance, shrieking ice-shards and shattering glass, down the connection. The queen had time for a single shriek before the resonance hit her crystalline body. Sound, which began as a tremble of one mind on another turned to a shattering cry. Even aboard their own ship, Cygnus could feel the way the reverberation echoed through her body until she couldnt fight them anymore. Andra, the thrill of satisfaction shining deep orange through her cut-crystal mind, struck one final blow. The battle, which until the last moment was one of three minds, suddenly wrote itself across the stars. Once the queen was dead, the ship, which was filled with her workers and drones, could not recover. The resonance shot out along the bond she used to control them and tore apart every mind on the way, a shockwave of destruction. The weakness of crystal. It could take a blow, but sound, that impossible sonic scream of two telepaths sharing a load that would wreck one alone, was their vulnerability. Better yet, a single mind aboard a ship was a target that Cygs mercenaries could fight. He had enough syzygy pairs and trios around to spread them across the whole battlefront. The trick that the aliens, powerful and numerous and heavily armed as they were, could not fight. The power of humanity, fighting together when the odds were bad, determined not to give in. Cygnus dragged himself back into his own body, still halfway wrapped in Andras mind as much as she was in his. When he opened his eyes, not sure when he had closed them in the first place, it was to a riot of green. The alien ship, which only moments before had seemed so unstoppable, was coming apart at the seams as the workers, devastated by the loss of their queen, died where they stood. The ship was half-organic itself, according to Andra. The pilots were grown from the egg into the stations they would man until they died and were replaced. without them to hold the ship together, without the engineers who maintained the engines and coaxed their strange technology into producing the power for interstellar travel, the ship was crippled. After that, it was a simple matter for the human ships, waiting just out of sight, to open fire. Cygnus turned, his intentions written in gold-edged red. Andra filled their shared mind with champagne ribbons that burst into red stars when he bent to kiss her over the bones of their defeated enemy. The bridge crew, already cheering at their victory, exploded into cheers that rang *hope* and *victory* across the edges of Cygs mind. Together, Andra whispered up to him when they parted, and he looked down into her eyes. Together, Cygnus whispered back, and kissed her again just to feel the smile on her lips. Hand in hand they turned back to the viewscreen, and the armada of alien ships that came to the dying scream of one of their own. \+++ If you like this and want more, check out r/LeeHadanWrites and my [BOOKS ON AMAZON!](URL"
17,vulnerability,HFY,Tales from Enroth Vol.3,1,epjczv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/epjczv/tales_from_enroth_vol3/,2020-01-17 00:31:43,"[First](URL | [Previous](URL | Next | Latest \-- Dramatis Personae: APHAME - Swarthy saboteur AMELIESE - Determined survivor GANNULUS - Militia captain HAART - Erathian knight NEELA - Bracadan alchemist \-- Aphame grinned ferally as the shriek of some great mechanism met her keen ears. It looked like her sisters had accomplished their task after all. She had begged to be part of the strike force to attack the factory. Intelligence suggested there would be gargoyles defending the structure, and she had wanted nothing more than to test herself in aerial combat against the famed Bracadan constructs. Alas, her incredible strength and endurance saw her added to an ad-hoc *sticho* with a special purpose. For thousands of wingbeats she had been cursing her weaker sisters for being too frail to bear the terrible weight she and her team currently held aloft. She would set neither claw nor feather inside the massive golem factory. She *would* cross overtop of it for one brief, keystone moment upon which the success of the entire raid would be balanced. Now that the factory's grand skylight was open, that moment was fast approaching. She angled herself to begin her laborious descent. \-- Their passage through the streets had been swift. Several times Gannulus had stopped to marshall the scattered Bracadan fighters remaining in an area, banding the survivors together on defensible ground and taking a handful with him to assist at the factory. The few mages he found were posted with groups of gremlins and ordered to remain outdoors until the skies were clear. His own forces, the gremlins and golems of his workshop, marched in tight formation flanking Haart's footmen. The disciplined, martial Erathians were like a Seal of Authority from King Gavin himself. Gannulus suffered little resistance as he ordered mages who felt nothing but professional disdain for him about like they were collegiate cadets again. For his part, Haart kept to himself as Gannulus barked commands. If a wry smile tickled the corners of his mouth as the mage berated particularly egregious laggards and cowards, it was nearly imperceptible, even to magesight. Strangely, resistance continued to abate as they approached their destination. The gremlins seemed not to notice, and the golems were characteristically impassive. Haart's footmen, on the other hand, were quick to take note. One voice in particular rose above a conspiratorial whisper. ""It's more Nighon trickery, I say. Something *big* is about to go down."" Haart glared over his shoulder at the source of the voice. Chastened, the man looked at his feet as he marched. ""Silence, men. A single piquet in a fortuitous post could blow our element of surprise. I assure you that our man Gannulus would never seek to march us into a trap."" *I am already one of theirs, it seems. A marvel how quickly the crucible of combat bonds us together.* The mage glanced about warily, but even his enhanced senses revealed no hostile presence. He directed his voice backwards, keeping it magically muffled so as not to carry far. ""I think you are right, some new phase of their plan begins to unfurl. If we are to disrupt their aims, we must get to the factory to assess where and how the damage will be wrought. It is just ahead. Be wary."" One of Haart's pikes cleared his voice. ""I'm just a farmer's son, so f'rgive my ignorance, but don't you whizzars 'ave a fair bit stored up inside wot could blow the factory up 'f it was mixed up just right?"" Haart looked at the footman incredulously, but Gannulus waved away the nobleman's concerns. ""A valid concern, but perhaps overblown. It would take having a fair bit more alchemical prowess than any harpy I have ever heard of having to create such an explosive in a short period of time, and it would be suicide for any involved without some method of creating a fuze."" ""Don't you lot 'ave anyone inside who'd know 'ow?"" Gannulus' blood froze in his veins. *Ammie.* He thought back to a warm memory, several months ago on a gentle grass training field. He was chiding her gently as she lounged on the soft ground, and she was deflecting his words with characteristically charming self-deprecation. *No Gan,* her voice windchime-pretty even in exertion, *I'm not worried about some errant magical arrow blasting us all to the hells and back. I'm perfectly capable of knocking a tray of electrolysed soda lye into a vat of aqua pura* without *the assistance of magic.* At the time it had been a lovely way to relieve the tension of a frustratingly difficult tutoring session, but in hindsight it was an alarming summation of her vulnerability. The harpies would have no qualms about forcing her to make and detonate their bomb. For all the wonderful things he knew about her, Gannulus also knew she was not the sort of person to stand up to a determined Nighon inquisitor's ministrations for long. He didn't know anybody who was. He fought to keep the fear from his voice as he replied to the soldier. ""We do. A staff of alchemists are always on shift at the factory, even when the laboratory floor is not in use. They would be expected to participate in the defense of the factory, but as you have seen that doesn't mean they chose to. If they have been taken captive, with time they *could* be coerced into acting against their peers and Bracada."" The farmer's son nodded grimly. The implication was clear. Haart clapped a reassuring hand on the mage's upper arm. ""Not if we have anything to say about it, man. Take a team of pikes and archers with you to secure the inside, I'll wait outside with the balance of our forces to pick off any who -"" The charismatic noble was cut off by a ground-shaking noise coming from the factory. Gannulus stilled the outburst of chatter from the Erathians with a raised hand that took all of his focus to keep from trembling. ""That is the grand skylight, it covers the factory floor. Surely that means they've taken the interior, and they're opening it up to reinforcements. Come with me. Now."" He indicated Haart and a group of the man's scouts with his head, and they hurried to follow him. They rounded a corner and the cobblestone street opened up into a spacious square dominated by the towering silhouette of the golem factory. Gannulus' eyes blazed with arcane energy as he scanned the scene with his magesight. Haart saw the man's features twist with a cascade of warring emotions, from disappointment and rage to plain concern and outright fear. The mage craned his head back to look up into the skies over the factory. His shoulders slumped, and as he fell to his knees the mage uttered a single, pained word. ""*No.*"" Haart stepped forward to place a hand on the man's shoulder. ""Tell us what you see, by the Light!"" Gannulus shrugged him off furiously. ""Get inside!"" ""What are you on about, mage?"" ""Leave me here and get inside! Take your men and my gremlins and get indoors, now."" Haart heard the deadly seriousness of the man's tone. He saw the harpies spewing forth from the top of the factory. He turned to his men, shrugged. He muttered under his breath. ""I suppose discretion is the better part of valour."" He made haste back down the empty street to link up with the body of their force. Gannulus entered the aethercasting trance. He knew the danger he faced casting so far and wide, but he had no other choice. *He had to warn them.* \-- Neela hovered at the shoulder of one of her blue-robed gremlins, directing the aim of his unit at the harpies churning the skies overhead. An experienced Bracadan commander, it cost her very little to cast away from her body and assume control of a golem as it dealt with a descending harpy *sticho*. Their death cries had not finished ringing in her ears before her consciousness was free of the golem and drifting back to her azure form. On the way there her astral self was accosted by a frantic presence. ""Neela, it is Gannulus. There is little time to explain, but the harpies are going to destroy the factory. Get your forces indoors and hunker down, the explosion will be large enough to - I have to go! Keep your head down!"" As suddenly as it had appeared the presence was gone, whorling emotional undercurrents still stirring the aether it had touched. \-- Aphame reveled in the rush of cool air over her face and through her feathers. Though she still constantly fought to guide the mine's damnable weight, their descent meant she no longer had to spend the energy to keep it aloft. She didn't need to mark the progress of her sisters, she could feel their every movement as the great hunk of metal between them bucked and twisted in the currents of air. They all did their part, but as the lead of her *sticho* it was her duty to steer the hated contraption to its point of release. Her keen eyes spotted their sisters fleeing through the open skylight even at this great height. She didn't bother to count their numbers, her orders were clear. Release at 2500 *pechus* above the factory and make for the rendezvous immediately. No waiting for laggards, no delaying the drop for anyone. Under no circumstances were any of her special *sticho* to risk capture, even to assist stricken sisters. She eyed the spout of the weather glass around her neck. A second, equally precious gift from their turncoat ally, the glass had been specifically sealed at the same height above ground that her *sticho* was to drop the mine. A thin column of dyed fluid drooped ever closer to the markline that told her to release her deadly payload. She filled her lungs and squawked a command to her sisters. She felt the mine lurch in her claws as 3 other sets of talons finally relinquished the burden they had been carrying for so long. She gracefully arched her body to coast away from the path of the mine as wind resistance caused the sleek device to fall faster than her feathered form. She flipped about the handle like a gymnast, and suddenly the mine was below her. She did not bother to fight the mine's weight, simply using the drag she provided as a rudder to ensure it did not drift off-course. The column on the weatherglass sank ever more quickly in its spout. Then the fluid was past the markline. Her talons were so cramped she was nearly unable to release her grasp, but with a determined shriek she prised her claws from the frigid handle one by one. She was filled with a jarring sense of lightness after the marathon feat of her long, arduous flight. She looked down between her talons and noted with satisfaction that the mine was not tumbling, as Lady Lorelei had feared during their preparation for the strike. Their dozens of practice runs with dummy mines had paid off. Her part in the extensively-planned operation played out, she looked ahead and snarled with determination. She still had a lot of flying to do before she met her sisters at the rendezvous. \-- Far below, a badly wounded alchemist lay ensconced in her corner of the rooftop by one of the massive glass plates of the grand skylight. She had been minding her own business, attempting not to freeze to death on the exposed factory roof, when the skylight had peeled back like the petals of some great crystal flower come to bloom. She was trapped in place, but the faint warmth and insulation provided by the glass panel were a welcome improvement over her prior circumstances. She grimaced in pain at a renewed wave of burning from the acid-soaked interior of her robes, and furtively attempted to enter the combat trance once again. Alas, its pain-dulling hold eluded her stricken mind. She heard Gan's voice, faraway and dreamlike, and assumed she must be entering a delirium. *Not now, Ameliese. You've got to stay focused. If you lose your head now you could die up here, it might be hours after they retake the factory before someone thinks to sweep the roof.* ""Ammie!"" The voice seemed a little clearer now, and the battered mage shook her head. ""Gan, are you... here?"" Her voice croaked out through dry lips, sounding worn and delicate. ""I am, and I am not. I am casting Ammie. You need to leave the factory, now! There is not time to explain, y-"" ""I *can't*, Gan. I'm trapped on the roof. I crawled up here to get away from the harpies. What's going on?"" Gannulus' was quiet for long enough that she began to think it was delirium after all. His voice was harrowingly sombre when he spoke again. ""The harpies have stolen a land-mine, Ameliese. I saw them carrying it myself. They... They will drop it in the grand skylight. It will happen any moment now. I... am sorry, Ammie. That was very clever, my love. You could not have known about the mine."" The alchemist closed her eyes for a deep breath. She felt a faint trickle of magic returning to her frozen limbs, and began to enter the casting trance. Her astral form looked down at herself. A pathetic bundle of robes, stained with blood and burned by acid, her ruined hand clutched to her like an infant. Tears had frozen on her cheeks. ""I think..."" She huffed. ""I think it's good to be free of the fear."" ""What do you mean?"" ""The whole time, from the moment the sigil appeared in the lab, I've been terrified. At first in that blind, desperate, crawling way that consumes your every thought and bends you to its will. Then I was terrified because I knew I had to act, and act in ways I was a stranger to, if I was to have any chance of surviving. I had to... kill... two of them. I was petrified of making the wrong choice and ending up one of their... playthings."" She shuddered. ""I'm not afraid any more. There are no right choices to make, no consequences for choosing wrong. I'm not happy to die, but I can accept it. I can relax."" ""It pains me that I could not be there to protect you."" ""Oh stop Gan, you're a militia captain. If you'd been born in Erathia you'd be a captain in *their* armies. You protect people because you can't help yourself, and you were already doing as much good as you possibly could have."" He took a moment to reply. ""Well, I can stay with you now. I will not let you perish alone."" She turned, eyes alight with concerned frustration. ""Damn you Gannulus, you noble fool! You know how dangerous it is to commune with another caster's astral form. You'll be scattered to the winds when my soul releases!"" ""I will be regardless, my love. I warned the rest of the militia of the bomb's approach, and it cost me dearly. I wanted to check on you with the last of my magic."" She looked at him then. Saw the fraying edges, the currents and eddies that danced and spun about him as his spirit unraveled. ""Well, that's both of us then, huh?"" He nodded, smiling weakly. She laughed, a hollow sound, and gestured at her crumpled form. ""Gods, what a wreck I am."" She felt Gan's astral presence draw near. ""You are *breathtaking*, Ameliese. You wear your wounds gracefully. I would hate to see your opponents."" She sneered bitterly. ""Hateful creatures. I'd not waste my last moments with you speaking of them."" This time his smile contained genuine warmth. ""Aye. I do not regret much, facing what lies ahead. I would have liked more time with you."" She shrugged. Fighting every instinct that was hammered into her by countless college instructors, she reached out to take his astral hand. Tendrils of loving kindness sprang from their grasping limbs, entwined, spun together and drifted away on the repellent currents generated by their ethereal interaction. A strange sort of contented cold seemed to drift over the affected areas as their swirling forms lost coherence. ""That's not as bad as I thought it might be. I'd have liked that too, Gan. All that time drilling, and training, it would have been nice to steal a few more hours together. It's not as though the rest of the militia was putting in the work."" Gannulus snorted as he allowed more of himself to drift into Ameliese's faint, flickering form. ""That is a horrible sort of vindication, Ammie dear."" She grinned playfully. ""I know, my love, but it's all you'll get. I knew my big, strong militia captain was right, and I wish now I'd fought a little harder to get your voice heard."" They had drifted nearly into one another, and the distinction between the two was quickly becoming hazy as their faint remaining energies continued to intermingle. She looked up into his eyes. ""Always so intense, that gaze. I am glad it softens for me now. It was hard to maintain eye contact when I met you. I think even then I sensed that you *saw* me. Thank you for trying to save me tonight, Gannulus. I know not what the next world holds for us, but I hope you'll remem-"" In a kaleidoscopic burst of astral energy, their final conversation came to an abrupt close. \-- Castles across Enroth are guarded by all manner of moats, from the flowing lava of Eofol's infernal keeps to the impassable mires and stinging vermin of Tatalian fortress-pyramids. It is a rare siege-master indeed who wouldn't prefer any of those to a grassy field concealing a scatter of land-mines. The force of their blast is enough to fell ogres and demons like wheat before the scythe, and the raging alchemical fire they spew into the air spreads death and destruction to all it can touch. Their metal casing peels outwards into a storm of vicious red-hot slivers to carve its way through the survivors. In the fuel-rich confines of the golem factory the mine's effect is particularly devastating. Aphame's aim is nearly perfect, and the device caromes off the edge of a skylight panel frame into the space below. The glass pane crazes with jagged cracks, but holds in place. The mine plows into a gantry running the length of the chamber, and detonates nearly in the centre of the room. The blast wave shatters crystal vats of voracious acids, and the ruined harpy on the laboratory floor is finally granted agonising peace by a sloshing wave of caustic soup. Aqua fortis from a breached acid vat drains into readied cauldrons of mercury whose gremlins will never return to use them. The concoction quickly becomes cloudy as the mercury begins to fulminate. The shrapnel blizzard spreads through the cavernous lab space with dizzying speed, the cloud of deadly shards growing ever more dense as fragments of shattered glass containers and sundered metal tools are caught up and carried along. A sizzling strip of glowing steel punctures a cask of fuel oil, and its contents leak onto an overturned tray of ammonium nitre. A glob of frothing alchemical fire touches the mixture and triggers a large secondary explosion. This new blast tips and ignites the cauldrons of fulminated mercury, adding more energy and shrapnel to the raging hellscape of competing chemical and kinetic forces. A hundred different reactions occurring at once, being stirred and admixed by entropy incarnate, coalesce into one great column of acrid roaring flames that soars skyward. Metal ducts and gantries shriek as they are torn loose and shredded into tangled ruins and coughed out of the grand skylight. Viewed from the outside, the factory shakes on its foundation. It appears to gather itself and then belch a spectacular plume of smoke and burning debris. Panes of the grand skylight are rendered into clouds of fragmenting glass and cast into the air. The battered alchemist trapped underneath, blessedly unaware of her own body's sensations, is killed instantly when her crumpled form is pierced by a hail of shrapnel. Her remains are atomised by the heat and wind, and borne aloft like the evaporations of some hellish lake. Metal hunks and gobbets of volatile alchemical soup rain upon the streets of Skyreach, and the devastation spreads quickly as blazes spring up across the quiet mountain town. People are struck down by the raining projectiles and maimed by the burning chemicals, and panic seizes the population. It is long past sunrise by the time a remote semblance of order is restored. \-- He drifted through a dark, formless void. He couldn't remember who he was. Attempts to plumb his memories turned up little more than harried fragments of great violence and fear. He thought he might have been a soldier, but the idea didn't seem to sit quite right. He was unable to see himself, attempting to turn his eyes downward resulting only in the suggestion of some ethereal mist and the sensation of chasing one's own tail. Suddenly his perception was seized by something seemingly far off. A growing light in the distance. Though he had no limbs with which to move, he willed himself in the light's direction. Whether he succeeded, or the light simply came to him, he knew not. Suddenly he saw. He remembered. His soul filled with agony as he cried out against the inexorable approach of the light. He fought futilely, and once more his consciousness was subsumed in some higher process. \-- Gannulus gasped as his awareness filled his physical body again. His whole body ached as though beaten, but nothing felt broken. With a start he opened his eyes and stared into the concerned face of Greem the gremlin. ""Sir! Thought you died."" ""As did I, Greem. What... happened? I remember casting... There was a bomb! The golem factory, is it...?"" He hesitated for a moment, unsure that he wanted the answer. The gremlin took it as a prompt to speak. ""Destroyed sir, razed. Will take many months to rebuild."" His conversation with Ameliese and its sudden end came rushing back to him, and he nearly choked on the bitter sob that welled up in his throat. The gremlin stepped back in alarm. ""Sir?"" ""I... am going to need a moment, Greem."" ""Yes sir."" Tears spattered the cobblestone as the wizard reeled from the shock of his mind knitting itself back together in a world that was undeniably and forever worse than the one it had left. After a long time, the wizard raised his torso from his prostrate position and craned his neck to look through blurred eyes into the mockingly tranquil sky. A desolate howl tore from his throat. ""It was supposed to be *both* of us!"" Exhausted, he lowered himself to the stone of the street. He nearly collapsed, and Greem gently propped him up. The gremlin gestured to a companion. ""Go find Haart. Tell Haart Gan is awake."" The red-robed figure nodded once before darting off around the corner. \-- Haart made his way through the chaos and debris of the cobblestone streets. The little gremlin was just ahead, moving as quickly as it could to lead him to its master. When they finally came across him, the sight was grim. He was propped up with his back against a stone wall, his legs straight out like an injured infantryman. His eyes were haggard and bloodshot, and he was staring sightlessly at the building across from him. Though he had not a wound on him, his visible skin was darkened by a uniform bruise from the blast wave emitted by the factory explosion. Haart mused that it was probably the open skylight that saved him, directing most of the force upwards into the sky. Haart cleared his throat, and it took a moment for the man's gaze to settle on him. The mage's eyebrows rose in recognition. ""You. It is gone, Haart. She... is *gone*. They blew it up."" The big Erathian's characteristic charm was disctinctly muted for once. ""They did. I'm sorry, Gannulus. She isn't the only one. The explosion rained much devastation on Skyreach."" ""I thought we were doing so *well*, Haart. Many gremlins perished, but the harpies bought those lives with their blood."" ""My friend, sharper minds than ours could not have predicted them dropping a damned *land-mine* through the factory's roof. We *were* doing well, and thanks to your warning a lot of lives were saved."" Gannulus lapsed into bleary-eyed confusion for a moment, before returning to lucidity. ""The land-mine! I know not how they got their filthy claws on it, but their whole plot revolved around it. This was planned well in advance."" ""Do you know of anyone with grudge enough against the College to turn traitor?"" ""I know of more than one small mind with big dreams, whose egos could not handle the realization that they were far from the finest of their peers. I would not have guessed that any of them could damn an entire town in the depths of their spite."" ""It does not take a cruel man to inflict terrible misery. Only one who is desperate enough to allow their hand to be guided."" ""Wise words, Erathian. The college will investigate, at any rate. I hope someday the perpetrators of this atrocity will meet their just fate. I know I would like to dispense it."" The mage looked down at himself. ""Perhaps more violence is not the answer. I... I am unsure what to do next. I will certainly be sacked from my post as militia captain. If I am terribly unlucky I will be arrested. I am not the only captain in Skyreach, but certainly the least popular."" ""Hells with that, man! You're one of the finest Bracadan fighters I've ever seen. You're a natural leader, and a clever tactician."" ""Aye, but a poor academic, and a worse politician. The college has never known what to do with me, and under the circumstances they shall see more use of me as a scapegoat than as a part-time combat instructor."" ""Damn them, then. Travel with me! I could use another man of magic. Nobody knows you're alive. From the way you spoke to me before the bomb fell I get the sense that you didn't think you'd survive either. It's a clean break."" The mage struggled internally. When he replied, his words were halting. ""I... they will need me. To rebuild. To marshall those who were..."" his voice wavered briefly, ""... not lost. I can do some good here while Skyreach recovers, until the investigation is over."" Haart sucked on his teeth as he looked furtively at the surrounding devastation, thinking hard. His gaze returned to Gannulus. ""Kreegan armies sally forth from the ashes of Eofol. Krewlod and Tatalia skirmish along their entire border in their eagerness to pick the bones of Erathia's fallen settlements. Even the necromancers of barren Deyja are particularly dour and insular of late. War is coming to Antagrich, Gannulus. The light is going to need leaders, and warriors. You cannot save the world from burning sequestered here in the mountains. Not in a town whose only strategic asset has already been razed. There are a hundred journeyman mages in Bracada who could direct the repairs here with their eyes closed. Come with me, man. Not on bent knee, bowed of head like some sniveling Nighon underlord. Travel with me as equals, and together we shall fight the evil that grows in the far flung corners of Enroth."" The mage looked at him, weighing his words and reading his eyes. He glanced at the men flanking their lord. Saw their loyalty, their steely resolve. His expression faltered. ""I... I cannot leave my country to this fate. For all our contraptions and war-machines we are a nation of lofty academics. Many will perish when our ivory towers are toppled."" ""Then take the fight to *them*. Nighon tunnels secreted the Kreegan hordes across the Erathian border, and their advisers accompany the invasion forces even now. I know not their aim, but their stinking handprints are all over this coming storm. Help me stop them from accomplishing their dark goals."" Gannulus looked inwards, weighed his warring emotions against the razor logic of a finely-tuned Bracadan mind. He wanted nothing more than to punish himself with a lifetime of squalid ignominy for allowing his love to be slain, but knew that nothing could be more disrespectful to her memory. He pursed his lips, steeled himself, and turned his face up towards the handsome knight. ""I accept, Haart. We shall travel this land together, and prevent as much tragedy as we can."" A broad grin split the man's face, and he held out a hand for his new companion. The mage looked hesitant. ""I... do not think that's a good idea. I cannot move without experiencing some pain or another."" The knight frowned. ""Well I hate to leave you here, shall I have Cadric fetch a healer?"" Gannulus shook his head, winced. ""The college will know I yet live then."" ""If you're determined to wait, my cleric makes his way here with all haste. Cuthbert will have you back to fighting shape in an instant."" ""That will do just fine."" ""In the meanwhile I'll have my men fashion a litter for you so we can get you indoors. I'd hate for one of your superiors from the college to come across you like this."" ""I am in no shape to protest. Are my gremlins and golems with your men?"" ""The gremlins, yes. Your iron golem as well. The stone golem was commandeered by another wizard to assist in the disaster relief."" ""That is just as well, the stone golem never belonged to me. I would have taken it, given the chance, but it will do much good around here. It will be a long time before they can make more."" Haart's face darkened momentarily. ""Aye, Erathia will not be pleased to learn as much. A blow to our allies is a blow to us in times of unrest. I pray the restoration goes smoothly. Wait here, my men will be along shortly."" With a practiced flourish, the sturdy man turned on one heel and made his way down the ruined street. \-- The next morning, a procession of Erathian and Bracadan troops made their way to the outskirts of town. They drew attention as they went, but were not stopped. Anyone who might seek to ask questions of them was wholly absorbed in the recovery effort. At the head of the column, a knight rode proudly, head held high. Flanking him were two robed figures. One in plain brown, the other rich crimson. The red-robed figure wore leaden features beneath his thick scarf as the buildings of Skyreach receded into the distance. He had ventured outside the bounds of the town more than once in the course of his studies, but never traveled farther than the Bracadan border. He was gripped by a sense of melancholy as he looked on his home for what might be the last time. With a renewed look of determination the figure turned Northwards, towards Erathia and the rest of Antagrich. Somewhere out there was the vile mind that conceived of the raid that took his Ameliese. He was going to *find* them. \-- \-------STATS------- Canon characters named: 1 Original characters named: 0 Canon characters mentioned: 3 Original characters mentioned: 5 Canon characters slain.: 0 Original characters slain: 1 \-------STATS-------"
18,vulnerability,HFY,[T-Verse] Terminarch: The Adventures of Endling and Furfriends - Part 6,1,etzybr,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/etzybr/tverse_terminarch_the_adventures_of_endling_and/,2020-01-26 12:23:35,"[Wiki](URL [First](URL | [Previous](URL | Next In this episode: Revelation and entering the abyss Rentahfsza and Husczarr were loitering outside the washroom as Nemka prettied herself up in privacy. ""What's the occasion?"" Husczarr asked, referencing Rentahfsza's excursion suit. ""Do we need spacesuits too?"" ""[No. Don't worry about it.]"" Looking at Rentahfsza, Husczarr already an idea to decorate [his] excursion suit, but for some reason, the Vespa had refused to have Vespan skulls painted onto [his] headgear. That wasn't a complete loss, though: Husczarr had other plans for a skull design. ""So, looks like you got lucky with her, huh?"" Husczarr asked Rentahfsza, referencing the only female on board. ""[Sure did.]"" With Rentahfsza being completely in-suit, Husczarr couldn't hear [his] Vespan underlying the ship's translation, only the English equivalent. ""Even back when half of the sapients in my knowledge were females of my species, I don't think I'd ever come across someone so exceptional, in terms of physique."" ""[How so? I get that humans are skinny, but does your kind not have the ability to put on weight?]"" ""What? No! A major portion of the population where I come from was obese."" Rentahfsza disagreed with that word. ""And wait, why are we even talking about this? Nemka's not a big girl."" ""[And here I thought you were into females with meat on them too. I'm above average in height and weight, and yet] *Nemka* [weighs almost as much as I do. She's plenty big,]"" Rentahfsza laid out. It was true: Nemka did have the highest BMI out of them all. ""But that's all in her curves. I don't consider that making her overweight."" Rentahfsza cringed at Husczarr's choice of words. ""[Where else is fat supposed to be stored?] *Nemkaen* [weight is sufficient that she has to take a week off every month, Endling. She hits the bar for being senselessly plushy and goes far past it.]"" Yterkis and Rentahfsza hailed from more temperate lineages of Vespa, while Nemka, with her thicker fur, snow coloration, and extra body fat, was of an arctic race, and that was by Ranshawn standards. Nobody tell Husczarr, but a not insignificant portion of Nemka's apparent curvaceousness was just fluff, thus her softness despite being pumped up with blood for the mating season. ""Yeah, but I thought that it was because you spent that time together."" ""[It's not like we do nothing but fuck for a week straight! Seeders, what does the museum let you watch?]"" ""Well, I thought you were a a, uh"" ""[A what?]"" Rentahfsza asked, assuming that Husczarr was talking about [him] and Nemka as a couple. ""A prostitute."" Rentahfsza blanked, and then slammed [his] armored forehead into the nearest wall, groaning, ""[I'm an electrician!]"" ""Sorry. I don't have an excuse for thinking that. But still, Nemka's hips-"" ""[Please stop talking about my girlfriend.]"" ""Yessir."" A moment of silence. ""[So, why aren't you asking me about the important stuff, like how long it's been since Earth was settled or how old you really are?]"" Husczarr lost his concentration for a moment and closed his eyes, sighing. He did not need the stress of these new revelations. Softly, he admitted, ""I've been content not to ask, and you'd been content not to bring it up, until now. I'd like to keep it the way it was."" Rentahfsza, hearing that, hid [his] growing hunger at Husczarr's vulnerability and endeared Husczarr to [himself], purring, ""*Prrhrrr* [Looks like the little puppy is scared, now isn't he?]"" [He] then hugged Husczarr tight to [his] chest, eliciting a yelp from the human. Husczarr put a hand to his temple, turning away from Rentahfsza. ""Ow! Metal chest plate!"" he called out, rubbing his face with his palms. Rentahfsza's ears and tail drooped in apology and [he] drew away, mumbling, ""[Sorry.]"" Husczarr glared at [him]. The lack of the sound of a Vespan voice made Husczarr suddenly realize: outside of the ship, there wouldn't be any translation, which would put him in extreme danger. Or would it? Nemka would understand him all the same as she had back at the museum. So if language wasn't the issue, why had Nemka been getting more aggressive over the previous two days? ""Yo Renta, do you know why Nemka kept threatening to eat me?"" ""[Because you refused, and still refuse, to kiss me.]"" ""I'm not falling for that. That's dumb."" ""[No, I'm serious. Unless Nemka sees that you've hooked up with me, you're an unwanted male. In the wild, where food was scarce, human or Vespa, she'd be entitled to eat you for that.]"" So, that was the straightforward reason why he was always separated from her. ""[And, there's no rule of law right now and I'm the only one who can stop her. I won't always be there to do so.]"" ""It's still a no on the kiss."" ""[Pup, you're liable to get killed.]"" Rentahfsza didn't know about Husczarr and Nemka's non-aggression pact. ""Are you threatening me, too, now?"" Rentahfsza's ears, having little space inside [his] helmet, started to itch, and [he] spent the next few seconds vigorously shaking [his[ head around before replying with, ""[No. I'm trying to help.]"" Given what Husczarr knew about Vespa, even that sounded suspicious. ""Why? Why do you care?"" Rentahfsza was put on the spot. Luckily for [him], their discussion time wouldn't last forever, as Nemka finished getting dressed before [he] was forced to answer. Her reemergence was unnecessarily flamboyant: taking inspiration from Husczarr, she had moved on beyond wearing belts of cloth and gotten herself something which covered her better and was noticeably better tailored to her as an individual. Rentahfsza thought it made her look noble. Husczarr was relieved that she'd finally started wearing a t-shirt and pants instead of her underwear. But above all else, there was something that caught Husczarr off guard. Nemka's mane and ruff were sticking out of her clothes. Husczarr realized that for some reason, he'd never seen Nemka's fur hanging out like this before. It was an extremely human look, since it was perfectly normal for humans to let their hair grow long on the parts of their body which went through the neck hole of their shirts. The difference was that, instead of putting her clothes over her fur, Nemka had patted her fur down over her clothes. It occurred to Husczarr that Nemka had never been forced to be a normal person around him before, and part of normalcy entails not wearing harnesses which press your body hair flat to your skin all of the time. Nonetheless, Nemka's hunched over, half-theropod posture, enhanced by her large avian eyes, made it look like she had a lot of back pain. It was a strange way of standing that Husczarr had gotten used to seeing after living with Vespa for a long time, but a layman would have made specific mention of how long it made their legs look, since their bodies themselves were almost horizontal, and as a result the bottom of Nemka's chest fur was at the same height as her tail. Husczarr's ape brain was receiving a thousand hell yeahs and a thousand nopes from this diseased-looking skeletal structure. Seeing Husczarr's mixed reaction, Rentahfsza placed a gloved hand, which had metal claws built in to prevent the wearer's claws from piercing the suit, on Husczarr's shoulder, and spoke into the human's ear from behind, ""[Yes, she's mine.]"" Nemka was left in the dark as to what Rentahfsza's antics implied, and asked, ""[What were you boys talking about?]"" Rentahfsza answered for them. ""*Ach,* [Endling was a bit misinformed, and I helped him out with that.]"" Husczarr didn't mind that response. More accurately, he didn't dare speak out against the armored ten-and-a-half foot alien that had six clawed digits adjacent to his neck. Clarification: Vespa have four fingers per hand, as with humans, but also have thumbs on either side of their hands, though their resting positions are outside of the curl of the fingers rather than in line with the other digits. These thumbs are evolutionarily recent adaptations for grasping, and are separate from the phalanges, thus Vespa having four digits on their paws, like their ancestors, but six on their hands. It also must be addressed that Rentahfsza's legs weren't themselves almost a dozen feet long; more rather, had [he] tried to reach [his] head as far up as [he] could, it would have been ten and a half feet from the top of [his] head to the ground. Usually, preferring to stand in a natural Vespan stance rather than at attention, Rentahfsza's snout was around seven feet off of the ground. Husczarr took note of something he had not previously noticed: despite wearing full-body, airtight, and armored gear, Rentahfsza didn't look much bigger than usual. It made him wonder just how much of [his] volume was wool, and how uncomfortable it must be for [him] to be squeezed into such a tight space, especially compared to how much Nemka was enjoying her fluff. ""*Ergpre kha, wisy?*"" Rentahfsza asked Nemka through his suit's speakers, turning to lead her towards the stern airlock room. Husczarr interrupted them as they were about to leave him behind. ""Hey! What happened to me being the first one out?"" Rentahfsza swayed his head from side to side and responded to Husczarr with, ""[We're all going out together. You can be the first out the door if you want.]"" ""And you're the only one who gets to have a protective suit?"" Nemka had become impatient with Husczarr's nagging, and decided to go on. Now it was a race, and Husczarr sure as hell wasn't going to let her be the face of the alien visitors in the mind of an entire civilization. Besides, it was only for the best if he bore the brunt of the risk of exiting the spaceship. Husczarr had an advantage that the Vespa did not: not only was he not sick, as they were, but he was also potentially capable of surviving on this planet. Given the low likelihood of interplanetary cross contamination, neither he nor the native life would get infected by one another. The only issue he could see was a need to filter the air around his orifices, because stepping out into an alien atmosphere could be like getting hit by mustard gas, only peeing into a rag wouldn't help. Simply based on conservation of momentum, Husczarr couldn't stop Nemka. He'd get trampled. So he outpaced her instead, taking the lead of their ragtag exploration team. Incidentally, they were arranged in the order of shortest to tallest. They successfully navigated their way to the airlock only because Husczarr had walked past it and immediately come back when he stopped hearing footsteps behind him. At least Rentahfsza was wearing shoes; he was unable to hear Nemka, with all of that excess fur. He contemplated giving her a shave as part of his art. Husczarr's mind was brought back on track as they piled into the airlock once the ship unlocked it, Rentahfsza taking the largest portion of the small room for [himself] and [his] sharp-edged suit, with the other two packed together. Husczarr didn't mind getting a facefull of Nemka's bust fur in the opposite corner. Whatever shampoo she used, it worked, because the odor of regurgitated stomach contents was completely gone. She must've been extremely confident in her medicine, too, considering the risk her hairstyle would've been in if she'd started to become ill again. Speaking of, Rentahfsza's leg began to shake as [he] fought off the urge to sate [his] own ailment. *No scratching.* The airlock's transition was far faster than Husczarr expected. Only a few seconds for the ship to confirm something, and then the other side opened up, as simply as if they were in a two-door elevator. Husczarr didn't even think any atmosphere had been exchanged. Swiftly pushing his way to the front, he saw why. They'd docked with something, which must've been what Rentahfsza meant by ""happy to meet us"". Husczarr took several steps out of the ship, yearning to find an alien to display his presence to, before he properly froze, given the circumstances. Whatever type of corridor he had come out of the ship into, and he had certainly left the ship, it was made of the same material as the ship itself, and was created with enough room to house a Vespa, along with having an atmosphere the Vespa could breathe. Husczarr didn't want to be first in line anymore. Before you could say ""Maybe this has all been a trap to get me outside of the ship and into a secret Vespa lab, considering that all I've known about the 'outside world' has come from an unreliable AI and a computer screen,"" Husczarr felt Nemka's presence behind him. Rentahfsza trudged up beside them and kept going, gesturing for them to follow. Nemka wouldn't let Husczarr come in last place, though, as she prodded him forward and kept pace behind him. Wherever they had ended up, or, more properly, whatever their ship had docked with, they weren't the first members of the Orion Arm Confederacy to stop by. Oh, well. There goes first contact. But why was Rentahfsza taking point? Snatching a glance behind himself, Husczarr got all the explanation he needed: Nemka's chest fur was now twice as voluminous. It was the most eye-catching case of the goosebumps Husczarr had ever seen. Nemka was just as scared as he was. Wait. Was she using him as a shield? Husczarr had never, in his wildest dreams, considered that Nemka was a coward. Rentahfsza certainly wasn't. In [his] armor, Rentahfsza was the warrior of their group. Not who Husczarr'd expected to fill that role, but whatever. Seeing the massive Vespa stalk [his] way through the hallway quelled any ambitions Husczarr had to ask [him] exactly who was waiting to see them and why. At first, it seemed that the end of the corridor was a turn into another one, but when Husczarr reached it, he discovered that it was a dead end. They were in some weird airlock limbo. Husczarr knew all about the shifting hallway trope from surrealist horror movies, and looked back just to make sure that the way they came hadn't turned into a wall while he wasn't looking. It hadn't. Rentahfsza felt the walls around [him] for some indicator of a door. [He'd] gotten used to the automatic doors of the spaceship, but [he] knew how to use a door [himself], of course, given [his] apartment's construction. The three of them were stumped by a wall. Then the other wall, the one to their left, slide aside in its entirety without prompting, revealing a visitor. The creature that appeared before them was almost, so close to being, not the third most putrid and vile thing Husczarr had ever encountered, behind Vespa having sex and myiasis. It was as if someone had mashed a maggot and a millipede together, removed the face, and then covered that missing face with translucent respiration equipment. Oh, and it was eight feet long and rearing up on its multitudinous hind limbs to greet them. &amp;#x200B; Rentahfsza immediately stepped between the other two and the alien. It was a new species to [him], which wasn't saying much considering that [he'd] been Earthbound [his] whole life, but whatever it was, it definitely wasn't a member member species of the League, the Orion Arm Confederation's board of representatives. He'd never heard of a species that looks like deformed, hairless newborn puppies. As with the distinction between autotrophy and heterotrophy, organisms on Ranshaw had each developed their limbs relatively late into their evolutionary histories. Following the evolutionary principle that gestation mirrors phylogeny, Vespa fetuses resemble fat, furry larva before they are transferred to the female, only gaining limbs, a head, and a tail close to the due date. These limbs only fully separate from the rest of the body a few minutes after birth. Terrestrial mammals have an internal method of amniote gestation. The category of Ranshawn organisms into which Vespa fall have an internal method of gestation similar to that of Terrestrial invertebrates, including a larval stage, inside the pseudo-male, and a pseudo-marsupial stage, thanks to the mother. Despite not apparently having any optical organs or other recognizable facial features, the larvapede turned its front end towards Rentahfsza and then did a weird form of arching bow. Whatever doubts [he] had about whether they'd discovered a new, rival spacefaring government to the Confederation were dispelled when it spoke, in that signature voice of a translator whose language settings were on default, ""[Senduen resh Phaedaea, dak unmurll-meija pagne dak kuskanwi unka! Ergpre, drak khan pluradhu. Phfere na pek kha refgher resh khan dennwung, kha crut?]"" ""*Keyd.*"" Rentahfsza said while bouncing slightly from paw to paw, eager to show Nemka what was waiting for them. [He] hadn't seen anything but wilderness and this one case of technology the whole time that they'd been here. Looking around for Nemka, Rentahfsza found that Husczarr was looking at [him] like [he'd] lost [his] mind, and Nemka was adorably ducking down behind the human, peeking at the alien. ""[Newtun, pek-realtu resh khan lunalectrun.]"" The alien stepped back some, looking like a big rig in reverse, and walked away from them, stubby limbs seeming to undulate like a cuttlefish's fins. Having nothing better to do, Rentahfsza followed, and then, having gotten over any fantasies that the native inhabitants would turn out to be fifty-foot eldritch horrors, Nemka followed [him], chest fur swaying as she strode. Husczarr took a little while longer to catch up with them, but by the time that had happened, Rentahfsza was on a different page entirely. Trailing behind the elongated alien, [he] passed through another doorway and recognized where they were: a completely pressurized hangar complex. It was as if someone had taken a spaceport and built it on the planet. But thanks to materials that must have been provided by a species in the Confederation, enough of an open space could be afforded around them all to see that it was all subterranean. Somehow their ship had passed through an opening in the surface to get there. Rentahfsza still didn't recognize any of this. Where was all of the stuff mentioned on that message [he'd] gotten back on the ship? [He] was not content with a choice between swamp or more of the same metal. The Vespa weren't nearly as taken aback by the sheer amount of open cavity as was Husczarr. To have a space that was as large and as tall as a human airport carved under the ground, without any support beams, was an engineering accomplishment that, having at least five years of memory living with the Vespa, he hadn't ever considered. They weren't actually in the same environment as the rest of the hangar, but in a separate transparent tube which had a deck built into it upon which they could walk. Interestingly, off to the left, Rentahfsza could see a number of what appeared to be unused ship berths, while to [his] right [he] could see more transparent tubes winding their way around, connecting and disconnecting on multiple levels all over the place. Theirs was the only tube that was occupied, however. Guessing by the breathing device on their guide's head, the natives didn't like whatever the tubes were pressurized with. Husczarr made some sort of comment in English as Rentahfsza became distracted by an odd flash to [his] left. Looking over and down, [he] was able to see where all the worm aliens were: next to manned construction equipment and unassembled transparent pipes, a number of supervisors and workers were milling about. The flash, as it seemed, was not from primitive welding equipment, but a warning flash from a near-collision. Rentahfsza did an awkward skip as [he] walked along, trying to flex [his] toes to berid [himself] of [his] itch on [his] paws. [He] nearly tripped doing it. This lasted a suspiciously long while, making Husczarr curious as to exactly what was bothering the pseudo-male. After what was, for Rentahfsza, an agonizingly long time, they arrived at the far end of the transparent tube, finding themselves next to another wall-like door, only this time it appeared to be built into the far wall of the underground chamber, rather than being an attachment to a shocking module, as the other end had turned out to be. This door, like all the others, opened exclusively when their guide desired, this time revealing something foreign to Nemka and Rentahfsza, but all too recognizable to Husczarr. The Vespa had no idea what to make of what Husczarr correctly identified as a subway car. When, following the alien and Husczarr, who were the most courageous in this case, they all piled into the maglev metal box, and it became clear to all that our was a mode of transport, Rentahfsza asked a killer question: ""*Krash yran sulh wequitasuflar?*"" Nemka held her tongue as the subway doors closed and it began to move (luckily with universal acceleration technology installed) into another chamber where it would be sealed into vacuum. The alien didn't. When it asked Rentahfsza what ""teleportation"" was, Nemka made her peace as Rentahfsza attempted an explanation and demonstration, whereupon [he] found out how useless [his] teleport chip was, as well as [his] suit's teleportation functions. Luckily, [he] didn't direct any of [his] suspicion onto Nemka, blaming [his] supposedly faulty technology instead. Though they were underground on an alien planet with different gravity, Rentahfsza could tell that they were slowly increasing in altitude. Despite the presence of transparent windows on the sides of the subway car, there was, for the first leg of their trip, nothing to look at but stone and earth. It's what there was to see when they made it to the surface that stole [his] attention. &amp;#x200B; Husczarr found himself privy to quite a sight: their ship wasn't just parked somewhere in a big city, it was right next to the most massive skyscraper Husczarr had ever seen. A gargantuan metal termite mound. This superhuman architectural feat was right there. And what's more, they weren't in the middle of a public park or anything of the sort; they had docked in a proper spaceship berth, the exact kind they had departed from on Earth's single (!) spaceport. What caught Husczarr's eye was a symbol located above what could be surmised to be the ground-level entrance to the skyscraper, a symbol he had seen many times before at the museum. The abstract design of the Vespa-Humanoid Syndicate's logo. Wherever they were, it wasn't on Ranshaw, but it definitely had some sort of tie with the Grand Vespan Museum. Add to that the fact that the only AI he'd seen anywhere on this planet was the ship and only the ship, without an android or even automated construction machines, and both the criminal nature of their unexpected eviction from the Earth and the suspect behind it became known. Husczarr would never admit to being an anti-humanoid bigot, but he always set himself apart from his distant relatives. He was the timber wolf, they were the pugs. So he thought nothing of his assumption that the ruling bodies of both the Vespa and the humanoids were behind whatever was happening, rather than the reality that the humanoids were only the lackeys. The larvapede hadn't, thus far, made any sort of specific mention of Husczarr. Husczarr couldn't understand anyone anymore without the ship, anyways, but he certainly wasn't being treated as the prized possession of whoever was in charge. For all he knew, everyone besides Nemka and Rentahfsza thought he was a humanoid. He was living the life of a humanoid, after all. Letting his eyes follow the track, Husczarr confirmed that, yes, the skyscraper was their destination. Or it was a stop along the way. But looking at the immense significance of the mound-like spire, Husczarr found it difficult to convince himself that it was anything but where they were intended to go. Its construction was an odd blend of organic and geometric that didn't sit right with the human's experience of how tall buildings work. Instead of being exactly cut, as skyscrapers would have to be on Earth, given that they were made of steel and glass, its exterior was misshapen and asymmetric, though it did narrow towards the top. It reminded Husczarr of the Mon Calamari ships from Star Wars, only stacked on its end, with circular windows dotting its surface at irregular intervals, going all the way its rounded top. He looked over at Nemka to see if she found this as fascinating as he did, only to find her absorbed in her HUD. The Vespa, especially Rentahfsza, were so cavalier about everything. They had the privilege of being able to comprehend whatever the larvapede had said, so they could be excused for not making such a big deal about all the things Husczarr could see out of the window, but that distracted them from the fact that, properly, they should've been acting like Husczarr. They were taking everything everyone else said at face value, when they only really knew as much as Husczarr did. Not understanding what the larvapede was saying aided Husczarr in understanding how it was saying it, in a way that the Vespa would be unable to discern. Its translator was speaking in Vespan Standard and exclusively that. Also, the first technology they had encountered on this planet was a flight of ""primitive"" jet fighters, and, after being witness to Rentahfsza's failed attempt at teleportation (which dispelled any fears that Husczarr's teleport chip itself was broken), it became clear that these aliens didn't have access to teleportation technology, thus the subway. So the natives didn't have the full array of technology. This all reeked of uplifting. If Husczarr's hunch was correct, then this world was the planet that Earth never got to be. He had to learn more about what exactly the larvapedes were doing and what they were living through. As of that time, the only available translator was Nemka. ""Nem-"" ""*It's an inn, Husczarr. The city. A giant inn.*"" Apparently, Nemka didn't need much prompting to know what the most important thing on Husczarrs mind would be. ""How much does it cost? Can you ask them?"" ""*That's a strange quest'un. Why d'yah care? Yer nat paying.*"" ""I want to know how much they're getting paid. Can you ask them what a skin treatment for Renta would cost?"" Nemka, with nothing else to pass the time, obliged, coming back soon after with, ""*They said we can ask at the frunt desk and we'll get it fer free.*"" *Get it for free.* Husczarr recognized slavery when he saw it. He could almost empathize with the big bugs: their entire race had become like him, but with real jobs. Husczarr had no qualms with himself over admitting that lecturing wasn't an actual career that he possessed. The issue laid with admitting it to someone else. As the not-so-humble inn came closer, it soon became too large for Husczarr to see the top of it, no matter how much he pressed his face to the transparent panes on the side of the subway. Feeling like he was being shipped to a prison camp, Husczarr, despaired, put his hand on the window and then slid away, his palm and cheek sliding against the pane. Nemka's sensitive ears picked up the squeaking sound of Husczarr on glass and groaned internally. He used to terrorize her with that sound, taunting her about not having ""the gecko hands"" because her fingertips were covered in fur. Honestly, it made her want to burn his off. Husczarr saw it as another case of jealousy, as with the ""little howls"". Quite soon, the subway came to a stop, at the same type of terminal on which they had arrived. The visitors disembarked collectively, except for Rentahfsza, who was using the opportunity to scratch [his] back against the open frame of the train's doors. Their guide had one more thing to say. ""[Dak reqapt drak grilk dak cullumnar, ghuulzaf tu trechu. Pifur krehtsull, e kha persimm na prekharaun Phaedaea.]"" Rentahfsza murred in acknowledgement and gestured for the others to follow [him] inside as the larvapede stood next to the stopped subway, probably waiting for the next arrival. The subway stop must have been some form of shuttle ramp. Perhaps the only normal part of the hotel was the door inside, because as soon as the door gave way to a hallway, it became clear that whoever had furnished the place was definitely a member of a subterranean species. &amp;#x200B; The first thing to greet Nemka's nose was not anything in and of itself, but a contradiction of the senses. When she walks into what looks like a hand-carved hallway, she expects to taste the stale air of a place that has not been properly ventilated. Instead, having never experienced the wonders of how termite mounds aerate themselves before, she was pleasantly surprised to find that the inside of the main building felt neither stuffy nor filtered by artificial air conditioners. If the design of the hotel's decor was meant to be artistic, then whoever built it either had too much time on their hands, or an army of workers who could dig their way through the construction materials, because every inch of the floor, walls, and ceilings had the appearance of being carved by mandible or claw. It was likely all a facade which was added to the more conventional underlying structure, but it still looked great. Finally back in her comfort zone, Nemka adopted a little bit of a spring in her step that, to everyone's merriment but hers, put a little bounce in her bosom as well. A few critical looks at the boys shut their investigative gazes up. Still, Nemka was regretting putting on her nice clothes. She was feeling the pain of having gone commando. Thankfully, the hallway had been built to Vespa standards, allowing Rentahfsza and her to move comfortably, but giving Husczarr's short legs a workout. The lazy ape would have asked Rentahfsza to pick him up again, but [his] metal carapace and Nemka's pillowy chest changed his mind. But when Husczarr raised a hand to Nemka's hand as the two Vespa began to outpace him, she ignored it. Nemka wasn't going to pamper him like she knew Rentahfsza, being less authoritarian, would. The lobby wasn't too far away by a Vespa's estimate, though Husczarr was not content to have walked half a football field just to get to a waiting room, and Rentahfsza and Nemka where surprised to find that, besides a desk agent, they were the only ones there. Maybe the planet wasn't commercially open yet. It would explain their reservation. Another larvapede was manning the front desk, and had its front end turned towards them expectantly. Weird, that an attendant with almost no one to service would not have anything better to do while waiting for customers. Nemka had expected it to be reading something or rather in its spare time. Its desk was part of a barrier, most of it glass, which kept the air of the main lobby away from its atmosphere. At least, it seemed that way, because it wasn't wearing a mask, only an external translator. They really didn't have faces. Without a complete grasp of what exactly she was supposed to do, Nemka left the talking up to Rentahfsza. ""*Grruda, turra drakn avev na unt pluradhu,*"" Rentahfsza greeted the receptionist. ""[Ahh, mmr! Reh drak unt plurahdu aidvi 'Nemka'?]"" ""*Mhm mmr.*"" The larvapede spent a few moments using its tiny limbs to interact with something on the desk in front of it, before turning to a compartment next to it and producing a physical key card in its mandibles. Rentahfsza would've asked why it didn't just update [his] and Nemka's ID chips, but [he'd] figured out from the teleportation and whatnot that these people probably weren't as technologically gifted as [him]. It used its mandibles to place the card, no, cards, in a tray which sat on its side of the barrier. With a *PHOOMP* of repressurization, the tray slid over to their side, allowing Rentahfsza to retrieve their new keys. ""[Drakn khan unlaka turra. Khasur zarru-retsu-finche-zwill. Kha crut phfere krehkwia deff?]"" it asked. Nemka chose the opportunity to step up. ""*Crut avev phfere unt xesce musquite camdlete-urfleh na Rentahfsza trenn,*"" she butted in. Rentahfsza seemed flattered: [he] hadn't heard Nemka and Husczarr talking about it earlier. But it felt like something else was missing. Looking down, Nemka saw Husczarr, indifferent to the conversation, and finally recognized the missing piece. If someone wanted to prove that she'd broken the museum's translation rules, they'd only need to pick out the largest translator nearby: their ship. So, there was no harm in getting another one. ""*e unt prak ture usside metwixxen kha vase na perr, ah, avaken trenn,*"" Nemka added, alluding to the human. The larvapede didn't question why a humanoid would need a translator; it likely didn't have a comprehensive enough understanding of the greater universe to understand that Husczarr was supposed to have any relation to the Vespa at all. Then again, supposedly this resort was owned by the Vespa-Humanoid Syndicate, not the Vespan government, so something could be amiss After confirming their requests, the receptionist bode them goodnight and then, for some reason, pressed a button that turned the transparent panes of its work box translucent, then opaque. They must have been the only reservation; it seemed the place was closing for the rest of the day. The way to the lobby didn't have a moving sidewalk, but mercifully, the room was surprisingly close to the main lobby. Husczarr rejoiced in the fact that they were on the bottom floor. There were a million risks in having to go up even a single floor, namely that he probably wouldn't know how to work whatever elevator system they had. He wouldn't be bound by any walls if he could walk out the front door, though he'd likely need some form of respirator first. His wing of the museum, his and Nemka's room, Renthafsza's apartment, the spaceport, the spaceship, it all boxed him in. On this alien planet, he'd potentially be more free from Vespan control than he had been when he walked out of the Grand Vespan Museum on Earth, because he didn't have any ID chip (Thank historical accuracy!) and the Vespa couldn't stay awake forever. Then again, he'd probably be safer with Nemka's guardianship. The Vespa had both been awake for almost an hour straight. Nemka was already getting a bit sluggish on her way to their room, and she desperately needed a catnap. No doubt, Rentahfsza needed one, too, but [he] had an excursion suit to hide [his] fatigue. There was a door, and Rentahfsza unlocked it, and Nemka walked in, and she collapsed on the nearest bed. With a place to finally store [his] excursion suit, Rentahfsza took off the clunky armor and enjoyed [his] freedom in the regular clothes [he'd] been wearing underneath. [He] wanted to bed down next to Nemka, [he] really did, but [he] given [his] constant itching, the thought of which made [him] hyper aware of all the new spots that needed a scratch, [he] advised [himself] not to lay with [her]. Instead, drowsy and uncomfortable as [he] was, Rentahfsza went into the hotel room washroom, stripped naked, and starting using every trick in the book to relieve [himself] of the terror that had been plaguing [him] since the previous day. Husczarr, meanwhile, sat on the bed next to Nemka, who was clumsily splayed out. He informed her: ""Hey Nemka, I have a serious, biological question that Rentahfsza didn't want to talk about, and which I think you, being the resident female, are qualified to answer."" Nemka was not fine with this distraction. She wanted the sweet bliss of unconsciousness. But she'd humor him now so he wouldn't keep her up later. ""It's about that,"" Husczarr said, using both hands, opened in gesture towards Nemka, to point at her figure. ""If having wider hips has no ill effect on a female's athletic ability, why would the females of a species have hips so thin that it causes birth complications?"" ""[Give an example.]"" ""I'm no biologist, but I'm pretty sure evolution doesn't prefer a bloodline that gets cut off at life stage one. So why didn't all human females have hips as wide as, say, humanoids?"" Nemka, to Husczarr's surprise, had a well thought-out answer. More accurately, one she'd had to memorize in grade school. ""[It's because humanoids have been living in a post-scarcity society for a long time. They adapted to having bigger, healthier babies early on, while your people were living in squalor.]"" ""Seriously?"" Husczarr remarked at the underhanded insult. ""[Seriously.]"" Some time passed between them without a word. Husczarr, had he been living with human technology, would have expected something like the ticking of a clock or the hum of an air conditioner to protect them from absolute silence, but the hotel's systems were quite effectively muted. The only thing anyone could hear was breathing and Rentahfsza's awkward struggling against [his] clothes in the washroom. Husczarr took the time to analyze Nemka as she laid her head down and looked off into the distance longingly, trying to mentally document all of the ways this Nemka was different from the Nemka he normally knew. She had the fat knockers, certainly, but she was also far more comfortable in her own body, with a huge difference when around him. She didn't bat an eye at him looking her over, most probably from exhaustion. On the topic of things which Nemka was, she was bored with Husczarr's stupid questions, and impatient because Rentahfsza might miss out on sex that night. But at least Husczarr didn't seem to be acting on his infamous fetishization of her people. ""[You know, there's something I can appreciate about you, Endling,]"" Nemka mentioned. ""What's that?"" ""[You're usually, but not always, respectful. You would not believe the number of humanoids who've tried to grab my butt because they thought I wouldn't notice. Even curious females. But you've *never* had an infraction of that sort.]"" ""Um, thank you?"" ""*Hmm.*"" Nemka's low growl and the narrowing of her eyes expressed her displeasure. She huffed at Husczarr and rolled away until her back faced him, such that he could no longer talk to her. Husczarr recognized that a limit had been placed on how much Nemka could be pressed for information, and wisely chose to back off before she got too agitated. Something intensely bothered Husczarr. Nemka's claim that he never got handsy with her was incorrect as of that morning, unless, of course, she simply didn't consider his actions scandalous. But that stood in contradiction to the fact that Nemka had figured out what ""positive reinforcement"" meant. Unless, of course, she was being sarcastic. His caretaker, that is, his current one, had always been antagonistic. This was counter to the museum's goals, though Husczarr didn't know it. Nemka specifically had been accepted as part of a program to increase endling-caretaker cohesion after the dolphin incident, but Husczarr always thought they'd hired the girl with the big booty because she'd gotten in the hiring agent's pants, or something like that. Not to mention, Rentahfsza had called Husczarr a pervert for knowing about the kinetic qualities of Nemka's endowments. It was definitely sarcasm. Right? Trying to unscramble the meanings of extraterrestrial nuance was going to be the death of him."
19,vulnerability,HFY,[Tales From the Terran Republic] Species Guide,1,exh6oe,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/exh6oe/tales_from_the_terran_republic_species_guide/,2020-02-02 13:20:09,"I have compiled descriptions from the comments as well as added some new material describing the various species that have shown up thus far. I think I got most of them but if I left one out or you have any additional questions please feel free to let me know The rest of the series can be found [here](URL \*** Here, in order of appearance are the various races of TFtTR. Zuush: The z'uush are roughly 3/4 human height and on average about the same mass. They bear a strong resemblance to an arthropod though that resemblance is only superficial. They are covered in thick black segmented overlapping chitinous plates with a large sturdy back plate protecting their vitals from behind. They have two large strong manipulating arms terminating in four independently articulated claws with a number of smaller manipulators clustered along the center of their torso where the large chitin plates of their back and sides meet. They walk on four arms similar in size and strength as their ""arms"" with a distinct scuttling motion. Their heads can only be described as bizarre with twelve eyestalks clustered on the top and large mandibles dominating the front of their ""face"". They look scary but the vast majority of z'uush are meek and extremely mild-tempered. There is a weird quirk of their nervous system though. If subjected to enough stress for a long enough time they will ""alter"". They will experience extensive changes to their brain, central nervous system, and body that result in them becoming very dangerous. The z'uush know how to inhibit this transformation and the government of their home system outlawed z'uush becoming altered. Their treatment of this ""condition"" is incredibly inhumane so an altered z'uush would have to be subdued or killed. One of the big problems the z'uush government had during the insurrection is that the rebel z'uush altered en-masse and the government suddenly found itself having to fight an army of ""super-z'uush"". It was widely thought that altered z'uush were too violent and too erratic to manage and that may very well be the case but it turns out that they can work together quite well and that the worst of the insanity seems to wear off as an individual z'uush gets used to being what is in essence a completely different life form. They still look the same. A z'uush can tell the difference but nobody else can. There is an interesting theory concerning this change. Several of the altered with a more scientific focus have put forward the theory that becoming altered is in fact the final stage of the zuush maturation process. In their early history the stresses that trigger alteration would be commonplace and alteration would be an almost certainty. Kalesh: The tough and versatile kalesh are the Terran humans sister race. They fought the Juon in a war of independence the same time as the Sol humans did and after they both won they allied to form the Terran Republic. The kalesh are the most ""alien"" looking of the bunch. They have a central squat thick central core with large flippers at the bottom and are surrounded by long thick flexible arms terminating in wide six fingered ""hands"" with a wide thick flexible palm. At the top they have four long eyestalks each bearing a large eye. They look a lot like a root vegetable actually. They don't look it but they can be surprisingly fast and light on their ""feet"" since their flippers are strong enough to bear their entire body weight plus some when they flex. Their coloration goes from earthy greens to browns with some mottling possible. They consider a mottled multi-colored skin tone to be very attractive when it occurs. They are reserved by nature to the point of being a bit ""stuffy"". As stated they really like service positions but it's not because they feel themselves to be subordinate to anyone or anything. They just like them. Anyone who thinks they are pushovers because of it is in for a surprise (like the entire Juon empire was once they pushed them just a little bit too far). Pol-ka: These amusing looking people are appx 1.5 meters tall, bipedal, with a four clawed pincer at the end of each arm. Their body is covered by a dense short fur that appears to be velvet if fastidiously groomed or more usually felt. This plus their protruding eyes and large mouths makes them bear a good and unfortunate resemblance to muppets, which is one of the derisive terms by which they are called by Terrans. They also have four to eight inflatable cylindrical protrusions on the top of their head. This crest bears an unfortunate resemblance to a certain part of the human anatomy leading to their second nickname, peckerheads. As far as temperament goes they are for the most part a polite unassuming race (if a bit excitable) though as with any people you have your assholes. One of these was the Zaran systems former councilor K-shal-ta. At present he is serving a twenty-five year sentence for a laundry list of crimes due to his involvement in the single greatest security breach in Federation history thanks to Shelias gang. Hes hoping that his homeworld will have forgiven/forgotten him a quarter of a century from now. (not likely). A lot of Pol-ka are in government service either as cogs in the bureaucracy or in the military where they serve with honor and do very well as enlisted. As officers they are very competent but never reach the highest ranks. You will probably never see a pol-ka commanding a warship for example. Their society is quite stratified and their economy is a bit stagnant. There isnt a lot of opportunity for those who wish more out of their lives. Therefore, those who do want to improve their lot often leave and the government is a huge employer. Adding to their economic woes, their home system was paid a visit by the Retribution during the Republic War. They made the mistake of welcoming a large number of human refugees when the porkies first entered the Federation (in part for the tax credits and grants). Being labeled a porkie planet put them in on the gold list. Their system was damaged very very badly. It will take them decades to rebuild. The Republic might have done them a favor in the long run. The reconstruction has generated a lot of new jobs and the influx of disaster recovery funds is finding its way into the hands of skilled trades and entrepreneurs giving them a much needed boost. The destruction of a huge percentage of the economy has also encouraged many take the leap and leave their system in search of opportunities elsewhere. They are making a name for themselves as good reliable workers and skilled tradesmen as well as further increasing their representation in the Federation government and military. As of now their future is uncertain but they are surprisingly resilient bunch of muppets and are doing better than most species who got the deluxe package during the war. Strangely enough they dont bear the Federation humans that much ill will making the distinction between the common working stiff and the assholes running the show. In fact, the current councilor of the Zaran system is a human for the first time in its history. Threen: The threen are a large bipedal creature with four muscular arms slightly taller than a human on average. They are a mammalian like critter with a protruding jaw, large nostrilled snout, and small eyes protected by a heavy brow ridge. They come in a wide range of hues with their version of melanin having a dark purple coloration instead of our brown. They are hairless except for their skull and a stripe down their back. Their home system is, for lack of a better word, a dump. Its a corporate oligarchy ruled by blind and merciless capitalism. There are little to no social safety nets save what the Federation provides and that is pretty scant because the programs are rife with misappropriation and corruption. Organized crime is unchecked and sadly almost a good thing since they tend to take better care of their neighborhoods than the actual government does. People in need often turn to the mob instead of the government. As a result any threen who can usually leaves. They are a very commonly encountered race in the Federation in every role imaginable with many serving in the military where they excel as soldiers and ship crewmen. They are also excellent labor due to their strength and endurance. They also are quite well represented in the criminal element. Xvli: The xvli are vaguely humanoid in the sense that they are bipedal creatures with two arms that walk upright. That's about it. They superficially resemble a Terran rabbit but there are significant physical differences a thick coat of fluffy soft fur conceals most of those and further reinforce the image of a walking rabbit. Their legs are quite long, much longer than a human's when fully extended and capable of some truly amazing leaps. They normally keep their legs somewhat folded and tend to ""squat"" under normal circumstances since it's hard for them to keep their balance when the legs are completely extended. They tend to move with a bouncing motion when they walk and will actually hop short distances rather than stride. Their bodies are lean and flexible, much leaner than it appears due to all of the fur. Females nurse their young and possess two small (A-cup to B-cup) breasts on their abdomen. Even for the most endowed xvli, these are completely concealed by their fur. Their heads are more elongated than a human's with long floppy ears that they can either allow to flop or they can hold fully extended. They do have whiskers and ""cute"" nose. Their teeth are due to diet similar to a rabbits but they also have short omnivorous fangs on either side of their incisors. (You really don't want to get bitten) A notable feature is that they possess long very sharp retractable claws. Each hand and foot has three of them. The claws for their arms are significantly longer than the ones for their feet. These claws are big source of pride and are intricately decorated with the designs denoting societal status or rank. Members of the xvli military have theirs metal shod and razor sharp. Even unshod these claws are very dangerous. Due to biology and temperament they are human-tier as far as a physical threat goes. Most of the Federation treat them with extreme caution putting them in the same category as a human or a drax. They are considered one of the Federations problem children. The reputation is well deserved. They never especially wished to join the Federation but as the Federation grew they found themselves completely surrounded with all of their former trade partners becoming members. They finally decided to join so that they could move freely in space without hassles and trade without some pretty steep tariffs. They ignore a lot of Federation regulations especially where it comes to the maximum size of their (cough) planetary defense forces. The xvli have a very large, very well equipped, very well trained, and very dangerous army and navy. Their first contact with another sapient species was when they were attacked in an attempt to subjugate their system. They were caught flat footed with a very undersized military. After they completely destroyed their attackers they made the decision to never be at that sort of disadvantage again. They once had a vast trade empire but eventually the Federation imposed severe sanctions on them due to them not disarming to the mandated levels. This ended the xvli trade empire for good. After the sanctions were lifted because the xvli started dealing with the Empire and there was a serious push for succession from the Federation the xvli focused on complete economic self-sufficiency instead of rebuilding their trade routes. They do engage in trade but mostly sell rather than buy what they do buy is from the Empire. They blatantly ignore tariffs. The Federation lets this slide. They treat the xvli very carefully. The xvli were rapidly expanding their military and inches away from leaving the Federation when the sanctions were hastily lifted. They were fully prepared to fight. As of now the xvli are still members of the Federation but dont like them very much. Your average xvli cant stand the Feds and there is virtually no Federation presence in the xvli home system. They pay their dues and thats it. There are xvli working for the Federation but not all that many and virtually none in the military. There are a fair number of xvli working in the civilian sector especially in banking and other financial roles. There are also a lot of xvli entrepreneurs. Juon: The ruling race of the Juon Empire. The juon are one of those examples of parallel evolution. They look like octopi. They evolved along the same lines as an octopus but they diverged as they became more and more interested in land. They are now capable of living completely on land though they still prefer to at least be moist if they have the chance. Their tentacles are stronger since they bear the entire creature's weight on solid ground and have tapered to very fine tips to better manipulate objects. Their body and head are also much more muscular for the same reasons. They have retained their chromatophores which they use in communication (usually basic emotions) between each other. Their military, especially their elite nightguard units, excel in using their chromatophores in camouflage and in more complex silent communication. They are roughly the same mass as a human. A height comparison is difficult due to the vastly different body structure but if you laid one out with its tentacles straight they would on average be one and a quarter times as long as a human. There is a lot of variance individual to individual. They rule a massive Empire and do it quite well. They are masters of bureaucracy and show what is possible when the system is fairly and efficiently run. Their subject systems and races are happy and very loyal to the Empire. The government does have one key vulnerability, the competence and character of the Emperor and other high lords. Before the Terran War of Independence a lot of the actual laws were very archaic and gave broad sweeping powers to the Emperor and nobility. After the madness that was the independence wars and the totally corrupt and incompetent emperor of the time a massive updating of all laws and sweeping reforms have changed that and have brought the actual laws in line with what was customary and expected. The current Empress is known as the Cyan Empress due to the brutal savagery that she displayed when she deposed her brother and the lords that supported him (Juon blood is cyan in color and at one point she and her clothing were completely covered in that lovely hue). She was the one who brought the independence wars to an end and negotiated the transfer of systems and territory to the brand new Terran Republic. Her generosity and grace are what really laid the foundation of good relations with the Empire very quickly. The normally very powerful Juon military has been badly damaged as a result of The Great War and it will take years for them to fully regain their strength. The imperial shipyards are working continuously and likely will for decades. Their military is predominately Juon. They segregate their forces with individual races completely crewing a vessel or comprising an army or a marine unit. They do this for logistical reasons and design concerns. An Imperial human vessel is designed for humans for example. There is little friction between the various racial units and the system seems to work well. Imperial human forces distinguished themselves during The Great War and are highly respected. An interesting note about the Juon Empire, corruption is non-existent. Even in the most tawdry backwater it does not happen. Even before the Cyan Empress created the office of High Auditor corruption was considered treason. It is worse than murder in their legal system and not only is the guilty individual going down, anyone who was party to it and anyone who knew of it and didnt report it is also in pretty serious trouble. Now, after the short but very damaging reign of her brother, it is doubly so and the office of the High Auditor relentlessly hunts down the slightest discrepancy. Its a capital offense. Demanding a bribe or misappropriating resources is suicide. The Mux: Only briefly mentioned they waged the only other successful independence war during the Juon crisis. They voted to remain in the Empire after the wars due to their faith in the new empress and a whole lot of gifts and promises (which were kept). They are a gray leathery skinned quadruped with a flexible spine and an additional set of arms ending in strangely human looking hands (centaur format). They have smooth rounded heads with a blunt snout with wide flat teeth that suit their entirely vegetarian diet. The Flink: Flinks are a slender bipedal reptile analog slightly shorter than humans on average. They are various shades of green with stripes, bands, or mottled coloration. Their most notable feature are four independently focusing eyes that constantly look about in all directions. Their system is currently in the grip of a very conservative theocracy with heavy censorship of all kinds. An engineering firm with offices on the flink homeworld did the controls engineering for the White Star. Jessie took advantage of their repressive government and traded a pile of pirated games and pornography (including some very rare live action stuff) with a flink computer engineer and software pirate for ships schematics, control software, etc. which made their plan possible. The Plath: The humble little plath are small, half human height at the most and very lightly built. They have smooth tough skin in various pastel hues with a light blue (like Sheloran) being the most common. They have thin limbs terminating in hands and feet with the fingertips being wide ""pads"". Their heads are large in proportion to their bodies with large eyes set somewhat on the side. Their mouths are quite large as compared to a human. The closest thing they resemble in our culture is the GEICO gecko except no scales, the head is a smaller in relation to the body (the neck and body has to be able to support it after all), and a plath has a short stubby vestigial tail. They are physically quite weak by human standards but are incredibly tough and have amazing stamina. The stamina may be due in part to a plath's stubbornness. They can be really stubborn and if they ""stick their pads down"" getting them to budge either physically or metaphorically can be an exhausting challenge. Their government is a democracy and they have a somewhat conservative culture. Their culture, economy, and their very souls are agrarian in nature with the vast majority of plath owning small farms that they operate using traditional, religious, methods. Strangely enough, their traditional methods of farming are very effective both from a yield and from ecological sustainability perspective. All of their produce is organic and highly valued. They dont produce a massive surplus but what they do produce fetches great prices and sells out immediately. Almost all plath live lives of quiet comfort, love working the land, and have ambitions no greater than winning the county fair. (This basksun berry pie recipe I just created is the best! Matron Harlorn is going down!) Yeah, thats your average plath. One odd note about their religion. Its pretty conservative and they stick to their bible but their bible works! In addition to the usual history, morality, and tales of miracles and prophets their bible has the recipes and formulae that the prophets used as well as a lot of other very practical information. The full plath bible is bigger than the old print versions of the Encyclopedia Britannica. Most of their medicine is still based on it and their medicine works and has worked for an unknown quite long period of time. Their educational system is well not that great and focuses on what the plath consider important so Their agriculture and child rearing with the basics (reading, writing, and basic math) thrown in. Any plath leaving their world (none really do except for one notorious criminal) are woefully unequipped. The Kalent: The kalent are actually three species, the sundrinkers, the hands, and the abyssal lords that seem to work cooperatively. Of the three only the sundrinkers come into contact with the outside realm as they put it and are thought to be the only species First there are the ""sundrinkers"". These are the ""kalent"" that everyone sees and almost everyone in the galaxy consider the only kalent since they are the ones that venture outside their home system (which is off limits) and have any dealings with the ""outside realm"". They are a long flexible fish between one to one and a half meters long (the oldest can reach almost two meters but those are rare) with a large head and mouth with retractable (folding) fangs and sharp barbs on their fins. They are a silvery gray in color with small bright scales. There is also a species of tentacled creature that are simply called ""hands"" they seem to be just that, the only one of the three species that have any significant manipulative ability. Jaxona said that they are the real reason that the kalent ever reached the stars or perhaps have any real tech beyond simple construction. They have briefly been mentioned as being engineering and mathematics specialists and are not a subservient species but a full sapient species and ""citizens"" in their own right even if many sundrinkers consider themselves superior to them (probably not wisest to say it to a hand's ""face"" though). They have never been seen by the galaxy at large and reside only in the home system and on the kalent starships where they play an essential role. They are a long two meter creature with a flexible conical shaped body with a skirt like fin that runs along both sides the head is the wide end of the cone and it is ringed with long strong tentacles. They are darker in color ranging from a dark green to a dark purple. Finally there are the ""Abyssal Lords"". They are a deep sea creature residing in the eternal darkness and high pressures of the deepest parts of the ocean. It's the reason why the thing is inside that crystal chamber. It maintains the extreme pressures of the deep sea. Both the sundrinkers and the hands defer to them in a very reverential almost religious fashion. They are three meters long with a large angler-fish like head and mouth with a single antennae that they can make glow with a pale blue light upon command. They are a pale white color with large milky pale eyes. They are the clear rulers of the kalent. For what reasons has yet to be revealed. They have never been seen by any except other kalent and even most sundrinkers may never encounter one in the flesh. They seem to have had worship almost imposed upon them rather than have compelled it based on what the one Abyssal Lord said to Jaxona when the subject of protocol was mentioned. The kalent are a very ancient race with a civilization that has lasted longer than some entire sapient species. They were one of the big powers behind the establishment of the Federation but sometime in the past they became disillusioned with the whole thing (I wonder why) and have largely stepped back from the whole affair. It is rumored that they possess technology that far exceeds the rest of the Federation and quite possibly the rest of the known galaxy. If so, they keep it a closely guarded secret along with all of the other secrets they keep. The Kreenel: They are a two meter high bipedal flightless bird with bright plumage and a hooked beak. Their feathery arms terminate in a three fingered clawed hand. They come in a wild variety of hues. The colors used to denote a persons caste and strictly defined roles but that caste system ended long before first contact. A lot of them are in government service in all departments and branches of the military. They are also encountered all over the Federation in any civilian occupation imaginable. Their home system is actually pretty nice. The reason they are so widespread is a natural wanderlust that makes them seek new places and experiences. They just like to see the galaxy. A number of them are in the Republic as well just for the hell of it. Their personalities are as varied as their coloration. For the most part they are curious and adventurous but aside from that they can range from absolutely delightful to a complete and total dickhead. Notable individuals were the former head of the Federation Security Council Gz-Kal (assassinated by order of Axlea) and Major Skree of Military Intelligence (in the chapter Farewell, White Star). There is also one in Federation Intelligence working on the task force headed up by Xree~knExZ@@. Detective Freela: Detective Freela is a member of the Vexa. They are slender bipeds slightly shorter than a human with smooth pastel pink skin, iridescent compound eyes, and two large wide antennae on their hairless heads. The antennae give them an incredible sense of smell that rivals scanners when it comes to detecting airborne particles and chemicals. This is quite the mixed blessing since she is a homicide detective. The Vexa dont really have a terrestrial animal that they are similar to but if one was pressed they are sort of a mix between a mammal and an insect. They appear like the wouldnt be that strong but they are very strong for their mass and more than one perp has found that out the hard way when Detective Freela introduced them to her friends Mr. Wall and Mr. Floor. They have a democratic government and their home system is about average as far as prosperity and quality of life goes. They are uncommon but far from rare in the Federation as they often venture forth in search of career opportunities. For some reason (maybe its the antennae) a lot of them go into law enforcement. Kolvacksa : He is a member of the Haruuun, a Federation race that resides on a colder than average planet. They are known for their massive size, strength, and thick white shaggy fur. Despite their cold origins and thick fur they are very good at thermal regulation and can easily adapt to most environments. They are a four armed biped two to three times the weight of the average human of their height and usually stand between two to two and a quarter meters tall. They are extremely proficient traders and are found across the entirety of civilized space. Their homeworld is a corporate state with profit sharing for the entire (working) population. There are good social programs for the few that are unemployed. A Haruuun has an instinctual need to be productive or profitable. The ones who dont work are either disabled or degenerates. In either case there are plenty of social programs to keep them from becoming desperate. A desperate Haruuun is a lot more expensive than one on welfare. Their home system is insanely wealthy due to the mega corporations and individual entrepreneurs. One interesting point is that they are one of the few societies that developed organized labor and the workers are quite well represented. In fact they are so well off that it is not unusual for a family or an individual to have an FTL equipped vessel and in a lot of families (especially trading families) they are given as graduation gifts when a Haruuun comes of age. They use these ships to explore and trade generating even more wealth for themselves and their families (who they usually buy the wholesale goods from). There is one other Haruuun in the Tales, Zora (Zoraklunsha) who is currently in jail on Terra pending trial. The Xneel: The xneel are a short lightly built insectoid race resembling a praying mantis with longer, sharper mandibles and prehensile hands instead of claws. Their coloration tends to be dark, almost black, with reflections of a number of different hues. They see in a slightly different spectrum than most of the races but there is enough overlap that they can get along without visors. In higher wavelengths they have intricate patterns that cover their entire bodies. They tend to be a bit ill-tempered and aggressive and can be quite dangerous despite their smaller size. The new head of Federation Intelligence, Gvz-Taa and one of Shelorans jailhouse friends, Txx-zzu (How was she supposed to know that there was such a big artery just sitting there unprotected in a humans neck. Seriously, thats just poor design.) They are a communal species, living in large arcology like cities on their homeworld. They are also a democratic society but their elected officials remain in office indefinitely unless a challenger presents themselves or vote of no confidence is called. This has caused problems in the past but a system of checks and balances does a good job of keeping the populace empowered. They are seen across the Federation where they have a rather bad reputation for violence and have a perhaps unjustified reputation for being criminals. Like the xvli they arent especially fans of the Federation and joined after finding themselves in a very similar situation. There are a few in government service for various reasons but they are not common. The Jaxa: Tizz, another of Shelorans buddies, is a jaxa. They are small, brightly colored, scaled reptilian like creature from the Empire. They are another adventuring species and their small exploration and trade vessels can be found across the Empire and all over Republic space. They tend to be fun-loving and can be a bit rowdy. One of them finding themselves in jail isnt particularly surprising. They are loyal imperial subjects and there are even jaxa military units, usually ground forces. One interesting note is that they take double dog dares as seriously as a Terran, another reason they often find themselves incarcerated. Tizz was dared to urinate on a True Terran in a starport bar Also, much like a Terran when a jaxa says words to the effect of hold my beer or hey yall watch this pull out your camera phones because things are about to get fun. Drax: They are large (between 6-7 foot or so) hairy muscular bipeds looking a lot like a cross between a mandrill baboon and a hyena though they have longer legs and a build suitable for waking fully upright. They have strong claws and fangs and can use both for deadly effect. Unless armored for battle they wear very little in the way of clothing and often will go bottomless (Thats why Kashs spike was so noticeable. Its was literally out in the open). They have plenty of fur to protect/conceal their privates though they really dont have much in the way of modesty. They often wear trophies on a belt consisting of remains of fallen foes (the more dangerous the higher status-- Human skulls, especially Terran ones are very highly prized). Their choice of weaponry is highly variable with each individual having their own preferences. They dont have a single centralized government or home system. They are organized in a tribal structure with each tribe living on a small fleet of ships or a space station. Some do form settlements on unclaimed habitable planets (unclaimed habitable planets are only marginally so). They have a well deserved bad reputation for piracy and other criminal activity since each tribe is pretty much free to do whatever they want with no oversight save for their chief or warlord."
20,vulnerability,HFY,[OC] The Day the Heart of a Megacity Stopped,1,e6xtn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/e6xtn5/oc_the_day_the_heart_of_a_megacity_stopped/,2019-12-06 22:55:34,"A looming shadow was cast over the megacity of Triumvirate, when the beating heart at its center ceased. One day, there were simply no more outbursts of orange lightning from the tower atop Triumvirates namesake, no more steadily paced bursts of dimensional static. One day, there was simply Silence. A dozen billion Novahumans stopped with bated breath, fully aware that something was wrong, for even those that had no other way of knowing could feel it in their implants, in the very gemstones that housed their minds. When the Transdimensional Displacement Engine stopped, so did all traffic between Triumvirate and its extraterrestrial and extra-universal colonies. No more exotic materials, no more supplies for the colonists, no more convenient zero-latency communications or faster-than-light travel to the colonies. Some were afraid, while many others were both ready and willing to begin emergency protocols - gather every single Novahuman capable of manifesting the iridescent lifeblood of civilization, the primordial soup of existence, the supreme power source known by some as Nilsen radiation, and by all as void energy, for it seemed to have truly come from nowhere. Indeed, the emergency protocols involved gathering nearly every single adult in Triumvirate and performing a world-shattering mass ritual in every sense of the word, using the citys own power grid as the ritual circle, to rip open a hole into the world between worlds and resurrect the T.D.E. The people of Novahome, and even more so those of Triumvirate were not meek sheep, they had fought for decades, some for millennia for the place they called home. Many died for this cause, once, twice, a dozen or a hundred times over. To them, no sacrifice was too great as long as they got to return to their homes and live their lives in peace at some point. After all, they had all the time in the universe and then some - it wasnt as if they were drawing only on the energy and resources of their world, for with each ignition of the T.D.E. and each trip, more new matter and energy was brought from the colonies to Novahome. Performing a mass ritual and risking total crystallization from void energy over-exposure, risking true death, that was not something most of them had to do before. There were certainly enough people with enough power and skill within the esoteric arts to perform such a ritual with little to no risk and less than a few hundred thousand individuals to bear the strain, but the common man didnt know that. The bounty hunter with half a dozen arms and two massive guns didnt know that, for he was only fifty. The barista with a kick strong enough to split a grown man in two didnt know that, for she was only seventy. The white-haired, mustachioed walking tank with a heart of gold didnt know that, for he was only three hundred. Not even the experienced runesmith with a thousand years of experience and a dozen spare bodies knew, for he had never considered such an act of self-sacrifice. Only, it never came to pass. For it was from within the Triumvirate itself that their salvation came. The dead god-machine came alive for the first time in a decade. It raised its four intact arms, tremendous arcs of red and orange arcing between its finger, and suddenly, a voice rang out. An all-permeating, wordless scream, a defiant roar into the cosmic ocean. All those who lived within the ever-expanding walls of Triumvirate heard it, for it was not sound or a signal, it was a vibration carried on the same void energy which permeated the megacitys streets, its buildings, its people, like haemolymph within the thorax of a great cosmic spider. Like the jolt of a defibrillator, a tremendous power power surge swept outward from T.D.E. complex. Were it not contained by the elaborate system of failsafes and inward-facing containment fields which had been built specifically for that purpose, it wouldve caused more damage to the citys infrastructure than the T.D.E.s failure ever couldve. Nevertheless, the system wasnt built to withstand this level of power output for more than a mere moment, and the damage had already been done - both to the citys failsafes, and the true beating heart at its center. ____________________________________________________________________________ An obsidian-skinned, vaguely humanoid shape stumbled through the maintenance tunnels under one of many hidden apartments owned anonymously by a certain well-known CEO. Its head was crowned with wicked horns and a raging mane of orange crystal. Ichorous, black fluid ran down its body and trailed across the ground, mixing with showers of extremely fine sand of the same colour to form a sort of putty on the ground. Its metal feet click-clacked against the stone-like floor, its flaming eyes and gaping maw illuminated its surroundings like some sort of perverted Jack-o-Lantern. Sparks of orange danced and crackled across what had once been its skin, waves of black sand falling off with each pulse. Step by step, the creature made its way to the exit hatch, and with an inhuman synthesized growl, it yanked the heavy-duty seal open like so much as paper tissue. The security terminal screeched and beeped at the violation, but even it was silenced by a stray tendril of unworldly lightning as it lashed out at in its general direction from the creatures upper arm. It stepped out into the alley, and a puddle of black ichor formed beneath its foot within seconds. It began making its way towards a secret back door which otherwise perfectly blended into the wall, and with each step, more of its exoskeleton fell away, exposing not veins, organs, bones and muscles, but alien formations of braided crystal, a mixture of red, orange, and yellow hues, violently rippling and pulsing with even the slightest motion. The thing reached out with its right hand, which was missing the middle and pinkie finger altogether, now only represented by vaguely finger-shaped crystalline tendrils. It seemed to shrink back ever so slightly when the expected keypad didnt present itself, only for another tendril of lightning to lash out of its hand. It somehow overwhelmed the secret doors mechanisms with its sheer violence, yet didnt damage it in the slightest. The secret door slid open with a faint hiss, and the creature entered a tiny, hidden room - an airlock of sorts, with an even stronger door at the other side, meant as a measure to stop exactly this sort of intrusion. Only This mighty bulwark yielded just the same as the one which came before it. Body shedding black sand, dark ichor bubbling up from cracks in its carapace and running to the floor, and an un-worldly, maddening force driving it forward, the creature stepped past the precipice. The soft, lilac and blue lights flickered on, and the house VI awoke. Welc- it chirped in an upbeat voice, only to cut itself off with an almost lifelike sense of shock. The firey-eyed humanoid craned its head upwards, then began to stumble its way through the main living space and towards a machine which resembled something between a coffee maker and a fridge, the brand Hagomune Y-3789 embossed on its metallic chassis in plain lettering. Without so much as a word, the VI dispensed a white cup made of ceramic-like material, and began filling it with fluorescent-orange liquid. Youre not supposed to do that unless the ritual fails, you know, the VI admonished. Someone mightve gotten it wrong. Put thousands in danger, she rumbled, reaching out for the mug. As she did, her self-repair protocols finally caught up, and the liquid nanites running down her body finally managed to consolidate and re-form missing pieces of exoskeleton. She unceremoniously kicked back the drink, and exhaled a tremendous cloud of steam. The combination of barely legal stimulants and biogel so good no amount of money can buy it kickstarted secondary self-repair subroutines, causing a coating of translucent orange jelly to rapidly flow out of the pores in her exoskeleton and form into a false coating of soft tissue, the very top layer rapidly becoming a matte, pale skin colour. Akaso reached for a second cup, and with a few steps in-between, sprawled out on a sofa. The holo-lens embedded in the coffee table came alive, and began projecting the most watched broadcasts covering the events which had just transpired, and which she had just single-handedly stopped. Nobody would know, not officially. But she couldnt have just let the people that put so much trust in her creations risk their lives. Shed go to a cafe and pretend she had no hand in it. Shed act like she hadnt just stared catastrophe in the face and told it No. Shed pretend she was the larger-than-life icon that her people thought her to be. Shed pretend she wasnt afraid. Sad. Lonely. Shed pretend she really was a thousand times more mature than other Novahumans of her age. Shed pretend the fame and fortune changed her, stripped her of vulnerability. Shed pretend, until she found the rare individuals who could see past the facade, past the riches and influence, past the raw power. Shed wait for those who saw that she was a demigod built from pieces of a broken child, held together by the sacrifice of a father, and still thought to reach out. Shed wait. And even until then, she wouldnt be alone. After a few minutes she got up, and made her was to the roof of the building, only three floors off the street - and yet, far above the megacity of Triumvirate, for it sat at the edge of one of its many monolithic skyscrapers, each containing a city in its own right. She took a sip of her drink, exhaled a puff of steam, and looked out across the blossoming creation of a dozen billion souls. A tear of black ichor ran down her face. A faint smile quirked her lips. She didnt have to bear the weight of the world alone. ____________________________________________________________________________ **[DATE] ** 383.5 Imperial Years [932 Novahome Cycles] Post-Heresy **[PERSONNEL] ** Chief of Xenocultural Relations and Research; Agulloz of the Thinker Caste **[BEGIN VOICE LOG]** I have lived among the Children of Nova for over five of their cycles now, which translates to approximately one and a half imperial years. In my time here Ive seen, felt, learned, and experienced things that, frankly, we dont even have words for. I learned how it is that these people so freely change their forms. Ive learned that, in truth, they havent excised the savage side of themselves, but rather compressed and chained it, only to release it in controlled, violent displays, be it in combat or even musical performance. Of all things however, I learned how different their view of life is. Just as we did, they obtained a means of avoiding death through aging, but unlike us, it wasnt through longevity and metamorphosis. No, they are constantly at war with time itself. Their treatment of their bodies as no more than hardware has given them an entirely different perspective. The people I would go as far as to call friends all own half a dozen different bodies each, each with a different build, different capabilities, a different purpose, yet united in a single, consistent aesthetic, each recognizable as the person inside. They switch these bodies out as we do with armor or weapons, the moment a module or an entire shell becomes obsolete, they either buy a new one, upgrade it themselves, or pay a professional craftsman to do it. It is this way that they cheat death - the relentless march of consumerism, held in a tight yoke by the truly draconian anti-corporatist institutions theyd put in place long ago. It is as though this future was meant to fail, as though those who remembered their home world clamored for the rule of oligopolies and corporate warlords, and yet, the children of this new world ripped the future from the jaws of the past. How they did it, I have no clue. Who did it, I do not know either. Why they did it, I am certain. They do not dream of the future and study the past in the same way those that came before them did. When you live among them, you find yourself living day to day as though each could be your last, only to find youve lived a thousand years."
21,vulnerability,HFY,Store-bought neurotransmitters are fine.,1,ebd0ei,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/ebd0ei/storebought_neurotransmitters_are_fine/,2019-12-16 20:33:00,"Kolahn walked into Tim's office. The air was stale, and the dim sunlight streaming into the room revealed just how long it had been since the room was cleaned. At the far end of the room stood an unusually tidy desk and a bookshelf filled to the brim with documents and studies on psychology and various outlandish methods of calming one's mind. Between Kolahn and the desk stood a small round table with four cushioned armchairs sat around it in an orderly fashion. Sat in one of them was Tim; a human that Kolahn had seen for years, but knew next to nothing about, not that he had made the effort. One Tim's eyes locked with Kolahn's, the human spoke ""Kolahn, take a seat."" Tim gestured to the seat opposite the small table. Kolahn slowly made his way to his chair. His foot wasn't propelling him like it was a few weeks ago, his arms felt heavier than ever before, and every unit traveled was a miracle. With languished effort, he sat his weight upon the cushioned seat, his eyes remaining downcast. A moment of probing silence followed. ""You're relapsing."" said Tim. ""... I know."" Even talking was an effort now. ""What happened? You can tell me."" Tim's tone was almost fatherly, it was insulting. ""... I don't know."" Kolahn didn't know if that was the truth, but it was the easiest answer to give. Yet more silence; invasive, scrutinizing silence. ""Are you keeping up with your pills?"" Kolahn had an answer, but it wasn't one he wanted to give. ""Look, I understand; sometimes we have days where it all goes wrong, everyone has those days. It's my job to help you through those days, but I can't help you if I don't know what's happening. I need you to work with me here."" Kolahn could just feel the human leaning forward in his seat, insulting his maturity by treating him like an angry child. But he had a point, he was the professional after all. ""...No."" Tim's tone darkened ever so slightly. ""How long have you been off them?"" ""... About two months."" ""Why did you stop taking them?"" Every question asked inflamed Kolahn's blood like nothing else; he didn't want to be here, he just wanted to be at home. ""I-"" No. He has told Tim plenty, some of which he wished he didn't, but not this. Kolahn didn't know what would happen if he did, how he would feel saying it, and he wasn't going to risk that strain. He shut his mouthparts tight, tight enough it felt as though they were going to crack. ""Kolahn..."" That tone... That caring, nursing, mocking tone. It's all he ever used, never once raising his voice, never once showing an emotion other than care that Kolahn knew for a fact was fake. Tim continued. ""Please, I want to help you."" ""..."" Kolahn wouldn't budge. Everything about him hurt, keeping it all inside hurt, but he continued anyway, it was the strong thing to do. He was strong. He was. ""Okay. Is there anything else you want to talk about?"" What? He just gave up on it? That vile bastard didn't care about him at all! If he cared, he would've continued, he would've persisted! But no, Tim thought it was just fine if he ""moved on"", if he ""respected Kolahn's boundaries"". That sick asshole! ""I WAS BROKE!"" Kolahn roared his answer, threatening to snap the wood holding his chair together as he gripped the armrests. Tim's face didn't change, no emotion, nothing but cold indifference. This wasn't good enough, he needed to see something, anything to prove that it was an actual person he had been speaking to all these years. ""I- I didn't have the money for my pills, so I just didn't buy them. I thought I could make it a week without them. Come next week, I just... forgot to buy them."" It hurt to say it, but something about doing so seemed to take something out of Kolahn's heart, he hadn't felt this alive in weeks. ""But then, and I know this is coincidental, I just got better."" Finally, Tim's face changed. It was subtle, but his eyebrows grew ever so slightly closer together. Kolahn continued. ""And for a few weeks, I was okay! I wasn't 'happy' per se, but I wasn't pissed off or sad all the time!"" As he spoke, Kolahn's posture slowly righted itself, his eyes brightened, and the world seemed all that clearer; he felt like he was talking to an actual person again. ""But then..."" Kolahn's skin began to slowly bubble as he drew his arms closer in. ""Then, it just stopped. I just stopped feeling okay. I knew there was something there that was helping me, but now it's gone."" Kolahn's skin bubbled more fiercely with every word he spoke, his every inch tensed tighter and tighter. ""I've been looking for what helped me for weeks. I gave up on my pills because I know I don't need them, I just need to find that one thing."" Kolahn balled his hands into fists, clenching them tighter as he reached his pitch. ""Then maybe I won't be forced to take drugs with potentially disastrous side effects for the **rest of my life JUST TO FEEL NORMAL!**"" Kolahn raised his arms, ready to bring them down and release everything he had bottled up, but he couldn't. Slowly, he withdrew himself into the chair, curling up everything he could, trying to fight the tears just behind his eyes. He sobbed dryly, unable to fight how he felt anymore. But it didn't feel any better, if anything, he had just made himself vulnerable, more vulnerable than he had ever been. And so Kolahn sat there; sad, angry, and trying to regain his composure before Tim could break him down any more. He stayed like that for what felt to him like hours, unable to build himself back up, still submerged in everything he had laid bare; he thought he heard Tim say something, but it sounded like nothing more than a weak drone. Then he felt it, Tim's hand on his back. Time seemed to freeze, and everything Kolahn felt solidified into one emotion: Rage. Rage at himself, rage at the world, and rage at this one man for thinking he could empathize with him. He wasn't even the same species! ""**GET OFF ME!**"" Before Kolahn knew what he was doing, he span around in the chair, and slammed his fist into the human's stomach, sending him reeling into the wall directly behind him. Tim collapsed to the floor, gasping. Kolahn seethed with anger, feeling bolstered by his defiance against... against what? His eyes widened as he realized what he had done. All the colour fell from his skin, his jaw laid slack as he took in the results of his impassioned act. ""I-"" He couldn't find words to justify it, there was no justifying it. He looked to the door and back to Tim, he felt the door pull at him, begging him to run; every fiber of his being was telling him to run. But he didn't. Tentatively, he climbed over the arm rest and down onto the floor, inching his way closer to Tim. Tim opened his eyes, and Kolahn froze as they locked onto him. What was he going to say? What was he going to do? Why did he hold out his hand? Tim's eyes, scrunched with pain as they were, held no malice. Nothing about the human's form showed signs of aggression, just vulnerability; raw, trusting vulnerability. With a moment of hesitation, Kolahn took the man's hand and helped lift him to his feet, steadying him as he walked to his chair. Kolahn stood anxiously by the human's side, watching as Tim's breath steadied, and his winded coughing lessened. And then Tim spoke. ""I'm not angry at you."" Kolahn couldn't believe what he was hearing. He just punched the man into a wall, how could he not be angry?! This had to be another trick, something that he could use against him; but it felt different, it felt real. ""I can never know how you feel, nobody can. But there are others like you out there who felt everything you do in their own ways. Do you know what they did?"" Kolahn honestly shook his head. ""They got the help they needed, and they healed. Not permanently, what they have will never go away forever, but they got better. That's why I do this: I do this because I want to see people get better. And you're no exception."" As the human pulled a notepad from his breast pocket and began writing, Kolahn saw a side of Tim he had never known existed. The human had helped him through more trials than he could count, but he had never seen Tim this merciful, this empathetic, this caring. He didn't want to hold his tears back anymore, and he felt worse when one of them stained the slip of paper Tim handed to him. ""Hand this into the girls at the front counter, and they'll renew your prescription. I want you to keep taking them, even after we find what kept you going those few weeks."" Kolahn nodded and made for the door, not wanting to leave the office for the first time in his life. As he put his hand on the doorknob, he heard Tim say his name. He turned to find the human standing before him. ""Kolahn, I want you to remember that I'm your friend, and that I'm here for you. And even though I wish you would've handled it differently, I'm thankful you were honest with me today."" The human opened their arms, and Kolahn couldn't resist. The two shared an embrace they way two old friends would, and Kolahn went on his way with hope that life would get better. &amp;#x200B; Tim felt a buzz at his hip. He pulled his phone out of his pocket and answered the caller. ""Tim, I saw what happened on the cameras; do you want me to call the police?"" said Stacy, the security girl. Tim thought on it a moment. Consequences are a good learning tool, but when he thought about it further, there was no debate. ""No."" Tim heard Stacy's confusion over the line. ""Why?"" Tim eyed the clock on the wall to his right before pulling a blister pack from his left pocket. He popped a sertraline pill directly into his mouth and swallowed, just as he had done every day for years. ""I think I know how to help him."""

When you really got down to it, though, it was weird. It was weird for a person to decide to become a starship. Now she and Cujo were standing inside the command center of the ship that, only just this moment, Opaline truly conceptualized was effectively the body of her old friend Darcy. Darcy had chosen to incarnate himself as an avatar on a video screen, an image of what was effectively an idealized version of what he would have looked like as a human if he hadn't, you know, become a starship. It was weird. ""There's no way anyone's going to overhear us now,"" said Darcy. ""We're outside of Consensus Space. So what's your mysterious plan?"" ""I already explained the gist of it: we establish electromagnetic supremacy over a world on the brink of nuclear war, put a moratorium on the use of heavy weapons, and thereby force the two sides to come to terms diplomatically. Then everyone thinks we're great and Appetent helps me get into Exigency."" ""That's it? That's your whole plan after all this?"" ""That's all you need. It's simple because it's elegant."" ""I thought you would have something, you know, better."" ""What do you care anyway, mercenary? You're only doing this because I have more rep than you now."" ""That's not fair."" said Darcy. He looked genuinely hurt. ""Maybe not but you gave up your right to criticize my plan when you made me jump through all those hoops to get your help,"" replied Opaline. ""Is any of this legal?"" ""We'll be in their jurisdiction so that all depends on whether the aliens thought to codify a law against invading themselves."" ""Oh..."" said Darcy. ""Don't get cold feet on me now, you're supposed to be this Herculean rogue starship. This is exactly the kind of stuff you do all the time."" Darcy didn't want to admit that he mostly just ferried people around. He liked this other interpretation of himself. ""Right. You're right. I'm just keeping track. Making a note of it,"" he said. ""So I'm assuming you already know of an alien species on the brink of nuclear war?"" ""Who do you take me for?"" asked Opaline. ""Obviously I do. Onogo system please."" ""Which planet?"" ""The inhabited one."" * * * As soon as they arrived in the Onogo system Darcy let loose a cloud of microscopic sensor drones like a fart. They quickly began to spread across the planet and deeper into the system. ""You said these people are on the *brink* of nuclear war, right?"" asked Darcy after some of the data started coming back. ""Right,"" agreed Opaline. Cujo barked because he agreed too. ""How long ago was that?"" ""Well right around when I first contacted you, so a little more than a standard month?"" ""Yeah because it looks like we're too late."" ""What?"" ""It's a total nuclear wasteland down there. Classic autoannihilation."" ""*What?*"" was all Opaline could muster. Cujo nuzzled her leg to comfort her and she absentmindedly stroked his head. ""Don't be too hard on yourself, this happens to about 70% of all species once they split the atom."" ""I was supposed to save them,"" said Opaline, her voice growing distant. ""Hey. Listen. You're not responsible for this,"" said Darcy. ""You did everything you could to help them. Nobody else did."" ""What difference did it make?"" asked Opaline. Her voice was oddly emotionless. Now Darcy was sure of it; she had turned off a physiological reaction. She was stopping herself from crying. ""It's a big galaxy Opaline,"" said Darcy. ""These aren't the only civilization with nukes. We can't help them but we can still help someone else. Your plan can still work."" ""Let's do that then,"" said Opaline. There was nothing of her in her voice. * * * They had to make their way back to Consensus Space to get access to the computer networks. Here they both released clouds but of digital simulacra and autonomous computer programs to troll all through the various computer webs, data feeds, and other more arcane alien networks. After days of searching Opaline and Darcy reintegrated these pieces of themselves back into their primary consciousness and took on the trove of information they brought back with them. It was a little depressing how many alien civilizations seemed to fit their criteria. &lt;You should just pick whoever is closest,&gt; suggested Cujo. &lt;Less of a chance of them killing themselves before you get there.&gt; They did exactly that. * * * Darcy emerged from hyperspace back down into the lower dimensions close to the planet Ssphlebeleb in the Phlesses system. He farted out another cloud of micro sensors. ""We got 'em,"" he said at length. ""These ones are still alive."" ""Good,"" said Opaline. ""Is the EMFM ready?"" ""Bringing it online now,"" said Darcy. ""Give me a minute and I'll have complete dominion over the local electromagnetic spectrum."" Opaline let out a sigh of relief. She was half expecting these people to blow themselves up before she got there. Preventing nuclear war was stressful. ""Let's start monitoring their communications,"" said Opaline. ""They're supposed to be spoken word users so it shouldn't be hard for us to worry out their language."" ""Already on it,"" replied Darcy. ""And the EMFM is ready. If anyone tries to shoot anything bigger than a personal firearm I'll be able to see it and stop it. Well, the autonomous program I set up to monitor for these things will. I have better things to do."" ""Let's just limit ourselves to ICBMs for the time being,"" said Opaline. ""Wait until we can tell them what we're doing before we go all in."" ""Right,"" agreed Darcy. ""Things are finally coming together,"" said Opaline, smiling mischievously. * * * Thebel flicked tongues out from all four sides of his head nervously. The air had an undertaste of agitation and unwashed bodies. The small underground dome was almost pitch black but the air was alive with sensation. It told the story of six men standing around a table console entirely in over their heads. ""We need to move again the Lelala,"" said Blebeb. ""Hide our weakness behind a show of strength. Word could already have reached the Lelala of the situation with our nuclear weapons. That's if this whole thing isn't their doing, which seems like the most likely explanation. If they confirm that we have no means of retaliation they will surely destroy us all!"" ""That's what I would do in the same position,"" agreed Sses. Both Blebeb and Sses were mental defectives, Thebel reasoned. If they'd been given their way the entire species would have been wiped out several times over. It was no wonder that even now, in their time of greatest vulnerability, they agitate for aggression. ""The risk is too great,"" said Phelessel. ""The last thing we should do at this moment is provoke the enemy."" ""We should prepare an overwhelming strike with conventional weapons,"" suggested Sashess. ""Then the moment we suspect the Lelala have learned of our weakness we attack."" ""That will be of little help while our cities are burning in atomic fire,"" hissed Blebeb. While the others argued Thebel felt the small communicator in his third audial canal buzz. He knew his assistants would only have forwarded a maximum-priority call under the current circumstances. ""Pholess Thebel,"" said a voice Thebel didn't recognize. ""This is Gless with the Institute of Xenological Affairs."" ""Never heard of it,"" said Thebel, quietly. ""I am too busy to talk. My assistants can deal with whatever your issue is."" ""This is important,"" continued Gless, his words running together in his haste to get them out. ""I think I know the cause of... the current situation with our... weapons systems. No, in fact I know what the cause is."" ""Don't waste time. What is it?"" ""Aliens."" * * * &lt;Do you think it's fine?&gt; asked Opaline. &lt;Be honest.&gt; &lt;I think it's perfectly fine,&gt; replied Cujo. &lt;You sure?&gt; &lt;I don't write a lot of speeches I'm not the expert.&gt; ""Okay,"" said Opaline. ""Go with that then."" ""Sending now,"" said Darcy. ""And I'm increasing my weapons nullification to anything large enough for me to detect."" The message went out, over all frequencies and through all means of wireless communication (as well as several devices that weren't strictly designed for it). The translation was broad but adequate. ""This is a formal declaration of peace against the people of Ssphlebeleb. As of this moment I have complete electromagnetic supremacy over this planet. In practical terms I have nullified all large-scale weaponry planet wide. You don't have anything you could use to fight back against me and even if you did I wouldn't let you fire it. ""This is what you get when you start playing with nuclear weapons. Do you want to blow yourselves up? Do you know what happened to the last alien species who tried what you're trying? They blew themselves up. We just got here from their planet and it's a mess. You don't want to go that route so smarten up. ""I may be willing to consider lifting these restrictions and going home once you kids prove you can play nice. Let the peace negotiations begin!"" [First](URL"
23,vulnerability,HFY,Field Report: Enemy Weapon Efficacy on Human Allies,1,eeaurn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/eeaurn/field_report_enemy_weapon_efficacy_on_human_allies/,2019-12-23 08:48:31,"To: Hir'okx Military Command, Research Division From: Field Commander Hctib (Luran Minor) Subject: Enemy Weapon Efficacy on Human Allies &amp;#x200B; Sirs: &amp;#x200B; Since the intervention of the Humans in the Ascendancy invasion of the Luran system, there has not been time to gain full formal testing of the Human capabilities in the warfighting effort. However, we have begun getting extensive field data from the humans staged in the Gajdo garrison on Luran Minor, opposing the Ascendancy forces there. While the results of plasma-based and kinetic penetrating weapons are in lines with expectations regarding damage inflicted (though the capability of humans to overcome said damage and continue combat is far above expectations), this report will focus on the Ascendancy's favored weapon systems, the Occillatory Inducer and Occillatory Inhibitor. &amp;#x200B; As you are no doubt aware, due to the obligate carnivore status of Ascendancy warrior caste species, and the long held cultural taboos about 'scavenging' (consuming the flesh of creatures that were killed by another creature, or other causes), the Ascendancy prefers to avoid the use of kinetic penetrators, plasma weapons, biological or chemical agents, and similar weapons systems. However, recognizing the need for ranged combat ability in a war scenario, the Ascendancy developed a series of weapons designed to debilitate most creatures, allowing Ascendancy troops to close to melee range and begin ceremonial feasting on the live captives. &amp;#x200B; The Occillatory Inducer works by exciting molecules in the target area, rapidly increasing their rate of motion, resulting in an increasing internal temperature. As one might suspect, the Inhibitor works in reverse, rapidly dropping the internal temperature of the target creature. Many species known to the Empire have biological states that allow them to effectively resist the Ascendancy's Inducer or its Inhibitor. The arctic amphibious T'hradt are easily able to resist the effects of an Inhibitor unless it is a vehicle-mounted weapon at least. However, they are particularly vulnerable to the Inducer, collapsing under the heat in seconds when faced with a typical Ascendancy sidearm version of the Inducer. There are similar results for desert-evolved creatures being highly resistant to the Inducer, but weak against the Inhibitor. &amp;#x200B; To date, all known species have been vulnerable to at least one of the Ascendancy weapons systems. Most, like we Hir'okx, have no particular vulnerability or resistance to either one, but find them both devastating under battle conditions, especially in the attrition battles the Ascendancy favors. This was held as a galactic constant, like the fundamental coefficient of gravity. Until the Humans. &amp;#x200B; Humans come from a world of extremes. Some have even called it a 'death world'. However, this evolutionary background has given the humans an impressive resistance to the Ascendancy weapons. &amp;#x200B; The Inducer typically heats individuals to an internal temperature of \[40 degrees Celsius\], though vehicle-mounted weapons can raise it further with prolonged contact. The Human homeworld has areas which can routinely experience temperatures of \[46 degrees Celsius\]. Because of this Humans have developed physiological methods to resist heat. Indeed, their own bodies will attempt to fight off the numerous pathogens in their native environment by raising their internal temperature to levels equal to the Inducer's capabilities in order to defeat infections. &amp;#x200B; While under Inducer attack, Human soldiers have been noted to leak liquids from various part of their outer membrane, called sweat, which helps to cool their body. Humans of the 23rd Expeditionary Force endured \[24 Hours\] of continuous Inducer bombardment during the siege of Garrison 12. The only ill effects suffered were a minor loss of accuracy and rare cases of hallucinations, as well as consumption of four times the normal amount of dihydrogen monoxide. &amp;#x200B; Conversely, the Inhibitor works by slowing the molecules in its path, reducing internal temperatures to \[30 degrees Celsius\]. It also has an unfortunate effect on structural integrity of certain materials. However, as with the Inducer, the Human homeworld has prepared Humans for combating this weapon as well. Parts of the human homeworld reportedly experience temperatures of \[-17 degrees Celsius\] or lower on a regular basis, forcing humans to adapt to the chilling temperatures. &amp;#x200B; The first Human response to an Inhibitor attack is to induce rapid movement in their limbs and other parts, a process known as 'shivering'. The human has little to no conscious control over this response. As exposure to the weapon continues, however, humans stop this shivering response, and enter a drowsy state. During the assault on Garrison 80, the Humans present were able to maintain fire for \[5 hours\], until a support flight took out the Inhibitor cannon locked on their position. Some humans, notably ones from an area called 'Finland', were able to maintain a high rate of accuracy while suffering from the Inhibitor. &amp;#x200B; Recommendation: Send diplomatic envoy to the Humans in an effort to gain genetic material for splicing into new Hir'okx warriors."
24,vulnerability,HFY,The Adventures of Endling and Furfriends - Part 5,1,efmipx,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/efmipx/the_adventures_of_endling_and_furfriends_part_5/,2019-12-26 09:05:06,"Wiki First | Previous | Next In this episode: Introducing the helper Husczarr woke up hot in the middle of the night. It wasn't his first time doing so when sleeping next to Nemka, but it was a first in the chilled conditions of a Vespan spaceship. Nemka was no more diurnal than she was nocturnal, so going to sleep with him was more of a formality than anything of actual use to her, but oddly enough, Husczarr's favorite bed warmer hadn't moved at all. His back, which was laying against her, was sticky with sweat from the extreme heat she exuded, and the metal floor had conducted a fair amount of her warmth. Either as a blessing or a curse, depending on what mood she would be in if she was woken up in her beauty sleep, Nemka hadnt moved from Husczarrs side. Given the terms they'd left off on, the human wasn't willing to risk assuming that she'd be grateful for being woken from whatever blissful dreams she was having; Nemka was purring up a storm. Whether those dreams involved his mutilation, Husczarr didn't know. Unsure of how much danger he was in, being locked in the cafeteria with a potential predator, Husczarr looked for his pointing stick, only to find it, to his dismay, chewed up on the floor. He never put it away, and it looked like Nemka had taken to using it as a chew toy in the absence of anything else nearby. At least it was a metal rod and not my body, Husczarr thought, taking a good look at how Nemka appeared in her mating season, his one opportunity before Rentahfsza locked [himself] in the bedroom with her for the next week. The thick-furred alien was curled up like a cat, snout to tailtip, and laying on her right side. Unlike him, she needn't have any form of bedding, primarily due to the cushions she'd developed going into her mating season, which her fur, clothing, and limbs and tail (which were draped over her body) were unable to disguise. Nemka outweighed Husczarr by a factor of 9, so of course she would be extreme compared to what he was used to, but he hadn't expected curvature as wide as the entire medial length of her skull. Yet she wasn't topheavy, all thanks to those flaring hips which never went out of season. This was an entirely new concept to Husczarr, Nemka having a complete feminine profile. Sure, Nemka had always had a wide hourglass shape, but he had attributed it to the same source as her overall weight, that is, her heavyset skeleton. It hadn't been sufficiently stressed to him that this was not exactly the case: instead, Nemka was legitimately curvy, and he'd have to live with that knowledge. What he wouldn't've given to be a psychopath at that time, and be able to ignore her distractions and screw her over if need be in the name of humanity. But no, his abuser just had to get all nice and sexy. A disclaimer should be made: Husczarr was not a trustworthy expert on Vespan reproduction, and never had been. Though his ""literary works"" which depict Vespa in the throes of mating may seem to come from a place of understanding, they are incredibly inaccurate. For example, the reason why males and pseudo-males use their tails to mate is because they are transferring spinal fluids, not blood, and this act of procreation, if described by a real-time human observer, would by no means be erotic to human sensibilities. To harp on another of his fantasies, humping has no place when one's reproductive organ has to wrap around one's body in order to mate, and it would be an exercise in futility: Vespan tails, like mammal tails, have spinal vertebrae, not a baculum. They are always flaccid. Husczarr's discovery that Vespa reproduce more like xenomorphs than tetrapods is what caused the cessation of his smutty writing, and made him incredibly averse to Vespan nudity. His old caretaker's porn stash did the opposite of what it was supposed to do. But alas, Husczarr was only a human, with a human's nonsensical mechanisms of sexuality, so he was stuck with the unwarrantedly attractive werewolf lady for at least a few more days. And it need not be mentioned that said werewolf ladys first inclination upon waking up would likely be to end his existence, given her disposition the last time she was conscious. But there was some doubt. Nemkas current physical state and the bite marks on the bent pointing stick indicated that she had been awake before, and capable of exacting her revenge, yet she hadnt. It was best not to risk it. Husczarr decided that the best place to hide was one completely out of sight, with a wall he could hide behind. Given that the ship was reluctant to help him with a door out of there, he'd need to get creative. In the cafeteria, there were storage units, cupboards, cabinets, and other assorts of compartments which could be accessed by a number of species, but they didn't help. Anything he could open, Nemka could open too. So Husczarr settled for appeasement: he'd have to make himself as cute and harmless as possible to Vespan sensibilities without having it backfire. He ran it through his head. Nemka was in heat, and that increased his chances of survival significantly. This was the time when males would be moving between territories looking for pseudo-males, and when females would look, for all the world, like pseudo-males, so her typical intolerance for his existence would be reduced through expected male-female contact. It also boded well that he was familiar to both her and Rentahfsza, setting himself up in the phantom evolutionary role of a satellite male, a male who would return to one female-pseudo-male pair for multiple months. Yet that wouldn't be enough to get him in the clear: he'd have to act like it. He didn't want to follow the role all the way to its logical conclusion, but he did want to be convincing enough that Nemka would subconsciously classify him as a very short male rather than another species. The solution? Keep talking. Food doesn't talk. Husczarr fully decided that his prime directive would be to keep the translators on all the time, lest even the slightest misstep in fluent speech doom him. The other part of being a satellite male was less crucial overall, but would be the most dangerous when dealing with Nemka specifically: tactile communication. Females become acquainted with males who stop by often through routine touch, and Husczarr had already earned up a repertoire with Nemka in that regard thanks to their sleep routine. The issue would come with being close together when awake. In a word, cuddling. Husczarr needed little convincing to want to pet the fluffball that was Nemka, but the same could not be said when it came to actually going through with it. Ultimately, it would come down to a calculated risk. In order to make sure that Nemka would be willing to accept him as a male by the time that she woke up, he would need to initiate physical contact, without startling her awake in the process. Knowing how light Vespa sleep, this was a fantasy. Nonetheless, he had to go for it, so he'd have to disturb the sleeping giant. He needed an excuse to touch her first, but luckily, the near-arctic conditions on board the ship in night mode had already taken all of his excess heat and more, so he had that covered. Against all common reason and instinctual self-preservation, Husczarr used his own hand to rub Nemka on the shoulder. Her eye flitted open. Husczarr, rubbing his arms and shivering for effect, asked her, ""Hey, Nemka. I'm really cold right now. Would you mind letting me sleep with you?"" She said nothing, only continuing to stare at him with the one eye. (She'd been trying to think up a pun to tell him off, but eventually gave up.) After that, she slickly ran her tongue along the top of her lip, never taking her eye off of him, and emitted a bone-vibrating low rumble. Husczarr wanted to go crawl in a hole. It was only the most logical decision. But he still had a chance to make it out alive without bloodshed. Assuming that Nemka in her mating season would be much the same as a normal Rentahfsza, or a normal human, for that matter, considering the human lack of a mating season, he did what he knew works on pseudo-males, and held his arms out before him, in the same manner as a puppy would jump up to a humans leg. An intolerable nothing was exchanged between them for the following half a minute. And then Nemka turned her head on its side, like the rest of her body, and pulled her tail away from herself. Success! Using one of her hands, Nemka boredly unlatched her harness, whose tessellated segments had stretched apart in the night, leaving only soft flesh, fur, and cloth. Tentatively moving closer, Husczarr inched down to the ground and close to Nemka, finally huddling tight to her belly, which he silently swore was the softest thing he'd ever touched. He practically sank into her belly fur. With a soft sighing yawn, Nemka curled herself back up, Husczarr nestled within. Husczarr soon took back his judgement about softness upon discovering for himself that Nemka's bosom wasn't painfully inflamed, despite it being full of blood. It was his luck that Nemka was fine with letting him use hers as a cushion: she had rows of teats going down her entire stomach, so to her, it was not much different than what hed already been doing. Her drowsy purr returning, Nemka relaxed as Husczarr let slip a relieved sigh. They slept the rest of the night like that. What Husczarr couldnt have judged was that, by morning, Nemkas consent had been revoked. No doubt due to Nemka's inability to stop being a heated sleeping bag, Husczarr was awake before her, but he had no intention to force his way out of her grasp and wake her. He was too smart for that: instead, he thought nothing was off when he finally submitted to his curiosity and used the time available to investigate Nemka's jiggle physics. Unfortunately, his experiments mainly served the purpose of resurrecting Nemka from her catatonic state. Upon feeling his ice-cold fingers touch her skin, which had been toasty warm under her clothing, Nemka abruptly sat up, shaking Husczarr off of his prime position. Husczarr, for his part, broadcast the betrayal he felt, but Nemka saw that as him being a spoiled brat who thought himself entitled to her privacy. And she wasn't wrong, though her assumptions were far from anything that Husczarr consciously acknowledged; it was more that Husczarr had thought he could get away with something he knew carried a lot of risk. Growling out her disagreement, Nemka grabbed Husczarr by his wrists and hoisted him up onto his feet before her, as she stood and faced him directly. She bared her teeth at him, but Husczarr was simply bewildered. He thought he'd pacified her, and Nemka was going to ensure that he would lose his perception of her as a mere animal to be satisfied. Unsheathing her claws, Nemka began to squeeze his wrists even tighter, keeping Husczarr still. However, still only partially awake, what Husczarr's attention was focused on was that which was directly in front of him, and what was directly in front of him was Nemka's body. Typically, a she-Vespa's physical transition into her mating period is marked by a full night of sleep, as that is when the moon is out and when the body is at rest, allowing the stores of blood-equivalent necessary for feminine features to build up such that the female will awaken ready to go. Nemka usually needed a night, the following day, and then another night for her bodily systems to get everything ready, and it certainly wasn't because of a slow metabolism. It was for this reason that, as Husczarr had recognized, she was not entirely flat-chested since around noon the previous terrestrial day, when she got painted. Vespan clothing for females is well-designed for their shape-shifting nature, with elastic undergarments and, when it comes to the highly practical harnesses which are considered standard-fare, tessellated segments which are capable of being stretched apart. So far as Vespan women's outfits are concerned, as long as all of the sensitive parts are protected and the jigglies are held in place, it's all good. By comparison, Husczarr's t-shirt, hoodie, and sweatpants were an elaborate, tailor-made suit, emphasizing far more wealth than he actually had. The design of Nemka's underwear was simplicity at its finest: instead of having something custom-cut for her, or anyone else, both the top and bottom were exactly the same, mass-produced stretchy hoop of medium gray cloth. The simplest description is that they were very wide belts without a buckle, one snugly fit around her chest, just below her shoulders, and the other around her hips, directly below her waist. And the distortion of Nemkas attire around all her soft bits made Husczarr feel a certain way. Thus, it clicked. Nemka! Wait! Before you do anything, just as an idea, can I recommend a punishment I know will work? A growl. Could you try positive reinforcement?"" ... ""[I'm listening.]"" ""It'll take a lot less effort. Instead of stepping in and doing all of the hard work every time I mess up-"" Nemka hissed sharply. He was always messing up. ""you could put me on probation instead. It's quick, it's easy, and it's free."" ""[Probation from what?]"" ""Company, mostly. As punitive isolation."" Husczarr struggled to maintain eye contact as Nemka thought his proposal over, his line of sight routinely dropping down and back up again, and she noticed this. It took a lot longer for her than it had for him, but eventually it clicked for her too. ""Aah [I expected you to be more deceptive than this,]"" Nemka said, letting go of him and adjusting her top to make sure the cut of her clothes wasn't revealing too much. ""[Why not] ehdr- [suggest for me to do the opposite? Why be so honest?]"" Husczarr's face flushed red as he realized that he'd already been found out.""This, mostly,"" he replied, ""I knew you'd catch on soon enough."" Nemka let her lips part in a Vespan semi-smirk. They had come to a mutual understanding that, since Nemka's mating period had begun in earnest that night, Husczarr had appreciated her company. Nemka couldn't believe her luck. She didn't have to drag him around everywhere anymore: he'd follow willingly. The deal was not done, though; Nemka had not agreed yet. ""[And just what sort of company are you expecting?]"" she pressed Husczarr. The human hoped that the slight sway of her hips as she said that was unintentional. He mulled over how to explain it, and decided on asking, ""Care for a demonstration?"" Nemka tilted her head. ""Here, how about this: could you sit down for a bit so I can show you?"" Surprisingly, Nemka did so, sitting on her knees with her legs spread and her head at Husczarr's eye level, all so he could do what he needed to. It bothered Husczarr to no end that it was a sex position, and it terrified him that the only thing protecting Nemka's modesty was her tight mini-dress which could, quite accidentally, be lifted. He did not need flashbacks. Nemka was there, and she was acting all innocent and unawares of the ruckus she was causing, and so Husczarr went ahead. Moving slowly to ensure that she wouldn't object, Husczarr walked all the way up to Nemka before hugging her neck, pressing his head against her cheek. The intimacy-starved human rubbed his cheek and the side of his head against hers as the waterworks built up, and eventually came cascading down. Nemka had waterworks of her own as Husczarr sobbed so close to her ear, fighting to stop herself from drooling all over him. She more than considered taking the chance to follow through with her prison promise from the previous night, and was about to as she moved her own arms behind Husczarr's back to hold him still, had it not been for how Husczarr reacted to her grasp. Husczarr relaxed and leaned into Nemka, continuing to cry, not from mental illness, but from nostalgia, for the first time in months. Nemka had never seen him purposefully show this kind of vulnerability before, and had he not done it, she would have assumed from his usual stoic act that humans don't have interpersonal emotions. It was a wakeup call for her. In a change of heart she herself had never expected, Nemka used her arms not to accost Husczarr, but to return his embrace. She had seen a anger. She had seen fear. Oh, world-seeders, had Nemka seen fear. But this was the first time she'd seen any form of remorse. This is what she expected from a being that would never see one of his own species again. And as tragic of a story as it was, it didn't really abate her hunger. All of the alarms in Nemka's head were screaming, ""Food! Food! Food!"", but her conscious mind knew that such was not the case, and it threw Nemka into turmoil. At the very least, she knew she had to eat something, but she, for only the fourth time since she first met Husczarr, didn't want to ruin his moment. ""[Alright. I agree.]"" With the arrival of a bright new day, Rentahfsza was rearing to go. Go outside, that is. If the aliens were to arrive, surely they would have by now, and as soon as the lights came back on and all the doors unlocked, [he] was on the bridge, getting [his] excursion equipment ready all over again. It hadnt even occurred to [him] that today would be the start of Nemkas fun time, thats how much [he] wanted to get off the ship. And, as [he] had done the previous day, [he] also forgot to check what the outside looked like before getting [himself] ready. Rentahfsza was almost done with the first part, getting on the sock-like paw coverings that kept the suit airtight, when Husczarr also arrived on the command deck, side-by-side. That was unexpected. It occurred to Rentahfsza that this was the first time [he'd] seen the little male go somewhere of his choosing without a Vespan escort, and he came straight to [him]. It just warmed [his] hearts. After Husczarr ran away the previous evening? ([he] still wasn't sure), [his] hopes of buddying up with him had been shot, but the implications of Husczarr's return were enough to give [him] something to think about as he approached. Despite Husczarr's regular company, Rentahfsza had never figured that the human would take a liking to a Vespa. The species, not the Italian scooter brand. Everything was going to [his] plan with Husczarr, but from [he'd] learned from [his] earlier attempt, Husczarr wasn't much for physical contact, much less with someone like [him], given how Nemka treated him. Yet, Husczarr was willing to turn around and accept [him]. Call it hubris, but Rentahfsza thought that reflected well on [himself], since it would appear that Husczarr hadn't been able to resist [his] charms, after all. In fact, -- ""Nemka wants to know what you did with the mouthwash."" Oh. ""[That's all right. I'll send send her a message. You can stay here with]-"" ""Sorry, but I've got more to do. Any idea when we're leaving?"" Husczarr interrupted [him], coldly. Apparently old wounds had yet to heal, because Husczarr was all about duty now. Actually, if Rentahfsza remembered correctly, he might have been so since quite early on the previous day, seeing as even his fingerpainting exercise had some practical purpose. But what [he] certainly didn't appreciate was the fact that, for all his seriousness, Husczarr was acting as an errandboy for Nemka, which felt like the inverse of what Rentahfsza had expected. Nemka had sugarcoated her relations with Husczarr, Rentahfsza guessed. No matter what she had told [him], after enough time, their faade will erode, and [he'll] know the truth. But in the interim, why not make it more perfect? Rentahfsza decided that, if you want to win over the disadvantaged, offer them an out. ""Yterkis [said we'll be gone for a least a week,]"" [he] tried to respond, quickly changing the subject to, ""Husczarr, [don't worry about] Nemka. [That's my job. You just do what you need to do and I'll do what I need to help.]"" ""Thanks for agreeing to leave me alone."" Seeders, what manner of plant matter did Husczarr have up his ass today? Rentshfsza, in [his] next attempt to calm Husczarr, only confused him, because when [he]tried to tell Husczarr not to let Nemka force him to do things for her, Husczarr responded with, ""What? Nemka's not pushing me around. She didn't even ask, actually. I just think her breath smells like shit, and now my sweater does too. She had an emergency bulimic episode."" It was then that Rentahfsza finally noticed that Husczarr's outer layer of clothing was missing, which hadn't even crossed [his] mind up until that point because [he'd] seen way more skin before. ""D'awh[Is that what it is, pup? Come here, let me warm you up.]"" In famous Rentahfsza style, [he] scooped up Husczarr without waiting for an answer and gave him the biggest hug [he] could, face to fur. And then Husczarr hugged [him] back. Rentahfsza suffered yet more cognitive whiplash from this, being completely unable to handle the mixed messages Husczarr had been giving [him], care to apathy to insult to snuggles, only for it to get worse when Husczarr mentioned, ""You know, Nemka's got softer tits than you."" Not only was that out of the blue, it was a challenge. Nominally, challenge from Nemka, but unless she'd spent the night bragging about herself to Husczarr, which Rentahfsza knew was wholly unrealistic, it was really a challenge from Husczarr. At the same time, it reminded Rentahfsza that it was that time of month again, which bore a light growl in [his] throat as [he] considered the alternate methods by which Husczarr could claim such forbidden knowledge. ""[You little pervert,]"" Rentahfsza harrumphed in a Vespan gasp, giving Husczarr a clawed noogie. Of course, [his] hand got stuck again, intentionally this time. Husczarr sighed as he lifted his face to look at Rentahfsza, who stuck [his] tongue out in a manner often meant to initiate play. Rather than mess around with Husczarr's hair, Rentahfsza used the selfsame hand to pet Husczarr, the strokes gradually setting it free and causing Husczarr to relax way too much. The pseudo-male, sensing a bonding opportunity via grooming, didn't stop, continuing to use [his]appendages, which were like warm massage chair rollers to the human, for the exclusive purpose of petting. Blissfully, Husczarr admitted, ""Don't let Nemka know how much I liked that."" A threateningly ragged voice came from the entrance to the bridge. ""[Don't let me know what?]"" Nemka cut in in between heaving breaths, staggering through the door with her hand on the doorframe. Thank Nemka's attempts to look presentable for Rentahfsza, otherwise she wouldn't have cleaned up her odor or kept her nighttime dress, which was all the better in Husczarr's view. Rentahfsza, who noted her completed transformation with a familiar joy, would be inclined to agree. Hopefully she wouldn't mind delaying their hookup by a few hours in order to induct a new species into the Orion Arm Confederation. ""Turn kha vase iyraquall irirwir dak kraghket?  Nemka asked Rentahfsza, who was half in [his] excursion suit and half hugged 'round the middle by Husczarr, who was scrambling to make separate himself and stand at the ready. Rentahfsza didnt answer, instead using [his] HUD to engage the viewscreen [himself] rather than suffer embarrassment. All they saw through it was stars. Husczarr immediately jumped to conclusions: Why are we in space? Nemka boredly replied with, [Were always in space. This is called the night sky.] On the topic of the night sky, Nemka was a bit conflicted about how the cycles of this new planet would interfere with her own; one of the elements of the night sky which was absent in her view was a moon, and she'd never been informed if there were any around this planet. It'd throw her hormones into whack if she didn't have some form of tidal forces affecting her to trigger her metamorphases, and she'd be very disappointed if there was no moon to howl at. This was part of the allure of planet Earth to her people: not only did they not need artificial gravity, but they didn't need an artificial moon either. Husczarr saved himself from a facepalm through sheer force of will. Nice going, me, what with trying not to act like youve never had their equivalent of an elementary school education, he scolded himself. Rentahfsza hissed uncontrollably at Husczarrs mistake, which Husczarr saw as antagonistic, though it really was mostly from surprise. Deciding not to fall for another ridicule from Nemka, Rentahfsza asked the ship directly: ""Reh drek lulleleem pakar averrj? "" On the main screen, visible in both Vespan and English, was the ship's reply: they were surrounded by the planet's atmosphere, making it hazardous for organics to leave. Rentahfsza thought that to be an odd assessment, so [he] informed the ship's AI that the atmosphere's contents, pressure, and temperature would not be lethal with the suit [he] had, and the AI acknowledged this, but its judgement remained the same. Both Rentahfsza and Nemka were left confused. They were used to administrative AI obeying them and being straight and to the point. Husczarr was the only one among them, who, lacking experience with supposedly dumbed-down AIs, supposed that the ship might be using euphemism. ""Ship?"" he asked. A bleep responded from the translation speakers, indicating that it was listening. ""What is our location?"" To Husczarr, the screen read: Maintaining a course 3 czarshlaw (15.8km) above and tangential to the planet's surface. All eyes went to Husczarr when the Vespa read their translation of it. It dawned on the human that they suspected that he was to blame, because of course he was. Looking to defend himself, Husczarr put his hands up, saying, ""Hey, I was locked in with you two, too. Don't look at me."" Nemka was looking at Husczarr like she was about to go back on her agreement already, while Rentahfsza was taking a second glance at the viewscreen. Rentahfsza figured that they saw so many stars because the horizon was below them, and was caught off guard when a number of lights moved by in the dark lower portion of the sky. They weren't high enough for shooting stars to be below them, so what was that? He petitioned the ship for yet another response, and all three of them stopped what they were doing when it nonchalantly mentioned that there were more jet interceptors climbing up to meet them, though none had gotten high enough yet. Everyone but the ship AI itself was perturbed by the fact that it had to be asked this information, rather than having them be informed the moment it was, as had been done earlier. It hadn't told them a single thing in hours, not warning them about night lockdown, their ascent from the planet's surface, or the fact that there were even more native inhabitants buzzing around now. Husczarr was smart enough to ask just how many alien ships there were, and the Vespa's expectations were floored, while his were vindicated, when it responded that aircraft had been arriving from every corner of the globe since those first jets had spotted them. ""Take me to your leader,"" Husczarr mumbled as he considered what to do next. It had been a brief while since the AI revealed that it had been hiding crucial information from them, and the Vespa hadn't taken it well. Nemka paced back and forth as she fretted, an action that disturbed Husczarr greatly with its likeness to an impatient predator, and Rentahfsza went back to holding Husczarr in [his] lap as [he] petted [him], the same as when they went to the surface the first time. Nemka should've technically been the one concerned with ordering the ship around, but she hadn't taken charge or formed any semblance of a plan yet, and Husczarr would not pass up the opportunity to get humanity's foot in the door and be able to claim an imaginary award for having initiated a first contact for his species. Without the use of his tablet, though, he'd have to give orders in open earshot of the Vespa, only inviting confrontation. Husczarr considered how to get both the ship and the Vespa to do what he wanted. ""Ship, have you identified any more surface structures?"" he asked, looking towards Nemka out of the corner of his eye. She didn't make any threatening gestures, but she certainly said ""watch it"" when she turned her snout up at him and looked away, arms crossed. Husczarr got that she wouldn't let him have access to whatever she had if he misused the ship. At the same time, Nemka hadn't given him an approved plan of action. It was becoming extremely challenging to judge Nemka's intentions. Then, Husczarr got a brilliant idea. What if he asked her? But that would be taking the preferences of someone who acts like Nemka into consideration, so clearly that would be a terrible course of action. He wouldn't be able to rise in the ranks if he was only doing what others commanded of him. Initiative, in his mind, was a better-advised course of action than playing it safe. It took a while for the ship to finally report that a multitude of structures reaching above the height of the local plants had been detected worldwide, with some being clustered together into surface superstructures. Husczarr knew a city when he heard of one. ""Which of these structures is largest, and where?"" he asked again, quickly checking to see if Nemka was remaining passive. The ship immediately reported that at one of the equatorial regions which was beginning its morning, there was a giant set of structures around a central, tallest structure, radiating out for miles. ""Pifur evev fawla, splet!"" Rentahfsza piped up, taking the blame off of Husczarr's shoulders. The human breathed a sigh of relief as Nemka cut out her passive-aggressive stance. More importantly, Nemka had accepted a command from someone other than herself. Rentahfsza giddily resumed donning his equipment as Husczarr asked [him], ""How do you know the jets won't just shoot us down?"" That was Husczarr's greatest fear: Nemka rightfully getting pissed off at him because he almost kills them all over again. ""[The same way space debris doesn't shoot us down,]"" the pseudo-male explained nonchalantly. ""[All interstellar vessels are equipped with something for that.]"" Husczarr was getting slapped by all of this basic information. It emphasized to him that the museum's excuse to keep him had a point: he is an expert on his own bubble of experience, but completely helpless when it comes to living an independent, modern lifestyle. And it irritated him that Rentahfsza, for whom this was probably [his] first trip to space, knew more than he did. Nemka resumed her pacing the command deck as they descended. She was either frustrated with Rentahfsza for placing them at risk, or thinking up a new way to punish Husczarr that didn't break their agreement. Husczarr chose this time to test her commitment. ""Hey Nemka, can I be the first person to leave the ship when we land?"" he asked, knowing how she'd respond. ""No."" ""Too bad. I'm doing it anyways."" Nemka growled at him and stormed out of the room in anger, silently seething. Rentahfsza heard this exchange. ""[So, is everything easier now that Nemka won't hurt you?]"" [he] asked Husczarr as [he] lifted [his] arms, letting Husczarr get up as [he] sat up. ""How do you know about that?"" ""[Nemka can't exactly chase you down when she's like this,]"" Rentahfsza explained, cupping [his] hands in front of [his] chest to visualize [his] point. Of course, Husczarr realized. Nemka didn't lose anything by agreeing not to hurt him. She was protecting her pride by making him work for something he could be getting for free. But, sham or not, Nemka stepping down from her position of power was a boon to him, if not immediately, then down the line. She was still dangerous, but if he never held up his side of the bargain and didn't accept her rewards, he would never be close enough to be in danger. However, Husczarr's experience with trying to use the control panel himself had taught him not to assume Rentahfsza will always be on his side. Nemka had been bumped down a notch, but [he] had not. So he had to make a deal with both Vespa and then coerce the ship to do what he wanted. Husczarr had yet to put their contracts to paper and get Rentahfsza and Nemka to sign off on helping with his project and not punishing him, respectively, so that was next. But it really was an inconvenient time to ask, what with Nemka leaving and Rentahfsza getting in [his] suit. Husczarr needed a suit of his own, too, especially if the life support failed. Being from a pre-interstellar civilization, Husczarr failed to realize that life support paranoia was as well-placed as the fear of an airplane crash. It was well under a one-in-a-million chance that any of the ship's systems would fail, a fact which also lead the Vespa to err on the side of malintent when it came to the ship AI's recent sketchy behavior. At least, if the charts on the main screen were telling the truth, the ship was obeying them this time: they were headed right for the largest surface settlement worldwide. The trip down felt far longer, now that there were much higher stakes and Husczarr was paying attention. Fearing that the ship wouldn't alert them to an attack, Rentahfsza kept asking whether any aircraft were following them, repeatedly, to the point that Husczarr became quite annoyed. ""Rentahfsza, could you please shut it and find a silent way to talk to the ship?"" he asked once his nerve broke. Rentahfsza looked over at Husczarr, turning [his] head slowly, menacingly. With great poise, [he]strode over to be directly in front of Husczarr, intimidating him by [his] height alone, and then bowed down at the hip such that [his] nose was mere millimeters from Husczarr's. Correction: Rentahfsza's muzzle was touching Husczarr's face. Husczarr's dinner plate-sized eyes (to exaggerate) and Rentahfsza's dinner plate-sized eyes (to be realistic) were locked as Rentahfsza offered the following: ""[Alright, puppy, if you give me a little kiss.]"" Husczarr decided that bugging it out of there was the better option, and high-end speedwalked his way out of the bridge, down the spine of the ship and towards the washroom, in an attempt to retrieve his hoodie, washed or unwashed. But when he got there, he was surprised to hear Nemka in there again, vomiting up a lung if his ears were to be believed. He was not ready to rule out the possibility of a stomach bug, but he didn't think such an advanced civilization as the Orion Arm Confederacy would have random, uncontrolled cases of disease. If it was disease, as the smell from outside the washroom indicated, then could it be a containment breach from the planet below? Unlikely, given that most Earth diseases didn't effect Vespa. Frankly, this was making a case against contagion: there were only three organics on board, so the sudden and unexpected appearance of a pathogen was unusual, since one of them had to be both patient zero and a carrier. Husczarr chalked it up to hormones, and waited outside the door. Husczarr had many an incentive to let Nemka suffer as he heard her lurch, groan and whimper beyond her heart's content, but his humanity made him give in. Knocking before he entered, Husczarr found Nemka doubled over before a waste collection receptacle, clutching her abdomen as she gagged on air. She'd run dry at this point, but her body wanted to purge itself evermore. Her eyes, though lacking in expression, looked absolutely pitiful as she saw him enter. Alongside those of hunger and nausea, Nemka felt pangs of regret as waves of discomfort washed over her body, leaving all semblance of contentment behind. That is, save the act of strength she put on for Husczarr. ""[Hey] Husczarr,"" she said shakily, trying to sound as normal as possible. ""[Could you get me something to help with an upset stomach?]"" Understatement of the millennium. ""[It's a light blue container in the leftmost section of the cafeteria's storage unit.]"" ""I'm not sure I could find it."" ""[Renta will know. Please?]"" Husczarr did not like the idea of going back to face Rentahfsza at that time. Nemka eyed him for a few more seconds as he simply stood there, unwilling to stay or leave, eventually concluding that the human would need an incentive. Normally, she'd try a good old fashion lunge, but, not feeling up to it thanks to her health, Nemka instead used a finger to pull her top down slightly, which immediately caught Husczarr's attention. She then grabbed the band at the top and pulled it back up, using her other hand to point out of the door. Husczarr gave her an awkward left-handed salute and made an about face to get her what she wanted. Nemka was endlessly pleased with the results; perhaps positive reinforcement would be better after all. It was risky, teasing Husczarr to incentivize him, but he was the one who proposed it, and she didn't particularly care. Husczarr made it back in record time, which was impressive considering the difference in scale between him and his cargo, at which Nemka graciously said, ""[Thank you,]"" as she took deep, calming breaths. Nemka became a bit perturbed when Husczarr didn't do anything but watch her, smiling. The medicine worked almost instantly, and once she was able to breathe and talk at will, she stared right back at Husczarr, who showed no hint of fear at all. ""[What?]"" Nemka asked, Husczarr maintaining his smile. ""Aren't you gonna show me your tits?"" There was the risk Nemka was concerned with. She was at a crossroads: should she stay true to her intentions, or should she humor Husczarr in order to encourage further helpful behavior? She weighed her options as best she could, and found it to really be a question of how much she needed Husczarr's help. The deal was done; if she backed out now, she wouldn't have to make a fool of herself, and yet still get all of the rewards. Not to mention that she ship was probably watching their every move, even if it never willingly said so. Not to mention the fact that Husczarr's insistence and expectation showed that he still had yet to learn that he wasn't entitled to her. But he wouldn't listen to her if he saw her as a liar, even though she never said she'd do anything for him in return. In the end, it came down to personal preference, that is, unless one takes note of Rentahfsza, completely suited up, in the doorway. Nemka gave [him] a quizzical look as Husczarr paled. Thirsting for Rentahfsza's girlfriend was the fastest way to turn Rentahfszaway [him]. ""[We've landed,]"" he announced. ""[And a lot of people are very happy to see us.]"""
25,vulnerability,HFY,[T-Verse] Terminarch: The Adventures of Endling and Furfriends - Part 5,1,efmt6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/efmt6w/tverse_terminarch_the_adventures_of_endling_and/,2019-12-26 09:30:02,"Wiki First | Previous | Next In this episode: Introducing the helper Husczarr woke up hot in the middle of the night. It wasn't his first time doing so when sleeping next to Nemka, but it was a first in the chilled conditions of a Vespan spaceship. Nemka was no more diurnal than she was nocturnal, so going to sleep with him was more of a formality than anything of actual use to her, but oddly enough, Husczarr's favorite bed warmer hadn't moved at all. His back, which was laying against her, was sticky with sweat from the extreme heat she exuded, and the metal floor had conducted a fair amount of her warmth. Either as a blessing or a curse, depending on what mood she would be in if she was woken up in her beauty sleep, Nemka hadnt moved from Husczarrs side. Given the terms they'd left off on, the human wasn't willing to risk assuming that she'd be grateful for being woken from whatever blissful dreams she was having; Nemka was purring up a storm. Whether those dreams involved his mutilation, Husczarr didn't know. Unsure of how much danger he was in, being locked in the cafeteria with a potential predator, Husczarr looked for his pointing stick, only to find it, to his dismay, chewed up on the floor. He never put it away, and it looked like Nemka had taken to using it as a chew toy in the absence of anything else nearby. At least it was a metal rod and not my body, Husczarr thought, taking a good look at how Nemka appeared in her mating season, his one opportunity before, presumably, Rentahfsza locked [himself] in the bedroom with her for the next week. The thick-furred alien was curled up like a cat, snout to tailtip, and laying on her right side. Unlike him, she needn't have any form of bedding, primarily due to the cushions she'd developed going into her mating season, which her fur, clothing, and limbs and tail (which were draped over her body) were unable to disguise. Nemka outweighed Husczarr by a factor of 9, so of course she would be extreme compared to what he was used to, but he hadn't expected curvature as wide as the entire medial length of her skull. Yet she wasn't topheavy, all thanks to those flaring hips which never went out of season. This was an entirely new concept to Husczarr, Nemka having a complete feminine profile. Sure, Nemka had always had a wide hourglass shape, but he had attributed it to the same source as her overall weight, that is, her heavyset skeleton. It hadn't been sufficiently stressed to him that this was not exactly the case: instead, Nemka was legitimately curvy, and he'd have to live with that knowledge. What he wouldn't've given to be a psychopath at that time, and be able to ignore her distractions and screw her over if need be in the name of humanity. But no, his abuser just had to get all nice and sexy. A disclaimer should be made: Husczarr was not a trustworthy expert on Vespan reproduction, and never had been. Though his ""literary works"" which depict Vespa in the throes of mating may seem to come from a place of understanding, they are incredibly inaccurate. For example, the reason why males and pseudo-males use their tails to mate is because they are transferring spinal fluids, not blood, and this act of procreation, if described by a real-time human observer, would by no means be erotic to human sensibilities. To harp on another of his fantasies, humping has no place when one's reproductive organ has to wrap around one's body in order to mate, and it would be an exercise in futility: Vespan tails, like mammal tails, have spinal vertebrae, not a baculum. They are always flaccid. Husczarr's discovery that Vespa reproduce more like xenomorphs than tetrapods is what caused the cessation of his smutty writing, and made him incredibly averse to Vespan nudity. His old caretaker's porn stash did the opposite of what it was supposed to do. But alas, Husczarr was only a human, with a human's nonsensical mechanisms of sexuality, so he was stuck with the unwarrantedly attractive werewolf lady for at least a few more days. And it need not be mentioned that said werewolf ladys first inclination upon waking up would likely be to end his existence, given her disposition the last time she was conscious. But there was some doubt. Nemkas current physical state and the bite marks on the bent pointing stick indicated that she had been awake before, and capable of enacting her revenge, yet she hadnt. It was best not to risk it. Husczarr decided that the best place to hide was one completely out of sight, with a wall he could hide behind. Given that the ship was reluctant to help him with a door out of there, he'd need to get creative. In the cafeteria, there were storage units, cupboards, cabinets, and other assorts of compartments which could be accessed by a number of species, but they didn't help. Anything he could open, Nemka could open too. So Husczarr settled for appeasement: he'd have to make himself as cute and harmless as possible to Vespan sensibilities without having it backfire. He ran it through his head. Nemka was in heat, and that increased his chances of survival significantly. This was the time when males would be moving between territories looking for pseudo-males, and when females would look, for all the world, like pseudo-males, so her typical intolerance for his existence would be reduced through expected male-female contact. It also boded well that he was familiar to both her and Rentahfsza, setting himself up in the phantom evolutionary role of a satellite male, a male who would return to one female-pseudo-male pair for multiple months. Yet that wouldn't be enough to get him in the clear: he'd have to act like it. He didn't want to follow the role all the way to its logical conclusion, but he did want to be convincing enough that Nemka would subconsciously classify him as a very short male rather than another species. The solution? Keep talking. Food doesn't talk. Husczarr fully decided that his prime directive would be to keep the translators on all the time, lest even the slightest misstep in fluent speech doom him. The other part of being a satellite male was less crucial overall, but would be the most dangerous when dealing with Nemka specifically: tactile communication. Females become acquainted with males who stop by often through routine touch, and Husczarr had already earned up a repertoire with Nemka in that regard thanks to their sleep routine. The issue would come with being close together when awake. In a word, cuddling. Husczarr needed little convincing to want to pet the fluffball that was Nemka, but the same could not be said when it came to actually going through with it. Ultimately, it would come down to a calculated risk. In order to make sure that Nemka would be willing to accept him as a male by the time that she woke up, he would need to initiate physical contact, without startling her awake in the process. Knowing how light Vespa sleep, this was a fantasy. Nonetheless, he had to go for it, so he'd have to disturb the sleeping giant. He needed an excuse to touch her first, but luckily, the near-arctic conditions on board the ship in night mode had already taken all of his excess heat and more, so he had that covered. Against all common reason and instinctual self-preservation, Husczarr used his own hand to rub Nemka on the shoulder. Her eye flitted open. Husczarr, rubbing his arms and shivering for effect, asked her, ""Hey, Nemka. I'm really cold right now. Would you mind letting me sleep with you?"" She said nothing, only continuing to stare at him with the one eye. (She'd been trying to think up a pun to tell him off, but eventually gave up.) After that, she slickly ran her tongue along the top of her lip, never taking her eye off of him, and emitted a bone-vibrating low rumble. Husczarr wanted to go crawl in a hole. It was only the most logical decision. But he still had a chance to make it out alive without bloodshed. Assuming that Nemka in her mating season would be much the same as a normal Rentahfsza, or a normal human, for that matter, considering the human lack of a mating season, he did what he knew works on pseudo-males, and held his arms out before him, in the same manner as a puppy would jump up to a humans leg. An intolerable nothing was exchanged between them for the following half a minute. And then Nemka turned her head on its side, like the rest of her body, and pulled her tail away from herself. Success! Using one of her hands, Nemka boredly unlatched her harness, whose tessellated segments had stretched apart in the night, leaving only soft flesh, fur, and cloth. Tentatively moving closer, Husczarr inched down to the ground and close to Nemka, finally huddling tight to her belly, which he silently swore was the softest thing he'd ever touched. He practically sank into her belly fur. With a soft sighing yawn, Nemka curled herself back up, Husczarr nestled within. Husczarr soon took back his judgement about softness upon discovering for himself that Nemka's bosom wasn't painfully inflamed, despite it being full of blood. It was his luck that Nemka was fine with letting him use hers as a cushion: she had rows of teats going down her entire stomach, so to her, it was not much different than what hed already been doing. Her drowsy purr returning, Nemka relaxed as Husczarr let slip a relieved sigh. They slept the rest of the night like that. What Husczarr couldnt have judged was that, by morning, Nemkas consent had been revoked. No doubt due to Nemka's inability to stop being a heated sleeping bag, Husczarr was awake before her, but he had no intention to force his way out of her grasp and wake her. He was too smart for that: instead, he thought nothing was off when he finally submitted to his curiosity and used the time available to investigate Nemka's jiggle physics. Unfortunately, his experiments mainly served the purpose of resurrecting Nemka from her catatonic state. Upon feeling his ice-cold fingers touch her skin, which had been toasty warm under her clothing, Nemka abruptly sat up, shaking Husczarr off of his prime position. Husczarr, for his part, broadcast the betrayal he felt, but Nemka saw that as him being a spoiled brat who thought himself entitled to her privacy. And she wasn't wrong, though her assumptions were far from anything that Husczarr consciously acknowledged; it was more that Husczarr had thought he could get away with something he knew carried a lot of risk. Growling out her disagreement, Nemka grabbed Husczarr by his wrists and hoisted him up onto his feet before her, as she stood and faced him directly. She bared her teeth at him, but Husczarr was simply bewildered. He thought he'd pacified her, and Nemka was going to ensure that he would lose his perception of her as a mere animal to be satisfied. Unsheathing her claws, Nemka began to squeeze his wrists even tighter, keeping Husczarr still. However, still only partially awake, what Husczarr's attention was focused on was that which was directly in front of him, and what was directly in front of him was Nemka's body. Typically, a she-Vespa's physical transition into her mating period is marked by a full night of sleep, as that is when the moon is out and when the body is at rest, allowing the stores of blood-equivalent necessary for feminine features to build up such that the female will awaken ready to go. Nemka usually needed a night, the following day, and then another night for her bodily systems to get everything ready, and it certainly wasn't because of a slow metabolism. It was for this reason that, as Husczarr had recognized, she was not entirely flat-chested since around noon the previous terrestrial day, when she got painted. Vespan clothing for females is well-designed for their shape-shifting nature, with elastic undergarments and, when it comes to the highly practical harnesses which are considered standard-fare, tessellated segments which are capable of being stretched apart. So far as Vespan women's outfits are concerned, as long as all of the sensitive parts are protected and the jigglies are held in place, it's all good. By comparison, Husczarr's t-shirt, hoodie, and sweatpants were an elaborate, tailor-made suit, emphasizing far more wealth than he actually had. The design of Nemka's underwear was simplicity at its finest: instead of having something custom-cut for her, or anyone else, both the top and bottom were exactly the same, mass-produced stretchy hoop of medium gray cloth. The simplest description is that they were very wide belts without a buckle, one snugly fit around her chest, just below her shoulders, and the other around her hips, directly below her waist. And the distortion of Nemkas attire around all her soft bits made Husczarr feel a certain way. Thus, it clicked. Nemka! Wait! Before you do anything, just as an idea, can I recommend a punishment I know will work? A growl. Could you try positive reinforcement?"" ... ""[I'm listening.]"" ""It'll take a lot less effort. Instead of stepping in and doing all of the hard work every time I mess up-"" Nemka hissed sharply. He was always messing up. ""you could put me on probation instead. It's quick, it's easy, and it's free."" ""[Probation from what?]"" ""Company, mostly. As punitive isolation."" Husczarr struggled to maintain eye contact as Nemka thought his proposal over, his line of sight routinely dropping down and back up again, and she noticed this. It took a lot longer for her than it had for him, but eventually it clicked for her too. ""Aah [I expected you to be more deceptive than this,]"" Nemka said, letting go of him and adjusting her top to make sure the cut of her clothes wasn't revealing too much. ""[Why not] ehdr- [suggest for me to do the opposite? Why be so honest?]"" Husczarr's face flushed red as he realized that he'd already been found out.""This, mostly,"" he replied, ""I knew you'd catch on soon enough."" Nemka let her lips part in a Vespan semi-smirk. They had come to a mutual understanding that, since Nemka's mating period had begun in earnest that night, Husczarr had appreciated her company. Nemka couldn't believe her luck. She didn't have to drag him around everywhere anymore: he'd follow willingly. The deal was not done, though; Nemka had not agreed yet. ""[And just what sort of company are you expecting?]"" she pressed Husczarr. The human hoped that the slight sway of her hips as she said that was unintentional. He mulled over how to explain it, and decided on asking, ""Care for a demonstration?"" Nemka tilted her head. ""Here, how about this: could you sit down for a bit so I can show you?"" Surprisingly, Nemka did so, sitting on her knees with her legs spread and her head at Husczarr's eye level, all so he could do what he needed to. It bothered Husczarr to no end that it was a sex position, and it terrified him that the only thing protecting Nemka's modesty was her tight mini-dress which could, quite accidentally, be lifted. He did not need flashbacks. Nemka was there, and she was acting all innocent and unawares of the ruckus she was causing, and so Husczarr went ahead. Moving slowly to ensure that she wouldn't object, Husczarr walked all the way up to Nemka before hugging her neck, pressing his head against her cheek. The intimacy-starved human rubbed his cheek and the side of his head against hers as the waterworks built up, and eventually came cascading down. Nemka had waterworks of her own as Husczarr sobbed so close to her ear, fighting to stop herself from drooling all over him. She more than considered taking the chance to follow through with her prison promise from the previous night, and was about to as she moved her own arms behind Husczarr's back to hold him still, had it not been for how Husczarr reacted to her grasp. Husczarr relaxed and leaned into Nemka, continuing to cry, not from mental illness, but from nostalgia, for the first time in months. Nemka had never seen him purposefully show this kind of vulnerability before, and had he not done it, she would have assumed from his usual stoic act that humans don't have interpersonal emotions. It was a wakeup call for her. In a change of heart she herself had never expected, Nemka used her arms not to accost Husczarr, but to return his embrace. She had seen a anger. She had seen fear. Oh, world-seeders, had Nemka seen fear. But this was the first time she'd seen any form of remorse. This is what she expected from a being that would never see one of his own species again. And as tragic of a story as it was, it didn't really abate her hunger. All of the alarms in Nemka's head were screaming, ""Food! Food! Food!"", but her conscious mind knew that such was not the case, and it threw Nemka into turmoil. At the very least, she knew she had to eat something, but she, for only the fourth time since she first met Husczarr, didn't want to ruin his moment. ""[Alright. I agree.]"" With the arrival of a bright new day, Rentahfsza was rearing to go. Go outside, that is. If the aliens were to arrive, surely they would have by now, and as soon as the lights came back on and all the doors unlocked, [he] was on the bridge, getting [his] excursion equipment ready all over again. It hadnt even occurred to [him] that today would be the start of Nemkas fun time, thats how much [he] wanted to get off the ship. And, as [he] had done the previous day, [he] also forgot to check what the outside looked like before getting [himself] ready. Rentahfsza was almost done with the first part, getting on the sock-like paw coverings that kept the suit airtight, when Husczarr also arrived on the command deck, side-by-side. That was unexpected. It occurred to Rentahfsza that this was the first time [he'd] seen the little male go somewhere of his choosing without a Vespan escort, and he came straight to [him]. It just warmed [his] hearts. After Husczarr ran away the previous evening? ([he] still wasn't sure), [his] hopes of buddying up with him had been shot, but the implications of Husczarr's return were enough to give [him] something to think about as he approached. Despite Husczarr's regular company, Rentahfsza had never figured that the human would take a liking to a Vespa. The species, not the Italian scooter brand. Everything was going to [his] plan with Husczarr, but from [he'd] learned from [his] earlier attempt, Husczarr wasn't much for physical contact, much less with someone like [him], given how Nemka treated him. Yet, Husczarr was willing to turn around and accept [him]. Call it hubris, but Rentahfsza thought that reflected well on [himself], since it would appear that Husczarr hadn't been able to resist [his] charms, after all. In fact, -- ""Nemka wants to know what you did with the mouthwash."" Oh. ""[That's all right. I'll send send her a message. You can stay here with]-"" ""Sorry, but I've got more to do. Any idea when we're leaving?"" Husczarr interrupted [him], coldly. Apparently old wounds had yet to heal, because Husczarr was all about duty now. Actually, if Rentahfsza remembered correctly, he might have been so since quite early on the previous day, seeing as even his fingerpainting exercise had some practical purpose. But what [he] certainly didn't appreciate was the fact that, for all his seriousness, Husczarr was acting as an errandboy for Nemka, which felt like the inverse of what Rentahfsza had expected. Nemka had sugarcoated her relations with Husczarr, Rentahfsza guessed. No matter what she had told [him], after enough time, their faade will erode, and [he'll] know the truth. But in the interim, why not make it more perfect? Rentahfsza decided that, if you want to win over the disadvantaged, offer them an out. ""Yterkis [said we'll be gone for a least a week,]"" [he] tried to respond, quickly changing the subject to, ""Husczarr, [don't worry about] Nemka. [That's my job. You just do what you need to do and I'll do what I need to help.]"" ""Thanks for agreeing to leave me alone."" Seeders, what manner of plant matter did Husczarr have up his ass today? Rentshfsza, in [his] next attempt to calm Husczarr, only confused him, because when [he]tried to tell Husczarr not to let Nemka force him to do things for her, Husczarr responded with, ""What? Nemka's not pushing me around. She didn't even ask, actually. I just think her breath smells like shit, and now my sweater does too. She had an emergency bulimic episode."" It was then that Rentahfsza finally noticed that Husczarr's outer layer of clothing was missing, which hadn't even crossed [his] mind up until that point because [he'd] seen way more skin before. ""D'awh[Is that what it is, pup? Come here, let me warm you up.]"" In famous Rentahfsza style, [he] scooped up Husczarr without waiting for an answer and gave him the biggest hug [he] could, face to fur. And then Husczarr hugged [him] back. Rentahfsza suffered yet more cognitive whiplash from this, being completely unable to handle the mixed messages Husczarr had been giving [him], care to apathy to insult to snuggles, only for it to get worse when Husczarr mentioned, ""You know, Nemka's got softer tits than you."" Not only was that out of the blue, it was a challenge. Nominally, challenge from Nemka, but unless she'd spent the night bragging about herself to Husczarr, which Rentahfsza knew was wholly unrealistic, it was really a challenge from Husczarr. At the same time, it reminded Rentahfsza that it was that time of month again, which bore a light growl in [his] throat as [he] considered the alternate methods by which Husczarr could claim such forbidden knowledge. ""[You little pervert,]"" Rentahfsza harrumphed in a Vespan gasp, giving Husczarr a clawed noogie. Of course, [his] hand got stuck again, intentionally this time. Husczarr sighed as he lifted his face to look at Rentahfsza, who stuck [his] tongue out in a manner often meant to initiate play. Rather than mess around with Husczarr's hair, Rentahfsza used the selfsame hand to pet Husczarr, the strokes gradually setting it free and causing Husczarr to relax way too much. The pseudo-male, sensing a bonding opportunity via grooming, didn't stop, continuing to use [his]appendages, which were like warm massage chair rollers to the human, for the exclusive purpose of petting. Blissfully, Husczarr admitted, ""Don't let Nemka know how much I liked that."" A threateningly ragged voice came from the entrance to the bridge. ""[Don't let me know what?]"" Nemka cut in in between heaving breaths, staggering through the door with her hand on the doorframe. Thank Nemka's attempts to look presentable for Rentahfsza, otherwise she wouldn't have cleaned up her odor or kept her nighttime dress, which was all the better in Husczarr's view. Rentahfsza, who noted her completed transformation with a familiar joy, would be inclined to agree. Hopefully she wouldn't mind delaying their hookup by a few hours in order to induct a new species into the Orion Arm Confederation. ""Turn kha vase iyraquall irirwir dak kraghket?  Nemka asked Rentahfsza, who was half in [his] excursion suit and half hugged 'round the middle by Husczarr, who was scrambling to make separate himself and stand at the ready. Rentahfsza didnt answer, instead using [his] HUD to engage the viewscreen [himself] rather than suffer embarrassment. All they saw through it was stars. Husczarr immediately jumped to conclusions: Why are we in space? Nemka boredly replied with, [Were always in space. This is called the night sky.] On the topic of the night sky, Nemka was a bit conflicted about how the cycles of this new planet would interfere with her own; one of the elements of the night sky which was absent in her view was a moon, and she'd never been informed if there were any around this planet. It'd throw her hormones into whack if she didn't have some form of tidal forces affecting her to trigger her metamorphases, and she'd be very disappointed if there was no moon to howl at. This was part of the allure of planet Earth to her people: not only did they not need artificial gravity, but they didn't need an artificial moon either. Husczarr saved himself from a facepalm through sheer force of will. Nice going, me, what with trying not to act like youve never had their equivalent of an elementary school education, he scolded himself. Rentahfsza hissed uncontrollably at Husczarrs mistake, which Husczarr saw as antagonistic, though it really was mostly from surprise. Deciding not to fall for another ridicule from Nemka, Rentahfsza asked the ship directly: ""Reh drek lulleleem pakar averrj? "" On the main screen, visible in both Vespan and English, was the ship's reply: they were surrounded by the planet's atmosphere, making it hazardous for organics to leave. Rentahfsza thought that to be an odd assessment, so [he] informed the ship's AI that the atmosphere's contents, pressure, and temperature would not be lethal with the suit [he] had, and the AI acknowledged this, but its judgement remained the same. Both Rentahfsza and Nemka were left confused. They were used to administrative AI obeying them and being straight and to the point. Husczarr was the only one among them, who, lacking experience with supposedly dumbed-down AIs, supposed that the ship might be using euphemism. ""Ship?"" he asked. A bleep responded from the translation speakers, indicating that it was listening. ""What is our location?"" To Husczarr, the screen read: Maintaining a course 3 czarshlaw (15.8km) above and tangential to the planet's surface. All eyes went to Husczarr when the Vespa read their translation of it. It dawned on the human that they suspected that he was to blame, because of course he was. Looking to defend himself, Husczarr put his hands up, saying, ""Hey, I was locked in with you two, too. Don't look at me."" Nemka was looking at Husczarr like she was about to go back on her agreement already, while Rentahfsza was taking a second glance at the viewscreen. Rentahfsza figured that they saw so many stars because the horizon was below them, and was caught off guard when a number of lights moved by in the dark lower portion of the sky. They weren't high enough for shooting stars to be below them, so what was that? He petitioned the ship for yet another response, and all three of them stopped what they were doing when it nonchalantly mentioned that there were more jet interceptors climbing up to meet them, though none had gotten high enough yet. Everyone but the ship AI itself was perturbed by the fact that it had to be asked this information, rather than having them be informed the moment it was, as had been done earlier. It hadn't told them a single thing in hours, not warning them about night lockdown, their ascent from the planet's surface, or the fact that there were even more native inhabitants buzzing around now. Husczarr was smart enough to ask just how many alien ships there were, and the Vespa's expectations were floored, while his were vindicated, when it responded that aircraft had been arriving from every corner of the globe since those first jets had spotted them. ""Take me to your leader,"" Husczarr mumbled as he considered what to do next. It had been a brief while since the AI revealed that it had been hiding crucial information from them, and the Vespa hadn't taken it well. Nemka paced back and forth as she fretted, an action that disturbed Husczarr greatly with its likeness to an impatient predator, and Rentahfsza went back to holding Husczarr in [his] lap as [he] petted [him], the same as when they went to the surface the first time. Nemka should've technically been the one concerned with ordering the ship around, but she hadn't taken charge or formed any semblance of a plan yet, and Husczarr would not pass up the opportunity to get humanity's foot in the door and be able to claim an imaginary award for having initiated a first contact for his species. Without the use of his tablet, though, he'd have to give orders in open earshot of the Vespa, only inviting confrontation. Husczarr considered how to get both the ship and the Vespa to do what he wanted. ""Ship, have you identified any more surface structures?"" he asked, looking towards Nemka out of the corner of his eye. She didn't make any threatening gestures, but she certainly said ""watch it"" when she turned her snout up at him and looked away, arms crossed. Husczarr got that she wouldn't let him have access to whatever she had if he misused the ship. At the same time, Nemka hadn't given him an approved plan of action. It was becoming extremely challenging to judge Nemka's intentions. Then, Husczarr got a brilliant idea. What if he asked her? But that would be taking the preferences of someone who acts like Nemka into consideration, so clearly that would be a terrible course of action. He wouldn't be able to rise in the ranks if he was only doing what others commanded of him. Initiative, in his mind, was a better-advised course of action than playing it safe. It took a while for the ship to finally report that a multitude of structures reaching above the height of the local plants had been detected worldwide, with some being clustered together into surface superstructures. Husczarr knew a city when he heard of one. ""Which of these structures is largest, and where?"" he asked again, quickly checking to see if Nemka was remaining passive. The ship immediately reported that at one of the equatorial regions which was beginning its morning, there was a giant set of structures around a central, tallest structure, radiating out for miles. ""Pifur evev fawla, splet!"" Rentahfsza piped up, taking the blame off of Husczarr's shoulders. The human breathed a sigh of relief as Nemka cut out her passive-aggressive stance. More importantly, Nemka had accepted a command from someone other than herself. Rentahfsza giddily resumed donning his equipment as Husczarr asked [him], ""How do you know the jets won't just shoot us down?"" That was Husczarr's greatest fear: Nemka rightfully getting pissed off at him because he almost kills them all over again. ""[The same way space debris doesn't shoot us down,]"" the pseudo-male explained nonchalantly. ""[All interstellar vessels are equipped with something for that.]"" Husczarr was getting slapped by all of this basic information. It emphasized to him that the museum's excuse to keep him had a point: he is an expert on his own bubble of experience, but completely helpless when it comes to living an independent, modern lifestyle. And it irritated him that Rentahfsza, for whom this was probably [his] first trip to space, knew more than he did. Nemka resumed her pacing the command deck as they descended. She was either frustrated with Rentahfsza for placing them at risk, or thinking up a new way to punish Husczarr that didn't break their agreement. Husczarr chose this time to test her commitment. ""Hey Nemka, can I be the first person to leave the ship when we land?"" he asked, knowing how she'd respond. ""No."" ""Too bad. I'm doing it anyways."" Nemka growled at him and stormed out of the room in anger, silently seething. Rentahfsza heard this exchange. ""[So, is everything easier now that Nemka won't hurt you?]"" [he] asked Husczarr as [he] lifted [his] arms, letting Husczarr get up as [he] sat up. ""How do you know about that?"" ""[Nemka can't exactly chase you down when she's like this,]"" Rentahfsza explained, cupping [his] hands in front of [his] chest to visualize [his] point. Of course, Husczarr realized. Nemka didn't lose anything by agreeing not to hurt him. She was protecting her pride by making him work for something he could be getting for free. But, sham or not, Nemka stepping down from her position of power was a boon to him, if not immediately, then down the line. She was still dangerous, but if he never held up his side of the bargain and didn't accept her rewards, he would never be close enough to be in danger. However, Husczarr's experience with trying to use the control panel himself had taught him not to assume Rentahfsza will always be on his side. Nemka had been bumped down a notch, but [he] had not. So he had to make a deal with both Vespa and then coerce the ship to do what he wanted. Husczarr had yet to put their contracts to paper and get Rentahfsza and Nemka to sign off on helping with his project and not punishing him, respectively, so that was next. But it really was an inconvenient time to ask, what with Nemka leaving and Rentahfsza getting in [his] suit. Husczarr needed a suit of his own, too, especially if the life support failed. Being from a pre-interstellar civilization, Husczarr failed to realize that life support paranoia was as well-placed as the fear of an airplane crash. It was well under a one-in-a-million chance that any of the ship's systems would fail, a fact which also lead the Vespa to err on the side of malintent when it came to the ship AI's recent sketchy behavior. At least, if the charts on the main screen were telling the truth, the ship was obeying them this time: they were headed right for the largest surface settlement worldwide. The trip down felt far longer, now that there were much higher stakes and Husczarr was paying attention. Fearing that the ship wouldn't alert them to an attack, Rentahfsza kept asking whether any aircraft were following them, repeatedly, to the point that Husczarr became quite annoyed. ""Rentahfsza, could you please shut it and find a silent way to talk to the ship?"" he asked once his nerve broke. Rentahfsza looked over at Husczarr, turning [his] head slowly, menacingly. With great poise, [he]strode over to be directly in front of Husczarr, intimidating him by [his] height alone, and then bowed down at the hip such that [his] nose was mere millimeters from Husczarr's. Correction: Rentahfsza's muzzle was touching Husczarr's face. Husczarr's dinner plate-sized eyes (to exaggerate) and Rentahfsza's dinner plate-sized eyes (to be realistic) were locked as Rentahfsza offered the following: ""[Alright, puppy, if you give me a little kiss.]"" Husczarr decided that bugging it out of there was the better option, and high-end speedwalked his way out of the bridge, down the spine of the ship and towards the washroom, in an attempt to retrieve his hoodie, washed or unwashed. But when he got there, he was surprised to hear Nemka in there again, vomiting up a lung if his ears were to be believed. He was not ready to rule out the possibility of a stomach bug, but he didn't think such an advanced civilization as the Orion Arm Confederacy would have random, uncontrolled cases of disease. If it was disease, as the smell from outside the washroom indicated, then could it be a containment breach from the planet below? Unlikely, given that most Earth diseases didn't effect Vespa. Frankly, this was making a case against contagion: there were only three organics on board, so the sudden and unexpected appearance of a pathogen was unusual, since one of them had to be both patient zero and a carrier. Husczarr chalked it up to hormones, and waited outside the door. Husczarr had many an incentive to let Nemka suffer as he heard her lurch, groan and whimper beyond her heart's content, but his humanity made him give in. Knocking before he entered, Husczarr found Nemka doubled over before a waste collection receptacle, clutching her abdomen as she gagged on air. She'd run dry at this point, but her body wanted to purge itself evermore. Her eyes, though lacking in expression, looked absolutely pitiful as she saw him enter. Alongside those of hunger and nausea, Nemka felt pangs of regret as waves of discomfort washed over her body, leaving all semblance of contentment behind. That is, save the act of strength she put on for Husczarr. ""[Hey] Husczarr,"" she said shakily, trying to sound as normal as possible. ""[Could you get me something to help with an upset stomach?]"" Understatement of the millennium. ""[It's a light blue container in the leftmost section of the cafeteria's storage unit.]"" ""I'm not sure I could find it."" ""[Renta will know. Please?]"" Husczarr did not like the idea of going back to face Rentahfsza at that time. Nemka eyed him for a few more seconds as he simply stood there, unwilling to stay or leave, eventually concluding that the human would need an incentive. Normally, she'd try a good old fashion lunge, but, not feeling up to it thanks to her health, Nemka instead used a finger to pull her top down slightly, which immediately caught Husczarr's attention. She then grabbed the band at the top and pulled it back up, using her other hand to point out of the door. Husczarr gave her an awkward left-handed salute and made an about face to get her what she wanted. Nemka was endlessly pleased with the results; perhaps positive reinforcement would be better after all. It was risky, teasing Husczarr to incentivize him, but he was the one who proposed it, and she didn't particularly care. Husczarr made it back in record time, which was impressive considering the difference in scale between him and his cargo, at which Nemka graciously said, ""[Thank you,]"" as she took deep, calming breaths. Nemka became a bit perturbed when Husczarr didn't do anything but watch her, smiling. The medicine worked almost instantly, and once she was able to breathe and talk at will, she stared right back at Husczarr, who showed no hint of fear at all. ""[What?]"" Nemka asked, Husczarr maintaining his smile. ""Aren't you gonna show me your tits?"" There was the risk Nemka was concerned with. She was at a crossroads: should she stay true to her intentions, or should she humor Husczarr in order to encourage further helpful behavior? She weighed her options as best she could, and found it to really be a question of how much she needed Husczarr's help. The deal was done; if she backed out now, she wouldn't have to make a fool of herself, and yet still get all of the rewards. Not to mention that she ship was probably watching their every move, even if it never willingly said so. Not to mention the fact that Husczarr's insistence and expectation showed that he still had yet to learn that he wasn't entitled to her. But he wouldn't listen to her if he saw her as a liar, even though she never said she'd do anything for him in return. In the end, it came down to personal preference, that is, unless one takes note of Rentahfsza, completely suited up, in the doorway. Nemka gave [him] a quizzical look as Husczarr paled. Thirsting for Rentahfsza's girlfriend was the fastest way to turn Rentahfszaway [him]. ""[We've landed,]""he announced. ""[And a lot of people are very happy to see us.]"""

I'd like to take a moment to explain why today's chapter art is behind a paywall. As some of you may know Akella, the creative owner of the CD universe, has taken his first steps on a quest to become a full time artist. Patreon is the vehicle he's chosen to support himself, and that's where you can get real time access to the art he's creating for Coronation Day, HEL Jumper, and other stories. For those of you who prefer not to partake, I will post his art on subsequent chapters once it goes public. I understand this is likely disappointing for many of you, but I hope you'll consider supporting this young man who has given us a compelling world and great art over the last many months. As an apology, please accept the longest chapter yet. \----- Keiko rose softly from her slumber into the waking world thanks to the natural mimicry of the shrine. The sunrise and bird calls were soothing to her resting senses. She was facing the ceiling and both of her hands were free of Seth's hold. The mercenary was found on his side as she turned his way, his back towards her. It was an unprecedented moment of vulnerability on his part. ""My first night with a man,"" Keiko whispered with a hint of self reproach, unafraid of the slightly warm feeling developing in her chest as she watched his resting body. ""And much to my distress you're still fully clothed,"" came Seth's sleep shrouded voice. She growled at him. ""Do you ever stop?"" ""On occasion, my lady,"" he replied, rolling over to face her and removing the comforter from his body. She was surprised to see him looking at her seriously. ""Are you well? Were there nightmares?"" ""I...there may have been. I don't recall,"" she replied after a moment of contemplation. She was looking at his stubble. ""I'm fine, Seth."" ""My lady is sure?"" ""I am. You have morning breath,"" she informed him with a cute smile. Seth breathed out through his nose, pushing himself upright and inclining his head in apology. ""I apologise for assaulting you with my commoners' breath,"" he joked, back to his usual self now that he'd confirmed Keiko was past the worst of the immediate aftermath. Her eyes followed him while drinking in his form, clad in a basic pair of boxer briefs and an undershirt. ""You've already done far worse, mercenary. You held my hand,"" Keiko accused, narrowing her eyes playfully. ""I would do so again in a heartbeat, especially if you prove capable of such exquisite murder. Now don't give me that look, my lady. Your visage was much more appealing when you were taking your time with the...male form."" Seth threw her a final smirk before retreating to the shower, leaving Keiko gaping after him. ""That human is just-"" her inevitable disparagement was halted as a small indicator appeared on her lens. She had a message...from Seth's program. Opening it, she saw that the missive was intended for Seth, though she'd received a copy thanks to how she'd acquired the application. Unable and unwilling to respect Seth's privacy, she opened it immediately. *Seth, Alex was great as always. That cat really knows how to work a girl's ass. I almost passed out when he came. Speaking of ass, that piece of ass that was sitting in your lap seems to have the golden touch...or the golden gun. Too sensitive to discuss over the net. I'm coming over now. I know it's late but don't eat breakfast. Kisses. -Sybela* Upon his return, Seth found Keiko sitting upright in shock, the telltale look of someone staring at their lens on her face. He checked his quickly as a look of exasperation came over him. ""Ah, I see. You have my sincerest apologies, Lady Keiko. As you can tell Sybela doesn't turn it off...ever,"" he lamented. ""Does she always inform you of her escapades?"" Keiko asked, sneaking a final glance as Seth threw on his pants. He didn't turn back to her. ""Ever since I failed to satisfy her. It's something of a game to her at this point, I believe,"" he replied roughly. Keiko's ears wilted. He turned back and their eyes met. Anger bubbled in his chest. ""Spare me your pity, my lady. I'm the last of a proud race, or so you say. Though I should have expected such discussions would only intrigue you. What is it? Snuck into the harem a few times too many?"" Keiko glared right back. ""And saw things you'd never believe, mercenary...but I'm sorry. Whatever happened to Sybela that's not fair to you."" ""And that is the absolute last thing I need, the princess of Alhamkara inserting herself into team dynamics,"" he insisted hotly, only to have her snap right back at him. ""Fine, I get it! Just keep on killing people and wilting like a flower every time that size queen of a rabbit gets reamed! What kind of human are you?! How am I supposed to help you kill those bastards if you shut me down over something as stupid as what I assume is a one night stand? Agh, why do I even care about you and her?!"" Keiko shouted, more at herself than at him. Seth watched her intently as she stood to take her turn in the bathroom, his eyes wide with surprise. ""It seems Alhamkara's pride and joy, on the other hand, is no wilting flower,"" he remarked once he was alone. Behind the wall Keiko had her head in her hands, groaning in embarrassment. ""What am I doing?!"" She wondered, not quite willing to admit that even her verbal sparring matches with Seth were getting her heart beating. That didn't change the fact that the rabbit in question was coming for breakfast. ""Guess I'd better get ready for that *woman*."" Keiko took time to recentered herself, washing her face and ensuring that her fur hadn't matted during the night. When she was satisfied with her appearance she pulled her nightgown over her head, turning her naked body slowly in front of the mirror and slightly adjusting her various piercings. ""I wonder if Seth has a camera in here,"" she murmured, feeling her hips cock and her chest push outward at the thought of intimidating him yet again with her bare body. She delighted in the momentary fantasy of a lady of the harem, the eyes of powerful and famous men enraptured by her form. It was hard to believe that for all his competence Seth might be a disappointment in the bedroom, but after reflecting on the last couple of days Keiko admitted it was a possibility. Everyone had something to hide. ""Ugh, look at me. So eager to be away from that stuffy palace that I'm contemplating the love life of that wolf. Pull yourself together, Keiko. This is all about the mnyama."" After quickly cleaning her teeth Keiko smiled for the mirror, happy to find that Seth had splurged a bit and purchased a model that had low intensity UV tech installed. She knew she was being a tad vain, but even in front of a mercenary like Seth she wanted to ensure her breath was fresh and her teeth were presentable. After all, unlike his they featured quite prominently in her mouth. That and she absolutely intended to give no ground to that bunny. Talented as she undoubtedly was, she'd done nothing but doubt Seth and her. The human, on the other hand, had shown her trust and an extraordinary amount of openness given the situation. Despite his anger he'd stayed with her the night before and helped her execute her impromptu plan to rescue Savannah and get Octavia a message. For that morning, at least, Keiko knew whose side she was on. After dressing herself, taking another calming breath, and standing straight, she turned and headed for the main room. She was surprised to find Seth standing there, waiting for her with a conservative posture. ""I owe you an apology, my lady,"" he said, meeting her eyes bravely. ""Seth?"" ""I allowed a bad personal memory to cloud my judgment. Integrating you into my team is exactly what I desire, and something I hope you will accept. Sybela might be hardest and I wish you could meet Talon or Argos first, but they"" ""We'll explain together when the time comes. And for what it's worth, Seth, I'm sorry too,"" Keiko replied, unwilling to remain mad after his sincere apology. ""My lady? You've done nothing wrong,"" he insisted. Keiko worried her hands together and adopted a modest tone. Something had been bothering her since the night before, other than murder. ""I called you a human fetishist when you first took me here. That couldn't be further from the truth. I don't understand your relationship to your own people or what's left of them, but this shrine is delightful now that I've had the time to appreciate it a bit. And after seeing what Savannah did to herself...I know where the real evil lies when it comes to exploiting the image of the human divine,"" she finished on a hard note. Seth nodded. ""I maintain you owe me less than nothing, Lady Keiko, but I humbly accept your apology. Shall we have tea while we await breakfast?"" He suggested. She smiled. ""That sounds nice, actually. Would you like some help?"" Her question seemed to catch Seth off guard, but he nodded with a slight smirk. ""I could use some company while watching the water boil; dreadfully boring that is."" \----- When Sybela opened the door to the shrine, bag full of breakfast swaying from her paw, she found the two of them sitting cross legged and blissfully sipping green tea at Seth's small table. They looked like a couple. Her mouth felt dry. ""Should I come back later?"" She asked sarcastically, prompting Seth to turn to face her. The wild dog with the wild eyes was already staring her down. ""What the fuck happened to your face, Seth?"" ""I happened to his face, something he very much deserved in the moment. And after last night I think you've done plenty of running away...and 'cumming'. Seth and I could use some breakfast. Sit down already."" Keiko fired the first shot, watching as Sybela's large ears, one of which featured two red glowing hoops, twitched indignantly. Eventually the rabbit smiled. The look on the princess' face told her she knew it was forced. ""I got your message, Sybela. I'm glad that jaguar didn't turn you inside out. Seemed a nice enough fellow I suppose."" The albino rabbit's pale ears developed a distinctive flush as she sat down at the head of the table, presenting her peace offering to Seth. ""Should have known better than trying to verbally spar with the princess of Alhamkara. And I guess we'll just ignore the fact that she's reading your mail, monkey. You hungry?"" She asked, withdrawing all manner of containers from the bag. ""Oh American! It's been so long!"" Keiko exclaimed, laying eyes on scrambled eggs, toast, sausage, bacon, and pancakes with small containers of artificial syrup. ""Seth, what's she talking about?"" Sybela asked in confusion, glancing at the human. ""You should do your homework, Sybela. It's the country and people that apparently pioneered the concept of a hearty breakfast. While not particularly complex, the cuisine seems to have eventually gained popularity among even the culture of those who developed this planet, if only as a curiosity. Thanks, by the way."" ""Don't mention it,"" Sybela replied, leaving discussion of the finer points of humanity to the human himself and the seemingly knowledgeable princess. All that mattered to Sybela was the fact that he'd saved her ass that one night. ""I uhshould probably apologize."" ""Oh? You, apologize? Do tell,"" Seth requested eagerly, a glance at Keiko confirming that apologizing was not something the lagomorph did often. ""Cram it, you furless oddball. Princess, how'd you know that girl was wrapped up with the Oro's genetic experiments?"" Sybela asked curiously. Keiko's ears stood on end, a bit of pancake hanging from her fork inches from her mouth. ""I'm sorry, what?"" ""That woman, the one you 'saved' last night. The cheetah girl. How'd you know?"" Sybela tried again. ""What was I supposed to know?"" Keiko queried earnestly with a tilt of the head, causing the jackrabbit to throw her head back in exasperation. ""Seriously?! Seth, she's luckier than my foot, maybe both feet!"" Sybela exclaimed. The mercenary finally spoke, having dug right into the meal. He'd already devoured a sausage and a couple of eggs. He pointed his fork at her. ""Stop with your roundabout nonsense and tell us, Sybela. You know you're here to synthesize all the crazy shit out there on the net, not make riddles about it."" ""Ooh, grown some balls now that the princess has shared your bed?"" Sybela teased. Seth was about to turn away but Keiko's foot touched his leg under the table, she smiled at him. ""He's surprisingly proven to be quite the gentleman, with a gentle touch. I also didn't see you killing any mnyama scum last night, Sybela."" ""Not my job,"" the rabbit deflected. ""Then stop beating around the bush and do yours!"" Keiko snapped, brandishing another plastic fork full of eggs at her. ""I won't presume to know what happened between you and Seth, but right now I care much more about breakfast and whatever is going on with the Oro than your inability to be satisfied by anything other than an oversized, barbed cock knocking your organs about."" ""Don't you have servants or something to tell you not to speak like a commoner?"" Sybela barely managed to reply. Keiko pressed on for the kill. ""I find it liberating. Not to mention the victory of having my counterpart change the subject. Don't presume to know what being a princess of Alhamkara really means, Sybela,"" she finished, taking a large bite of sausage and throwing the rabbit a wink. Her stomach was positively buzzing with excitement and embarrassment at engaging in such lewd banter. Sybela shook her head in resignation. ""Fine, I concede. Let's just eat, yeah? I'll fill you all in fully after we're done. Seth...we may need to bring Talon and Argos up to speed. I think Octavia is going to move on this one,"" Sybela warned, spreading jam on toast and taking a bite. Seth nodded but said nothing, clearly thinking through scenarios behind his distracted eyes. Keiko's mind wandered as well, worried for the Sekhama if they went hot into hostile territory. \----- ""So based on the logs from Talon, that girl made it to the palace with her kids just around midnight. He spotted Octavia about five minutes later and ended the mission. Now watch this,"" Sybela instructed, directing their attention to a holographic projector that she'd paired to the various electronic devices embedded in her skin. After a couple of touches against the slim panel in her left wrist, a stylized model of the local Alhamkara network appeared. She pointed to a highlighted cluster surrounded by thick barriers. ""This here is your home, princess. What I'm showing you now is normal traffic, before that girl made it inside. And yes, the palace is subject to that level of cyber attack on a regular basis. Whatever else you want to say about the Sekhama's net techs, they play damn good defense. See there? Ooh, that was a good one. Anyone on the other side of that hack just got a face full of terminal shrapnel!"" ""Sybela!"" Seth cut in, motioning that she return to the subject at hand. Keiko looked uncertain at the rabbit's description of certain palace countermeasures. ""I assure you, my lady, anyone attempting that sort of breach deserves a bit of facial reconstruction."" ""What he said,"" Sybela agreed, much more friendly with Seth now that they were discussing an operation. ""I'm going to roll it forward now. Check this out."" As Sybela guided the display they watched as a sudden explosion of traffic emanated from the palace. ""Let's overlay the capital, shall we?"" Sybela sang happily, projecting a three dimensional model of the city atop the network map. ""Oh, Talon is going to love this one,"" Seth mused, seeing that the vast majority of outgoing traffic was terminating in a cluster of buildings in a slum adjacent to the corporate district. The rest of the attacks targeted one of the nearby skyscrapers. ""Those lines of sight will be juicy."" ""Juicy?!"" Keiko demanded as Sybela laughed. ""Juicy as in if any mnyama are on those rooftops their heads are going to be split open like ripe melons,"" the rabbit clarified, enjoying the disgusted look on Keiko's face. Nevertheless the princess injected herself into the discussion. ""How many people can see this, Sybela? Do the Oro know?"" She pressed. ""Doubtful. The net is highly fragmented; every corporation and mnyama has their own little pocket in addition to the public infrastructure. It took me and Seth...how long would you say?"" She asked, looking at the human. ""Six months at least,"" he supplied. ""Yeah, six months plus to install spikes at enough physical access terminals to assemble this map. Only the Sekhama, the military, and the Wildfire have the kind of resources to maintain full access like this. We had to do it on the cheap and I doubt our spikes will last more than a year or so,"" Sybela explained. It set Keiko at ease to know the Oro probably didn't know they were being targeted, but the idea of the Wildfire having capabilities on par with the Sekhama was most disconcerting. ""Do you know what that traffic is?"" Keiko asked. Sybela shook her head. ""No. If I burrowed in there I'd get a face full of slag too. You ever meet one of their net assassins in person? They're probably more machine than faunum and they can fuck you up six ways to Sunday if you've got any tech they feel like exploiting...and they can get into just about everything."" Sybela shuddered as Keiko recalled Idris introducing her to a particular meerkat back when she turned sixteen and began learning about the darker side of the palace's efforts to combat the vile underbelly of the capital. The sheer amount of metal and plastic in his body was the stuff of nightmares. The Commander had explained the authorization for the modifications had taken years. ""But I don't think we really need to get inside to know where Octavia is going to strike,"" Sybela continued. ""There's two targets, this Oro base and the Psygenics Ltd offices. My guess is if the raid comes up with any dirt at all you'll see them frog marching those suits out of their glass tower the next day. Oh, I can't wait to watch the vids, maybe see if Alex wants to play"" ""If the Oro do end up destroyed I think Seth and I might go out for dinner, maybe a movie?"" Keiko replied easily, loving the shocked looks on the faces of the two mercenaries. ""What? I've never gotten to go to a normal theater."" ""I just can't win around her,"" Sybela lamented, seeing the honest smile on Seth's lips. ""Anyway, Seth this traffic died before sunrise. The Sekhama got what they need quickly, probably blueprints, access points, and the like. I've been monitoring the news but there's been no press conferences or royal declarations or anything. I think they're going to risk it."" ""Seth!"" Keiko implored immediately. He placed a hand comfortingly over hers where it rested on the table. ""We will do everything in our power to ensure your captain is successful, my lady. We may not see eye to eye on many things, but we share the same goal."" ""The enemy of my enemy,"" Keiko whispered. Seth nodded. ""How the hell are you going to break this to Argos and Talon, Seth?"" Sybela asked pointedly. ""They may not even agree to this."" ""Fear not, Sybela. I can assure you they will."" \----- After breakfast had been consumed and enjoyed, complete with Sybela ribbing Seth about the other tied off takeout bags next to the door, the three of them gathered around Seth's terminal as he pinged both Talon and Argos. The tiger's gruff voice was the first to reply. ""I don't like being kept in the dark, Seth. What's going on? We finally getting together?"" The human gave Keiko an apologetic look. ""A couple of complications with the princess, nothing more. We'll hit up the Sakura soon enough, but I have another job. This one I think you'll both be interested in."" ""Another job? Seth, what the hell was last night all about?"" Talon squawked as he joined the call. ""I know you're money good, man, but seeing some slut and her kids to the palace? The fuck is with you?"" Sybela had to slap a hand over Keiko's mouth as the wild dog made ready to verbally bite Talon's head off. It was Argos who spoke instead. ""What happened last night, Seth? This isn't like you,"" Argos insisted in a worried tone. ""We've been working together for months, man. Does Sybela know about this?"" ""I know,"" Seth countered patiently. ""The abduction of the princess has presented me-"" ""He means us, by the way,"" Sybela cut in sharply. ""How you boys doing?"" ""Heya buns! Didn't know you and Seth were back together,"" Talon called. Keiko thought the sniper seemed almost put out by the news. ""We're not back together, you birdbrain! I'm here because Seth is telling the truth. This is a big op, easy job. And the employer...let's just say she's money good too."" ""She?"" Argos demanded thoughtfully. ""Seth, are we working corporate now?"" ""Something like that,"" Seth replied. ""Dude this is bullshit. Give us the details or I'm out!"" Talon insisted. ""We're going to aid the Sekhama in killing the entirety of the Oro,"" Seth snarled. ""How's that for details?"" ""Seth...what the hell did you get yourself mixed up in? And what about the princess? She's still there with you, right?"" Argos eventually asked after a long moment of silence on the channel. ""She's accepted her place, Argos,"" Seth replied without remorse. ""There won't be any issues during the op. As for the job, let's just say our little heist garnered the attention of an idealistic individual with very deep pockets and a...favorable moral compass."" ""So what, we're going to kill the people that pay us?"" Talon squawked. ""Am I the only one who thinks that's insane? Am I insane, Argos?"" The tiger gave a disbelieving chuckle. ""You are, but that's not the point. We get paid enough we won't have to work for the mnyama anymore."" ""Fuck you man, I thought you were on my side!"" ""And you know how I feel about the Sekhama,"" Argos growled. ""Seth, I'm in but no more games, no more secrets. We pull this off and we meet with this employer to take payment, all four of us. Then we go drinking, all four of us."" ""You got it, big guy,"" Seth agreed, shooting Keiko a satisfied look. ""Talon, you in?"" ""Yeah yeah, I'll be ready. I'm clearly outnumbered here. When do we move?"" ""Before dusk. I'll send you the details. Sybela and I are working them out now, monitoring traffic. Be ready to deploy on a moment's notice,"" Seth advised. Talon and Argos signaled their affirmation and ended the call, leaving the three of them to plan the next move. ""I know my place?"" Keiko demanded angrily, cuffing Seth on the back of the head. Sybela copied her and gave the princess a wink. ""Yes I suppose that's only fair,"" Seth admitted, swatting at Sybela who jumped out of his reach. ""I couldn't tell them over comms. They need to see for themselves. At a minimum there will have to be some apologies on my part. I hope you'll be willing to come with us."" ""On the op?"" Keiko gasped. Sybela laughed and unceremoniously rested a hand on her shoulder. ""No, he means to go drinking after, bit of a tradition we developed. Besides, doesn't matter how flashy you are, you don't have armor or combat training. Leave this one to the professionals, princess."" Keiko was torn between offended anger and begrudging acceptance that she didn't belong on a battlefield. Nevertheless, Seth stepped in to defend her. ""She was more professional than you are in terms of assassination, Sybela. Still don't understand why you took that job to off some Trang'aul all on your own."" ""Oh would you shut up about that? You got yourself a net jock out of it!"" The rabbit protested. ""He might if you stop bringing up your one night stand,"" Keiko suggested, watching as the two mercenaries looked away from one another. ""My word, I've seen little children more mature than the two of you!"" ""None of your business, *your majesty,*"" Sybela shot back. Seth just closed his eyes and rubbed his temples. He pushed the conversation forward. ""Sybela, are you going to remain here or head back to the den?"" ""I'll be there; I've got everything set up already. Just need to tell it to start looking for anything Oro related, as well as the usual Sekhama stuff. Damn hard to pin down Octavia, but I'll let you know. Princess, it's been a pleasure,"" Sybela said with some amount of sincerity before gathering her things and leaving. ""She even left us the garbage,"" Keiko muttered after the door closed. Seth moved to stand beside her. ""It's a good thing she's one of the best net technicians I've ever seen. Makes tolerating her much easier,"" he admitted. ""Still don't want to talk about it?"" Keiko asked, glancing his way. ""Would you want to discuss your sexual failings with a princess, my lady?"" ""At least you've had a sexual anything,"" Keiko retorted, eliciting a bout of coughing from the human. ""But enough about that. You're really going to help Commander Octavia? How?"" ""Finally, a subject of conversation that won't have anyone's undergarments twisted into knots. Shall we? Perhaps this can be a teaching moment."" Seth gestured to the table and they seated themselves anew. ""What do you plan on teaching me?"" Keiko asked, allowing her curiosity to show through. ""A bit about how someone like me thinks about a job, decides where or when to act. And if my lady is feeling generous I hoped you might give me some insight into how the Sekhama-"" ""I'm sorry Seth, I can't do that. I won't do that,"" Keiko clarified abruptly. Seth seemed unperturbed. He waved it off casually. ""I had expected as much, my lady. Please, there's no reason to be looking like that."" ""I hate how much I want to trust you, Seth,"" Keiko lamented, finding a pair of sympathetic brown eyes looking back at her. ""It would be easier, wouldn't it?"" He agreed. ""You feel as though you're among people who are on your side and we get deeply privileged intelligence on the Sekhama."" ""You don't need to use that tone, Seth. I understand just how ridiculous that sounds,"" Keiko replied. They both smiled thinly at one another. ""And so you chose the hard path, as a just ruler must. It matters not, my lady. I will ensure my team is in place before dark. Perhaps you can tell us a story while we wait?"" ""Talon and Argos?"" ""I suppose they can do without the story...or you can use this,"" Seth said with a wink, using his own lens to direct her around their team's little program. A handful of options could be found below the icon that allowed one to communicate with the whole team. ""You would have to be near my terminal, of course, which I will leave open and partially accessible to you, my lady. That icon you see there will garble your voice. We use it whenever we are in an area of significant hostile network traffic or when we have reason to believe someone is listening on the other side. It is entirely up to you, but I'm never above playing a practical joke on my teammates."" ""I'll think about it, Seth,"" Keiko promised before returning them to the subject at hand. ""Will you teach me a bit about what's going to happen tonight?"" ""Yes, of course. Pardon the distraction, Lady Keiko."" Seth stood and walked over to his armor, rummaging around until he located a holodisc just like Sybela's. He returned and set it on the table before them, taking a moment to drink Keiko in. ""Seth?"" Her voice was more curious than anything else. She sounded so pleasant to him in that moment. ""Would a bit of nature be to your liking?"" ""I...yes, that sounds nice,"" she confirmed. At her affirmation Seth fiddled with his lens for a moment and the sounds of the midday savannah surrounded them. ""I have it set to only activate in the morning and evening. It helps with sleep, I find, but should you ever wish it just let me know,"" he offered. Keiko found herself able to relax a bit, leaning forward on the table and extending her legs. ""Shall we talk, Seth?"" ""Let's talk, my lady,"" Seth agreed, activating his holo and showing her a map of the capital and the surrounding environs. After a few moments of searching he highlighted the palace, a fortified military airfield outside the city limits, the Oro's den, and Psygenics main office. ""That should just about do it. Now then, my lady, given that we know Savannah survived, spoke with Octavia, and delivered your message, what do you believe he's likely to do?"" ""I told him to act at his discretion, which means he'll do whatever he can to make a raid happenbut"" Keiko trailed off. ""Yes, my lady?"" ""How dangerous is this area?"" Keiko asked, pointing to the neighborhood that bordered the corporate district. ""Idris won't send them into a death trap."" ""No, history says he won't...unless the opportunity justifies the risk,"" Seth clarified. ""What do you mean?"" ""Let's check the news, shall we?"" Seth suggested, extending his terminal on a metal arm that allowed it to turn and face the table. After a few adjustments he had three separate news broadcasts up, including the palace's, as well as a quadrant of the screen where he threw in a few search terms. ""Oh yes, my lady, I believe your Sekhama think they've got a big one on their hands."" ""How do you know that?"" Keiko demanded, not enjoying how this mercenary seemed to know more about the Sekhama than she did. ""Let's review, shall we? We know thanks to Sybela that the Sekhama infiltrated both Psygenics and the Oro last night. Those taps are not ongoing. We know that, reasonably, your Commander Octavia does not lead stupid raids just to bring back a bunch of mnyama pelts. They're will always be more mnyama than Sekhama."" ""But the Trang'aul was different, right?"" ""Correct, Lady Keiko. All of Alhamkara watched that particular drama unfold. No one, not even the Wildfire would have interfered. Can you imagine the outage if they had? Trying to stop the Sekhama from retrieving you from the clutches of those dastardly hyenas? The commoners would have opened their homes to the military itself if it meant the Wildfire's destruction."" ""Perception is everything,"" she whispered. ""Precisely, my lady. Today, however, there have been no announcements from the Sekhama. The palace has said nothing other than that the search for you is ongoing. They aren't even announcing that Octavia knows you're alive. For now that appears wise to me, keeps the enemy on edge. After a week or two they will be forced to reveal something as the populace wonders if the Sekhama are impotent."" ""I suppose I can understand that,"" Keiko agreed. ""Honestly, Seth, would people be that upset?"" The human gave her an appraising look. ""You wish an unvarnished evaluation of yourself?"" ""Of course!"" She yelped. ""My handmaidens only ever say what they think I want to hear, Lyria exempted. As dear as she is to me, she only understands a palace perspective. Now tell me!"" ""Many people in this city would die for you, Lady Keiko,"" Seth told her seriously. ""And before you protest, allow me to finish. You've been a public face since you became a woman. You struck out often into your city, if under heavy guard. It's understandable. Many would do you harm and it only takes one to succeed. You advocate tirelessly for the Sekhama, who enjoy a sterling reputation compared to both the police and the military, and you are the reason we can drink the water from our taps again. Every roof, even in the foulest slum, has a durable, easily maintained solar powered purifier thanks to your insistence that funding be diverted from the restoration of various human monuments throughout the nation. For every well to do fanatic you angered, hundreds praise your name for making those blueprints free. Sybela's old corporation even helped install some of them as part of a charity outreach."" ""Wait, Sybela used to be corporate?"" Keiko asked, her ears already jingling happily as Seth told her of the success of her first real initiative as heir to the throne. ""Yes, and on the way to the top. She was undercut and betrayed. More is not for me to say,"" Seth said, scratching his chin. ""She may be an annoyance, but she values loyalty above all else."" ""Alex?"" Keiko cocked her brow skeptically. Seth looked remorsefully at the wall. ""So long as her credits are good Alex will always be there and willing to serve her as she requests. He won't get killed in a gang war, he won't meet a mercenary's end, their relationship isn't subject to the thorny intricacies of the heart. He is exactly what she wants."" ""And what is it that you want?"" Keiko whispered, suddenly yearning to know. His facial expression hardened until it resembled his mask. ""I told you, death and vengeance."" ""What does your heart want?"" Keiko pressed, narrowing her sunburst eyes at him. ""You'll never survive this if you don't want anything afterwards!"" ""As I said yesterday, survival isn't-"" Seth was cut off as Keiko slammed her fist on the table. ""Shut up! You think Markhan will fall to someone like you?"" Keiko yelled. ""Why do you think I tried so hard to get the Sekhama access to the harem? I don't care if your answer is something depraved or lacking in sensibility. If I'm going to work with you I need to know that you have the will to not leave me locked up in here and die!"" Seth only spoke after a long, stunned silence as the hologram flickered between them. ""We were just speaking about tonight's-"" ""Well I'm not! I'm going to be queen of Alhamkara, Seth. Unlike you, apparently, I plan to survive this war you want to fight. I have to think of the long game. Everything you can tell me here today is valuable, but it means nothing if you die and I lose my sword."" ""Your sword?"" Seth asked, honestly unsure how to reply to the princess's insistence that he was now her instrument. *I suppose this is what they refer to as the tables turning.* ""Am I wrong, mercenary?"" She accused, placing both hands on the table. ""An idealistic woman with deep pockets and a flexible moral compass, I believe you said?"" He smiled wickedly. ""Indeed. Woe to your enemies the day you ascend to power, my lady."" ""I already have power according to you, Seth. You are not leaving this room until you tell me something, anything, that will compel you to come back. I don't care what it is; it could even be-"" Keiko brought a hand to her mouth as she realized where her rant was about to take her. Seth's eyes were wide as dinner plates as he finished for her in a panicked voice. ""No my lady, you cannot-"" ""Me!"" Keiko finished fiercely the moment he told her she couldn't. ""Even if it's me. Even if barbaric, human lust for your princess is what gets you back then that's acceptable if you kill them all. Now continue to instruct me, Seth. We've gone on a bit of a tangent."" ""I appear to be in far, far over my head,"" Seth admitted, looking over at his terminal screen to shield him from the gaze of the princess that he felt might shatter him. ""As you wish, my lady. There doesn't appear to be any attempt by the palace to influence public opinion regarding the Oro or Psygenics. Given what we've already discussed why do you think that might be?"" Keiko tapped a finger against her lips for a long while before replying. ""This isn't really even about the Oro, is it?"" ""I'm inclined to agree, my lady. Even with advanced warning a mnyama can only do so much against an unobstructed Sekhama operation. However"" he led her, hoping she would understand his meaning. ""If Psygenics is working with them and they knew a raid was coming they could tie off loose ends!"" She answered proudly. Seth smiled at his 'pupil'. ""And then there might be more Sybelas in this world,"" he concluded. ""Yes, my lady, as it stands I believe if the Sekhama move at all they will do so without warning, secure whatever they can, and use it to make arrests of anyone involved from Psygenics. I had thought Savannah simply got some new breasts and removed her tail, maybe got unique lenses. It would appear the truth runs much deeper. Let's hope your medical staff is up to the task. As for us, perhaps we might discuss the Sekhama in a way that does not involve you revealing their secrets to me. If we are to aid them, we must anticipate their movements."" ""The airfield? That's only one of many,"" Keiko mused, looking at the other glowing compound on the map. ""I doubt they'll risk walking. I admit my knowledge of the Sekhama's access to military assets is limited, my lady."" ""And I have no intention of telling you, Seth, not until you and Octavia speak to one another."" Yet again Keiko managed to render him speechless for a long while. ""The long game indeed, Lady Keiko. All I will say for now is that in all my time I've yet to properly pin down how, when, and where the Sekhama will move."" ""Should we contact Sybela? See if she has any other insights?"" Keiko asked, noticing it was already the early afternoon. ""In a moment. Come here?"" Seth requested, indicating that she should sit next to him. Keiko did so warily. ""Already decided to cave to your base male desires?"" She teased. He shook his head. ""You are taking every advantage of your freedom, aren't you?"" ""Yes, of course."" ""I just want to see your lens, my lady. It's about time you were added to this program properly. If only so you need not read about Sybela's exploits,"" he explained. Keiko granted access and watched as he made the appropriate changes to add a fifth member. ""You really think that bugs me, Seth? I'd say it gets to you far more than me."" ""It is not talk fit for a princess,"" he insisted, giving her status indicator the designation 'sunburst'. Keiko smiled and nodded to indicate she approved of the codename. ""Seth, a rabbit taking a jaguar in her ass is nothing. I've seen a woman take seven men at once in the harem. A couple of them were *very* well endowed species,"" Keiko informed him with no small air of superiority. ""I love that stupid look you get when girls act like they have needs too. The harem is one of the crown's greatest assets. I just decided to educate myself a bit early."" ""I didn't know the palace allowed their staff to be...used in such a way,"" he replied, trying hard not to think of such a depraved act in too much detail with Keiko being so close. ""Seth,"" she said with a devious smile. ""Yes, my lady?"" ""She was the client."" \----- [Previous] [p] | [First] [f]"

Rhythmic and constant. Light and high. &amp;nbsp; Wow, you really dont do silence well, a voice said, pulling Toms attention up from his tangled position on the floor. He was wedged between two metal shelving units stacked high with computer components. &amp;nbsp; Huh? The tapping ceased. &amp;nbsp; Eva tucked her hair behind an ear, crouching so their faces were level. She pointed to his idle hand. It rested on the bottom shelf of one of the shelves to his right. You were taping out what I can only guess was Tom Griffin: Nerd Programmer in A Minor. &amp;nbsp; Shit. He flexed his hand. Sure enough, the tip of his index and middle fingers were warm with the force of repeated impact against the flat metal surface. He hadnt even realized hed started tapping. Hed come to the store room in an effort to avoid interruptions, to really get into a programming zone the likes of which hed enjoyed in his makeshift workshop while alive. &amp;nbsp; And while the room *had* been quiet (and devoid of Hellizens with questions, his friends included), it seemed hed grown accustomed to the noise Hell brought. So much so that his body had a mind of its own and had started replicating that noise by way of involuntary tapping. &amp;nbsp; How goes it? she asked, going cross-legged in front of him, knee to knee. She was alone, this time. At one point, hed been in a cavern just off the main one with an empty acid pool, but itd been too close. All manner of beings had followed Eva in to voice a concern or ask a question of him until finally hed picked one far enough away she was able to lose them before stopping by to report on the rest of their seemingly endless tasks. &amp;nbsp; Slow. It was hard to fully tell if what he stripped away from the clones base code would have catastrophic results. At best, if he removed too much, theyd stand there like drooling idiots. At worst...well, who knew? Earth didnt have a rogue killer robot army spree in its history. &amp;nbsp; Itd been some time since hed used the ink pouches, but the walls (that he could reach) of the store room were covered in scribbled, dribbling lines of code. Ones he wanted to remember for later, others he was worried were important but couldnt be sure, others yet were just simple translations from demonish to english. While he was working on a copy, experience and common sense told him to back up, back up, back up. And the walls in here (and the sides of the empty pool in his first hideout) were a form of backup that helped him untangle his thoughts. &amp;nbsp; Well, want a distraction? She leaned back onto her palms, stretched out behind her, till she was reclined like someone lounging at the beach. &amp;nbsp; Yes. But- &amp;nbsp; The army is useless if I dont get some kind of program into them. But his brain was turning mushy and foggy. Theyre been blessed few problems in the last several hours. Stanton had stationed a team with the magic wielders working to close Level 5s doorway, Twinkle worked away in the library, and Kyle was deep into his own program, promising every hour that hed have it in another hour. There hadnt been a sign of The Curator or his threat. Either it was still forthcoming, or it had been bluff. &amp;nbsp; Tom wasnt going to bet on the latter. &amp;nbsp; Well, I phrased it like a question to make you think you had a choice, but Twinkle said if I didnt come get you and bring to post haste to the library he would have no choice but to allow himself to feel the slightest bit of disappointment in me, his fair maiden. &amp;nbsp; Did he really call you his fair maiden? Tom laughed. &amp;nbsp; No, he did threaten disappointment like a dad though. I was properly adolescent and stuck my tongue out. But here I am all the same. &amp;nbsp; Tom shook his head, smiling. Youve gone soft, Eva. Not even a stomp of your feet as you rebelled against being told what to do? &amp;nbsp; She lifted a leg to look at her feet and the ragged coverings theyd all been given upon entering Hell. In these expensive shoes? I think not. &amp;nbsp; He saved his work, making to stand amid the scattered packets of used ink sacks. Glancing around he considered leaving the tablet behind. It had been disconnected from the network to just to ensure he didnt accidentally sync his practice code with the real one and bring their weapons to a terrible and useless halt. That made this tablet the only one with his project housed on it. If something happened to it, hed have to start all over again. &amp;nbsp; But if he left it and something happened to prevent him from returning for it... &amp;nbsp; Whats the dilemma? Eva rose with him, kicking at the empty pouches till they were in a neat pile. &amp;nbsp; Lack of backup options has me feeling real nervous. &amp;nbsp; I thought you might say that. I had Kyle take another tablet off the network. She lifted her tunic and pulled one from the waist of her pants, tapping the screen live. He said something nerdy about making a backup on a second tablet but I stopped listening about five seconds in. &amp;nbsp; He knew she hadnt really. Eva might not be a programmer or know a lick about how to write code, but she keenly took in everything around her and cataloged it away. That was what was special about her. She was a procurer. If she couldnt do something, she sure as hell knew where to find you someone who did. &amp;nbsp; Bless that man. He took the tablet from her, bringing up the app hed been using to write the practice code in. It worked kind of like NotePad, except not. It was hard to describe. It allowed for text entry but no manipulation of that text. Which was where the walls had come in handy. Plus, the act of actually writing had helped center his thoughts. Of which the amusement wasnt lost to him given that hed never hand written code or notes about code while hed been alive. How long before Twinkles disappointment turns really sour? &amp;nbsp; Do what you gotta do. I can handle Fancy Feet. She winked and settled back down to wait for him to replicate a copy of his work on the back up tablet. &amp;nbsp; *** &amp;nbsp; Twinkle says that the library has been collecting books for well over a billion years. A trillion even. Said it was unlikely we'd truly find an end to the place, but if the journals are any indication, the Kyzin have been running Hell for a long, long time. Eva picked her way through the stacks of thick volumes that narrowed the space between the shelves of the library. &amp;nbsp; Did he find the beginning journals? Tom sidestepped a teetering tower of hardbacks, steadying it before moving to catch up with her. &amp;nbsp; In the dim lighting he could just make out the shake of her head. Said the journals run for rows and rows. He hasn't found accounts from the first Satan of Level Six, might never if there is truly that many years of accounts housed there. &amp;nbsp; Bringing up the rear was one of the team that had been tasked with guarding Twinkle while he worked. They carried a makeshift torch, which cast a warm yellow light on their path, but even that wasn't enough to push back the sheer endlessness of the darkness and knowledge that surrounded them to dizzying heights. &amp;nbsp; The last time he'd navigated these pathways he'd been trying to to escape from Cam's capture. And her annoying tendency to try to take out his kneecaps. &amp;nbsp; Then he'd tossed her in a cell and hadn't looked back. Probably wasn't the best way to handle the misguided woman, but Tom hadn't felt like trying to convince someone they should join their cause who so clearly wanted to stand on the other side of it. &amp;nbsp; Still...she'd been left to her solitude for some time now. &amp;nbsp; Mentally, he added another item to his To Do list: test the temperature of Camille Deveaux. &amp;nbsp; Ahead, Eva cursed. She'd smacked a hip against the corner of a particularly thick book; it was as wide as five regular volumes and framed in a dull metal, large clasps holding the monstrous thing closed. She gave it a swift kick then continued on, muttering. Tom suppressed a grin. &amp;nbsp; What'd you do with Saddie? &amp;nbsp; She shrugged, pausing at a junction. Their light-bearer called out a direction and she took it. I figured it was best, for the time being he spend a little time away from the Hellizens, so I sent him with a recon team. They're showing him how to use the tablets. &amp;nbsp; He doesn't know how to use them? That was surprising. He hadn't even considered just how much technical prowess the Ruler of Level Six might have but he'd assumed he had at least *some* level of knowledge. &amp;nbsp; He couldn't confirm, but I gather as much. In fact, I don't think he knows much of how anything works around here. Mechanically speaking. He didn't even know the tablet had a floor plan. &amp;nbsp; That drew Tom up short. Really? &amp;nbsp; It's hard to tell but I think I'm starting to recognize when he's genuinely surprised. He's used them to open doors, but that might be the extent of his experience. He's likely had one of those Imps with him each time he went and did something. Eva cut left and took them down another narrow aisle. He hurried to catch up, mulling that information over in his head. &amp;nbsp; They'd been worried when following him to the 'Well of Souls that giving him a tablet would allow him a chance to regain some control. But he'd only used it to enter each of his designated stops. It was entirely possible Eva was right and he really didn't use them for more than door access. &amp;nbsp; So many questions, too few answers, he mumbled under his breath. &amp;nbsp; The sounds of their footfalls were joined by the distant sound of voices. Instantly, Tom recognized the authoritative tone of Twinkle Toes. Another, deeper, voice seemed to retort with just as much condescension. &amp;nbsp; Oh, I bet those two are just *loving* each other's company, Tom said. &amp;nbsp; It's positively heartwarming, Eva joked back. &amp;nbsp; It wasn't long before their voices drifted to them, clear and argumentative. &amp;nbsp; Clearly you aren't accounting for vernacular shift! All language changes. That was Twinkle. &amp;nbsp; This is my native tongue! Satan Two. &amp;nbsp; Which you clearly do not speak well from the help you've provided on this translation. There was a huff and snort. A clear sign Twinkle was well beyond indignant and straight in the clutches of exacerbated. You're hardly old enough to speak the *ancient* dialects of your language. Trust me, Tom wouldn't know what to do with an original copy of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and it's written in English, a language he knows and speaks poorly as well. You have that in common. &amp;nbsp; Satan Two hissed and replied back in the very tongue they were arguing over. &amp;nbsp; See, already I know enough to know that was extremely unkind and not helpful to our present situation now is it? Twinkle snapped back, all the force of a tired parent in his tone. &amp;nbsp; I leave you alone for five minutes and you've started in with the insults, Eva said as they finally turned the last corner to the aisle the two were positioned on. Their heads swiveled towards them, as did those of the three silent Hellizens standing behind them. One held a torch for closer inspection of the journals as the bio-luminescent light from the books wasn't enough for deeper investigation. &amp;nbsp; Five minutes? You were gone for well over an hour. I thought I said to bring Tom *post-haste*. Twinkle stamped his foot, dipping his horn in annoyance. &amp;nbsp; Unruffled by the unicorn's clear agitation, Eva patted him on the shoulder. For a mythical creature you sure do take things literally. &amp;nbsp; My dear, hyperbole is the resort of a dramatic and you are better than that, he tsked, then locked eyes with Tom. Do my efforts mean so little, Tom, that you can meander down here like you're taking a Sunday stroll? &amp;nbsp; For being not of his world, Twinkle certainly knew a fair amount of colloquiums from it. &amp;nbsp; There were two ways he could approach his reply: snark or flattery. It was anyone's guess when one would get you further with the prickly beast over the other. He opted for the third option, which never failed to needle at the unicorns sense of self importance, but often redirected him back to the task: pretending he hadn't heard the insult. &amp;nbsp; How far back have you gone in the journals? He moved closer to get a look at the volume currently open in Satan Two's hands. All the more he was certain there really was a difference in his appearance compared to Saddie, much in the same way two white cats looked alike but not. And right now, he looked as annoyed as Twinkle sounded. (And looked.) Satan Two sniffed the air by way of greeting, but whatever emotion he scented on Tom, he made no comment. &amp;nbsp; Would he ever get used to them doing that? Probably, but it wasn't today. &amp;nbsp; It's hard to tell. Their record keeping when it comes to the date is woefully inconsistent. One chronicler will format the date one way and another will have some other kind of rendition, while others still didn't even bother to *put* a date. I guess they figured no one would be reading these for their placement in a timeline, but I think I've managed to make it back a few billion years. Somewhere near the beginning, but I can't confirm because the help has been second guessing all my translations. &amp;nbsp; Tom nodded, continuing without addressing the obvious personal jab. Twinkle was just a little cranky. Probably time to suggest a break, if the proud unicorn would even take one. What was so important I needed to come so...archaically fast? &amp;nbsp; Twinkle rolled his eyes but pointed his horn to a stack of volumes piled high at Tom's left. One of the silent helpers rushed forward to grab whatever book Twinkle was gesturing to, obviously prepared for just such a task as they deftly pulled the fourth spine from the top clear, making sure to hold a hand on the others so they dropped down without toppling over. She handed it to Tom, stepping back to the circle of light their torch-bearer cast. &amp;nbsp; The sentry at his back stepped closer to cast his own light over Tom's shoulder. He cracked open the front cover, the brittle snap loud in the muffled hush of the library's air. The pages were aged and cracked, the script fat and bleeding on the vellum-like paper. &amp;nbsp; I had them mark the page. Twinkle urged, nodding towards a slim piece of torn paper near the center of the journal. Tom opened to the bookmark, light falling on a set of drawings instead of text. &amp;nbsp; Etched on the left-handed page were strange vessels, elongated and slim. The right had what looked like a top down view of one of those same vessels. A network of lines trailed out of the belly of it, leading to scribbled lines of text which filled the margins of the page. There were lines that looked suspiciously like mathematical equations though it wasn't any kind of mathematics he'd ever seen. &amp;nbsp; The vessels themselves were sleek, rendered with shading that implied whatever they were made out of in reality was reflective. Metal. &amp;nbsp; He'd seen his share of science fiction movies and shows to guess at what he was looking at. Spaceships? &amp;nbsp; Directly translated, something more like Bird of the Heavens but yes, I suppose you might confine it within the cage of such a primitive word. Twinkle touched the page with his horn. Turn the page. &amp;nbsp; He did. There were more drawings of these Birds of the Heavens; larger in scale he realized, as the artist had sketched out the vessel from the previous page in minute detail alongside the others. What's their importance? I mean, this could just be the imaginative scribbles of a previous Satan's work on a novel he wanted to write. A dream he had that he wanted to record. &amp;nbsp; But it felt like more than that. He just didn't want to jump to any conclusions. &amp;nbsp; Luckily there were no conclusions even *within* jumping distance. Tom didn't know what to make of this revelation without some context. &amp;nbsp; Eva leaned over his shoulder to see what he was talking about. She whistled low. That's some Star Trek shit right there. &amp;nbsp; While I doubt there is much in the way of creative brain power among the Satan's of Hell, having read through as much of their passing thoughts as I have, I wouldn't call you down here for arts and crafts. I've translated and cross-referenced the notations on these pages and the surrounding ones. In fact, these aren't the only volumes with similar drawings, along with star maps- &amp;nbsp; Star maps? Tom felt his brows raise in surprise. &amp;nbsp; Twinkle took the interruption in stride, motioning to another volume from the stack the one in Tom's hands had come from. The same girl darted forward and pulled one from the middle out, quick as one might pull a tablecloth from under the place settings. She handed it over, but not before flipping it open for him to the bookmark. &amp;nbsp; He thanked her and studied the page. It was fully coated in thick ink, like a rendition of a night sky, and where ink had been withheld formed what looked like a constellation, though Tom couldn't name it. &amp;nbsp; Not that he knew more than the famous constellations, of course. But it felt alien. Strange in a way that was simply intrinsic to him. The page next to it depicted another constellation set. Page after page, till the last one had left enough room at the bottom for an inscription. &amp;nbsp; As though reading the question on his face before he could ask it, Twinkle offered the translation. Long I've dreamt, oft a place I'll ne'er know. But the Star is writ upon my atoms even as mine eyes have never seen thee. &amp;nbsp; It was oddly beautiful, even poetic. &amp;nbsp; He was looking at the script when another book was thrust into his hands over the top of that, open to a page rendering the same constellation. Another scribble in a different hand altogether. &amp;nbsp; Home. Twinkle offered in a soft voice. There was more text there than would equal such a single word translation, but Tom didn't need the full break down to feel the gravity of this discovery. &amp;nbsp; Still, it spun his head, trying to piece it together, to give that gravity a voice. &amp;nbsp; Shit... Eva whispered, coming to the same heavy place as him. Does this mean the Kyzin weren't from here? &amp;nbsp; Twinkle's nostrils flared as he shook his mane ever so slightly, breaking the spell of awe that hung over Tom. Yes. I'm starting to think the Kyzin came from a world far away from this place. &amp;nbsp; Why leave their home, travel through space, just to make Hell? It didn't make sense to Tom. He knew in his own world, humans had done something similar with Australia, but even that dark chapter of their history couldn't compare to a whole race of beings leaving earth in spaceships just so they might pioneer a multilevel torture dimension. &amp;nbsp; That's the other reason I called you down here to see these. I've gone back far enough, collected enough samples of their writing and the subjects of their writings over the thousands and thousands of millenia and I'm starting to suspect...the Kyzin are not the creators of Hell. &amp;nbsp; Like the star maps before him, his understanding of everything fractured outward, bursting into a thousand questions, scattered like a web work of constellations within his head. How certain are you? &amp;nbsp; About as sure as I can be, but Tom, that's never one hundred percent. The true genius of an intellect is to never stop seeking the truth and to re-evaluate with new information. But unless something in the oldest of these volumes  provided we can find them  tell us something different, I'm strongly confident. The concession that he might never be fully sure of something was a bit of a surprise, given the surety with which he spoke. Was this a rare glimpse behind the armor of the unicorn? &amp;nbsp; Tom locked eyes with Satan Two. I'm guessing you can't confirm or deny this? &amp;nbsp; Satan Two chewed on a lower lip, considering his words carefully. He certainly seemed to dance around his curse with more ease than Saddie. Older perhaps? More practice at speaking around the words he couldn't expressly say? I'll say that I must write, but I need not read. &amp;nbsp; Eva pursed her lips. You weren't even curious about those that came before you? Not even once? &amp;nbsp; Satan Two shrugged, though Tom thought he noticed a stiffness in the motion. The curse? Not everyone is a *F'atiaqutaniza-ka*. &amp;nbsp; A what? Tom asked. &amp;nbsp; A poet. He means not everyone was a poet, Twinkle offered with a sigh. And he is right. Some of the drivel in these journals was bad enough that even if there were valuable pieces of information they're lost to us because I just...I'd rather be thrown into a vat of acid. &amp;nbsp; That's fair, Eva agreed, taking the book from Tom's palms. She thumbed through a few more pages, scanning the drawings more intently. &amp;nbsp; Tom turned on his heel, pacing between the shelves of the aisle. Once, twice, three times  churning his chaotic thoughts over till they started to align into neat rows, like code coming together. &amp;nbsp; The Kyzin set out into the void of space from where ever - *when ever* - their home planet is, billions of years ago. They...what? *Find* the Hell dimension abandoned? Overthrow the previous leadership? Either way, they set up shop, closing off all the levels and put one of their kind over each new micro kingdom, cursing them to silence and promising paradise for time served? &amp;nbsp; A tree of questions snaked outward in his mind's eye from each one of those pins in the hypothetical timeline. How had living beings found a plane of existence meant for the souls of the dead? Had they brought the robots with them, or were they relics from the days of creation? Had they found this place empty, devoid of any souls or were there Hellizens among the throng who'd been here since the beginning? He supposed that even if someone among Level Six's inhabitants had been here before the Kyzin found this place, their memory of that time was unlikely to hold any level of clarity by this point. &amp;nbsp; He didn't remember what he'd eaten the week before his death. If Twinkle's prediction was even close, a soul old enough to remember the beginning (or a change in management) would be somewhere in the trillions. And with how time worked in this plane, who knew what that translated to in their original world. They might be several times over a trillion. Which was a long time considering *his* universe was only estimated to be roughly thirteen billion years old. &amp;nbsp; Tom shook his head, thoughts going muddy around the magnitude of this train of thought. He could hear the words of his grandmother once, from when he was a boy. He'd asked her how old God was and she'd said he'd always been and always would be. Which, for a young boy, was a concept difficult to wrap one's mind around. This had the flavor of that. &amp;nbsp; As a man of logic and science, he believed everything had a beginning. Hell was no different. &amp;nbsp; Why? He continued to pace. Why leave their home world? Did all of them leave or just a few? Why take over Hell? Why silence their leaders? &amp;nbsp; And how did they continue to fill the ranks of Satans? The Kyzin lived and died and while it seemed their lifespans were longer than that of the average human, they would still need to replenish their population to span the number of years they'd been running this operation. &amp;nbsp; The answers are in here somewhere. I'll keep digging. Twinkle almost sounded excited by the prospect of digging further into the mystery. &amp;nbsp; Tom stopped pacing to take them all in. Eva was watching him, eyes sharp even in the dim lighting. She was processing this all in her usual manner and later she'd give him her thoughts. Twinkle turned back to the shelves, already dismissing him to continue his work. &amp;nbsp; Something sprang to his tongue before he even realized he'd thought it. Focus on writings that deal with The Curator. &amp;nbsp; If the Satan's couldn't bother to read the writings of their predecessors then they probably operated under assumptions. Anything closer to their present time would be riddled with tall tales and fear mongering, likely passed down by The Curator himself. But in the beginning...the beginning might yield more truthful accounts of the leader given dominion over Heaven. &amp;nbsp; There's been precious little about him thus far, but I have noticed some carefully vague grumblings about the Ruler on High. &amp;nbsp; The oldest stuff will likely give us more. Anything at all is better than nothing. Even the disgruntled ramblings of an employee will gives us insight. Tom tapped the stack of journals nearest him. Legends arent born, theyre created. Hopefully someone knew the man before the myth. &amp;nbsp; Twinkle nodded, turning back to his work. The three helpers drew closer while he gave them instructions. Run three deep this time. Ten minutes instead of five. Then pull a volume and bring it back to me. They gave a sharp nod of agreement and set off, leaving the rest of them in only the blue glow of the journal's spines and the last torchbearer's yellow light. &amp;nbsp; Thank you, Twinkle. We couldn't have gained this knowledge without you, Tom said, genuinely grateful for the unicorn's help. An army was nothing without knowledge and wisdom. They were well on their way to improve at least one of the latter things. &amp;nbsp; Of course you couldn't. Twinkle snorted. &amp;nbsp; Tom dipped his head towards Eva, who was smiling at him, rolling her eyes. She moved to stand next to him, likely ready to go check on Saddie and the others while he sank back into his task. &amp;nbsp; As their escort turned to lead them back towards the door, Tom could just barely make out Twinkle's, You're welcome. before they were out of earshot. It almost sounded humble. &amp;nbsp; *** &amp;nbsp; He hadn't returned to his quiet store room after bidding farewell to Eva. Instead, he found himself outside the doorway leading to the cell where Cam was undoubtedly fuming. When Eva caught wind of his idea, she'd called for Felicia. &amp;nbsp; You're not going alone. &amp;nbsp; She's not a threat. Except to my shins. She was a little bit of a threat. &amp;nbsp; Tom, you're not going alone. Eva hooked her arm through Felicia's as the woman approached, looking between the two of them. Lish, would you mind going with Tom? He wants to check on Cam. &amp;nbsp; Really, I'm fine- &amp;nbsp; Ill go. &amp;nbsp; For the record, Eva added, to Tom's dismay, he wanted to go alone. What do we say to that, Lish? &amp;nbsp; Felicia gave him a look of subtle disapproval. She schooled her features so strongly that it was often hard to read her emotions, but Tom could feel the wave of horror as it rolled off her. She did *not* like the idea of him putting himself in what she deemed harm's way. It's why she'd hung around after Swek had made a play for the telephone, cutting them off from Heaven's communication. &amp;nbsp; Now, he was going to get a stern speech about not taking risks for no reason. See, it wasn't that the viking-like woman didn't believe Tom *shouldn't* take risks, no, only that it needed to truly be worth it. Being overpowered by Cam was not one such risk. &amp;nbsp; We say, 'Not today, Satan'. &amp;nbsp; Eva laughed. I taught her that.  &amp;nbsp; I can see that. Hardly applicable to the current situation, Tom said, narrowing his eyes at her. &amp;nbsp; Au contraire! When a bad idea rears its head, that's the work of satan, coming to shake you off the straight and narrow path. She made a flicking motion with her thumb and middle finger. So you gotta tell that bad idea, Not today! and send it packing back to the loins of the devil that birthed it. She grinned at him. &amp;nbsp; Did anyone ever tell you you're weird? &amp;nbsp; She pretended to be confused. What's weird mean? &amp;nbsp; Okay, okay, I'll take Felicia. He waved the large woman forward and turned, heading for the side hallways leading to the prison cells. &amp;nbsp; If she steps out of line just tell her you'll have Twinkle knock her into another vat of acid! Eva called to his back. &amp;nbsp; Does Saddie know youre talking about his loins?"" he shot back at her. Her chuckle followed him into the hallway. &amp;nbsp; Now, standing at the door, he wasn't sure he wanted to open it. What would he even say to her? Would she want to hear it? She hadn't fought *too* much when they'd brought her here, but neither had she been truly compliant, spitting curses in Cajun french he knew were unflattering to him. It had sounded good though. &amp;nbsp; Felicia stood ready at his side, arms folded over her chest. He hadn't let her stop to get a weapon, but truthfully, she didn't need one. If one of her fists came for your head, it was, Hello stars, Goodnight Enemy, and he'd seen her dole out a hefty amount of hurt with her thick legs as well. &amp;nbsp; He didn't want to admit it, but he *did* feel safer with her there. Cam might not be big, but she made up for size with a healthy dose of ferocity and not a little bit of crazy. When coupled together, that could make her formidable. &amp;nbsp; You going to open it? Felicia asked when the silence had stretched for a minute more. &amp;nbsp; Yeah, I'm just... Wishing he had some shinguards. Or a cup. ...gathering my thoughts. &amp;nbsp; Felicia nodded but didn't press for further explanation. He liked that about her. &amp;nbsp; Sighing, he entered the room number and the door opened with a *whoosh*, ruffling his hair. Inside Cam was sitting cross-legged on the stone bed, back to them. She didn't even glance toward the sound of the door opening. She was hunched forward, resting her head in her hands, which in turn rested on her thighs. &amp;nbsp; Cam? Tom took a tentative step into the cell. Felicia took up a position directly behind him, blocking the entire doorway. &amp;nbsp; Now she did look back over her shoulder at him, hair falling away from her face to reveal one reddened cheek. Her eyes  the one he could see  looked red and puffy. &amp;nbsp; Had she been...crying? &amp;nbsp; He didn' come for me. The words were a muffled whisper into the fabric of her tunic. &amp;nbsp; It took a second for Tom to realize who she meant. &amp;nbsp; Swek. &amp;nbsp; She'd been waiting on the guy to bust her out. Come and release her from captivity. But he hadn't. In fact, he hadn't even tried, not that he would have been able to, but the fact wasn't lost on her. She must have known they'd been trying to get through one of the magically sealed doors. When the alarm sounded...she'd have known he had made his move. &amp;nbsp; Without her. &amp;nbsp; I'm sorry. It was all he could think to offer. &amp;nbsp; She sniffed and stuck her chin up, eyes sharp as glass. He could see her shell hardening right before his eyes, closing him off from the vulnerability she'd let slip a moment before. So. What's it to ya? Gon ahead, tell me you were right. &amp;nbsp; I was right. Careful, Tom. This was a delicate game, but he thought he was starting to understand her, just a little bit. &amp;nbsp; Her eyes shot wide, the tears in her eyes shining now with fury. You're kind of a bastard. &amp;nbsp; It's true, he admitted, sitting down on the second stone slab across from her. He hazarded a smile. His comment had done exactly what he'd wanted. Given her some power back. A chance to refocus her hurt into something she found more productive (even if *he* didn't): anger. &amp;nbsp; So you come to ask me to join your side? She turned in place, bringing her feet over the side of the bed. &amp;nbsp; I wouldn't insult you, Cam. You told me you wouldn't ever join us and you're a woman who values their word. &amp;nbsp; She eyed him, trying to discern the jest in his words. There wasn't any, but he didn't blame her for being cautious. Ever so slightly, she seemed to relax. You're right. When I give my word, I keep it. My mere told me the only currency worth anything was your word. Ain't no one gonna value you if you never keep your word. &amp;nbsp; Tom nodded. Smart woman. &amp;nbsp; Cam shrugged. Suppose so. &amp;nbsp; I can't let you go, Cam. But I could maybe move you somewhere more comfortable? It wasn't that Cam had any kind of inside information that she could give to Swek if she *did* manage to meet back up with him. Tom just didn't want another unknown variable at his back. And he did believe her. When she gave her word, she kept it. He was starting to see this woman was stubbornly loyal. &amp;nbsp; To a man who didn't deserve it. But he wasn't about to try to convince her of that. She was likely well aware of that fact, given Swek had flown the coop and left her behind with the *enemy*. &amp;nbsp; So I'm a prisoner of war? She sounded like she was rolling the word over her tongue, accent more pronounced than ever before. If words were clothes, she wanted to try these on. &amp;nbsp; Would you like to be? He asked, brows arching up. &amp;nbsp; It's only fair. The redness of her crying was starting to fade, replaced by the faint implication that she might actually be enjoying the exchange. That was a start. &amp;nbsp; Let's see what we can find you, closer to the action. That way I can grab ya quickly, should I need to use you to bargain with. &amp;nbsp; Most women would loathe the idea that they might be tools with which one could parlay with an enemy. Hell, most men would hate that too. Cam seemed to relish the idea, as though it made complete sense. That was how prisoners of war were valuable after all. &amp;nbsp; Tom had no intention of using her that way, but the banter took his mind off all the other pressing concerns. &amp;nbsp; Rising to stand, he turned towards Felicia. Her face was hard to read. How had she interpreted their strange verbal dance? Dis-ingenious? Bizarre? It wasn't the former, but it could certainly be the latter. Even to him, who'd participated in it. &amp;nbsp; Despite her efforts to be a nuisance, Tom didn't actually harbor any ill will to the woman. In fact, he admired her in a way. It must have been so freeing to give oneself over so completely to their sense of duty and commitment. To have no doubt you were doing what you thought was right. &amp;nbsp; Every villain is a hero in their own story and all that. &amp;nbsp; Not to mention, the woman had endured nearly being dissolved in a vat of acid for the man shed sworn her fealty. &amp;nbsp; Swek didn't deserve her, but he wasn't going to convince her of that. She had to find it out on her own. And he was confident, once she had, her unwavering loyalty might just find a better target. Till then, she'd remain their prisoner. &amp;nbsp; I'll send a team back to collect you when we've secured a new location for you. &amp;nbsp; Cam nodded, shifting again on the bed till she could lay down on it. More at ease with her new status than she'd been before. She had purpose again. A goal. &amp;nbsp; Back in the hallway, door secured behind him, he sighed. &amp;nbsp; Do you have children? Felicia asked. &amp;nbsp; The question surprised him. No. &amp;nbsp; Eyes wide and fathomless, she studied him. It was deeply intimate and yet clinical. She was once again assessing him as she'd done many times before. Putting him through whatever filter she saw the world through. &amp;nbsp; Among my people, one has two fathers. The one who gave him life and the one who leads him to a better version of themselves. It is the same with our mothers. One to birth us, another to teach. Sometimes they are one in the same. Sometimes, the parent who ushers us to our higher self comes to us by ways other than blood. She studied him again and turned on her heel, leaving him a little off balance. &amp;nbsp; He was still mulling over the heavy weight of Felicia's words when he parted with her and made for his silent storage nook. Head down, churning them over and over, he started to feel a little light headed. He'd never seen himself as a leader, that much he'd been clear about with everyone, much less a *father* figure. &amp;nbsp; Later, he will teasingly blame her, saying that if she hadn't gotten into his head with her sudden crown of added pressure (a father figure, really? was it the dad bod?) then he might have been paying attention to his surroundings. Might have seen what lay in wait and avoided it. &amp;nbsp; But he wasn't; and he didn't. &amp;nbsp; And when darkness struck him like a bolt, it was accompanied with pain, white hot and screaming (or was that him?), sending him propelling towards nothingness."
28,vulnerability,HFY,[OC] Weight of the World,1,e1oc5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/e1oc5b/oc_weight_of_the_world/,2019-11-26 09:53:05,"A looming shadow was cast over the megacity of Triumvirate, when the beating heart at its center ceased. One day, there were simply no more outbursts of orange lightning from the tower atop Triumvirates namesake, no more steadily paced bursts of dimensional static. One day, there was simply Silence. A dozen billion Novahumans stopped with bated breath, fully aware that something was wrong, for even those that had no other way of knowing could feel it in their implants, in the very gemstones that housed their minds. When the Transdimensional Displacement Engine stopped, so did all traffic between Triumvirate and its extraterrestrial and extra-universal colonies. No more exotic materials, no more supplies for the colonists, no more convenient zero-latency communications or faster-than-light travel to the colonies. Some were afraid, while many others were both ready and willing to begin emergency protocols - gather every single Novahuman capable of manifesting the iridescent lifeblood of civilization, the primordial soup of existence, the supreme power source known by some as Nilsen radiation, and by all as void energy, for it seemed to have truly come from nowhere. Indeed, the emergency protocols involved gathering nearly every single adult in Triumvirate and performing a world-shattering mass ritual in every sense of the word, using the citys own power grid as the ritual circle, to rip open a hole into the world between worlds and resurrect the T.D.E. The people of Novahome, and even more so those of Triumvirate were not meek sheep, they had fought for decades, some for millennia for the place they called home. Many died for this cause, once, twice, a dozen or a hundred times over. To them, no sacrifice was too great as long as they got to return to their homes and live their lives in peace at some point. After all, they had all the time in the universe and then some - it wasnt as if they were drawing only on the energy and resources of their world, for with each ignition of the T.D.E. and each trip, more new matter and energy was brought from the colonies to Novahome. Performing a mass ritual and risking total crystallization from void energy over-exposure, risking true death, that was not something most of them had to do before. There were certainly enough people with enough power and skill within the esoteric arts to perform such a ritual with little to no risk and less than a few hundred thousand individuals to bear the strain, but the common man didnt know that. The bounty hunter with half a dozen arms and two massive guns didnt know that, for he was only fifty. The barista with a kick strong enough to split a grown man in two didnt know that, for she was only seventy. The white-haired, mustachioed walking tank with a heart of gold didnt know that, for he was only three hundred. Not even the experienced runesmith with a thousand years of experience and a dozen spare bodies knew, for he had never considered such an act of self-sacrifice. Only, it never came to pass. For it was from within the Triumvirate itself that their salvation came. The dead god-machine came alive for the first time in a decade. It raised its four intact arms, tremendous arcs of red and orange arcing between its finger, and suddenly, a voice rang out. An all-permeating, wordless scream, a defiant roar into the cosmic ocean. All those who lived within the ever-expanding walls of Triumvirate heard it, for it was not sound or a signal, it was a vibration carried on the same void energy which permeated the megacitys streets, its buildings, its people, like haemolymph within the thorax of a great cosmic spider. Like the jolt of a defibrillator, a tremendous power power surge swept outward from T.D.E. complex. Were it not contained by the elaborate system of failsafes and inward-facing containment fields which had been built specifically for that purpose, it wouldve caused more damage to the citys infrastructure than the T.D.E.s failure ever couldve. Nevertheless, the system wasnt built to withstand this level of power output for more than a mere moment, and the damage had already been done - both to the citys failsafes, and the true beating heart at its center. **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** An obsidian-skinned, vaguely humanoid shape stumbled through the maintenance tunnels under one of many hidden apartments owned anonymously by a certain well-known CEO. Its head was crowned with wicked horns and a raging mane of orange crystal. Ichorous, black fluid ran down its body and trailed across the ground, mixing with showers of extremely fine sand of the same colour to form a sort of putty on the ground. Its metal feet click-clacked against the stone-like floor, its flaming eyes and gaping maw illuminated its surroundings like some sort of perverted Jack-o-Lantern. Sparks of orange danced and crackled across what had once been its skin, waves of black sand falling off with each pulse. Step by step, the creature made its way to the exit hatch, and with an inhuman synthesized growl, it yanked the heavy-duty seal open like so much as paper tissue. The security terminal screeched and beeped at the violation, but even it was silenced by a stray tendril of unworldly lightning as it lashed out at in its general direction from the creatures upper arm. It stepped out into the alley, and a puddle of black ichor formed beneath its foot within seconds. It began making its way towards a secret back door which otherwise perfectly blended into the wall, and with each step, more of its exoskeleton fell away, exposing not veins, organs, bones and muscles, but alien formations of braided crystal, a mixture of red, orange, and yellow hues, violently rippling and pulsing with even the slightest motion. The thing reached out with its right hand, which was missing the middle and pinkie finger altogether, now only represented by vaguely finger-shaped crystalline tendrils. It seemed to shrink back ever so slightly when the expected keypad didnt present itself, only for another tendril of lightning to lash out of its hand. It somehow overwhelmed the secret doors mechanisms with its sheer violence, yet didnt damage it in the slightest. The secret door slid open with a faint hiss, and the creature entered a tiny, hidden room - an airlock of sorts, with an even stronger door at the other side, meant as a measure to stop exactly this sort of intrusion. Only This mighty bulwark yielded just the same as the one which came before it. Body shedding black sand, dark ichor bubbling up from cracks in its carapace and running to the floor, and an un-worldly, maddening force driving it forward, the creature stepped past the precipice. The soft, lilac and blue lights flickered on, and the house VI awoke. *Welc-* it chirped in an upbeat voice, only to cut itself off with an almost lifelike sense of shock. The fiery-eyed humanoid craned its head upwards, then began to stumble its way through the main living space and towards a machine which resembled something between a coffee maker and a fridge, the brand Hagomune Y-3789 embossed on its metallic chassis in plain lettering. Without so much as a word, the VI dispensed a white cup made of ceramic-like material, and began filling it with fluorescent-orange liquid. *Youre not supposed to do that unless the ritual fails, you know,* the VI admonished. Someone mightve gotten it wrong. Put thousands in danger, she rumbled, reaching out for the mug. As she did, her self-repair protocols finally caught up, and the liquid nanites running down her body finally managed to consolidate and re-form missing pieces of exoskeleton. She unceremoniously kicked back the drink, and exhaled a tremendous cloud of steam. The combination of barely legal stimulants and biogel so good no amount of money can buy it kickstarted secondary self-repair subroutines, causing a coating of translucent orange jelly to rapidly flow out of the pores in her exoskeleton and form into a false coating of soft tissue, the very top layer rapidly becoming a matte, pale skin colour. Akaso reached for a second cup, and with a few steps in-between, sprawled out on a sofa. The holo-lens embedded in the coffee table came alive, and began projecting the most watched broadcasts covering the events which had just transpired, and which she had just single-handedly stopped. Nobody would know, not officially. But she couldnt have just let the people that put so much trust in her creations risk their lives. Shed go to a cafe and pretend she had no hand in it. Shed act like she hadnt just stared catastrophe in the face and told it No. Shed pretend she was the larger-than-life icon that her people thought her to be. Shed pretend she wasnt afraid. Sad. Lonely. Shed pretend she really was a thousand times more mature than other Novahumans of her age. Shed pretend the fame and fortune changed her, stripped her of vulnerability. Shed pretend, until she found the rare individuals who could see past the facade, past the riches and influence, past the raw power. Shed wait for those who saw that she was a demigod built from pieces of a broken child, held together by the sacrifice of a father, and still thought to reach out. Shed wait. And even until then, she wouldnt be alone. After a few minutes she got up, and made her was to the roof of the building, only three floors off the street - and yet, far above the megacity of Triumvirate, for it sat at the edge of one of its many monolithic skyscrapers, each containing a city in its own right. She took a sip of her drink, exhaled a puff of steam, and looked out across the blossoming creation of a dozen billion souls. A tear of black ichor ran down her face. A faint smile quirked her lips. She didnt have to bear the weight of the world alone."
29,vulnerability,HFY,11 (7 part 2),8,dqijms,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/dqijms/11_7_part_2/,2019-11-02 21:49:32," [\[First\]](URL 11 It had been eleven years since the attack and Corporal Miller had seen what at alien invasion looked like. Eleven years, and the only thing he ever wanted to do was let the nerds figure out the who, what and where, and then go punch the homicidal maniacs in their throat-equivalents using whatever tech the nerds could come up with to do the throat punching. Unfortunately, for Millers plans, the only thing that reached the public was a new type of energy generator which made cellphones and tablets practically self-charging. Stacking enough of Them together and you could comfortably supply a household with free power as well. Using his slightly above average deductive skills, he had summarized that the one place where he'd have a shot at trachea-trauma infliction would be in the United Terran Defence, so naturally, he enlisted when he was old enough. The first year had been tough, really tough. Not many of his fellow recruits had been age-equivalent, and basic training was definitely not designed for a 15-year-old boy, but not many of his fellow recruits had been driven by a revenge motive. Miller was. It didn't matter what the challenge was, or how impossible it seemed in the exercise brief, he would either push through or die trying. The hatred fueled his stamina, both physically and mentally, and allowed him to not only pass every challenge presented to him the first year, but he'd also finished top of the class. &amp;#x200B; 2nd year had been tougher. Much tougher. &amp;#x200B; Where the first year had focused on physical training, weapon use and maintenance, close-quarter combat and the theoretical aspect had been the equivalent of high school. All in all a lot crammed into a year, focused in 14hr days, 7 days per week, with a single 5 day week every 4 weeks and then 48 hours off. He'd usually spend his time off by sitting in the nearby woods, starting at the alluring dance and the promise of both warmth and pain the flames from his Campfire hinted at. He would watch the shadows dance across the side of the tent. And he would allow himself just a short Window of vulnerability, a single tear each time. The weeks had been divided into 2 days physical, 1 day of schooling, then 2 days combat &amp; weapons use, then another 2 days of schooling. Rinse and repeat. Year 2 had focused more on teamwork. Miller had found himself in a squad of 6 recruits, where every month one was chosen by the drill-sergeant as squad leader. Every week had been different. Teamwork exercises, puzzles, and cooperation drills. At first, he had tackled the challenges presented in the drill briefings with his usual solution: Head on brute force and hatred fueled willpower. Naturally, this approach had failed and in his blind rage he had, inadvertently, caused a fellow recruit to sustain severe injury during the first week. This had broken him. The drill sergeant had found his bed empty during a midnight checkup of the barracks and had done a quick sweep of the premises, to see where his wayward recruit had gone to. He had found him on the rooftop of the mess hall. &amp;#x200B; ""Miller! What in the sheep-shagging sumbish are you doing up there recruit?"" The question had been poorly hidden behind the outright offensive volume it was delivered in. ""Nothing drill sergeant."" Barely a whisper, even by the conversational standards of civilian life. ""Front and center you useless excuse for a sheet stain."" Volume: unchanged. Tone: wavering. Miller had gotten up, trotted down the roof to the rain gutter, taken a single glance at the 3-meter drop and casually rolled off the roof, upon touching ground the roll was completed, with Miller standing at attention in front of the sergeant. ""Yes...sir"" no pride, no volume, full disregard that addressing the drill sergeant as \\\*sir\\\* would result in scrubbing the ENTIRE barracks with his toothbrush. &amp;#x200B; ""Walk with me, Miller."" The two of them walked out to the perimeter fence of the compound in silence.""What do you see?"" The sergeant gestured to the horizon, the mirror glow of a city was clearly visible on the clouds in the distance. ""Open terrain, easily defended, 186 attempts at concealing landmines, 23 remote controlled hidden turret mounts and light-reflections on the clouds, a friendly settlement 22 k's out."" Miller listed his observations calmly. ""Not wrong miller... I'll need to double-check your estimations on the defenses, but also not what I meant"" ""No need to check sarge, I'm right"" No smugness, no pride, simply stating facts. ""If you are, I'll let you know. What I see is Earth, as fucked as we are as a species, I see dirt, life and home"" The Drill Sergeant turned to face Miller ""the ONLY reason this is what I see, and not the gates of hell..."" ""Hammer Squadron"" Miller offered. The Drill sergeants face contorted into a mix of expressions, anger being the most forward of those, quickly followed by a deep breath and a facial reset into understanding and compassion. Sgt. Sanchez looked out at the former forest-now-turning-into-a-desert landscape. The scattered trees, desperately clinging to what one Was, interspersed with the various invasive forerunners, Much Better suited to the low-hydration, high-temperature biome the former forest Was transforming into. Each of the trees were fighting in vain, none of Them would survive the next decade, and Sanches Saw way too Many similarities between both himself and his recruits, and those struggling trees. ""You were only a child when the attack happened, and so that would be your perception, but no. As much as The Hammers did, it was a team effort to make it possible. Everyone wants to win, to be the best, and make no mistake Cadet: If ANYTHING comes through those gates that need to get fucked up face-first, you'd be my first pick every day. But there are NO missions anywhere, ever, that will rely solely on beating shit to death with other shit."" Miller looked at the sarge, not understanding the point. The UTD airborne force had tallied in around 300k aircraft and Hammer Squadron had consisted of 57, of course, they hadn't been alone. &amp;#x200B; ""Teamwork, Miller, teamwork. Everyone knowing what their part of the mission is, some are the spearhead, others are the shaft, and somewhere in the middle is a paper-pushing leather strap, that makes all the individual parts work together and be a lot more dangerous."" Miller sighed as the sarge continued: ""You've been treating your teammates as if they were you, same ideas, same skill sets and same abilities. They're not. Not even close, Emerson would snap like a twig if you two were facing off in hand-to-hand. But his skill set is different from yours."" A deep breath from the sergeant and then a long pause. ""I think you need to view your squad members as enemies"" Miller reared back ""what? but?"" ""analyse them, like you would an opponent, spot their weaknesses and identify their strengths, then, instead of using their weakness against them, use their strengths in your favour."" &amp;#x200B; Silence fell over the pair, as they stood by the fence of the UTD compound and time passed. ""thanks sarge"" ""Don't mention it"" There was no attempt to hide the underlying threat. ""And Miller, before you head back to the barracks, that little rooftop stunt, will have you talking to the one person inside this fence that doesn't think hating the enemy is a good thing"" ""Yes sarge"" ""The barracks will, of course, be as clean as the colonels glasses by sunrise"" ""YES DRILL SERGEANT!!!!"" ""Dismissed"" &amp;#x200B; As Miller sprinted off to the Barracks, Drill Sergeant Sanches looked at the boy, took a deep breath, whispered a silent ""sleep well kid"" to himself and headed off to fill in the pile of paperwork needed to get his golden goose into a therapeutic session. At the end of his time in the Infantry barracks, corporal Miller found himself in charge of the squad for 4 months straight, as if by magic, the Cadets had turned around on a plate and, instead of suffering harrowing defeats and injuries, they had become a force to be reckoned with. 11 months of gruelling teamwork drills and missions with a 100% completion and survival rate. &amp;#x200B; At the final graduation parade, a total of 1000 Cadets had finished their training, all stood at attention in their dress uniforms, not a spec out of place, holding their glee in while the Colonel took the stand to give them their final address as recruits. Colonel James Henderson rose from his seat, slightly behind the microphone podium, walked the 4 steps to it, cleared his throat and took a second glance at the tablet in his hands. ""All celebrations are cancelled, as long-range satellites have identified numerous meteors travelling towards Earth on a collision course. All Personel report to your Immediate superior for instructions"" Not a single beat was missed, every last of the newly-graduated Cadets were on point. 5 Cadets had formed a loose semi-circle around a 6th. ""what now corporal?"" Emerson looked at Miller with eyes that could have pierced steel. Charles Ricardo Emerson. A man who, prior to his joining the UTD, would have lost any physical challenge against most inanimate objects, had spent his entire two-year training trying to keep up with Millers shadow, the man was Hyper intelligent, and a true genius when it came to electronics and computers. He had jury-rigged a couple of cellphone batteries with some wire-doohickey-stuff and a body-bag from the morgue to ensure that the squad always had hot water in the barracks, the contraption was confiscated on every inspection, but something similar would be in its empty spot no less than 20 minutes after the inspections had ended. He was also the tactical perspective and a VERY dangerous enemy unless you were Miller. ""It looks like the only ones who get to throat punch are the SOB."" Miller was torn inside, he knew that the rest of the squad weren't particularly keen on joining the Stellar-Operations-Battalion, but after graduating each cadet had to apply to join a branch for specialization. Privately he had hoped that he could have joined the airforce. ""So as my last action as your Immediate Superior"" He smiled ""you maggots better go sign up for your preferred branch"" ""Yea-Nah fook yoos Corporal"" Louise Biedermann, originally from Germany, but she had the annoying habit of semi-adopting the dialect of whoever she was currently using to keep the sheets warm...badly. Long-range support and the best tactical marksman Miller had ever met. ""if yous goin' SOB mate, so's we"" &amp;#x200B; **A/N:** I know the style has changed a bit, but 7 was intended to be a one shot at first, and then the story kinda grew. I couldn't make it fit the format and keep all the stuff in that I wanted in this part. comments, corrections and opinions are encouraged."

Karen from Accounting _didn't_ end up speaking with the checkpoint guard's manager, but she made it clear she had a Very Important Appointment waiting for her on the other side. And Jabba the Hutt trailed a line of squealing jawas behind her. Han Solo followed behind, looking like he'd rather still be frozen in carbonite. The slice of toast gave a satisfying *crunch* as Solomon bit into it, the sweetness of the jam combining with the caramelized flavors of the toasted bread, complimenting the cheap but not unpleasant flavor of the coffee in the cup next to it. Solomon reviewed his plans on his laptop, navigating through different pieces of information in his virtual crazy wall software, updating it with information from emails he'd received last night. A letter from a middle manager in one of the launch partners indicating &amp;mdash; in far too many words &amp;mdash; that something-or-other relating to labor practices had general support and would be able to go to a vote. Another indicated that the proposed revisions to the aerospace aluminum tariff schedule had gone through, securing Solomon's end of a bargain with another supplier. It wasn't all good news, unfortunately. The project review board's report had included an extra finding he'd hoped they'd omit, and while he already had a scapegoat lined up, that was going to cost him a few favors. Just more byzantine corporate politics. Down below, Pee-Wee Harris had forgotten to to put his knife in his checked bag with the rest of his troop, and one of the older boy scouts took him back to help him Fed-Ex it home. Shama Biswas glanced around in her green hoodie as a guard opened her bag for a search, and for a moment she looked like she was about to try reaching in to palm something. Flava Flav made a lewd comment at one of the security guards as he waddled past with his pants sagging nearly to the knee, and earned himself and his sideways baseball hat a complimentary secondary screening and an escort over to one side. And Arnold Schwarzenegger presented some kind of badge as he pulled a holster out of jacket, placing it and the large handgun inside it on the conveyor belt. Overall, it looked like Solomon's political maneuverings were about to pay off. There was still a chance he'd be saddled with an administrator if his business in New York didn't pan out, but even if so he was pretty confident he knew who they'd saddle him with. he might not like it but he could at least work with them. The waitress came by to refill his coffee, and Solomon was mid-sentence asking for another plate of toast when something suddenly snagged in the back of his mind. He froze, and quickly looked back down over the edge of the balcony. For some reason Schwarzenegger had been held up, and the guard had called over a superior to verify the document or badge he'd presented. He was clearly becoming very agitated, trying to pay attention to something on the other side of the checkpoint, while simultaneously having to pay attention to the guards to resolve the holdup. Solomon followed his gaze just in time to see Green Hoodie disappear into the crowd, getting a glimpse of her face as she glanced back towards the checkpoint. And there it was. Solomon realized he'd stopped mid-sentence, and he apologized to the waitress as he scrambled to pull up a picture. ""Sorry, give me a minute."" The one photo he'd managed to find that showed a face wasn't great, and he really hadn't gotten that good of a glance, but in many of the others she wore a _very_ similar green hoodie, and the build was _definitely_ a match. -------- The feeling of being watched subsided as Angela got away from the checkpoint, and after a moment her bodyguard caught up. It had been a stroke of luck when he'd been held up, giving her the perfect chance to retrieve some of her items from her bag without him breathing down her neck. She certainly hadn't been going to wait for him, and it would've been all the better if he'd somehow managed to lose her all on his own. After a night's rest she was a lot more composed than she'd been the night before, but the nagging need to get away somehow was still very much present, and the lockpicks and notebook in her bag weighed heavily on her mind. She didn't like to rely on magic &amp;mdash; not after her failure under pressure with defending herself that in a way had led to _all of this_ &amp;mdash; but she now had a lot more practice with a number of spells, after casting many of them repeatedly for the human's experiments. She'd also spent some time to prepare several nearly-complete sigils in her notebook. Preparing these sorts of incomplete spells was a bit tricky; you had to spend the time up front to do everything in a way that would make it easy to pick back up. Even with that, you still needed at least a vague memory of what you were doing, but as long as you were able to recall it, it could be a significant time saver if you needed to be able to cast a more complex spell quickly. Back on Kemhe, carrying a notebook with some of the sigils she'd drawn could get one in a _lot_ of trouble, but here on Earth there were only a handful of people that would even know what they were, much less try to stop her. After a moment Angela got to the gate, and took a seat to wait for the flight. Last night after reaching the breaking point, Angela had finally buckled down and texted Jess, pouring out everything that had been going on. Her escalationg stress from working in the same few locations. Echoes of her feelings of vulnerability after the incident four months ago. How her need for security had twisted into a sort of paranoid fear. The loss of control, her efforts to manage her stress, ideations about escaping and running away. Even going so far as to lay out fragments of a plan, details she'd noticed about how to get past the security fence in Palmdale. The map she'd put together of foot traffic around NIH, showing all the back entrances and broom closets and mechanical spaces of the main building where she usually worked. Everything. To what end she didn't know, but at that point she'd just been texting everything she could think of, hoping Jess would be able to help her. Of all the humans she knew, Jess was probably the one she trusted most. She'd been consistently sympathetic in the past, and was generally fairly outspoken in advocating for her interests, at least in the few meetings she went too. Unfortunately, while Mike and Matt had both managed to find their niche within the project working with different teams, Jess hadn't really found a place where she could really do much, and had announced that she would return to school to finish her mechanical engineering degree next fall. This had been a bit of a blow to Angela, but this was her decision; even if Angela _could_ convince her to stay, if Jess felt the need to move on it wouldn't be right to. This was one of the main reasons she'd held off asking for help for so long, and Angela still felt bad about getting her involved in what was really a personal issue. Well, she hadn't told her _everything_ everything. She glanced behind her, to where her bodyguard stood a respectful distance away against a large pillar. Going through security had been nerve-wracking, and while none of the items in her bag were strictly speaking against _their_ rules, it had been especially embarrassing when her bag had been searched. She'd almost instinctively reached out to try to snag something from it when it had been opened, and pulling her hand away had taken a small effort of will. At least nobody had noticed, or she didn't think anyone had. Angela pulled out her notebook and opened up, just letting her pen wander. Jess _had_ been sympathetic, talking things through with Angela to help her sort out her thoughts, but ... What _had_ Angela expected, exactly? More information &amp;mdash; details on security patrols, help and advice on refining and developing the fragment Angela had laid out? A promise to help her escape &amp;mdash; from what even? That they'd a freedom pact like _Thamhad_ and _Sannair_, like in the stories? The idea of ""forging a freedom pact"" over _text_ of all things felt ... almost sacrilegious somehow, and humans didn't really even _have_ stories like that. Sure, _The Italian Job_, _Ocean's 11_, or _Logan Lucky_, had similar plots, but there weren't any of the themes of the sort found in something like _One Piece_ or other Shnen. Besides, the real world doesn't work that way. This wasn't a fairy tale, this was real life. And besides, at the intellectual level Angela didn't even _want_ to ""escape"". Yes, escape the _planet_, but that was the _whole point_ of staying focused, working on the project, and upholding her end of the deal. And if she did want to leave, walk out on the project, she could. That had been part of the deal. If she really wanted out, she didn't _need_ to ""escape"" or do anything dramatic. The humans _would_ honor their agreement. Right? Angela read the last text from Jess again. &gt; `Just try to hold out until you get back to Palmdale, we'll figure something out.` Maybe ""we'll figure something out"" was meant as some kind of promise, but the vagueness didn't help. Who was ""we""? Herself and Jess? Herself, Jess, and some additional accomplice? She trusted Jess, but did she trust everyone _Jess_ trusted? Did this ""we"" include one of _them_ &amp;mdash; whoever it is _they_ were? Stop. No. This sort of eisegesis was the opposite helpful. There was no conspiracy, there was nobody after her, the entire concept was as far-fetched today as it was day _one_, and she couldn't start doubting _everyone_ and _everything_ over some _slightly vague wording_ in a _text message_. When she got to LAX, Angela wasn't going to _do_ anything. She was going to step off the plane, walk down the concourse to the curb, and then ride in the car back to Palmdale. Once she was there, _then_ she could worry about this. Angela came to a halt, realizing to her horror that she'd been mumbling some of these thoughts out loud. She shot her gaze around, ears wiggling under her hood, and immediately felt like she was being watched again. How much had she said? Had anyone heard? It didn't look like anyone had noticed, and with din of the crowd starting to line up to board the plane, it would've been difficult for anyone further than a few feet to hear. It's fine. Don't stress. Angela looked down at her notepad. She'd unconsciously drawn out a map of LAX terminal six, plotting the route she expected to take out of the airport. And it was covered with annotations, various half-baked ""escape"" plans scribbled on and around it. Ugh! No! At least most of this was written in her native Kemhe script, although there were a few English words scattered in there. It's not like anyone except maybe a few of the linguists could actually read this, right? Besides, she'd still need some kind of diversion or some way to create extra chaos for the plan to have even a chance of working. She forced her mind back off that track, and found she'd written that thought down at the bottom of the page. In English. ""Aagh! No!"" She tore the page from her notebook and ripped it in half, and jumped to her feet. She suddenly felt very conscious of the attention this outburst had attracted from the gathering line of people, and she froze, frantically searching for a way out. ""Time to go."" The words from her bodyguard brought Angela back to ground. Stop. Breathe. It was time for her to board the plane. The wadded paper made a *shnk* sound against the plastic liner of the trash can as Angela fled down the jet bridge. -------- ""con-spur *nnn* they're after me *nnn* won't work *nnn* need to trust"", Angela mumbled quietly. It had taken Solomon a few minutes to get through security, re-acquire his target, and set up, but this was definitely her. Solomon had set up just out of line of sight, on the other side and a bit further down, and now listened carefully to try to pick out anything he could. Optical microphones of the sort he'd pointed at the plate glass window in front Angela were often unreliable, but it was about the only thing with any hope of isolating conversation in this environment, at this range. So far, his effort had been thwarted, but finally he'd managed to pick up something. Solomon recorded everything, and made careful note of it all. The thug following her wasn't doing anything to try to blend in, leaning against a pillar in open view. He hadn't been able to find any matches for him so far, so Solomon didn't have much to go on in terms of potential actors, but he could hazard a guess as to why the man was here. In other circumstances he would've guessed ""bodyguard"", but given the way Angela had tried to ditch him at the security checkpoint that seemed very unlikely. Clearly whoever it was didn't care if she noticed him, and based on body language and her fragmented mumblings just now, she clearly _had_ noticed, and considered him a threat. He was here to intimidate her and ensure she got on the plane. Why this mystery actor felt the need to force her onto a plane &amp;mdash; rather than, say, simply kidnapping her &amp;mdash; was still a mystery. Solomon had had to employ similar tactics himself in the past, usually force nosy journalists who were getting too close out of the country, _before_ they'd put themselves in _real_ danger asking the wrong questions. Another group of people passed by, blocking the beam from his mic and cutting off the audio. Solomon's plane was due to begin boarding in only half an hour, but he didn't care. There were at least six other flights he could catch to JFK and still make the overnight to Cairo, and this was far more important than what he'd be doing in New York. After a moment the crowd subsided and he was able to re-acquire the signal. ""&amp;mdash; step off the plane,"" there was a brief pause, ""then worry about this"". Angela was silent after this. Solomon waited, listened, and watched. After a moment there was a brief outburst, and Solomon turned to look; his gaze would be only of several, and wouldn't be out of place. Angela had stepped into Solomon's line of sight from behind the pillar, and tore a sheet of paper in half, but then froze as the thug walked up to her. After making some sort of remark Solomon couldn't hear &amp;mdash; likely a warning not to cause any trouble &amp;mdash; he escorted her up to the gate, and followed her down the jet bridge. A second later, Solomon realized that Angela had thrown the scrap of paper into a trash when she'd passed by. Solomon waited as the remaining passengers boarded, and the plane pushed away from the gate. The thug did not re-emerge; he'd boarded the plane with her. Unusual, but probably meant there was a specific connecting flight they needed to force her to take. It also meant that this actor probably didn't intend to shoot down the plane or otherwise have it crash. He sat there for another half hour, following the flight's progress as it taxied to the runway and took off, watching and waiting to ensure any _other_ potential observers had had the opportunity to move on. Hers was an eight-hour flight from DCA to LAX. Solomon had plenty of time to wait, plan, and figure out the correct course of action. What he didn't have time for were sloppy mistakes. But the first step would be retrieving the paper Angela had thrown into the trash. Solomon winced as a kid threw a McDonalds bag smeared with ketchup into the same trash bin. The kid missed and it bounced off the rim onto the floor, but he'd waited long enough. He packed everything back into his bag, and got to work. First, a bag of chips from the mall kiosk. He paid for it with cash. In the bathroom, he changed into the horrifically garish Hawaiian shirt and hideous pair of shutter shades. He had planned to wear these getting off in Cairo. He opened the bag of chips, and emptied most of the chips into the toilet. He stepped out of the restroom, and sauntered back down the terminal. He paused in the walkway, a few feet from the trash can. He looked into the bag, and shook it slightly to emphasize it's near-emptiness to any potential observers. From here, he could see the two wadded pieces of paper, resting near the top of the can atop other garbage. He took the last potato chip, and ate it. He didn't have to feign disgust at the ketchup splattered around the can's rim, but it was a useful excuse. He lowered the empty bag into the can gingerly, by one corner. When he withdrew his hand, both halves of the page were crumpled tightly into one palm. He didn't look at either of them. Not yet. He returned to the walkway, and resumed walking, until he was far out of sight at the other end of the terminal. -------- At this point, there was very little Solomon could have done from DC that he couldn't do from New York, but his heart was still pounding when he boarded the flight to JFK. _This is why I was never a field agent,_ he grumbled to himself. Solomon was perfectly capable of doing field work himself, but had never been his area of expertise, and he now felt a bit silly about the elaborate stunt he'd pulled to grab the paper from the trash. _I'll take a potato chip, and **eat it**_ indeed. Ugh. After paying the extortion rates most airlines in the US _still_ charged for WiFi, he was able to photograph the two halves of the paper and upload them to his intelligence aggregator for processing. Matching the seam between the two fragments together wasn't difficult, and he submitted a search query for anything and everything relevant to the contents that the servers could find. The writing on the page was _exceptionally_ neat, not quite typewritten but very evenly-spaced in uniform straight rows. The text itself though drifted between English and some other script Solomon didn't immediately recognise. It looked a bit familiar though, and ... he stared at it for a few moments. _Oh. That would make a lot of sense._ He pulled up his scans of the Auriga flight manuals. This was definitely a match. And further confirmation. Angela wasn't just someone _else_ who matched the profile and had somehow gotten deeply involved with all this by mistake. Angela _was_ the alien. Of Solomon's team, Joyce knew the most about this script, and he immediately sent her a message containing the scans. He'd have to wait until the plane landed to make a live call, but she would need some time to look at it anyway. Most of the mixed english and xeno text was scattered across some kind of diagram or map, presumptively annotations of some kind for it. He didn't recognise it, but when the aggregation servers returned a hit for LAX terminal six, he wasn't surprised. What was surprising was how _accurate_ the drawn map was. The outline of the terminal was a near perfect match. _Is this even drawn, rather than printed?_ Solomon re-inspected the paper, and felt the marks on the page. It looked like pen ink, and there were small impressions in the page from a pen being dragged across the surface, right where one would expect. There were also _other_ impressions, from whatever had been written on the _previous_ page. He needed to get this developed, ASAP. -------- Solomon again sat at a cafe in an airport, this time in New York. Instead of meeting with his associate as he'd planned, he'd spent the majority of the day analyzing the document, comparing it to other evidence, and trying to piece everything together. Finding a forensic document examiner in New York willing to work on such short notice had taken several hours, and cost him a pretty penny. It also hadn't given him much more to go on, aside from a confirmation that this was indeed handwritten rather than drawn with a pen plotter. Most of the latent indented handwriting had just turned out to be some kind of decorative geometric design. The pattern _did_ bear some faint resemblance to some of the written glyphs. but nobody had any sense for what it was or meant, and they couldn't simply turn to the internet here like they'd been able to with the flight manual. Jack had said it looked vaguely reminiscent of a complicated distributed element filter. They had, however, been able to discern some meaning from the visible writing. The smattering of English words had revealed several interesting faucets of the language's sentence structure, and Joyce had been able to provide rough meanings for many of the annotations. Solomon went over what he'd been able to determine one more time, hoping something else might pop out at him. Fact 1. Whichever actor had sent the thug to ensure Angela got on the plane, Angela had apparently been aware of them for a significant length of time, likely back to or possibly before the train fire and mugging incidents four months ago. Fact 2, she'd known in advance, that this actor would be sending someone to escort or follow her, and she had planned to escape from them at Los Angeles airport. Fact 3, there was some other co-conspirator that she'd expected to provide some kind of assistance in her escape, but this had failed in some way, and she'd been forced to plan around it. Fact 4, the plan she'd laid out had a _very_ low chance of working. Angela had marked out on her map, dozens of different chokepoints, alternate routes, and possible diversions relevant to the escape route. All things considered, it wasn't a bad plan. For an amateur, anyway. She'd missed one _critical_ point along the route she'd marked. Nearly thirty years ago, Solomon had been involved in an operation trying to retrieve a target that had fled to the US, that had involved a very similar sort of ""escort"" mission through Los Angeles International Airport. It was one of the very few overseas operations he'd conducted in the US, and it wasn't one he was proud of, but he'd done what he had to. Fortunately the efforts to divert the plane to a more favorable terminal had worked, and consequently the terminal six plan hadn't been necessary. But assuming the currently ongoing operation was being coordinated by anyone even remotely competent, Solomon was almost _certain_ there'd be a second thug waiting to intervene at that critical junction. Angela had, fortunately, seem to realize there was _something_ wrong with the plan, even if she hadn't realized why. Down at the very bottom, she'd written in English, ""still need a diversion"", ""escape in the chaos"". Although brief, those notions were _exactly_ correct, and with the right sort of diversion the plan _could_ still work. The means to create such a diversion were easily within Solomon's grasp. Solomon didn't know the full situation. He'd done his best to find out as much as he could, but he still hadn't been able to dig up who this mystery actor was, what they wanted with Angela. For that matter, Solomon didn't know _why_ Angela was here, on this planet. The best conjecture he could figure is that the ""original"" Auriga pod he had in Cairo was an _escape_ pod, and she'd landed here due to some emergency or fault with the Carina mothership and was now stranded. What was Solomon's _goal_ here, exactly? Why did he care? What was he hoping to accomplish? Certainly, if Solomon did nothing this mystery actor was going to achieve _their_ goal, and any action he took would be adversarial to them. _Should_ he oppose them, not knowing anything about what their goals even were? Perhaps she posed some kind of real danger, that this mystery actor hoped to avert. Solomon himself had certainly made the choice himself many times in his career, putting what was necessary over what felt right or just or fair. That was the key question: Did Angela pose a threat? To Earth, to its people, to anyone. Even if it was known for certain that Angela didn't pose a threat, any intelligence agency worth their salt aware of her would still try to persue her If this actor was from outside the US, it would make sense that they'd want to strong-arm her onto friendly territory before taking custody. The current operation didn't prove anything either way in that regard, except that they'd noticed her. Really, given that she'd first arrived nearly two years ago and it had taken until just four months ago _for_ anyone to notice, indicated the opposite: she _didn't_ pose a significant threat. So then, was interfering the right thing to do? What were Solomon's _own_ interests in the matter? Gaining access to Angela himself would be invaluable for the project, and that was far more likely to be possible if Angela escaped. Angela almost certainly knew more about this actor's intentions than he did, and she'd judged it worthwhile to plan to escape. Either way, if she were captured that would likely be final. Angela's plane had just started it's approach to land, and if he was going to act, he needed to set things into motion well before it got to the gate. The deadline was four minutes from now. By intervening, he might do more harm than good. It was dangerous to depend on her ability to think on her feet, and if something fell flat in the execution because she wasn't expecting the diversion to occur, she might be injured or killed in the attempt. Was that risk worse than the risk posed by doing nothing? When you weren't sure, doing nothing was often the safer policy. It's possible Solomon had made an assumption somewhere along the line, and his understanding of the situation could be totally skewed. If he'd just been more diligent in his investigation, less concerned about his own safety, _something_, maybe he'd have found some bit of information that would've changed the whole picture. But one rarely knew all of the facts. If you thought you did, you were probably more ignorant than anyone. And if you waited until you were certain, it was almost always too late. Solomon reviewed [the checklist][checklist] he'd filled out one last time, and made his decision.

31,vulnerability,HFY,[Wild Frontier] Ikirouta - Gods' Fall,9,d9lht0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/d9lht0/wild_frontier_ikirouta_gods_fall/,2019-09-27 01:51:30,"This is for the \[From the Dirt Up\] category. &gt;Old legends say the first of mankind came to this world through a rift that connected two very different worlds. Eventually it collapsed, leaving people behind to live their separate lives on this world, where in time, theyd come into contact with alien civilizations that for thousands of years had been ruled by living gods who had descended from the heavens to lead them. Opposite to what one would expect, under their tutelage the world had been driven into a perpetual state of struggle. Bloody wars were waged only to satisfy the endless vanity of gods and so their servants could show their loyalty through their sacrifice and claim glory for their gods through brutality. When the other-worldly Humans appeared, they quickly caught everyones attention. Gods and their servants, the Illuvarans soon waged a holy war against the weak and primitive Humans who had no means to defend against the supremacy of Illuvarans who had already mastered metalworking to a high degree. Their steel blades and armour made them nigh invulnerable on the battlefield against the crude weapons of Humans made of bronze and stone. Humanity was enslaved and for the thousand years that followed, there were no free Human tribes or nations, until escaped slaves found a refuge far in the arctic North, around the arctic circle, where the lands were separated from the South by titanic mountain ranges and vast woodlands. &gt; &gt;Over time, as word spread and more people escaped and made their way North, they formed new tribes and settlements, which would grow into the first nations that spawned the great cities of North that rose in defiance to the odds raised against them by the many perils and challenges of the arctic north. Kingdoms and empires would rise and fall as Humans expanded, taking over Northern parts of the continent all while gods and their puppets remained ignorant of their success. When their fields would freeze in winter, their livelihoods would come from the seas, where mighty fleets would clash, vying for control over the waters and islands richest with resource. Forged in the fires of war and tempered by the challenges of the arctic, empires of Humanity were propelled into a golden age. With empires seeking to achieve supremacy over one another, their competition spiralled into a technological arms race that lead into many discoveries and advancements both in the arcane and physical levels of the reality that enabled technologies and weapons that would soon eclipse even those of the gods favourites: the Illuvarans. &gt; &gt;Decades went by and a new world, an entire continent, uninhabited and untouched even by the gods was found in the East over the ocean. Colonies were built to exploit its resources and it seemed like Humanity was about to enter yet another Golden Age, until soon after the discovery of the new world, grim news from the South reached them. Rumours had long circulated of Human slaves being executed in sacrifice to gods by the order of the gods themselves and later when reports from the spies confirmed this to be true, they also found out Illuvarans had been wiping out entire Human slave populations in Illuvaran cities. Free Nations of Humanity had been aware of the horrors inflicted upon their kind by the Illuvarans and their gods, but their policy had been to remain under the radar so as to not rouse the ire of gods. The news of mass executions and outright genocide however inflamed their resentments that had long remained dormant. &gt; &gt;A year after the news broke out, Illuvaran cities by the coast saw high masts and great sails slowly rise from the seas horizon. A fleet of hundreds of strange ships appeared near the coast. For the first time in over a thousand years, Humanity once more stood against the civilizations that dominated this world. This time it was not crude weapons made of stone and bronze that met Illuvaran steel. For the first time in their ten thousand years of history, they would bear witness to an inconceivable act of defiance and see the death of a god. The godless North had come seeking for the justice long overdue. The skies would glow with their retribution as cities burned, scorched by the combined power of Humanity released unholy firestorms upon them that would spare not even the holiest of temples. Word quickly spread of the Northern devils whose hellfire would rain down from the heavens, immolating cities with infernos that spared no mortal, no god. The death of a god sent shockwaves among the divine, the shattering their long-held illusions of their superiority and immortality was a rude awakening that brought into question their divine right to reign eternal, forever unchallenged, and unopposed. &gt; &gt;Fear and insecurity took root in their hearts in realizing their own vulnerability. Only by kindling their already bottomless scorn and rousing their already consuming hatred for Humanity could they hope to conceal their insecurities brought to light by the defilement of their sacred immortality. Alas, gods could not simply destroy Humanity with a snap of their fingers. Humans being from another world had a strange synergy with the world that made them immune to their divine retribution. Their immunity to the direct influence of the divine had been the first seed of their hatred for Humanity and the reason for their enslavement. Regardless of gods tenacity and frustration, the waters of the oceans could not be stirred to rise in unnatural tsunamis to wipe out Human cities and the clouds above them would rain down no fire nor acid nor disease. The world around Humans would only obey the strict order of nature. Unable to smite them, gods began carving titanic leviathans out of mountains and raised hordes of cruel creatures from the dark pits of the nether-realms and sent them North to do their bidding that was to bring an end to the great heresy that was Humanity. Only through death and extinction, could mankind atone for their defiance. &gt; &gt;A century passed and decades of war against the gods took its toll. Mankind was left teetering at the precipice of extinction as resources were running low and their continental heartlands struggled to fight off the hordes swarming from the South through corridors that had been carved through the difficult terrain over the years by the leviathans. Much of the North had already been overrun and what land was not lost, was in many places left tainted with the corrupting blood of the nether-beings that made the land barren around them when they were slain. Over the years, most people on the continent had migrated to the capital isles further North or gone the new world beyond the ocean. Much of the continent had been abandoned, leaving great cities to rot in the wind as hordes of monsters passed on their way to North. Only towns and cities by the Northern coast still continued to live on in the hopes that the hordes could be stopped by Imperial Arcoliers left defending the frontier. &gt; &gt;If it wasnt for the Capital isles reliance for food from the fertile lands of the continental provinces, the continent could have been abandoned long ago and the hordes fought off at sea, but as long as the colonies in the new world were unable to provide for the capital isles, a large part of the population was in danger of facing starvation which would have been the eventual result of over-reliance on fishing. Overfishing was already leaving some areas entirely barren. &gt; &gt;Page BreakAurora borealis danced in the sky above a wintry forest as a convoy of soldiers and wagons pulled by reindeers marched along a path under its snowy canopy of pines and spruces. Snow softly crunched under their feet and wagon wheels whinged amidst the silence of the forest. &gt; &gt;Far in the distance, above the treeline a gigantic dark creature loomed in the horizon. Its eyes glowed as it slowly lumbered forward. Blue lights arching in the skies occasionally fell upon its hide engulfing it in blue explosions. A series of explosions flashed brightly in quick succession, causing the giant to recoil in pain. The air vibrated as the thunder of the explosions reached the convoy like a rolling thunder. Loose snow came falling off trees when the ominous, deep bellowing of the giant soon followed, rumbling like an earthquake. &gt; &gt;The 3rd company of Imperial Arcoliers has been on the march for two days after they were ordered to abandon their outpost at the frontier and reposition closer to the coast up North. The march had been perilous, leaving many of them wounded and dead from several encounters with the enemy on the way. The enemy had become more active than usual, with Leviathans appearing in the distant much more often and with enemies traversing far over the wilderness and going deep behind the frontier, there they would harass supply trains coming from the main defensive line and attack villages in the countryside. &gt; &gt;Some of the wagons were full of frozen bodies of the dead covered under white cloths, while others carried supplies and wounded, who were shivering as they struggled to stay warm even under thick pelts of fur. &gt; &gt;Two weeks ago, after fending off a particularly powerful attack on their outpost, a messenger had arrived bringing new orders from the high command. They had been garrisoning an old keep guarding a mountain pass out in the wilderness for over a year, but with the new orders, the long days in the wilderness were finally brought an end. With the new orders, they were to march to Blackhearth; a large city built on islands and islets in a river delta that flows into the Northern sea. Upstream the many rivers of the delta fused into the great river of Vesine which lead far inland, carving deep into the continent. Having suffered serious casualties recently, the new orders were received with a sense of sombre elation by the soldiers. &gt; &gt;Someone behind Hadwin was talking of the city, saying how they'd go to the first inn they saw and order the largest plate of the greasiest mutton chops and the strongest ale on the menu and indulge on the many pleasures offered by the great city. Hadwin could not quite yet share their excitement as he had not yet been out in the frontier long enough to have become so weary of it. It had only been a few weeks since he had been deployed. Thoughts of the city brought him no comfort as he struggled to stay warm despite the fur cloak on his shoulders and thick winter clothes under a loose overcoat. Arcoliers grey overcoat was like an odd mix of a loose mages robe and a military long coat. It was made of thin cloth and designed to be worn over the actual clothes and armour in both winter and summer time, making it a very saggy piece of clothing that seemed to catch even the slightest gust of wind. Hadwins overcoat fluttered in the wind that blew snow into his eyes from the top of a wagon moving in front of him. He saw a man on the wagon smoking a pipe and looking at him, while leaning on to a large gun on a tripod. &gt; &gt;The glow of embers from his pipe revealed a dirty, scarred face. He pointed the pipe at Hadwin. Puffs of smoke erupted from his mouth and nostrils as he spoke with a noticeable accent. Hey, kid. Yer one o the new guys, arent ya? Whats yer name, boy? &gt; &gt;Hadwin Iscariot. &gt; &gt;Hmm... Hadwin. the soldier mused. From the isles arentcha? &gt; &gt;Yeah. Halitona. Hadwin confirmed. &gt; &gt;Im Akitona, but you can call me Corporal Akitona he said with a smirk and tapped a rank insignia on the prominent gorget sticking out between the fur of his winter cloak. He glanced down at Hadwins armour. &gt; &gt;Ya better check yer straps. Seems a bit loose. he said pointing at Hadwins gorget. &gt; &gt;He remembered the instructors in the boot camp always reminding them double check it before heading out into field. Sometimes theyd have to stand in a formation as sergeants went through their armours making sure everything was secure. If someone had even one loose armour strap, the whole company had to strip their equipment and put them back on. Theyd keep doing it until they all got it right. &gt; &gt;Their gorget and chest plate were instrumental in protecting arcoliers from being disembowelled and having their throats slit in battle. &gt; &gt;Akitona was grinning slyly as Hadwin was checking the straps. Hadwin heard someone walk up to him from behind and put their hand on his shoulder. A short and stocky dark man walked next to him. &gt; &gt;Hes just screwin with you, boy. Shouldnt you be busy fondling your balls, Akitona. The man gestured at the heavy repeater Akitona was leaning against. &gt; &gt;Akitona cackled. Onri, mate. Ill have all night for that when we get to Valga. he said, rubbing a crystal ball the size of his palm encased in a brass frame embedded into the wooden body of the gun. &gt; &gt;Whats Valga? Hadwin asked &gt; &gt;A village down the road. Onri answered. Hey, I dont think weve talked before. Im Onri the catering specialist. Good to meet you. &gt; &gt;Akitona scoffed Yer a cook mate. A feckin catering specialist he said shaking his head and drew smoke from his pipe. Do they come up with those titles to make ya feel better when you stir the feckin pot while others are fightin. &gt; &gt;Hey, I have my battles same as you. I cut onions all day, see. Onri took an onion out of his pocket and tossed it at Akitona Feckin onions. Akitona chuckled and threw it back. Dont ya have anythin nice to throw at me for a change. &gt; &gt;Aint nothing for a sleazy bastard like you, Akitona. Aint nothing for anybody but roots and turnips and those feckin onions. Look my hands, mate. Omri took off his mittens and showed his hands full of cuts. It hurts to handle them with my hands like this. These hands werent made for precision. Theyre made for skewering creeps and smashing heads or for caressing a lass. Doesnt have to be a pretty one. Im not picky these days. &gt; &gt;Onri and Akitona laughed. &gt; &gt;Maybe ya oughtta learn yer way with the knife. Youve been a cook for a while now aventcha. &gt; &gt;Suddenly the column came to a sudden halt and somebody yelled. &gt; &gt;CREEPS INCOMING! TO THE RIGHT! &gt; &gt;Akitona swivelled the heavy repeater around towards the forest where humanoid figures emerged from the shadows. His eyes began to glow blue after he placed his hand on a crystal on the side of the gun. The wagon shuddered when the gun fired, rapidly unleashing a hail of lead into the tree lines with glowing blue trails in the wake. Blue muzzle flashes illuminated the forest along the road as the convoy opened fire. Creeps were tall, slender and dark creatures that almost seemed like an elongated shadow of a person come to life. They ran with an odd gait due to their bizarrely long limbs that also made it easy for them to charge through the deep snow of the forest floor. Sparks flew and dark blood splattered when bullets struck metallic scales on their hides. Hadwin saw the gaze of one them affix upon him when their eyes met. Its eyes were glowing white, both cold and dead. It charged at Hadwin screeching and snapping at him with a maw filled with rows of protruding, razor sharp teeth. Hadwin struggled to aim with his trembling hands. He felt the warmth of mana on his fingertip and was briefly blinded by the muzzle flash. When the smoke cleared and his eyes readjusted, the creep was still running at him. While others around it fell as blue trails struck them down, the few shots directed at it only seemed to glance or miss entirely. Hadwin panicked, fumbling with his arconette to load the next round but the wheel-lock of was stuck, leaving him pulling and rattling it while the beast drew dangerously close. Other soldiers around him were oblivious of the creep closing in while they were engaged with other targets. Finally, he managed to pull the wheel-lock all the way back and saw a crystal had shattered in the magazine jamming the gun. He tried to clear the jam but the creep was already upon him about to strike. It managed to slash at him with its long blade-like claws on the fingertips just before someones mace caught it mid-air, causing its face crumble and cave in. It fell next to Hadwin gargling blood. A dark pool formed in the snow around it. Onri walked over to it and smashed its head once with a mace, making sure it was dead before turning to look at Hadwin who was staring in shock. &gt; &gt;Hey, kid. You okay? &gt; &gt;Hadwin gasped when he remembered feeling the claws of the monster on his chest. He felt a gash on the steel of his gorget. His overcoat was slashed revealing the chest plate underneath which also had a noticeable gash on it. His cloaks bind was cut off as well, but there was no blood. Looking at the monsters hand on the ground next to Onris foot and seeing the sheer size of the blades on its fingers, he could not help but feel lucky. &gt; &gt;Akitonas heavy repeater soon silenced and the fighting was over. Soldiers walked up to monsters left writhing on the ground, putting them out of their misery, stabbing them with bayonets and shooting them. &gt; &gt;Hadwin was startled when a single shot rang out right next to him. Akitona was eyeing at the forest, squinting behind his heavy repeater and then shot again, but this time with a short burst. A screech echoed among the trees. Yeah, thats what I thought. No running back, creep. He said, pulling a handle on his gun that clicked and made satisfying metallic clack when he brought the lever all the way back. He looked at Hadwin and tutted. Did they almost get ya already? &gt; &gt;Come on now. Get up. Youre fine. Onri grabbed Hadwin, pulled him up and held him by the shoulders looking at the damage on his equipment Keep your wits about you, kid. You might get fortunate every now and then out here, but if you run out luck once, itll be over. So dont count on it. Onri pointed at the mace on Hadwins belt. Next time use your own or use the bayonet. he says and walks away, wiping blood off his mace with snow. &gt; &gt;Hadwin stood by the dead creature as the convoy started moving again. Its shattered teeth protruded in its face that was sickeningly disfigured as its skull had caved in. Its eyes still seemed to glow. A soldier walked up to Hadwin and pointed at the corpse. &gt; &gt;Hey, help me move it. We need to get it out of the way. He gestured at a wagon coming up on the road. &gt; &gt;They tossed the carcass by the side of the road and Hadwin jogged back to Akitona who was already smoking his pipe and leaning against the heavy repeater like nothing happened. &gt; &gt;A man stood by the road watching as the column moved past him. He saw Hadwin and Akitona approach. Captains insignia glinted on his gorget and on his torso hung various pouches and scrolls, including a few webbed pouches with crystal balls within hanging on his chest &gt; &gt;Hadwin was about to salute Captain Valos but the captain waved at him to stop. &gt; &gt;Theres no time, nor need for formalities out here, Iscariot. Just do your duty. He said and walked over to Akitona. &gt; &gt;Corporal Akitona! He called and started walking behind the wagon next to Hadwin. &gt; &gt;Yes, captain. Akitona greeted with a lazy salute-like gesture. &gt; &gt;Valos glanced at the gashes on Hadwins armour. Looks like you got your first big scare already, Arcolier Iscariot. &gt; &gt;Yes, sir. I did. Hadwin said nervously. &gt; &gt;Valos smiled and turned back to Akitona. Corporal. Here. Take this. he produced a scroll from under his cloak, extending it to Akitona who grabbed it and unrolled it. &gt; &gt;Akitona carefully studied the scroll with a map on it. &gt; &gt;Aye Aye So, there are creeps in the village. &gt; &gt;Indeed, and quite a few of them, but only one lich. Keep an eye out for it. &gt; &gt;Aye, sir. Will do. Can I take the newbie with me? Ill need help moving this thing. He tapped the heavy repeater. &gt; &gt;No. Take someone else. Arcoliers Iscariot and Lemas will be coming with me. &gt; &gt; Aye. then Ill take Arcolier Torgen with me. He raised his voice when saying the name as if to ensure it is heard. &gt; &gt;A hoarse voice answered behind Akitona. &gt; &gt;Ill be sucking ale out of a Valkyries teat by the time you get there. the voice said. &gt; &gt;Akitona laughed and walked to the back of the wagon and helped someone up from under a thick pelt. There was a wounded man lying in the wagon among boxes of ammo. Blackened veins criss-crossed under the skin of his face and neck. &gt; &gt;By the Ikko, Torgen. Yer a hardy bastard. I thought ya ought to be dead by now. Akitona said feigning surprise and helped the man to sit up against the back of the wagon. &gt; &gt;Torgen grimaced as he was about to speak. My soul had almost left for the stars. &gt; &gt;Akitona chuckled and produced a small metallic flask from under his cloak extending it to Torgen after taking a mouthful from it himself. &gt; &gt;Have some spirit before you become one. &gt; &gt;The man emptied the flask in one go and coughed, cursing as black tar-like blood spilled from his mouth. &gt; &gt;How are you, Arcolier Torgen? I hope you arent really planning on leaving us just yet. We are almost at the village. Theres ought to be antidote there. Captain Valos assured. &gt; &gt;Im swell, but with all due respect captain, if the Valkyries come for me, Ill not refuse their warm bosoms. &gt; &gt;Theyll not send Valkyries down to get a dirty ol bone like ya. Therell be nought but a rope unfurled from the stars and old gods yelling atcha Climb yerself up, ya filthy fuck!  Akitona quipped. &gt; &gt;The captain smiled. When you get there, give the old gods my regards, Arcolier. &gt; &gt;Aye. Will do. Give the new ones mine. Shove my rifle up one's arse. &gt; &gt;Ill let them have it sideways. he said. &gt; &gt;What? Torgen managed to utter before he went into a coughing fit. The coughing subsided and turned into a hoarse laughter. Oh sideways. Torgen said smiling, with a bloody mouth Thats better, yes. &gt; &gt;Hadwin was still shaken but he couldnt help but smile listening at the exchange. &gt; &gt;A few hours later when the convoy came to a halt, Akitona was unloading the heavy repeater wagon and saw Torgen lying in the wagon looking up in the sky with glassy eyes and a smile on his face. &gt; &gt;Akitona walked over to him and crouched besides him, smiling bitterly as he closed Torgens eyes and whispered. &gt; &gt;May the stars guide you, brother. &gt; &gt;Captain was briefing men gathered around him at the vanguard of the convoy. A few kilometres down the road where the surrounding woods would end, the Northern lowlands which were the agricultural centre of the empire, would begin. Thered be an intersection with one road leading North towards the farmlands and ultimately to Blackhearth, while the smaller path to the West would take them to the village of Valga. The village was not far from the road making it an ideal place to stop and rest for the night, but theyd have to clear it first. While the captain was speaking, their scouts returned from the village reporting it had been set ablaze. There had been fighting in the village, even though it should have been evacuated by now. &gt; &gt;Captain quickly made markings on a map and explained something to a lieutenant by his side, who quietly nodded and left captains side gesturing at some of the sergeants to follow him. Valga was the only village within miles and if they wanted to avoid sleeping out in the cold, theyd have to assault the village before it was burned entirely. When they reached the village and saw it burning, it was a small consolation to see that the village was located right next to a mana swamp which would at least be a warm, if not damp, alternative if there was nothing of the village left when they got there. Mana swamps radiated with warmth that melted snow around them even in the coldest winter nights, but they had their downsides: they were always damp and while they seemed beautiful and serene even with all their light and warmth, they could also be extremely precarious. Not only was the stagnant and warm water rife with disease, but it was also often haunted by malevolent spirits known as Marras that would drag a careless passer-by into deep waters should they wander too close to a chasm where the spirits reside. The chasms are dark spots in the swamp where ethereal humanoid shapes are sometimes seen fading in and out sight against the glow of the swamp. &gt; &gt;A handful of Arcoliers stayed behind to guard the wagons while the 1st platoon lead by Captain Valos and 2nd platoon lead by lieutenant Gaspartus moved out, taking positions around the village. The 2nd platoon took positions at the tree line right at the edge of the swamp where Corporal Akitona set up his heavy repeater on high ground on top of a tall rock outcrop protruding from the snow towards the village right at the very edge of the swamp. &gt; &gt;Hadwin felt his grip tighten around his gun when the 1st platoon started advancing along the road, crouching and running behind the snowbanks along the road that concealed their approached. Meanwhile 2nd platoon moved into their positions among the trees behind the glow of the swamp. It was dark and quiet save for the eerie noises from the village carried by the wind. They took positions along the road in snowbanks facing the village and waited quietly. They watched the village and saw silhouettes running among the Hadwin tried to calm his nerves while his heart was pounding, but his thoughts kept drifting. Drops of cold sweat formed on his temples and his breathing grew heavy. Captain Valos next to him noticed his trembling rifle. &gt; &gt;Arcolier Iscariot. He called. Dont think of what is before, just see it is there and focus on whatever it is you must do. Whatever it is, do it without hesitation. Never hesitate. When the time comes, dont focus on the enemy, focus on the shot. And keep your wits about you. just as the captain finished the sentence, a horn blared in the woods beyond the swamp and a rattle of gunfire and blue flashes erupted in the treeline. Streaks of light whipped at the village, snapping and sending splinters flying as they struck wooden walls of the burning houses. Wood cracked and burning beams fell amidst the flames and dark silhouettes of monsters began to swarm out of the village. Some of them ran right into the swamp where streaks of light perforated them while they were waist deep in its water. Their blood, like ink, coloured the water black. &gt; &gt;Suddenly several large ice shards flew into the woods from the village. Tree trunks shattered and cracked loudly as they fell from the impact. The heavy repeater directed its fire at the source of the spells among the houses. Clouds of burning embers and smoke erupted as its bursts tore through the buildings and the hail of ice shards soon stopped. &gt; &gt;1st platoon watched as a lone creature came running out of the village and started wading across a snowy field towards the road to go around the swamp. It was shorter and paler than a Creep. &gt; &gt;Not far behind it, a group of several dozen more ran out of the village following it into the snow. They waited until the creatures were all out in the open and then Captain Valos leading shot rang. The head of the one ahead of the group exploded in a bloody mist. A spray of blood erupted from its neck and it disappeared into the snow. Hadwin felt the mana release from his index finger and his arconette fired. A fusillade of gunfire erupted from the snowbanks along the road as the 1st platoon opened fire. A trail of blue left the bore of Hadwins arconette and struck an enemy in the leg, almost severing it. It writhed in the snow and screeched in pain until another shot struck its chest. Hadwins aim wasnt quite there, but he managed to keep a steady pace until his arconette clicked. Hadwin reloaded a new magazine and watched the last of the creatures drop dead on the ground as a volley of shot tore through it. Captain blew a signal horn when no more creeps came out of the village. A horn in the woods blared in response and 2nd platoon ceased their fire. Captain Valos motioned for them to move out and lead them into the village. Bestial roars were cut short by cracks of gun fire among the burning buildings as the men combed through the village. &gt; &gt;There was a large wooden building with a neat cobblestone foundation at the centre of the village. Its large main entrance had not completely torn apart by something and there was at least several peoples worth of frozen gore littered on the ground. Eerie noises echoed from the dark interior of the building. &gt; &gt;Captain Valos ordered two sections to split up from the rest and circle around the sides tp continue sweeping the village while the rest took positions behind porches and corners of the houses and fallen carts and various debris around the building while they listened intently. They listened for the noises coming out of the building for a short while. Bestial grunts and groans echoed from within it. Captain motioned for everyone to stay put and ran up to the house. He leaned by the door and peeked in, scanning the interior before he went in with his gun raised. Inside he saw a small lobby where the shattered remains of the main doors were strewn across the floor amidst icy debris and rubble. A large portrait painting covered in frost hung on the wall opposite to the main door and to each side of the lobby there was a doorway that seemed to lead to a corridor. When Valos walked towards the door on the right the noises grew louder, echoing from a room at the end of corridor where an icy window glowed orange with flames. &gt; &gt;He snuck through the corridor, peeking through doorways as he approached the last door. When he reached the door and carefully peeked into the room. He saw the back of a large monster sitting in what looked like a huge pool of red blood and gore. It was groaning as it masticated on flesh, throwing half-consumed bodies around the room. Captain looked behind him to check the corridor, before he took a crystal orb out of a pouch on his chest. He peeked into the room again, making sure there was nothing else there, before he stepped out and stood at the doorway. Gently he tossed a crystal ball in the air where it stayed afloat beside him. Valos eyes started burning blue with mana and the crystals glow grew increasingly brighter until it burst into a flame. With a swift motion of his hand, he sent the orb flying at the monster. Its scream was deafening when the orb struck its shoulder and exploded nearly severing its arm. The monster was immolated in flames and howling in pain, when felt something move in a room behind him. &gt; &gt;Outside, while Hadwin was waiting, he saw Lemus to his right fidgeting behind a porch, trying to get a good shot at the building from behind the fence of the porch. Lemus saw Hadwin looking at him and smiled nervously, giving Hadwin a thumbs up. Hadwin didnt really know Lemus aside from a few talks he had in passing with him. It bothered sometimes how young Lemus looked. He had just turned 18 right at the end of the training right before he joined the company with Hadwin. &gt; &gt;Suddenly, Captain Valos emerged running out of the building with something roaring after him. A hulking monstrosity crashed through the doorway, bringing down the frames of the main entrance. Its skin was dark grey save for its charred shoulder. On its face it had a wide mouth with thick rows of needle like teeth that protruded well beyond its thin lips. Its relatively small glowing red eyes were surrounded by black tear-shaped black shapes that started from the eye sockets and went over its head. &gt; &gt;Its arm was nearly torn off from the shoulder, just barely attached by a thin strip of black flesh from a gruesome wound that spilled blood everywhere. It let out a blood-curdling roar before charging at them while all but ignoring its almost severed arm. &gt; &gt;Hadwin felt an almost overwhelming sense of dread taking over as he watched the huge monster charge furiously even after sustaining a wound like that. He was about to panic and run off when he looked at Captain Valos and saw him standing defiantly out in the open between him and Lemas, who was cowering behind the porch. Despite the fact that his mind was screaming for him to run, Hadwin stood out and took aim at the monster with the captain and opened fire with the others. Furious gunfire tore the monsters flesh. &gt; &gt;Several shots struck its belly and tore it open. causing it to slip on its own guts. It still got up and kept running even when its organs were spilling out. It only stopped when a concentrated volley of shots struck it in the upper chest and head. &gt; &gt;The monster fell dead on the ground spilling its brains right before the captains feet. The other newbie, Arcolier Lemas by the porch was staring the dead monster with a look of horror on his face. Shaking and his lips quivering, he looked up with teary eyes and saw him standing before the monster and glancing at him just before a second monster came roaring out of the building &gt; &gt;Seeing Hadwin standing by Captains side gave him the little encouragement he needed to muster the courage to stand up and bring level his rifle at the monster. The very air vibrated with the monsters ear-rending roar and then a volley of fire struck it. Shockwaves of bullets rippled on its skin as they tore gaping holes, revealing the black flesh underneath, but it didnt slow down. Captain Valos crouched on the ground and carefully aimed with his gun. His eyes briefly glowed blue with mana and when he fired the gun, a brief, but bright beam of light erupted from its bore and struck the monster in the chest. A spray of blood and white sparks exploded from its back, leaving behind a big hole on its chest, stopping the monster dead in its tracks. It groaned weakly as blood poured out of the wound. Several more shots struck the monster, and it was about to fall, but managed gather enough strength to send a small wooden cart flying across the air with great force. It missed flying right past the captain and crashing at the porch in front of Lemus. &gt; &gt;The monster fell with a thud and a dark pool of blood formed on the snowy ground around the monster and Hadwin sighed with relief. &gt; &gt;There was a moment of silence, that was broken when one of the arcoliers suddenly yelled, pointing at something. &gt; &gt;MEDIC! &gt; &gt;One of the Arcoliers screamed running to Lemas who was trashing on the ground. Hadwin followed him but froze when saw Lemas. &gt; &gt;The cart slung by the monster had sent a sharp piece of wood flying when it crashed in front of Lemas, driving it into his throat through a gap in the gorget. He was squirming on the ground kicking dirt while others struggled to hold him still. Captain Valos tried to have a look at the wound but the armour was in the way. Blood splattered on the ground with each heartbeat. &gt; &gt;Get the medic, now! He went around the house with the others. Make sure he finds us! The Captain ordered one of the Arcoliers. &gt; &gt;The world seemed to come to a standstill. Voices and sounds around him seemed to become distant until they all but disappeared as Hadwin stared at Lemas who was gasping and drowning in his own blood. Suddenly a hand jerked at Hadwin and pulled down. Captain Valos was looking at him and saying something. &gt; &gt;Did you hear me?! Put your hand on the wound! Captain guided Hadwins hand on to a bloody rag on Lemas neck and told him to hold it tight. Hands slippery with blood, Captain Valos struggled to open the leather straps of Lemas chest plate. Hadwin felt Lemas grab his arm tightly and looked at him with blood spilling from his mouth. &gt; &gt;Moments passed and someone with the golden emblem of Surgeon Mage Order and an insignia of an Adept healer came running to them just as Captain Valos managed to get the chest plate off. &gt; &gt;The medic briefly inspected the wound, before drawing out a knife and cutting Lemas shirt open. The medic produced a vial from a pouch and poured its contents on the bare chest. On my mark, pull it out. the medic ordered. &gt; &gt;W-wait, what? Hadwin barely managed to utter anything in response before the medic was already casting some kind of spell. The medics eyes and hands started glowing and pulsing with white light that spread into the liquid on the chest and lead up to Lemas neck. The medic seemed to fall into a trance of some kind until the light faded. PULL! &gt; &gt;Hadwin jerked out the piece of wood in Lemas neck and blood came spilling while the medic started casting the magic again. It seemed for a moment like the wound on Lemas neck was closing, then the medic stopped, taking deep breaths before starting again. Hadwin felt Lemas grip on his arm weaken and his gaze drifted into eternity. The medic stopped and got up shaking his head. Captain Valos grabbed a name tag from Lemas neck and walked away cursing. &gt; &gt;Hadwin was left confused looking at Lemas. It was like something was missing; like there should be something more. One moment Lemas was looking at him and then he wasnt there anymore. It felt like there needed to be something more to this, but there wasnt; no words, no nothing. Captains voice boomed when he began barking orders and they moved on to clear the rest of the village."

I want to see that first griffon pass overhead, want it so badly, the relief that comes from seeing that everything is business-as-usual and that said business hasn't noticed you. The dragonmy dragon, I suppose, though I'm less sure about that come every passing moment with hernotices my worry and agitation, whether because she can read my body language or because I'm sending emotion as well as thought and just don't know it. Maybe one, maybe the other, maybe both, there's just so much I don't know. That makes two of us, I suppose, watching her crane her donkey-disguised neck to look around, to take in the world-above for the first time. All that knowledge distilled into her egg and how much of it is any good now, two thousand years and untold destruction on down time's road? ""I know you're curious,"" I whisper, knowing I probably shouldn't, just thinking it at her is enough, but still feels so unnatural. ""But scav-donkies don't look around that much in familiar territory, and that's what we want them to think we're in. Nothing unusual, nothing to be concerned with."" *There is no 'they' to be concerned right now, and this has you concerned in turn,* she says, not looking at me, not that I'd want her to, those illusory eyes both aren't quite right and aren't in the right places. Right place for a scav-donkey, sure, the disguise isn't nearly *that* bad, but wrong place for a dragon, and it's impossible for me to forget that's what she is. I open my mouth to reply, then shut it. If I want her to exercise caution, maybe even paranoia, I'm going to have to be the example, what other has she got? *What other has she got?* She's looking at me again; even under the just-that-off hard light disguise I can tell her real eyes are looking at me, all white fire set in diamond sea, I don't have to see them to know. I concentrate on sending back rather than speaking, kind of ridiculous considering how many times I've already done it by accident. *We need to be very careful, and if I want you to be careful I should be careful too. Set an example.* She looks away from me. *Yes, be careful to look the way a scav-donkey-creature looks, both appearance-wise and head/eye movement. Must not have apparent conversation with Operator.* I make a sudden decision. Something about the way she says Operator rubs me the wrong way, drudges something peripheral out of my head. Fire. Gods. Choice-of-targets. A tall elf in armor, an arrogant sneering mask of a helmet, pointing his sword at a human baby and... ""My name is Kella,"" I say simply. Then I realize, and sigh, and shake my head. *Sorry. This way of speaking is difficult for me, but I know that is not enough excuse.* A ruined fueling-station passes slowly by on our left while I walk and she does her best to move with less-than-customary grace, like a scav-donkey, and considers what I've said. I think. *Operator Kella does not need to justify course-of-action to DRAGON unit. Unit interface/uncertain AI provided for information/quick execution/tactical options.* It takes me a moment to parse that, and a moment more to realize there's one bit I can't. *Okay, not speaking aloud this time. What is AI? I know those two ancient letters, but I don't know their meaning put together like that.* She bobs her head, just slightly, then noses at the ground, pushing a soot-streaked rag forward before tossing it aside. *AI is Artificial Intelligence, Empire researchers unsure of true existence, DRAGON unit responds? thinks? maybe? maybe. No time for complete tests shortcuts taken.* ""Ummm..."" I say. I figure it doesn't count as talking, not like anyone listening in can glean anything from that. Kind of thing people say to themselves all the time, right? Even when walking down the street? I'm thinking so much about not looking suspicious that we probably look suspicious and we haven't seen anyone since we left that ruined basement since this isn't a very populated part of the city ruins and I'm avoiding really thinking about what she said, aren't I? *Why would Kella need to avoid thinking about DRAGON unit communications?* I freeze, stopping dead on the shattered-moldering remains of what was once smooth paving on the side of the street. I feel absurd about it, too, why should she have such an effect on me? Why isn't this a simple thing, a joyous thing even, I'm walking beside perhaps the greatest potential victory humanity has even been able to hope for in more than two thousand years, and she's not giving me any trouble, she's been perfectly cooperative. Charming even, in her way. I concentrate on keeping my thoughts inward, feeling vaguely guilty about it even though mental privacy is something I've taken for granted my whole life, and why shouldn't I? It must be working, because I can feel her question even though it doesn't have any words, just a sort of open query strung in the air between us. No impatience there, no discomfort, at least from her, but then does she even have any feelings that aren't just projections from me? She's a weapon, right? I catch the image as it comes center-stage in my mind, pull the curtains tight so she won't get a glimpse. *Small dwarven child clutching a doll eyes wide looking up, up, where are her parents what are those ashes* Enough. I should answer, anyway. *I've never really considered the idea that you would be as...as alive as you seem.* I let the thought trickle through careful shaping as it flows toward her. Just a moment of something like surprise, if she's capable of that. Which is part and parcel of the whole question, the whole thing, I suppose. And then *DRAGON unit is not alive, uncomfirmed/unanswered research/development questions do not constitute* And then a sudden stop. She spots them before I do, not a patrol, just a group of young dwarves. Low-caste, by their shaved-side heads and short simple beards. Much worse than a patrol. Maybe. She shudders. I think. Maybe she actually does move under her disguise, but I experience it as a mental thing, the kind of shudder that narrows in to a fine quiver rather than shaking out of control. Like a homing knife. *Possible targets course of action rules of engagement all requested timeframe narrow* it's all a rush in my head, just a fraction of a section to understand before the final prod *readiness is nice but right now has the necessity* and I make the decision, not really understanding it, part of me wanting to take it back. *Hold. Wait and see.* She turns to look at me again, her false-donkey eyes mild, the real ones intense beneath the obfuscating cloak if only in my mind. *They are drawing weapons. Now is time for maximum range-plus-surprise, melee is difficult not for DRAGON unit but for Kella, operator is unarmed, operator is unarmored, possible to defeat all but no full surety of operator uninjured end-of-fight.* She's right, probably, even a miraculous thing like her can't guarantee none of them will get a good hit in on me if this comes to a brawl, and they do have their weapons out but they're all young males, they do that, want to feel powerful, and I don't know them and don't want to kill them just for being in my way. Because I've seen plenty of humans killed for just that, being in the way, and I want to be better than the people who did it. I don't know how much of that she catches. It feels like she's absorbing it. She doesn't respond, not right away, but one of the dwarves speaks, the leader maybe. ""Hey! Human!"" It's a good sign, the ""human"" instead of ""vermin"" or ""Touchless"" or a hundred other slurs. I stop, pat my ""beast,"" and give the dwarf the bent-neck bow he's almost certainly expecting. ""Sir?"" I say simply. They come near, still holding their weapons, but not really brandishing them, just holding ready. Not meant for me, I don't think. Which is good, because the closest two are almost within swinging distance for their battle-axes. The same dwarf speaks again, from back behind that front pair. ""You scav this area a lot?"" The question takes me back a little, mostly because there's no hostility in it. Not that this never happens, it does actually, all the time. We hold a low low place in the great scheme of things, but the fey don't all just hate us for no reason. Plenty of interactions are more or less neutral, even somewhat friendly. Pleasant, even. Well, almost. No matter how cordial they are, that awareness of the background, that sense that they can demand anything of you right up to your life and there's not much you can do, that colors everything, drains some of the joy even from small kindness. They're looking at me expectantly. They don't seem annoyed. Maybe I look thoughtful, like I'm considering their question at length. I rub my chin, and nod. ""Been through a few times."" Which is true enough, I scouted this area out carefully during my years of search for the egg. The young dwarf leader smiles. ""Good! Maybe you can help us. We're looking for a source of skysteel, we've heard rumors there's an old half-buried wrecking yard nearby."" They heard right, I know the place, picked-over at the peripheries but still containing some good finds under the collapsed fiberstone skyway that's fallen on it. Skysteel's popular with human rebel groups, or was back when there *were*any serious human rebel groups not made up of a few ragtag teenagers with romantic visions and poor life expectancies. It's taken from the engines of old human flying machines; having been bathed in strange energies, it's extremely resistant to magic. What these young dwarves want it for is anyone's guess. Weapons and armor, most likely. Maybe they're even more disaffected from their society than I'd expect for the low-caste. Skysteel *anything* is going to be seen as a grave affront to the Runemasters who stand at the top of every Dwarven nation...but weapons and armor made with the stuff can make you a nightmare to anyone relying on magic to fight. It'll also suppress the natural magic of any fey who wore it, but low-caste also usually means low-Touch, so maybe not a serious problem for this group. Anyway. Not really any of my business and no skin off my back. Except it's nice to remember that humans aren't the only potential rebels around, that ours aren't the only necks the fey aristocracy have their boots on. I smile. I'm surprised to realize it's utterly genuine. ""Sure! I know the place you're talking about. It's just down the road the way you're already going, turn right at the corner with the ruined temple, continue until you see the snapped-off light pole with the intact ampoule still glowing a bit. Then take your next left and you'll see it a little ways down as you round the curve. All the good stuff is under a collapsed skyway, you're gonna have to do some digging through fiberstone."" He smiles back, and I'm just as surprised to realize it seems genuine as well. ""Thank you, human. Here,"" he says, and tosses me a small silver coin. I catch it, about to bow again, then realize he's throwing something else as well, something spherical and red. I manage to catch it as well, using both hands and dropping the coin. It's a largish stoneapple. ""For your scav-donkey,"" the young dwarf says, and I laugh despite myself. ""I'm sure she'll appreciate it,"" I say, and sense a surge of amusement from my false-donkey. ""Thanks, and good luck in your digging."" I realize that his little entourage is scanning the skies, weapons still in hand. ""And in avoiding the sky-bastards."" I shouldn't have dared say it, but it's out, and it still seems like the right thing to say. Right-thing, shouldn't-thing, I'm not quite clear on how the two intersect. And maybe it is the right thing, because they laugh, and one even gives me a sort of half-salute as he walks past. Another pats my not-donkey on the rump, and I suppress a wince, but he doesn't notice anything, so we keep walking. Half a block down I have to stop and sit. I'm shaking. I'm shaking all over. *Operator distress* I look up at my false-donkey, and she nuzzles gently against the side of my face. It really does feel real, the fine hairs along her projected snout, the subtle warmth. ""I'm okay,"" I whisper, even though I know that's not true. Okay enough, maybe. I'll be able to stand up and go on in just a few minutes. ""I just...that was nerve-wracking. I wasn't sure I made the right decision."" *Pointing enemy unit toward possible resource-source? Not understood. Violence averted during possible vulnerability, tactical reasoning, yes-understood.* ""I don't think they're our enemy,"" I say, still keeping my voice low. Dwarves have good hearing, and the ruins are quiet in the mid-morning sun. *Fey carrying weapons asking about resource-source? Not understood.* ""Things have gotten complicated since the end of the war,"" I say, not knowing if that's really true. Were they always complicated? The old stories don't sound like they were. Maybe it's hard to see the jagged little edges from a great distance through time. *Complicated how-complicated?* I sigh, steadying my limbs, breathing deep, sigh again, hoping she won't take it as a sign of frustration but then why would she? That's not the way she hears, not how she communicates. I glance around, keep my mouth shut this time. *There are lots of different groups and sub-groups and clans and tribes and kingdoms. Most of them still treat us like the dirt under their boots, but they're shitty to plenty of their own as well. And not all fey hate us. We cant just...go burning them all, all the time. Even if we could...we shouldn't.* There's a small shimmer in the air as she moves to sit beside me. It's comical, almost, knowing what's under that scav-donkey disguise, seeing her plop down on her hindquarters, even though I've seen actual scav-donkeys do just that a thousand times. Maybe she pulled the detail from my head. Must have done. *Shouldn't why?* She sends. I shrug, suddenly uncomfortable. I don't want to say it, not to her, because I know what she'll be used for, what she *must* be used for, which is something I don't regret because I'm not going to leave my whole race ground down in the dirt but I'm starting to sense, really *understand* what that's going to cost. And not just me, her too, and do I have that right? *DRAGON unit understands purpose, does not regret it. War is sharp in memory. Current situation taking shape in world-model. Now has the necessity, not always comfortable, always there.* I laugh, and it's a good sound, even if there's not much humor in it, some tension flowing out. *I guess you're right. I know you're right. It will just be a good deal messier than I guess I dared contemplate. Okay. Come on, let's get going back to the camp. There are people we need you to meet.* &amp;#x200B; &lt;continued soon, come on by [r/Magleby](URL for plenty more stories in the meantime&gt;"

I Know That You,43,co45y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/co45y7/world_of_karik_chapters_45_i_know_that_you/,2019-08-10 01:46:26,"Prologue [\~\~\~](URL previous chapter [\~\~\~|](URL next chapter \~\~\~| In fact, I knew who I wanted to take along on a reconnaissance. None of our people were innocent, but there were some that I couldnt trust at all. And there were those that I thought I could rely on. Fortunately, I could now check all of that. *If I had to decide who to go with based only on the available information...* Innokenty could be of help with his *Iron Fists*, despite our complicated relationship. Unfortunately, he was useless now. I couldnt, and didnt trust Semyon, from the beginning, which why I didnt want him to be a part of the campaign. His twisted nature could prove to be dangerous. I would definitely recruit Olga. She was calm, judicious and we had a heart-to-heart conversation back then. In the end, she collected herbs for me without objection. To be honest, if I were her, I would have already rebelled. Like Dasha did. *What should I do with her?* She was a nasty girl, but also a good archer. I would think about her candidature later. I hardly knew the guys from Vladas detachment. I was still mixing up Paul and Stas. Nikolai was too old, so we didnt have common interests. Age wasnt the best parameter to follow when choosing fighters, but I preferred people with whom I could have a common ground. Nikolai was always silent, so it was hard to imagine what was on his mind. Ambidextrous Cyril seemed to be a good option, but his malicious nature didnt inspire confidence. Yeah, I was suddenly an experienced HR specialist. Everyone here was a murderer, even if they didnt want to be one. Some of them had killed a dozen people, and I was using words like twisted and old. It was really easy to get used to the circumstances. Petrovich didnt let me pick the blacksmith, which was a bit annoying as he was a good guy, and it was not surprising that the leader appreciated him. I could understand his decision, though. The old man was about to send me into the unknown, from which I may not come back. Being a competent leader, he couldnt deprive himself of support of the powerful members. Thats why he couldnt risk losing the redhead who knew a lot about this world. He was also reliable, unlike Boris, who was the first to give up when we attacked their detachment. I didnt take the girls into account as they could do nothing else but laugh and giggle; except for Lena, she could be useful. All these thoughts were based purely on my guesses, of course. *And here comes my first victim.* Sergey! I called the guy who I had barely spoken to before. He jumped in surprise as if I had scared him. Dont be afraid, I winced. Youre good at handling a crossbow, arent you? I was a real Captain Obvious, asking a question I already knew the answer to. I just wanted to have a talk with him and see his reaction. I am, the guy shyly replied. Its my specialty. I would like to master it... Dont belittle yourself, I interrupted. You must be good at hunting. Better than others. He got braver and lifted his gaze. While the crossbowman was telling me about his skills, I was attentively reading his data. ***Sergey Nosov*** *Level 10* *Age: 43 days* *Skill: ranged combat (crossbow)* *Additional skill:* Accurate Shot *Vulnerability: Heavy armor reduces the main skills effectiveness.* There it was. Their vulnerabilities were added to other characteristics. This would come very useful when fighting enemies and make coming up with tactics much easier. I will take into account Sergeys abilities. I politely said that I was busy and moved on, interrupting his long story and leaving him guessing what I actually wanted from him. Despite the fact that I already knew who I definitely wouldnt take with me, I had to check everybody. Getting information was more important than the campaign. Boris, who was specialized in wielding a mace, had an ability called *Rush* *Attack*, and a vulnerability *Reduced Vision Radius*. In fact, the guy was almost blind when using his hurricane attack. Although he could break through a strong defense, he was open to blows. Dasha had *Instant Reaction* that allowed her to dodge strong, but inaccurate blows. However, she paid for that with increased damage as her endurance was reduced in favor of dexterity. Almost all of the descriptions so far were only about combat skills, so I was disappointed. I hoped that I would discover a couple of other peoples secrets. Then I came across Olga. As a long-range fighter, she could use the so-called *Archer Pose*. From the short description of the skill I got that our business lady shot more accurately and caused more damage when sniping although she was nearly useless using any other weapon. The system read, Using a non-primary weapon reduces the effectiveness of the attack by 50%. Nikolai, a man over forty years old, who obviously used to listen to country music in his former life, could fall into a sort of berserk mode and deal monstrous damage. The skill was called *Blind Rage*, but I liked berserk better. In fact, his vulnerability was quite predictable: a great reduction in speed and a decrease in health points. As they say, the bigger they are, the harder they fall. It looked menacing, but he couldnt cause a lot of damage without special abilities, but he could try raising his dexterity and combo attacks accordingly. *Nothing but fighting again*. For a while I was just looking around absent-mindedly. Paul, who was Vladas assistant, handled axes, hatchets and ax helves masterfully. He was good at fighting with both hands, holding weapons in each of them. However, his left one was clearly inferior to the right one, so gloomy Cyril was the only one who was ambidextrous. I didnt find anything interesting about Lina, Marina, and Ravshana. Dmitri, whom I wanted to thoroughly examine, surprised me. As I once assumed, he had a strange ability that allowed him to break his enemys weapon. He had done that back then, in the duel with Nikolai. But then things started to get weird. First of all, he had no vulnerability. Nothing. Secondly, he had a *geas* icon. I couldnt see what its essence was though. I had sympathized with the blacksmith, and he turned out to be a black sheep. I winced... I remembered who wore that bright red scarf that I had noticed in the old mans cave. The tall, ungainly blacksmith once had it on when he was on patrol. He laughed, saying that it would save him from the cold. That was a long time ago, even before the coup that was arranged by Petrovich. The blacksmith wore this scarf infrequently. There was nothing special about it which is why I didnt remember it immediately. His face, buried in that tasteless scarf, appeared in my mind. The redhead had been in that cave. He spoke to the old man and received something from him. Moreover, judging by the fact that I couldnt see his vulnerability, the *geas* had something to do with it. The blacksmith was clearly hiding something. I wondered if he had been there before or after Petrovich. Maybe this was the reason why the blacksmith was so precious toward our leader. I found some interesting things, but I was yet to decide what to do with that information. The only thing I knew for sure was that I had to be more careful with the redhead. *Cordyceps* was still working, so I decided to have a look at Petrovich. I was sure that he had something to hide too. After all, both he and the blacksmith had visited that place... *Why didnt I start with him? Why didnt I ever think of taking a closer look at Petrovich?* What do you want, Cat? the leader kindly asked when I found him. Have you recruited your team? Almost, I nodded. I just wanted to ask you something. Could you maybe change your mind about Dmitri? I blurted out the question without thinking. Dmitri mustve come to mind since I was thinking about his hidden *geas*. Petrovich sighed wearily, put his hand on my shoulder and answered me in a tone a father would his son. Cat, I told you that I need him at the base. Thats it. You are free to go. Pretending to be upset, I smiled at Petrovich and hurried out. I managed to see the most important thing. Like the redhead, he didnt have any vulnerability. Instead of that, he had a special attack  *Lance Blow*. And a *geas*. However, this time I was able to read a part of its description. That was enough to make me think about what could happen. Under the terms of his *geas*, which the system helpfully highlighted for me, Petrovich had to bring at least ten people to the distant forest within a year. Thats all I managed to read. So thats why he was in such a hurry to move North. Thats why he started to gather other detachments around him. Even if some of them died, he would still have enough people to complete his mission and not lose his attributes. Why were we going to the *Forbidden City* then? It would be easier to just head North. I wondered what other secrets his *geas* held. One thing became crystal clear to me. Petrovich didnt want to leave this world. He had said that before. But it only became obvious to me now that this man had no reasons to come back. He was a nobody there. But here, life was endless. If one was stronger than others, they could climb to the top of the food and social chain. The question I ended up asking myself was if I wanted to leave this place or not. Of course, I had thought about that before, more than once. Was it worth going back to the place where I was now a nobody from nowhere? Where I was hated, where I could die and couldnt reborn. Where I would have to work hard just to make ends meet. I wondered if I really wanted such a fate for myself. What did I really want? Hey, Cat, why are you standing there like youre made of stone? Stas, the archer from Vladas detachment, was standing in front of me and staring at me. Seeing that I was alive, he sighed in relief. I thought that someone had paralyzed you. I mean, who knows what kind of creatures can get to you here. ***Stas Zakharov*** *Level 13* *Age: 54 days.* *Skill: ranged combat (bow)* *Additional skill:* Evasion *Vulnerability: Heavy armor reduces the main skills effectiveness.* Nothing special. Same as Sergey. Stass level was higher though, and he had a different type of weapon. Everything else seemed ordinary to me after I had revealed the blacksmith and Petrovichs secrets. I was just thinking, I answered calmly. We are going to the *Forbidden City* soon Petrovich asked me to recruit people. Thats great, Stas nodded. But I would appreciate it if you dont take me with you. He managed to surprise me with his words. Having in mind how he fought when we attacked their base he was not a coward. What if I have already chosen you? I decided to play with him. It was funny, but the system counted my little improvisation as a successful deception, giving me two dozen deception points. Well, I wont resist then, the archer said, sounding a little bit disappointed. Im kidding, I admitted. But why are you asking me about that? I didnt think youd be upset by something like that. I have heard many things about that place, Cat. *Interesting revelation.* Nothing good. Did you know that Vlada had been there? I lost my ability to speak for a second. Today was a really strange day. I wondered why Vlada didnt tell anyone that that damned place was familiar to her. I also wondered why Stas gave her secret away. I didnt know, I shook my head. She didnt tell anyone. And she wont, Stas sneered. Our people know about that. Apparently, she doesnt want you guys to know. And you want us to know, I said, looking him in the eyes. Oh, go to hell! The archer got angry all of a sudden. She isnt hiding that! She just doesnt tell if nobody asks! Stas lost his temper and quickly left, not turning around. It was time to pay someone a visit. It was slowly getting dark and cold, especially near the river where I found Vlada. She was sitting there with the business lady whom she was lively talking to. The ladies fell silent as they noticed me, and Olga suddenly said that she has to go and cook dinner. *Womens intrigues!* Vlada, I said. We need to talk. Having heard my words, Olga immediately hastened her step and disappeared from our sight in a few seconds. *She might start gossiping.* Sit down, lets talk, Vlada said with a slight suspicion in her voice. I looked at her, thinking that she was very beautiful for her age despite the slightly faded strands in her brown hair. Tell me about the *Forbidden City*, I said finally, sitting down without taking my eyes off of her. *Skill:* Sword Blow *Vulnerability: Attacks to the lower part of the body* *Status:* The Mark of the Abyss **Thank you for reading.** **The next chapter will be tomorrow.**"

My new armor was weak against that thing. I remembered Jones telling me that creatures blood was used to prepare the potion that turned people into zombies. And now I was sitting next to the woman who was somehow related to all of this paranormal stuff. I wondered what everybody else was hiding from me. I didnt manage to check everyone and I sure as hell couldnt do it now; itd be rude to leave. Whats more, itd give rise to questions and suspicions. Therefore, I would stay and listen to the story about the *Forbidden City* as it was actually interesting. Ill take a look at the other members of the detachment later. So, yeah, Vlada sounded sad. She mightve received the mark at the *Forbidden City*. Listen, there were two of us there: our former leader, Ruslan, and me, his assistant. You know, at first, this world is frightening, but then a feeling of permissiveness overwhelms you. You think that you can do whatever you want so long as your tombstone is safe. So we decided to visit those ruins. We were being silly, hoping to find some ancient legacy, a powerful weapon, or a spaceship with access to extraordinary technologies. I remember us walking and laughing. But you didnt find anything. Vlada paused so I tried to make her continue the story. If the pause became too long, she would change her mind about finishing the story. Yeah, she stopped staring into space and continued as if nothing had happened. More precisely, we found something else. By the way, Ive never told anyone the details about what had happened then. I dont know why I decided to do that now, so dont interrupt me, please. If you do, Ill probably leave and go cry for a while. *Is she joking?* She seemed to be both joking and not at the same time. I nodded in response, just in case. We spent the entire day exploring the outskirts; no nocturnal monsters came close to the city border, so we managed to spend the night there without dying. Although neither of us got enough sleep. I swear that we could hear the sound of dripping water the entire time. However, there was no rain either that night or the whole week before that. She paused. Maybe she needed to take a deep breath or was reliving that nights events. I wanted to come back to the base in the morning, but Ruslan insisted that we stay and explore. I remember him saying that in the worst case scenario we wont have to return on foot. He was always like that; calm, cracking jokes no matter what was going on. In the end, we went inside. At first glance, they looked like ordinary ruins, but then a gang of *Stone Goblins* appeared from one of the basements. We managed to cope with them so we thought that there was nothing to be afraid of, but their blood attracted stronger monsters. Vladas throat got dry and she lost her voice for a moment. Fortunately, a sip from a flask, which she found somewhere, came in handy, and the story continued. It seemed trustworthy at first, but the more details she added, the more suspicious it appeared. Something invisible appeared near us. At first, we heard the sound of shambling footsteps; the next moment, it drank all the blood spilled on the ground. We were rooted to the ground and didnt dare to move, foolishly hoping that the creature wouldnt hurt us if we did so. However, it didnt leave; it attacked us instead. It seemed like our shadows rose from the ground and wrapped around our bodies, not letting us move. A voice appeared in my head and told me to give in. I felt like that lasted forever. A moment later, Ruslan managed to light a fire with a Molotov cocktail, which he brought along in case of emergency. Both he and his shadow started to burn, and then the flame moved to the thing holding me. I think I heard someones scream in my head right before I regained control over my body. Thats how I managed to escape. Once I came back to the base Ruslans body continued to burn even after he had respawned at the cemetery. No one knew what to do. They tried pouring water on him, but he kept dying and respawning, still in flames. Five minutes later, his tombstone cracked and crumbled to pieces. I became the leader right after that. Although some people considered me responsible for his death, none of them dared to oppose me. *What an impressive story.* I was about to believe her, but she had the *Mark of the Abyss* the story couldnt have ended so simply for her. Maybe unlike the burned Ruslan, she reached some sort of an agreement with those creatures? Was the *Mark* the proof of that? She was a sly one alright, luring me into the *Forbidden City*. I wondered what I wouldve thought about all of this had I not known about the *Mark*. Had she not told me anything, I wouldve hesitated. Had she told me that this place was nothing special, I wouldnt have believed her. Thus, this little scheme of her was a nice one. Yeah, it was dangerous there, but the monsters were nothing special, and the mysterious shadows were afraid of fire. There, mystery solved. I could confidently go there. Thanks for the story. I didnt have to make a decision right now. I had to think things through. Vlada didnt even attempt to make me stay. She was a smart woman. She understood that I wouldnt make any decisions until I thought things over. I checked everybody as I had planned. And it was a good thing that I did as it turned out that Igor, the former head of the third detachment, had two *geases*. I had no idea where he had gotten the second one, but the first one was definitely from his old armor. If removing the armor didnt remove it as well, putting it on even once would be a huge mistake. No temporary protection was worth a permanent commitment. Realizing that I wouldnt be able to fall asleep after all this, I went to the swamp and spent a few hours there instead of having dinner. First of all, I increased my intelligence to its max. Now I had 75 without any boosts. It was about time too, as there were so many dangers lurking about and I kept postponing it because I had to burn myself. However, dying and knowing that theres no second chance hurt a lot more than that. I then just sat there, staring into the darkness and trying to come up with a plan. Everyone was obviously playing their own game, and I had to think through how to get the best possible outcome out of all of this. After all, when else, if not during moments like these, do people get stronger? First things first, I had to decide whether I was willing to take such a risk and go to the *Forbidden City*, given what I managed to learn about it. Maybe I should just send everyone to hell and sit in my cave or go wild in the swamp for a couple of days. Unfortunately, I couldnt do that unless I planned on leaving the detachment and continuing on my own. Right now, I still had things under control. I was one of those who had the right to determine the future of our squad. Right now I was the player, but if I deviate I would become a minor chess piece. Since we decided to go to the ruins, I had to come up with a plan that would keep us all from dying. For starters, my squad. I would definitely take the three new guys to cover me in case of emergency. I would also need a couple of people to act as messengers. Cut off someones head and everyone in the camp would get your message in less than five minutes. The only problem was that they could misinterpret the messages so I would have to leave some sort of a note or code to Petrovich. The codes should be simple phrases that the dead players could unknowingly without raising suspicion. There would also be keywords embedded in those messages, so that they couldnt make things up. Well, they would still be able to say whatever they wanted, but Petrovich would be able to understand that the message wasnt from me. The idea certainly wasnt bulletproof, but I couldnt come up with a better one that would confirm the authenticity of a message. *I read something about such a method being used during the French Revolution.* It might come in handy, but that also meant that I had to decide who would be the messenger. If you weigh all the pros and cons, Semyon and Sergey were the best candidates as they were very devoted to our leader. They probably wouldnt lie to him. Not to mention that the two became good buddies after Major had left. Me disliking the former cop aside, all he had to do was to play the role of a carrier pigeon; no one would ask him anything else. *One problem taken care of. Whats next?* Itd probably be better to look at this situation not from the point of an individual, but of groups that kept secrets from one another. I knew that after having visited the old man and acquiring their *geases*, Petrovich and the redhead bonded in some way. Fortunately, neither of them was going with me on the campaign. There was also Vlada and her strange bond with the abyss. She clearly wanted me to go to the *Forbidden City*. The question was if taking her along would be worth the effort. I wondered if she would pull some trick or follow us on her own. Did I really need to spend the campaign looking over my shoulder, expecting a nasty surprise? However, this problem could easily be solved. I would take her along and get rid of her the moment we reach the ruins. Even if she decides to return, I wouldnt have to worry about her schemes for a while. So, the old man, the abyss lady, and Peculiar Armor Igor. Also, given that he had a *geas*, he knew about the curse, but he didnt say anything. Maybe he was another candidate for the pre-*City* cemetery trip. Going in alone seemed easier. However, the mysterious monsters were really bothering me. I wouldnt go there without backup. In the end, I decided to take Igor, Egor, Anton, and Stepan with me. Semyon and Sergey would be the messengers. Vlada and Cyril would join us too, as taking the latter one with us would show that we were willing to have someone from the second detachment with us. Moreover, I wouldnt feel sorry for him. Not everyone will come back from this adventure. *So, the plan.* As soon as we reach the ruins I will get rid of Igor and Vlada because I dont need people connected to the abyss in a place that was obviously its home. I will then make up some story and make Sergey respawn in order to send a request to Petrovich to keep those two at the base until my arrival. Judging by Vladas story, they stayed there overnight, and were greeted by those things in the morning. She might have exaggerated the details, but the main point of the story was clear. We will set a camp too, but we wont spend the night. Instead, we will quickly advance along the border of the *Forbidden City*, thus covering a decent distance by morning. If monsters gather around our campfire, we should better be somewhere far away from it. At first glance, everything in my plan seemed logical. However, we should try to avoid fights. If we shed blood, I will immediately order a retreat. Risking everything would be a stupid move. My main goal was to get a good look at the monsters and their descriptions. With that, I wouldnt be walking on thin ice anymore and could come up with a proper strategy. Concentrating on the creature approaching me from the water, I looked at its stats using *Full Mind*. ***Rotten Drowned Man*** *Level 15* *Health: 1,000* *Element: water* *Attack: 150* *Defense: 150* *Magic defense: 3* *Skills:* Tearing Flesh Out*;* Poisoning *Vulnerability: fire* *Speed: 2 (walk), 7 (sprint)* Turns out that I could get more information on the monsters than on people. *If I knew so much about the inhabitants of the ruins, I could lure them away and calculate how long it will take them to get back! I wouldnt have to worry about anything! Raiding that place would be so much easier!* I captured my victim using *Stone Spikes* and paralyzed it with a burst of endurance just in case, activating *Flame Flow* after that. The system log showed not only the damage dealt but also something called *Paralyzing Pain*. *So thats how the paralysis works.* I killed the undead monster, reducing its health to zero. *I finally finished increasing my stats. I can start gaining levels now!* **The next chapter will be tomorrow.** **Consider telling about this book to your friends.**"
35,vulnerability,HFY,World of Karik. Chapters 50. No. 2,50,cqd6a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/cqd6a2/world_of_karik_chapters_50_no_2/,2019-08-15 03:49:21,"Prologue [\~\~\~](URL previous chapter [\~\~\~|](URL next chapter \~\~\~| It seemed that I managed to find out another secret without any risk. Apparently, having seen us at night, Osipov concluded that we already knew everything, and he let it slip. Shadows would move easier in the morning. Those were his words, and I knew that these creatures were the main danger in the *Forbidden City*. Therefore the shadows needed light as they simply couldnt exist in the dark; nighttime was the safest time to explore the ruins. If I hadnt known that, we wouldve used torches and lured our own deaths. I silently looked at the old mans figure, now accompanied by three zombies that staggered from side to side as they walked. The guys will have a hard time, but it will be worth it. It seemed that I finally remembered where I had seen Osipov before. Cyril, I called the guy who was groaning in pain. Hes from your detachment. He stabbed himself in the heart when we attacked your six newbies while they were leveling up. What? Cyril replied. Have you lost your mind? Ive never seen him before. Really? I mistrustfully asked. Really the guy growled. We didnt have any old people. Nikolais the oldest; hes forty-five. And this man is at least seventy years old! Plus, we had only five newbies. I was confused and speechless. I thought I had it figured out. *What the hell is going on here? I was certain that that was him* Why didnt anyone remember this guy? If that really was him back then, why did he, powerful as he is, run away so quickly? Had he tried to stop me then, there would have been nothing left of the enthusiastic hand-chopper. However, given the power of his illusions, which affected even me with my 20 points of magic defense, it wasnt surprising that Vladas former detachment failed to notice him. We never discussed what had happened to them before our union, how they had lived, or what incidents and oddities had occurred to them. Maybe that was then when they lost a few people, and Osipovs zombie collection got richer for few members. How did I notice him back then, if now I had nothing to oppose his illusions with? It could be that the old man just didnt expect someone with magic defense to be there. However, he quickly fixed the situation. I was willing to bet that there was no actual knife in his heart. I just happened to be trapped in his illusion too, and the alleged corpse was probably just standing further away and enjoying the show. *Does that make sense? I think it does.* Moreover, I believed that I knew the name of his master. I was even tempted to tell him that and see how he would react, but I had the sneaking suspicion that I would end up dead. Having looked once again at the apprentice of Polina Lyutova, the Reaper, who, as Baldy used to say, could subdue any mind, I was surprised to notice that the earth shifted under one of the zombies. Did I imagine that? Or was there an underground hiding place that no one had noticed so far? I should keep silent as we couldnt be sure if Osipovs departure was another illusion and that he wasnt watching us at the moment though I doubted that there was anything but filth and desolation in this place. However, where was it more likely to hit the jackpot: in the ruins, where any psycho with zombies could go, or in a closed basement? I would prefer the second option, especially because I really didnt want to return to Petrovich empty handed. I will tell Petrovich everything, Sergey informed me. By and large, I wasnt bothered by what had happened. Just a bit disappointed. Should I make you report to him right now? I couldnt help but answer sarcastically, stroking the scythe with my hand. All the comments about my wise leadership were immediately postponed for a better moment. Its good when you have reasonable people around. In the meantime, the old man seemed to have already left. I wondered if I should check that suspicious piece of ground or if we should wait a little longer. Guys, lets go back, weve already lost so many people, its time to stop. Honestly, I thought that we had only one whining person in the detachment, Dasha, but Lena was going for a record today. Too early, I cut short any discussions. Cyril and Sergey immediately realized that I had noticed something. Are you going to tell us? After a few minutes of silence, the crossbowman couldnt wait anymore. We had threatened each other just recently, but as soon as he understood that the campaign wasnt over yet, he got himself together and got ready to listen to my commands. It was a shame that such an intelligent person supported Petrovich. Semyon was also behaving surprisingly adequate today. Maybe I had underestimated the lancer. Smart people wouldnt gather around him for no reason. Well wait until our guest leaves, no need to hurry. I was trying to figure out how much time we had until dawn. Despite the old mans words, complete darkness still surrounded us. However, I didnt want to be late. If we dont do this today, I cant guarantee that another undesired guest wont visit us again. Though I asked Petrovich to look after Vlada and Igor, I doubted that he would bother himself with that, which is why they would catch up with us sooner or later. The rest of the detachment was ordered to stand still next to me for at least half an hour before I gave them a sign that the time had come. This delay turned out to be good for us. My surviving wards turned their fear into displeasure with me. As a result, there was no trace of shaky hands or widened eyes. Soon, all three of them got down to business. Ground that had shifted under the zombie wasnt just a trick of the light. There are wooden planks under the stones and mud, Sergey was the first to figure out what I had noticed. I finally relaxed. Until now, I wasnt sure if the old man was a pulling a prank on me. Having cleared about two square yards of the territory, we pulled out a wooden bar, soaked in something black and similar to fuel oil. Then we pulled out another one, having cleared a part of the way wide enough for one person to go through. I have a lighter, Lena said, but I grabbed her hand in time. As soon as fire appears, the shadows would immediately come. I didnt want to know what would happen then. We cant, I explained in a few words what it might lead to. On one hand, I didnt want to share valuable information that gave me advantage over the others in the *Forbidden City*. On the other, this was *my* detachment, so I should have a sense of priorities. Moreover, it would be much worse to suffer due to someones ignorance. Better get your rope ready now, Ill try to go down and see whats there. At first I wanted to send Sergey or Cyril, but I thought that an extra pair of hands would be useful. Among the four of us, I would be able to defend myself in case of danger. I didnt have to ask the girl twice. She unbuckled her weapon, a thin but strong rope, from her belt and lowered it down. I waited a little longer just in case, even pulled up the rope to see if there was anything on its lower end, but it was empty. Cyril also tried to carry out a test, throwing down a couple of stones. Unfortunately, none of us could determine by the echo neither what awaited us at the bottom, nor even the depth. In the end, I was the one to go down. The first thing I tried to do was to get used to the darkness around me. I managed to do that even quicker than I expected. The impenetrable darkness vanished, and the world around became gray. I even thought I could see rough stonework. Descending lower, I had to spend some time getting used to my surroundings. It seems that its getting brighter, Sergeys voice came from above. *Damn it, its almost dawn, we need to hurry.* Having come down another couple of feet, I suddenly felt solid ground under me. In the end, the hole turned out to be only eight or ten feet deep at most. *Such a shame. So much effort for the sake of what?* As my eyes had already adapted to the twilight, I managed to take a look around; my mood immediately changed from dissatisfaction to anticipation. Instead of one of the walls, there was a passage leading into the unknown. Normally, I would never go there, especially since I couldnt use any sort of a light source. But in this world, I could resurrect; I couldnt give up on a little adventure now. Come on, theres a passage in here. We have to check where it leads. The one who goes down last should try to hide the entrance. I didnt want this place to be visible from afar, and we needed shelter from the light. If anything happens, we would stay in the dark until evening. I thought there would be questions or objections, but there werent any. The dangers that we had already gone through rallied our small detachment. However, we didnt manage to cover the entrance properly. The night sky was clearly visible through the big holes. I hoped that the place at least wasnt very conspicuous at a glance. When everyone got used to the darkness and felt more comfortable, we moved forward. The first thirty feet didnt hide any surprises, except that I had a feeling that we were walking in a spiral, moving a little bit to the right with each step. I think the road gradually gets stepper, Lena shared her observations. I agree, Cyril confirmed. If we werent mistaken, we were going toward the center of a huge underground spiral. I got goosebumps, and then I noticed *it*. Tentacles. A huge number of wriggling tentacles hanging from the ceiling and sticking out of the floor, right in front of us. I immediately stopped, and Cyril ran into me. Sergey and Lena continued forward, as if not noticing the lurking danger. Hold still! I grabbed them by the shoulders, stopping them dead in their tracks. Dont you see whats ahead? No. *Thats what I thought. Another mental block?* I spent a few minutes explaining what, and where, to look at, poking them to the side in order to stimulate their attention, before both of them finally noticed the danger ahead. Holy shit! Lena swore and jumped back. What are we gonna do? Sergey reacted more calmly, keeping himself together. Cyril pretended that he knew that something like this was going to happen from the very beginning, but it was evident that he flinched at the sight of the Lovecraftian decor. We obviously wont punch them with our fists. I already managed to do a little experiment. As soon as I got closer to the growth, all of the tentacles began to move more actively. Particularly troubling was that some of them crawled closer to us, forcing us to take a couple of steps back. It turned out that these werent a part of some huge monsters body or even several monsters bodies but that they were independent entities. I bet that if we attacked one of them, the rest of the mass would murder us. Although each of these tentacles was only level 10 and had 100 health, we wouldnt be able to cope with all of them. Even a dozen of them would give us a hard time, considering that they had a special attack called *Paralyzing Touch*. Their only vulnerability was mental attacks, but hardly any of us were capable of something like that. Maybe my paralysis that I could cast with endurance wouldve been considered such an attack. *Should I try it? Or is it better not to risk it?* Neither of us had any other ideas, and there was no sense in sitting here forever and waiting for something to happen. Having decided not to waste time, we started getting ready. It wasnt difficult. We just agreed that if something goes wrong, my support group would kill me first, and then kill themselves. No one wanted to die in the clutches of the underground monsters. *Well, lets get started.* I took off all of my armor. It wouldnt save me, but it could prevent my health from reaching zero too quickly, in case it comes to me having to use the most radical methods. If I spend endurance, a couple of blows should be enough. The most important thing was that I wasnt afraid. Lets go! I told myself and tried to paralyze the nearest tentacle. The attack was successful, but I didnt foresee what happened next. I didnt expect that this wild growth would have a common consciousness that could feel someone elses influence and get rid of the infected member. As a result, the affected tentacle stopped moving and immediately turned into stone. Not being able to stay on the ceiling, it slipped down and shattered. The others continued to move peacefully as if nothing had happened. *Did it really work?* **Mental blocks, huh?** **What is there, in the dungeons of Forbidden City?** **The next chapter will be tomorrow.**"

Neatly hitting the weakly wiggling tentacles and paralyzing them using my consciousness, I slowly made a narrow passage. Lena, Cyril, and Sergey were standing behind me and silently observing. They even seemed to be holding their breath. However, that wasnt surprising since I myself had to take a deep breath and stand still before each blow, preparing for the worst. The visibility in the corridor was minimal, so we didnt know how many more of these living growths lurked in the dark. *What if the whole corridor is full of them and were about to get caught up in the swarming filth?* I didnt manage to think about it properly because someone touched one of the creatures. It didnt matter who it was. Perhaps it was Lena who carelessly walked past it, and the tip of her lasso touched one of the tentacles. Or maybe it was me... The corridor, quite literally, came to life in front of our eyes. A second ago the tentacles reminded me of almost harmless plants, but now I felt as if I was inside of some creatures stomach... Aaa! the girl screamed in fear. The situation was getting direr by the second as we had to act in almost complete darkness. I could only see what was in front of me, but the creatures attacked us from all directions. The lower ones tried to wrap my legs and make me fall onto the floor, while the upper ones reached for my neck. Their touch was cold and slippery, and a distinct smell of raw meat hung in the air. However, we had been lucky so far as the mysterious *Paralyzing Touch* hadnt occurred yet. Help! one of the guys shouted, but I couldnt see who it was. Panic made his voice unrecognizable. *Have I tempted fate?* I heard a gasp and strange sobs, followed by the sound of a body dropping to the floor. *Damn, thats really bad.* Go on! I shouted. Break through! Break through! There was a cleaning up ahead; same corridor, same walls and ceiling, but without the filthy writhing monsters. Forcing my way through them, I was frantically thinking about using my last chance weapon. *Flame Flow* would help me escape but I would reveal myself and create shadows. Therefore, I would either continue to squeeze through and hope for the best, or risk it. I really didnt like either option. Deep in my heart, I hoped that my last chance weapon would not only be able to cope with my comrades perception, but also shelter us from shadow danger. *Arcobaleno* I remembered different versions of myself that others would see when I used this skill. I wondered how they would see me this time. However, it was almost impossible to see anything here... Or rather, it had been impossible until flames burst from my hands, lighting up the corridor full of tentacles. I almost threw up now that I got a better look at them. Glistening in the light, they looked like balls of stirring snakes. It was simply indescribable. *But* ***what*** *is that?* The flames only made them undulate as they tried to evade it, curling into balls and moving away. It dawned on me that they were afraid of the fire. That made things somewhat easier, and although I could keep the flame burning almost indefinitely thanks to the healing effect, I still had only thirty seconds. Lena! I saw the girl near me and shouted. Come to me! *Was saving her really worth the trouble? Probably not.* I better stop wasting time and move on. I didnt know what had gotten into me; I just couldnt keep quiet. Maybe it was because I didnt want to be alone here. After all, we had just lost another member of the detachment; Sergey was probably in the camp now, telling Petrovich about what had happened. Cyril was still making his way to us; paralysis could happen at any moment, and we wouldnt have a chance to save him. Run! He got lucky. All sweaty, with crazy in his eyes, the guy jumped out into the open space, and the three of us started running at the same time. Leaving the undulating mass behind, we rushed along the empty corridor until I stumbled and fell onto the wet, earthen floor. Lena and Cyril fell after me, tripping over my prostrate body. We did it! the girl said, almost crying. She then got up and dusted her clothes. And he... Hes dead! She burst into tears. Cyril snorted and moved away from her. Whats next? Running seemed to have helped him calm down; he was much more emotional among the tentacles. Whats next? I shrugged. Theres no way back, no one would go through there for the second time. Well have to go back anyway, Cyril said. What do you suggest? I was getting annoyed. That was no walk in the park. You should be grateful that youre still alive... That all of us are still alive. Sergey was eaten, he kept arguing. Was he blaming me for that even after I had saved both of them? Maybe I should have just left them there. Casting magic wouldve been easier then. He was, I agreed. Ripped apart. Killed. We also lost Anton, Stepan, Vlada and the others. What do you want from me? Okay, Cat, calm down, Cyril suddenly eased up. Were all a bit on the edge, you know? We went somewhere unknown, we risked... Yes, well get revived. But in this world There are things worse than that. You know what I mean, right? It seemed that he wasnt about to stop talking anytime soon. *All right, Ill let him talk, but Ill have to calm him down if anything goes wrong.* They were turned into zombies, Cyril continued. For good, Im pretty sure. God knows where we are now... To hell with you! And with these ruins! He spat angrily but then calmed down. All right, I said in a conciliatory tone. Its time to move on. It could be that there is more than one way out of this dungeon. Lena, how are you? Im fine, the girl answered. Her voice was still shaky but a bit calmer already. That was good. How did you even get rid of the tentacles? Cyril asked, and then added, Thanks, by the way. If it wasnt for you, I He paused. Maybe it was good that I stopped and waited for them to catch up. Didnt you see? I answered his question with another question. I wondered what he saw when I used *Arcobaleno*. A huge flame. The tentacles immediately crawled to the sides, he said. Where did you get that lighter? I barely restrained myself from sighing in relief. It was so simple. Cyril thought that I had used an ordinary lighter. I inherited it from my grandfather, I lied without blinking an eye. That was a common thing back then. Despite the nonsense, he believed me, so I even got a couple of deception points. That was nice of your grandfather, Cyril stated. I thought we were dead. I remembered all sorts of stuff... He shuddered. But was it worth the risk? You talked about the shadows and that light shouldnt be used under any circumstances. *What should I say? That my knees were also shaking until the very end? Or that I have a skill thanks to which the flames dont create shadows?* Did we have a choice? Either we died for sure or risked and possibly survived. We won. Enough self-reflection. Its time to move on. Lack of new questions confirmed that I was not alone in my opinion, so we continued on our way. Having made a couple of steps, I felt that I had sprained my ankle really badly when I fell. It hurt to walk. *God, I hope it gets better soon. It shouldnt be a fracture or a dislocation.* Does it hurt? Lena asked sympathetically. Its bearable, I muttered. Ill walk it off, itll be fine. Look, Cat, Cyril said. I think I see light. Damn it! If there was light, there would be shadows. *Arcobaleno* wont save us this time. I looked closely at where he was pointing. Something was really shining at the end of the corridor; reddish and dim, like the emergency lights in one of the stores I used to work at. The owners were quite rich and were able to fork out for an additional generator. Maybe we shouldnt go there? the girl fearfully asked. What if theres something there? Do you have any other suggestions? I didnt want to ask her, but it was difficult to make such decisions alone. Tell us. Cyril and I are listening. Lena immediately drooped and stared at the floor. Come on, I ordered and limped toward the red glow without waiting for them. Darkness gave way to twilight after a couple of steps. I looked back and saw that the outlines of our shadows had begun to appear. *But why are they so huge? Were they waiting for us?* I dove to the side at the very last moment. A second before that, the shadow under my feet gained volume and lunged at me, aiming with its claws at my throat. However, both actions were pointless. The red glow, toward which we were going, turned out to be an insurmountable obstacle for this disgusting creature; it froze as if having crashed into an invisible wall. Cat, are you all right? Why are you jumping? Lenas voice was shaky again. Maybe she imagined what wouldve happened to had I gone crazy. It was obvious that neither she nor Cyril saw the dark figures behind us. Strong magic defense turned out to be a bit of a problem. I couldnt just walk and not worry about anything. *Ill have nightmares because of that for sure.* In fact, I was pleased. I finally managed to see the description of the shadows and examine their stats. I was safe and I could finally make plans based, not on stories and conjectures, but on real facts. I increased my intelligence and activated my inner vision. ***Shadow Reflection*** *Level: 8* *Health: 10,000* *Element: abyss* *Attack power: 300* *Defense: 300* *Magic defense: 5* *Skills:* Way of Shadows*,* Search for Heat*,* Reflection *Vulnerability: order* *Immunity: physical attacks* *Speed: 40 feet per second (cruising); 82 feet per second (sprint)* As one smart man used to say: thats the long and the short of it. Forty feet per second was breaking the world record, and these creatures were able to move at that speed constantly. Well, it surely was impossible to escape from them. Their attack power and defense were also impressive. The only thing I couldnt understand was why they had armor if they were immune to ordinary attacks. Probably, it was possible to strengthen or modify your damage in some way so that it would no longer be physical. Anyway, this information was useful. Now for their skills. *Way of Shadows* was obviously what they used to get here, and *Search for Heat* was how they found us. I wondered what would happen if I lowered my body temperature. The last skill, *Reflection*, gave me no hint and I could only make assumptions about it. It was probably an ability that allowed them to scale with their enemys level. The three shadows, which were still trying to break through the red light, were the same level as us. With all of that taken care of, I had to answer the alarmed girl, given that Cyril also got nervous. After that, we would move on."

Reserve,45,cr7fw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/cr7fw5/world_of_karik_chapter_52_reserve/,2019-08-17 00:52:35,"Prologue [\~\~\~](URL previous chapter [\~\~\~|](URL next chapter \~\~\~| My eyes are just playing tricks on me. Lets move on. I was glad to hear that there were no more questions; especially considering that no one believed in my awkward excuse. I wouldve known if they did. The corridor got wider the deeper into it we went. The ceiling appeared to be much higher and became semicircular. The walls were covered with pale tiles, the color of which was impossible to determine because everything around us, even our faces, had become bright red. Thats not good, Lenas whisper was too loud. I looked at her strictly and was about to shush her, but she beat me to it. She stood there motionless, eyes wide, with her hand covering her mouth. The light was flickering, casting shadows onto the girls face, making her look gloomy and slightly mysterious. Shaking my head to get rid of the sudden numbness, I turned around and walked down the corridor. My leg had almost stopped hurting. For a second I foolishly thought that the pain was about to subside. But I was mistaken. As soon as I hastened my pace, the pain returned and become much more severe. Wow! Cyril exclaimed when the corridor led us into a round, wide grotto. The walls were covered with the same tiles as the hallway, and the domed ceiling loomed high above us. The lighting was poor and I was pretty far away, but it looked like there were a lot of illustrations on it. A red sphere lay on a small, rocky ledge in the center of the grotto. It was the source of the glow that we had noticed. The sphere was about the size of a soccer ball, but it looked like to be made of glass. Whats that? Lena asked in awe. I wish I knew, I muttered in reply. Its better not to touch it. All I knew about it was that it scared off the *Shadows*. Judging by their vulnerabilities, I would assume that it was somehow connected with the *Order* mentioned in the monsters description. Cat! Cyril called me in fear. I turned around and immediately realized what had frightened him so much. A strange creature, a naked woman-like, slender body, was watching us. Her shiny black hair was falling over her shoulders in waves. She had red skin, yellow eyes, and disproportionately long and thin fingers, as well as short, black horns. *How vulgar*, flashed a strange thought. ***Dorea*** *Level: 100* *Special skill:* Hypnosis *Additional skill:* Dissection *Vulnerability: none* As I expected, the description was much shorter than those of the *Shadows*. On the other hand, if you compared Dorea with Osipov, there was a great difference. When I looked at the old man, I could see only his name. Did that mean that he was stronger than this... This demon? Or was it because he was a man and not a local monster? Its been a long time since anyones been here, the creature said in a pleasant, deep voice. Feminine voice. Are you here for the power of the *Sphere*? Perhaps, I answered evasively. *What else could I do?* Strange answer. Maybe I had imagined it, but Dorea sounded genuinely surprised. I wondered how this demoness was connected with the *Abyss* and *Order*. We know nothing about the power of the *Spher*e, I added, so we arent sure if we should mess with you. *What the hell did I say?* We knew neither what dangers awaited us, nor how to avoid them. I was improvising and making decisions on the go. Our mysterious companion grinned slyly, revealing her snow-white teeth and sharp fangs. You arent like anyone who has ever been here before, she said, still smiling. I dont even want to kill you. Dont, Lena joined in on our conversation, voice trembling. Please, dont kill us. *Dorea, is that even her name?* She gave Lena a withering gaze and turned back to me. The *Sphere* gives strength, she explained, carnivorously smiling, devouring me with her eyes. *Seems that she managed to get into my head somehow.* I felt like someone was touching my brain. This feeling was gone very soon though. It decides to whom and how much to give. What do we have to do? I swallowed hard, trying to make it unnoticeable. Dorea noticed my confusion. She smiled yet again, straightening up and stretching her arms. Excuse me, would you mind getting dressed? It just slipped out. *Were dead now*. Youre making us uncomfortable. The demoness laughed out loud. At the same moment, a suit of armor, black as anthracite, appeared on her body. You amuse me. That is a rarity these days! she said, and immediately became serious. You have two options: either you fight me or... Answer a question. Can we just leave? I asked. Since she was being so chatty and was in no hurry to kill us, it was worth trying to get her to talk. You cant, Dorea said with a smile. *Well, I tried* It seemed that we had no choice. There was no way that the three of us could kill her. Level 100 wasnt a joke! *Fine, Ill play your game.* The question then, I made my choice. Good, Dorea nodded. Listen carefully, I wont repeat myself. *It doesnt distinguish beggars from kings* *Unexpectedly, on each door it rings,* *Dark creatures, birds, and animals it stings,* *You and I cannot avoid what it brings* Listening to someone read poetry in this world was strange. If there was no catch, the answer was obvious. Death, Cyril answered first. Thin and fragile-looking female fingers crumpled his skull as if it was made of paper. I didnt even manage to figure out what exactly had happened. Did she teleport to us or did she stretch out her arm and crossed the distance between us? Wrong answer. Dorea cleansed her hand from the blood with a sharp wave. A moment later, she was a pretty girl instead of a bloody demon. Is our time limited? I gratefully looked at Lena who asked the question I didnt dare ask myself, being afraid of the life-threatening outcome. Fortunately, it turned out that peaceful communication was possible so long as we dont make wrong guesses. Technically, its not. I didnt like answers that seemed to be positive at first glance but that usually hid even more problems than you initially imagined. However, if I were you, I wouldnt waste your time, given that the representatives of three different forces are almost here. *Thats unexpected. It would be nice to learn more details about that.* Lenas question was formally connected to the riddle, but I wondered if Dorea would tell us things that had nothing to do with it. In any case, I had to act carefully as such questions could result in another punishment. Can they try to answer your question too? It was pleasant to talk utter nonsense from time to time. Even Dorea laughed in response. Two beginner *Chaosites*, two slaves of the *Abyss*, and the one whose master thinks himself equal to the Gods? I dont think that we can negotiate. The demoness paused and stared at me. Are you trying to manipulate me to find out about the impending danger? I wouldnt recommend it, or itll be the last thing youll care about. Her gentle tone made me flinch. However, I had already gotten what I needed. It was clear who these slaves of the *Abyss* were  Vlada and Igor. Dorea using slave to refer to them was hardly accidental. Their *Marks* were quite a distinct characteristic. It could be that the two made a mistake in planning their moves or that they were indeed exposed to evil against their will. But the main thing was that they managed to leave the camp and were on their way to here. *Who were the Chaosites then? Strangers? Or...* After the *Mark of the* *Abyss* had been added to Igors *geas*, they became even more suspicious to me. I thought that a certain obligation came with a *geas* and that the person either fulfilled it or not. Having implemented it, theyd then receive the *Mark* or, in Vladas case, increase its level. I bet that that thing also made them stronger, but that wasnt the point right now. There were two more people with *geases* in the camp. Petrovich and the redhead and I wouldnt be surprised if they couldve gotten the *Mark of the Abyss* had they fulfilled the mandatory requirements. It seemed that Petrovich decided to hunt using live bait. Thats why Vlada and Igor werent stopped and rushed to the *Forbidden City* yet again. As for the latter one, it was obviously Osipov. Only his teacher, the Reaper, could imagine himself being equal to the Gods. Of course, these were just my guesses, but I was willing to bet that they were right. The only question that was bothering me was how did all of them learn about this *Sphere*. I wont apologize for trying to survive. I didnt intend on beating around the bush anymore. But I was forced to It seemed to me that soon, only brute force will be able to defend us. Thats why I had to immediately think about how to divide our forces. Wouldnt you have done the same if you were me? Or is the demon thats guarding the artifact of the *Order* the epitome of obedience? So, you know what Im guarding. Her harsh, penetrating voice gave me the shivers. I felt like it was pressing me into the ground. It turned out that I was right yet again. Maybe that was some kind of feature that came with *Deception*? Asking the right questions even when lacking information? Unlikely. There wouldve been some data about it in the logs. No, I answered honestly. I could only make guesses based on the *Shadows* vulnerability. *If I continue talking, shell figure out that I dont know as much as she thinks I do. I have to make the best out of this situation.* I told you to stop playing with me. This time, her outstretched hand squeezed my skull. It wasnt teleportation after all. My health dropped, and I felt blood running down my cheeks. This is your last warning. Dorea removed her hand, but her stare was still heavy. If I solve your riddle, will you answer my questions? *Am I going too far, considering the recent events?* Blood was still trickling down my face, and turning into some weird mask. It seemed that my own *geas* had a bad influence on me. I was trying to use a simplified version of it. Okay. *So simple?* Dorea herself didnt seem too happy about the upcoming guests. She was clearly trying to figure out if she could get rid of them with my help. *Have I willingly walked into a trap?* Elephant, that is my answer. I had planned to say fate at first. After the mistake with death, nothing else came to mind. For some reason, I decided to check whether or not the demoness was going to use me. If I was wrong, I would be sent to my lovely swamp. But if I was right, she and I had a deal. So the elephant doesnt distinguish beggars from kings? Stings all sorts of creatures? Neither you nor me can avoid it? Why not, she smiled at me, demonstrating her hypnotizing, sharp smile. I accept your answer. If my weird answer was accepted, Dorea obviously wanted to use me in order to deal with the new guests. More precisely, to detain or misdirect them, taking into account my level and skills. She probably didnt believe that I could handle any of them on my own. Never doubted myself for a second. Lena was stunned, clearly not understanding how come my answer was accepted. Seems that she didnt get that this riddle had no right answer. Now its your turn to answer my questions and agree upon what we get in return. **I hope you enjoyed the early update.**"
38,vulnerability,HFY,"[PI] Earth is famous for its ability to repel invasions by galactic warlords, although its unknown how, as everyone whos ever tried makes up different excuses. As it turns out, humans are just an irresistably adorable species that nobody wants to eliminate.",1199,cs2j39,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/cs2j39/pi_earth_is_famous_for_its_ability_to_repel/,2019-08-19 01:24:14,"[Link to collection subreddit ](URL Cosmic timescales are vast; it's a truth we forget even more often than cosmic distances, which have come to seem less important since our discovery that most of the galaxy has giving Einstein the finger for, well, a whole cosmic span of time. What this means, besides the fact that all galactic civilizations are unthinkably ancient, is that Homo sapiens sapiensis almost unbelievably young. Newborn, as intelligent tool-using species go, still figuring out the most basic rules, crawling around and banging things together to see what happens, like uranium or high-speed particles. It means we're adorable. We remind the other civilizations of their own barely-documented earliest years, and we're extra-precious because the infant mortality of intelligent species is extremely high. Not a lot of babies to go around, so to speak. And even taking all this into account, even by the barely-comprehensible standards of the cosmic timescale, it's been a very long time since the last sapient organisms came on the scene. Been a long time since the last dozen, really, and they've all long since gone extinct. So it's a galaxy with no babies, or was until we came along. A few toddlers, a handful of adolescents, and way too many damn moody teenagers. Now, like any metaphor, especially any metaphor trying to cram something as massively complex as galactic civilization into a simplistic story about human life cycles, this one breaks down when examined in much detail. But the whole cuteness thing? Absolutely true. We're on our fifth failed or failing invasion right now, with the Aaa'aae'ooo'raa High Facilitator Fleet currently packing up its Marines and its cookies on its way out of the system. That's not to say it's been painless. There's been plenty of death and destruction and suffering and environmental collapse and cultural upheaval and insufferable old politicians sending other people off to die, everything you'd expect from a century and a half of intermittent and extremely asymmetric warfare. It has sucked. Although...maybe not as much as it might have had they just left us alone. Historians are increasingly of the opinion that before the invasions we were already well on our way to facilitating our own extinction for various stupid and mostly preventable reasons, like the extremely strong tendency of humans to discount the real costs of any activity that profits them personally. Or profits their tribe, because tribalism has also been just a real peach when it comes to resource management and allocation. The first invasion seemed to take care of the tribalism thing, with the whole planet uniting against these newcomers. For, you know, about thirty seconds, the time it took for some oppressed groups to realize that they could maybe now be the oppressors if they played their cards right, and some oppressors realizing that maybe they could strengthen their position over the oppressed people they were basically terrified of. Also all your usual screaming ideologues and ranting fundamentalists. Everyone started trying to strike their own treaties or make sure the right number of generals in the resistance had names of the proper ethnicity or arguing about whose fault it was that the entire resistance was in fact a total failure and utter waste of time. Really though it wasn't anyone's fault except for time itself. We were a bunch of squalling infants trying to stop elite squads of professional soldiers by throwing noodles at them from our high chairs. Until some serious time had passed and some growing up accomplished, there just wasn't anything to be done. The invasion happened, the invasion barely noticed the resistance, the incoming colonial government granted special privileges to especially skilled or lucky brown-nosers out of simple convenience, and life went on. And at first life really sucked, let's not make any bones about that. It sucked even for the groups who got the upper hand in their little appeasement games. People disappeared. Sometimes whole cities disappeared so that the invadersthey called themselves the Im-te-hass, which means ""Things Examined Apart"" and yes that could be every bit as horrific as it soundscould study entire human social systems at once. But then things started to get better, for a couple reasons. First, they fixed a lot of things, just because it was easy for them and made occupation easier. They repaired the planetary climactic balance, re-balanced ecological networks, mass-recycled embarrassing amounts of garbage. Second, the Im-te-hass started to leave, first in a trickle, then in a drove. It wasn't until they had nearly gone completely that we figured out why; we only really knew what they told us, it's not like we had any means to effectively eavesdrop. No, we figured it out because the last of them took nearly a third of our population with them as pets. That was the beginning, because a few of them became fond enough of their pets to let them visit Earth again, and they talked, and we listened. And, more to the point, their masters had been talking to them, the way you do with pets, and a few had learned to understand, at least a little. Enough to start piecing things together. We were cute. We were goddamn adorable. Enough that the Im-te-hass actually felt kind of bad about how they'd treated us. Sometimes. When it was convenient. Don't make that face, our species has no room to talk. Do you have any ideas what painful genetic monstrosities we've visited on, say, dogs, all in the name of making them look ""cute?"" The Im-te-hass may have been callous in their studies but at least they never altered anyone. Though then again, maybe they just thought we couldn't get any cuter. It's kind a blow an already-bruised species ego to find out that you escaped your would-be alien overlords by tint of being just the cutest thing ever. Sort of escaped, I mean a third of us were still gone. But we learned. We prepared. We managed to scrounge some technology, jump-start our science, and with the biosphere already largely remedied we thought we could be ready for the next invasion, if it ever came. It did come, and we were laughably wrong. It was bad at first. With our new tech and knowledge we managed to do a miniscule amount of damage, but it was enough to piss the invaders off. There were reprisals. There were a couple decades of very dark days. We don't like to talk about that time. What history mostly commemorates is the sort of collective sigh we made as a civilization before finally just leaning into our cuteness. It was humiliating, sure, but you'd be amazed how little that matters when it feels like continued existence is on the line. We got better at listening to our conquerors. We figured out their weaknesses, researched what their babies looked like, how their kids behaved. We played up the extreme youth of our species, talked about how sorry we were for hurting them that little bit in the first attack, how we were clumsy, didn't really know how to handle even the small strength we'd managed to acquire. And they went away. It didn't even take that long. We made sure that images and audio and video and any other media we could throw ourselves at got back to their public, all slathered with Maximum Cuteness. By then, even their high-ranking military had begun to waver. Once they'd gone, we ignored the demands of our military, we focused entirely on xenopsychology and improving our own societies, trying to make them as sympathetic as possible. Not quite building a utopia, you understand, more a...sort of tourist village. There was a dark side to it, a lot of problems shoved into dark corners. Let's not pretend this was some sort of Golden Age. But when the next invaders came, they bought it, or mostly bought it, or in any case were ground down by their own political and popular pressures within a year. They only took a few pets, we made sure there were plenty of sob stories to go around about humans separated from family. The fourth invaders lasted just a month, because we'd mastered our greatest weapon to date: faster-than-light broadcast with universal encoding. That species was actually recently subjugated entirely by its neighbors, who were indignant at their mistreatment of such an adorable race of hapless moppets such as ourselves. This latest invasion? Less than half their force even touched down on Earth before they had to back away. We greeted their troops with huge peaceful demonstrations, precious little welcoming committees containing our most videogenic children, heart-rending displays of naivet toward their most hardened troops. All broadcast, even though they tried to suppress it. We'd pushed the lion's share of our scientific research in that direction, and when our wormhole-links to the outer planet stations were cut, we hijacked their own comms to do the trick. By accident, of course, all so very innocent. So very cute. We just didn't know how the controls worked, you know? Pressing buttons to see what they'll do, d'aww. And of course we stole their tech, and hoarded it underground, studied it, didn't let any of its nastier applications show anywhere but the most isolated hush-hush labs. Because normally it would take several thousand years to catch up to our Galactic neighbors, but if we can keep these invasions coming? Then maybe we can be ready soon. Because the cuteness act is getting tiresome, and we live a lot longer now, and have long memories. We've been doing accidental leaks, showing our vulnerability, playing up the incredibly adorable potential of human pets, maybe worth the backlash of an invasion. It might cost us some people. We'll steel ourselves and make the sacrifice if it gets us another angle on alien tech. Just a little more. Just a little more. And then Steel yourselves, galaxy. Snuggles the Conqueror is coming for your ass."

There was a knock on the door. Isolation is, after all, one of the great human fears. Yet we're so fascinated with the idea of the end of the world. Because the end of the world is not isolated, often. it brings with it a handful of true companions, and meaning. It makes daily survival something worth striving for. It magnifies the worth of those who have survived. But what if you were truly, utterly alone? This is set in Hell's Kitchen Sink but is pretty much entirely standalone. [URL # Still Life Chapter 2: Natura Morta Dolly stared daggers at my back. I cant bring you with me. Okay? A frosty silence filled the air as I loaded supplies into the back of the van. A crowbar, a gun, food. No, this isnt because I dont trust you. I turned to face Dolly. Her head was turned to the side, slightly downcast, arms crossed in front of her chest. She wore a slim and stylish jacket, belted at the waist, emphasizing her hips. I could almost swear she was frowning, though her face remained in the same neutral expression that all the mannequins wore. If you wanted to hurt me, you had plenty of opportunities. Its not like I had my eyes on you all the time. I dont know what this person is talking about, but they might not trust you. Look, if I get there, and its safe, I can come back and get you. Alright? She didnt say a word. Of course Im going to come back for you! Im not going to just abandon you! Look, Ill call all the time, okay? Ive got your number, Ive got my phone, Ill call you every day. I bent down, picked up one of the heavy jugs full of water, and set it back in the car. I looked up, and Dolly was gone. I frowned, and turned around. She sat in the passenger seat of the jeep. I wasnt exactly going to worry about fuel economy on this trip. Dolly, come on. I really cant. I sighed. Theres a lot I dont know. Like, can you really not move while Im looking? Or is it just an embarrassment thing? I bent down to pick up another set of canned potatoes, and the door slammed. I stood up sharply, and saw Dolly in mid-stride, about twenty feet away. She was very fast when she wanted to be. Dolly! I ran up to her. Her legs were spread apart, arms out sharply at her sides, back hunched, an expression of absolute neutrality on her plastic features. Dolly- Come on. You dont Are you proving a point? She pointedly ignored me. I just want you to be safe. What if it is dangerous where this other person is? What if the mannequins are more dangerous there? What if they hurt you, or what if I couldnt continue the words. What if whats happening around them spreads? It could be dangerous. I turned away from her. I dont know. I dont want to be on bad terms with you when I leave, Dolly. Her hand rested suddenly on my shoulder, very gently, the stiff cold plastic strangely comforting nonetheless. Thanks. Im just not sure whats going to happen, and having you along could be as dangerous as it is helpful. I turned, and gave her a quick kiss on the cheek, and returned to the car. I loaded it, and Dolly helped, my eyes closed as I heard the cans settling in the back. When I finished, I climbed into the front seat, started the engine, and drove. I saw Dolly in the rear view mirror, her arms crossed, her head lowered. Like she expected to never see me again. It wasnt the most cheerful note to leave on. But I had to leave nonetheless. I set down the now familiar roads, on the way to Pennsylvania. As I travelled, the sky darkened. A light rain fell, forcing me to drive slowly to avoid rear-ending someone as I made my way down the road. I flipped my brights on, and appreciated the feeling of simply driving. An audiobook played on the stereo as I drove, my eyes focused forward. I briefly felt tired, and realized that I had no hurries, and stopped to nap by the side of the road. About halfway through the day, on the border between New York and Pennsylvania, I stopped at a gas station to refuel. I frowned when I realized I didnt have money on my card to pay for the pump. I walked into the gas station, and stopped. There were half a dozen mannequins in the gas station. One behind the counter, one standing at the entrance to the mens room. Another four scattered around the aisles. That wasnt so odd. What was odd was the way every one of them had their head turned towards me. Hey. Just passing through, need to get some gas. Dont mind me. I slipped behind the counter, and flipped the switch for the gas pump by my car. When I looked up, the mannequins had crowded around the counter, uncomfortably close, their expressions fixed on me. Uh Hey. I felt a little prickle run down my spine as I walked out of the gas station, keeping my eye on the gas station. I had to look away for a moment when I selected the gas. I went with premium, because frankly, why not. When I looked back up, the door was open, and the mannequins were standing in a small crowd outside. I kept my eye on them, feeling the disquiet growing in my stomach. I began to blink one eye at a time, not giving them a chance to get closer. Look, guys. Im not trying to hurt anyone. Just getting some gas. I coughed. Sorry for stealing it, but, uh I tried to think of something better to say. I was talking to an ominous group of inanimate mannequins. The gas pump let out a soft chunk as the flow stopped, and I placed the nozzle back in its cradle while keeping my eye on the group. Without looking away, I fumbled with the door, opened it, and climbed in the drivers seat, buckling my seatbelt by feel. I reversed out of the gas station, and took off a bit faster than I probably should have. After about a minute, I let out a breath, and reached up, my heart rate finally returning to something normal. I reached up, and adjusted the mirror, realizing I hadnt checked it for a while. A mannequin sat in the seat behind me, an arm reaching out. I let out a completely undignified shriek and hammered the brakes, the mannequin tumbling forward between the chairs and landing awkwardly across the passengers seat. It was holding a phone. I stared at the screen. It was opened to google maps. A destination had been punched in. Sturgis, South Dakota. Christ, I muttered. Scared the hell out of me, there. Sit in the front seat, would you? Its your lucky day, though, Im headed to South Dakota. I reached over, and helped the mannequin into its seat. It took a bit of willpower, but I closed my eyes. The seatbelt clicked, and when I opened them, the mannequin sat quietly in the seat next to me. I started the car again, and began driving once more. Sorry about freaking out on you. Got some ominous news, been a little edgy today You know how it can be, right? I chuckled softly as I started off again. So, Sturgis. Got family there? Visiting someone? I smiled to myself. I admit, Im surprised to find a mannequin looking to go anywhere, let alone hitch-hiking. You always seemed kind of sedentary to me, you know? Mannfred didnt respond, but there was nothing particularly new about that. I nattered on for a while, happy for the conversation. Pennsylvania quickly gave way to Ohio. I stopped for gas, and this time, I locked the doors to the car when I stepped out of it. As the sun set, I noticed the cars stopped on the road had their lights on, making driving somewhat less stressful. Even so, I was beginning to feel tired. I frowned. The encounter in the gas station had shaken me, and I wasnt entirely comfortable with that. I waited until we had gone without seeing any other cars for a few minutes, and pulled off onto the shoulder, lying back in the chair, closing my eyes, and going to sleep. I didnt awaken to find myself being strangled by mannequins, so I was inclined to think that things had gone safely enough. I yawned, as I climbed out of the car, stretching my arms into the air. The air was crisp and clear, but there were dark clouds on the horizon. More rain. I wondered briefly about what Id seen in the e-mail. About the idea that there was more rain. How was that possible? There was a limit to how much it could rain. Was it just raining more frequently, with greater rates of evaporation? Or That was an unsettling thought. The idea that it would rain, more and more. The whole world slowly drowning. Like global warming, but gloomier. Was that even possible? Where would the rain come from? Was it connected to the damn mannequins, or what? Dont suppose you have any answers, do you, Mannfred? I asked, grinning lightly. Mannfred did not. I took out my smartphone, and dialed Dolly. She didnt pick up. I didnt know whether that was because she couldnt, or because she was busy with something else. Both questions raised some very bizarre implications. Hey, Dolly. Its me. You know, the only person in the world who can call you. Uh, trips gone alright so far, had kind of a spooky encounter outside a gas station, Im not sure if it was what this person was talking about, some kind of bad neighborhood, or if Im just getting a little spooked and paranoid. Picked up a hitch-hiker, hes looking to go to South Dakota too, so hes got my back on the trip there. Ill, uh, keep my eye out, make sure that everything looks good. Dont worry about me, everythings going good and smooth here, Im staying away from any big cities and stuff, been keeping moving on the highways. Love you. Uh, that sounds weird when I say it out loud, but Yeah. God, I hope you can open your voice mail. Wish you were here, but, Im glad that youre not. I ended the call, feeling profoundly embarrassed by the way Id rambled on, and then stepped back into the car. Mannfred was leaned back in his chair. He was wearing a hoodie and a pair of jeans, I noticed, and a pair of sneakers. He had a paperback book, some mystery novel, in his hands. Uh Mannfred, this is probably going to be kind of invasive, but I reached out, and slid my hand into the mannequins pocket. Ive been curious about something. I withdrew the mannequins wallet, and flipped it open. There was a drivers license. Jill Nguyen. Well, thats not very helpful, is it? I sighed. I was wondering if theres a connection between the mannequins and the people they were, but Hell, whered you get this wallet? I frowned. Should I call you Jill? The distinctly masculine mannequin didnt say a thing. I shrugged. Well, fair enough. Ill stick with Mannfred to keep the joke going. I frowned down at the card. Hey, you didnt pickpocket this, did you? Its alright if you did. Mannfred had nothing to say about that. This is the way the days went. I would wake up, call Dolly, leave her a message, and then drive. I ate out of the cans in the back of the car, and because I was both a piece of shit and painfully aware that it would never matter, I tossed the cans on the roadside. The world was fundamentally over, a bit of roadside trash one way or the other wouldnt change things now. Then, I drove. Long hours, eating up the miles, stopping only really to eat occasionally, to crap on the side of the road, and to refill on gas. My experiences of the first day, the spooky behavior of the mannequins not being repeated. Part of that may have been the fact that I wasnt taking my eyes off the mannequins anymore. And each night, Id sleep, trusting Mannfred to wake me. Things went like that, fairly calm, until about the fourth night of my trip. I went to sleep, as usual. I woke up to find my arm being shaken, lying in the drivers seat as usual. The moon was full. Bright and silvery. It shone down, lighting the Great Plains highway like the noon sun. I frowned. Mannfreds hand was on my arm. Whats up? I saw his other hand. It was pointing out the window. It took me a second to realize what it was. The silvery moonlight shining down from above was bright, but monochrome, casting everything into sharp relief. It took me a few seconds to recognize the figures in the darkness. Mannequins were gathered. Perhaps a hundred of them, in a large crowd half a mile down the road. I felt my stomach clench as I stared at the group. How long had they been swarming there? How long had I not noticed them approaching? I wasnt entirely sure where the mannequins had come from. I wasnt close to any large city or towns. Had they been getting out of their cars? Moving to approach me? That idea by itself was a bit ominous. I took a deep breath. Mannfred- Wake me up if they get any closer, alright? I closed my eyes, and Mannfred squeezed my shoulder once. I sighed softly, and tried to get back to sleep. I was very, very glad to have someone with me for this trip. Consciousness returned slowly. I was groggy, deep in sleep. The car was shaking, I thought, before I realized it was Mannfred shaking me. I opened my eyes, panic surging. The mannequins were standing in a crowd outside the jeep. There had to be hundreds of them. The most disturbing part, for me, was that none of them were wearing any clothing. Naked, doll-like bodies, no sexual characteristics, just smooth plastic, surrounded me. I tried very hard to keep my eyes on all of them at once, and failed. Each time I turned my head, they had crowded in a little bit closer. I felt the panic gripping me like a fist, and fought it. I started the car, shifting it into gear. I closed my eyes, and when Id opened them, the mannequins had begun to pull back, creating space in front of the car. They recognized their own vulnerability. I drove out of the crowd, watching the rear view mirror as they vanished into the distance behind the car. What was that about? I asked Mannfred, looking over at him. He was shrugging, his hands raised slightly in the air. Shit. God damn it. Im lucky they backed off. Lucky you spotted them. Lucky. Lucky. Cant rely on luck. I checked the phone. Were about two hundred miles from South Dakota. If I drive us straight, we should be able to get there fairly soon. Ill drop you off in Sturgis, then, Ill be on my way again. I stopped the car, and took out the phone, composing an e-mail to countrymatters88. Not much information, just where I was, and that I expected to arrive by that evening. I tried not to let the lack of good sleep, or the nerves, show. But it was scary as hell. I didnt know what was happening, but it didnt fit with anything I knew about how the world was supposed to work. The world had been so peaceful around me. Why were the mannequins suddenly acting so goddamn creepy? I drove into town around sunrise, riding down the off ramp into the main drag. Abandoned franchises sat around. This place looked substantially less well-kept than home. No sign of mannequins out on the streets. I frowned out the window at a McDonald's, whose windows had been broken. Weeds were growing out of cracks in the concrete. The lawns were all dead. You sure you want to be left here, buddy? I asked, softly, before turning my head to Mannfred. He was flashing a thumbs up. If you say so. I stopped the car, looking away. I heard the door open, and close. When I looked back, he was gone. I sighed softly, and began driving again. The town looked rough, and I had the feeling it hadnt always looked this way. I decided I would rather get out of the place, as quickly as possible. Thats probably why I didnt see the caltrops. The cars tire exploded. I gripped the wheel with white knuckles, keeping the car going straight as I slowed down, my heart pounding as the car fishtailed over several dozen feet. I climbed out of the car, and stared. The tires on the left side were a ruin. The roads were littered with half a dozen caltrops- Six railroad spikes, taken from who-knows-where, welded together at the base to create something that looked like nothing so much as a giant jack. It had ruined two of the tires on the car. I had one spare tire. I began to look around for another car, which is when I saw the door of one of the houses was open. A mannequin stood in the doorway. I opened the back of the jeep, and pulled out the gun, and the crowbar. Weapons of last resort. I walked over to the closest car, checked inside. No keys. I looked up, and could see the mannequin had left the house, and was approaching. Two or three more doors were open. It was the slowest chase scene in the world. I walked with the crowbar hooked into my belt, the gun in the back of my pants, holding my phone in such a way that the camera stayed on my back. I walked down the street, checking each car as quickly as I could, and finding no keys. None of them had mannequins in them, either. The camera let me keep an eye on the mannequins, and I was able to outpace them as long as I didnt blink too much. Each time I blinked, they took a few steps forward- as fast as Dolly, then- but I was able to put more distance between us. As long as I kept the camera up. Five miles in, my arm was aching. I sat down, on the road, and turned to face them. The mannequins had gathered into a large crowd. Thirty, forty. More than I could shoot. If I approached them with the crowbar, who knew what would happen? If I took my eyes off them for even a second I had to hope theyd get bored, or tired. Before I grew too tired, or the night fell, and it was too dark to see them. I swallowed, hard, at the thought of that. My arms and legs seemed much less tired with that particular thought floating around in my head. I pushed myself to my feet, and began walking again. Humans have been performing incredible feats of walking endurance for as long as there have been humans. We would race antelopes down. The antelopes were faster, but we had enough endurance, enough intelligence, that we would find them, make them run, watch them tire out, and then do it again. Eventually, they would stop running, or die of a heart attack. Walking through the icy cold air, I could sympathize. Twenty miles into the walk, my bones were aching, my body straining to keep going. The featureless road ahead didnt change. The mannequins, behind me, would occasionally disappear over the horizon for a time. Sooner or later, though, they would reappear, sometimes from oblique angles, coming from the sides, surprising me with how close they had gotten. Making it clear that I wasnt safe. There were no cars here. No sign that the road had seen regular human habitation. No shelter. Nowhere to run. Only the never-ending walk. Around three PM, the sky began to cloud over. Raindrops began to fall, adding to the savage cold of the experience- warmer than the air, but soaking my clothes. South Dakota, at least in the part I was in, was more akin to desert than great plains. The rolling hills were rough on the legs, too. It was 6 PM, when I finally reached the coordinates that I had been given. I was turned towards the mannequins, holding my phone out to keep my eye on them while staring at the coordinates. I was definitely close. But all I could see was featureless, rolling grassland. Enough hills that the mannequins would be able to get closer to me. The sun was hanging on the horizon, the sky growing darker rapidly. I was almost there. I had to be within a few hundred feet of her. But I didnt see any sign of another human being. I felt a little crippling sense of despair in the pit of my stomach. If I never came back, what would happen to Dolly? Was Mannfred okay? My thoughts werent with my neglectful, hateful family who had driven me a thousand miles away for college. My thoughts werent with the people who Id known in school, who Id avoided, who Id hated to be around. They were with a pair of mannequins. Would they still be people if I was gone? If I wasnt there to observe them acting like people? Had they ever been people? Maybe Id just been lying to myself. I felt a strange wave of exhaustion run over me, a weariness with it all. Maybe it would be better if I simply died here, torn apart by mannequins on the side of the road. Maybe itd be better if this all ended. Maybe countrymatters88 had died days ago. They hadnt responded to any of my e-mails. Maybe I was already alone in the world. Maybe Mannfred and Dolly were going to succumb to whatever had happened to these mannequins. I looked up. The closest of the mannequins was perhaps twenty feet away. Naked. I noticed a scar along its side, a burned place in the plastic. What happened to you? I asked, softly. What made you act like this, here? Something in the water? Did someone do this to you? Or is this just what youre like, in the end? I watched silently as the mannequin stood, an arm outstretched. Do you just need a chance, or something? A little trust? I closed my eyes just for a moment. I opened them just as quickly as the mannequins fingers went around my windpipe, squeezing. With my eyes open, it was easy to break the creatures grip, breaking one of its thumbs as I did. Fucker, I growled, my eyes running across the mannequins. I was tempted- so very tempted- to just draw the gun, and shoot every one of them in the head. I didnt, for a few reasons. First, I didnt have enough bullets. Second, I wasnt perfectly convinced that they deserved it. They had attacked me, but I didnt know why. And last If I was honest, I didnt even know if it would help. What if I shot them, and they kept on coming? They didnt have brains, presumably. They didnt have organs. Maybe shooting them wouldnt help. I couldnt think of anything more terrifying than trying, and failing. So I kept going. The sun had set. The darkness was profound. I had my phone out, providing some scant light with the flashlight. It had fifteen percent battery left, after having it on all day. When it ran out, I was going to die. I kept walking through the grass, very possibly in circles, constantly checking around myself, jumping at every rustle, every breeze of the wind. Fourteen percent. I stepped over a barbed wire fence, checking behind me. I couldnt see the mannequins. The moon hadnt risen yet. Or maybe it had, and it was invisible behind the cloud cover. I couldnt see much in the way of stars. I could try turning off the phone, and acclimatizing myself to the darkness. If I thought, for even a moment, that I would survive that. Twelve percent. I turned, and a mannequin was standing there. Perhaps ten feet away, its arms outstretched, almost unbalanced, as though Id caught it in the middle of a rush. I stepped back quickly, breathing hard, my heart pounding, backing off until it vanished in the darkness, turning more rapidly, now, trying to watch in every direction at once. Ten percent. The flashlight shut off, abruptly. Some power saving measure. I struggled with the interface for a second. Then a rustling filled the air. I shoved the phone in my pocket, grabbing the crowbar. I ran, blindly, through the night, holding the crowbar out. I felt a hand grab at my arm, stiff and plastic. I ripped free, and turned to stare into the darkness. The hands did not reappear, and I realized I could see- only the barest outline, a glimmer of light in an infinite black plain- but it was enough to keep me alive, at least for a little bit longer. In the end, I couldnt just lie down and die. I couldnt give up. Every time this nightmare gave me a chance to surrender, a chance to give in and be murdered, I fought against it. I couldnt stand it, the idea of stopping. Mannfred and Dolly were depending on me. They needed me to come back. That was a hugely arrogant thought, that they cared what happened to me, let alone that they couldnt continue without me around. But that was the nature of survival. I was going to keep going. I was going to keep fighting. I wouldnt just lie down and die, like the rest of the world had. I looked up. The gentle glint of mannequins surrounded me. I didnt know how many- Dozens, hundreds maybe. They surrounded me. I took a few steps back, my heart falling into the pit of my stomach. It occurred to me that, at a certain moment, it didnt matter how much guts or determination I had. They couldnt overpower the shit-awful situation I was going to die in. I would die, and never know what had happened to me. I raised the gun, and rested it lightly against my own chin, considering. Was it worse to die that way? To give up hope, in the face of the hopeless? Or would it be worse to find out what the mannequins intended to do to me? It was a hell of a decision to make. I put the gun down. I took the phone out, instead, watching. I dialed the number. It was easy, it was the only number Id called in months. I breathed in, and out, ready for it to go to voicemail. Someone, on the other end, picked up. Dolly? No response. That was natural. Dolly Im sorry. I came out here, and things have gotten bad. Im stuck, and I dont see any chance of getting out of this alive. I closed my left eye, opened it, closed my right eye, opened it. Buying myself time. I was so damn tired. Id walked for so long, so far. Im sorry, Dolly. Im so sorry. I should have stayed there with you. I should have stayed where it was safe, just the two of us. If I could do it all over again- But, shit, I cant. I took a deep breath, and let it out. Im so sorry, Dolly. You were the best thing that ever happened to me. I love you. I closed my eyes. Thats so pathetic, that I loved a mannequin more than any human I ever met. But you were always there for me. Im sorry I didnt just stay there. I let the hand holding the phone drop to my side, and waited for death to come. And waited. Perhaps ten seconds passed, before I frowned, opening my eyes. The mannequins were gathered around me, unchanged since the last time Id opened my eyes. I turned slowly. And the flood lights went on. I screamed, covering my eye, and there was an explosion of sound. The phone was torn from my hand, as a cloaked figure held a rifle, firing shot after shot. I screamed, and screamed, covering myself. Hey. Hey, you can look now. Itd help, for that matter. The persons voice was rusty as an old cast iron gate. Like they hadnt talked at all in the last couple of months. But there were a few things I recognized about it. It was young. It was American, Midwest. It was female. The last woman on earth smiled at me as she pulled off the goggles, blonde hair hanging around her face. She raised the gun, aimed it, and fired again. I turned, and saw another of the mannequins go down, its head pulverized into fragments, its body on the ground, along with a dozen or so others. The rest were all fleeing, stuck in positions of panicked flight. She took her time, gunning them down, one by one, and smiled as she approached me. Patrick, Im guessing? Y-Yeah. Countrymatters? Stacy, she murmured, softly, smiling as she stepped up suddenly to within arms reach of me. She put a hand on the back of my head, and kissed me very suddenly, very hard, her tongue slipping into my mouth. She held me in her embrace for several very long seconds, before finally releasing me, leaving my head spinning, and my heart pounding. She was warm, and she smelled sweet and a little bit musky, and her hair was soft to the touch, and she yielded slightly where she pressed up against me. It was all just a little bit too much to take. Hi, Stacy, I said, and she laughed, though it wasnt remotely funny. Let me show you my place."
40,vulnerability,HFY,When The Gods Come to Visit - Chapter 12,461,cuffwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/cuffwv/when_the_gods_come_to_visit_chapter_12/,2019-08-24 01:30:07,"[Previous](URL &amp;#x200B; News traveled quickly about the vitaskas demise. Such an event was worthy of a celebratory feast, one that would share the spoils of the kill with everyone, as well as commemorating the one who killed it. Once Alvarez found out, she was adamant that there would be no commemoration of her actions, but showed no objections to the feast. Barely an hour had passed before the Plorians started to butcher the carcasses of the vitaska and the belaki. Loading up wagon after wagon of freshly cut meat, leathery hide, vivid feathers, anything of use that the corpses had to offer. Queen IssaKala was overseeing the operation, silently upset at herself that she didnt get to see the massive creature perish before her eyes. Kala, is this not incredible!? IssaVala asked excitedly as a butcher started to carve into the carcass, spilling blue blood all over the ground. No one has successfully hunted a vitaska in over twenty years! Sometimes, IssaKala wished that she shared that same zest for life that her sister had. That simple, carefree nature of hers always served to lift her spirits. It was one of the many things she loved about her. Yes, it certainly is. IssaKala said, still gazing in awe at the size of the creature. Is it me, or is this one bigger than the stories we were told when we were young? Hmm? Bigger? She leaned back, looking down towards the tail end of the creature. Then looked at its limbs. The limbs were as thick as an entire woman. ...Yes. I would say it does appear to be bigger than the stories. That makes it even more amazing! And it was taken down by one person. IssaKala stated while walking around to the head of the beast. The blue stained teeth on the lower jaw were as long as her forearm. The spike Alvarez had drove through its skull remained embedded there. A goddess, yes, but still all by herself. Well, you know the goddesses. IssaVala said as she looked closer at the long, vicious teeth. They control magic more powerful than we can imagine. Yes, of course they do, IssaKala agreed as she gingerly opened the gaping maw of the creature, inspecting its throat. So, the reports were true. There were burn marks on the inside as well as on the outside. She let go of the creatures mouth, letting it snap close as she dusted her hands. They have such powerful magic. But why has Glenn not taught us some of that magic? Or at least, how to forge better weapons, ones made of iron? Better weapons? IssaVala repeated as she was busy inspecting the colorful feathers of the vitaska. Bronze has never let us down yet. Sure it may bend, but it is tough to break and is hard to chip. The Lokrans use iron which, we all know, is inferior. It bends easier and can break under heavy, repeated stress. That is not true, not anymore! IssaKala blurted out suddenly and with such unexpected passion that IssaVala flinched. I talked to the survivors of the recent battle with the Lokrans. They said their iron is better now, stronger and fearsome. Able to cut through leather armor again and again, on the same edge even! That is worrisome, IssaVala commented. There is a reason why we train using all sides of the blade. Yes, I know. You always want to hit your target with the sharpest edge. IssaKala said, reminiscing about her training. It is why we are trained to constantly change how we hit our enemies. But their iron had no such drawback! Really now?. Yes! One of the survivors brought back one of their swords. It was from a barbarian that had felled many Plorians in battle, cutting through their armor. IssaKala gave IssaVala an almost frenzied look, with her eyes widened and her hands clenched into fists. Even after piercing and cutting through our bronze armor, it was still sharp! You could cut yourself along the edge of that cursed blade! Well, while that may be true, we do still have Glenn and the other goddesses. IssaVala said as she helped carry some meat a butcher had carved, moving it to a nearby wagon. Their iron was worthless against their armor. And that is well and good for them, but what about us normal ovathi? IssaKala asked while pointing at chest. We need something to defend ourselves. We need better armor and weapons! I am certain that Glenn will come up with something. IssaVala said while wagging around her dominant head tentacle in a dismissive motion as she moved closer to her sister. I fear it may not be soon enough. The Lokrans already attacked during harvest time, which was unheard of and risky. Who is to say they will not attack again during their winter? Well that is what we are training for, is it not? IssaVala asked somewhat rhetorically. KalEva said that she spoke to some of the survivors, to better learn how the Lokrans defeated us. She has been training us in ways to help counteract their tactics and battle techniques. That is fine for defense, but how are we to ever push back against them? Well we cannot afford to think about offense at this time, IssaVala said seriously. We lack the numbers we used to have. And the training. All we can do is wait, rebuild our forces and resupply with whatever new creations Glenn comes up with. How can you be so apathetic? After those barbarians wiped out our forces and killed our mother and Yai! Do you not want revenge?! Please Kala, it is not like that. IssaVala said, looking up at her sister, a determined look on her face. Sure, I may not have been as close to mother as you were, but I did look up to Yai. She was so understanding and easy to talk to. Even when I shirked my duties, she never scolded me. In fact, I recall her defending my actions to mother, saying that since I was third in line, I should be allowed to do as I please. Yes, but I know it did not prepare me if something should happen to her or to you, but at the time I admired her for defending me. IssaVala said, her eyes slowly growing misty as she reminisced about her older sister. I remember the lessons she taught me about riding corhans, or when she caught me sneaking out late one night to look up at the stars. She always encouraged me to pursue that which interested me, even if it was not politics or the throne. Vala So make no mistake Kala, IssaVala said, a fierce look in her eye as she clenched one of her fists. I hate the Lokrans for taking her away from us. I want to strike back at them as much as you do! But we simply cannot. Not yet. There was a tense moment of silence between the two, only broken by the sounds of cutting flesh and the movement of people around the corpse. I am sorry Vala, I did not mean to say that you did not care. IssaKala said softly. I know you did not, IssaVala responded It is fine. I know the younger me would have loved to strike back and attack without thinking things through. But I have changed, at least a little bit. So I have noticed, IssaKala observed. Something was different about her little sister. Is that from the training you have been doing with KalEva? Has she tamed that free spirit of yours to make you more grounded? I would not have expected my little sister, of all people, to remind me of logic and realism. There is a time for fancy, and a time for seriousness. My encounter with Glenn taught me that. IssaVala said, her free hand absentmindedly moving over her second heart. Do you know that there is no scar? You would never be able to tell just by looking. I remember the day you returned home. You showed us your chest and the clothes you wore. I know some of us did not believe you were even injured in the first place. Yes, I know. But I was injured. The pain I felt that day is still fresh in my mind. And the sight! IssaVala shuddered, closing her eyes as she pressed her firsts to her forehead. Seeing that iron blade sticking out of my chest, stained with my own blood. It haunts my dreams, Kala. I wake up some nights screaming in terror, even after all this time! The memories flooded her mind yet again as she started feverishly muttering to herself. She turned away from her sister as she smacked her head, trying to dispel the thoughts. IssaKala, overwhelmed at her sisters reaction, quickly walked over to her and embraced her. I promise you, Vala, that will never happen again. I will do everything in my power to make sure you and all of Ploria is safe. I already lost a mother and a sister, I refuse to lose another. IssaVala turned towards her sister and buried her face into her chest. I never want to get hurt like that again. Does that make me a coward, Kala? She asked in a soft whisper as she returned the hug, squeezing painfully tight. If IssaKala was in any discomfort, she did not show it. No, it makes you rational. IssaKala said, continuing to hold her sister until she let go first. After several moments, IssaValas grip lessened and the two broke apart. IssaKala looked around at the various workers to see what they were doing. To their credit, they were all diligently focusing on their work, giving the two sisters their space. IssaKala knew that her sister went through an incredibly trying ordeal, at such a young age too. If she could spare her any more pain, she would do so. Right now, there was only one surefire that she knew of. The total elimination of the Lokrans. However, she needed two things to make that happen, equipment and more soldiers. She was slowly getting more people. As for the equipment, she knew who she needed to talk to. \--------------------------- The next day, the Plorians had already cleared out the town square, repurposing it once again from a training ground to an outdoor eating area. Several fire pits were dug, bonfires were created and wooden tables were set up, complete with colorful tablecloths. Several large banners were also raised, all covered in spectacularly bright yellow and purples, both for decoration and to represent the color of the slain vitaska. Dozens of chefs had volunteered to cook, after all, the chance to work with the flesh of one of the most fearsome predators was a rare treat. All this preparation and talk of cooking the meat went largely unnoticed by Glenn. He was rather busy working at a bronzesmith who had agreed to let him borrow the outdoor facilities. She was an experimenter with iron, having already created her version of a bloomery in her yard. The only problem was that she couldnt feed enough air into the furnace to keep it hot enough. This was easily solved by Glenn who hastily created some makeshift bellows. I should have known that you could easily solve the problem, Glenn, BloKoth exclaimed, hands on her hips as Glenn was pumping away. Give yourself some credit. You got this far at least. Glenn said with a smile as he continued pumping. He wasnt exactly sure how long he would have to keep at it, but hopefully it wouldnt be too long. Now what will happen after the iron is heated through, is that it will form a lump of metal combined with lots of other stuff we do not want. We just have to heat that up and work with it until we get what we want. *Wrought* iron. What kind of iron? Oh, iron that has been worked with by hand. Glenn clarified. It was a shame there was no magnetite around. He wouldve loved to start working with that, creating some really nice looking steel. But he supposed he couldnt immediately jump to that, he had to work through iron first. With the iron we get from this process, we can forge some nice tools. Using those tools, we can better work with iron in the future. Tools? What about weapons? BloKoth asked. You know that will be one of the first things people will ask when we say we can work with iron now. No, you do not want to make weapons out of this iron. Glenn said, still steadily pumping air into the bloomery, a light sheen of sweat forming on his brow. You would be better off with bronze. This iron will be too brittle and would break easily if made into weapons. But that makes it great for tools. BloKoth shrugged her shoulders at that, this was all new to her so she would have to take him at his word. She continued watching Glenn work the bellows until a loud horn resounded. Ah, it is time for the feast. Are you coming, Glenn? Vitaska meat is a rarity, a delicacy even. Oh I do not think so. I do have to figure out this iron after all. I have been too lax in inventions lately, Glenn said with a slight nod. Go on and enjoy the feast. I will make sure to take care of things here. Oh and fear not, I will tell you all that I learned. BloKoth smiled and bowed to him in the traditional way before opening the door to leave, almost running right into Queen IssaKala. Oh! My Queen! I did not expect you to be here, She said, bowing to her respectfully. Hello BloKoth, were you on your way to the feast? IssaKala asked as the smith nodded. Then please, go on ahead. I need to speak to Glenn alone. Thank you, your Highness, BloKoth said, bowing once more as she left. Queen IssaKala, Glenn said, straightening up. To what do I owe the pleasure? Glenn, IssaKala said, bowing in the usual manner to him. I came here to see how you were faring. Do you have everything you need? I believe so. Glenn said with a nod. I think I have figured out how to work the iron properly. It will allow me to create some decent tools. ...Tools? IssaKala repeated, doubting she had heard him correctly the first time. Yes, tools. Soon I will make a bigger, better furnace to create even more iron. The new tools will be essential to working with all that iron. Glenn said as he still lightly worked the bellows. But you know that teaching the other *humans* Plorish takes priority. Right now is a day off for them, from my teachings, so I am using the time I have to work on the iron. Why not simply focus on your creations and leave them to learn on their own? IssaKala suggested. It will be much faster if I can teach them. Glenn asserted. Besides, once they can speak on their own, things will improve a lot around here. Renou will teach you better fighting techniques and organization of defenses. Schmidt will be able to discover different uses for plants as he studies them. Alvarez will no doubt aid in defending Ploria as well as...maybe going on hunts? Not sure. Miller will...well I do not know what she will be able to do. She was a *sensor technician* back on the ship...regardless, I am sure she will make herself useful as well. Alright, so say you finish teaching them Plorish and they are getting along alright, IssaKala said, steering the conversation back to the topic of ironworking. Do you think you could create other things out of iron? Such as weapons and armor? Perhaps Glenn hesitated. I would rather create more tools to make your lives easier. And that is a very admirable goal, IssaKala deflected. But I am rather concerned about our safety. I was talking to the survivors of the battle and they mentioned Lokran iron, how it remained sharp with repeated use, and how some of their armor could withstand numerous attempts to pierce it. Really? Glenn said, looking rather surprised. Their armor, it would not happen to be made up of numerous small rings interlocked together, would it? Why...yes. That is correct! Ah, *chainmail*. Glenn said with a grim look on his face. Hmm, they seem to be more advanced in ironworking than I thought. And this iron of theirs...I doubt it is actually pure iron. Pure iron? What do you mean? If you make a sword out of nothing but iron, it will be worse than a bronze sword. It will bend far easier and will not hold an edge as well. I am sure you have heard stories of Lokrans having to straighten out their blades in the middle of battle because they bent so often, yes? Now that you mention it, yes. I have. That is because those weapons were made of pure iron. But, if you do something while working the iron, it changes it from iron into *steel*. I...you lost me. IssaKala admitted. Alright, it is like the difference between copper and bronze. If you make a copper sword, it would be fairly useless, right? Glenn asked while looking up at the queen. When she nodded, he continued. But when you mix it with tin, it becomes bronze. It becomes a much stronger sword. The same holds true for iron and *steel*. Iron by itself is weak, but when mixed with a little bit of *carbon*, like say from burnt plants, it becomes something stronger. *Steel* in this case. I see...so the Lokrans created this *steeyul* and made weapons out of it? IssaKala asked. Not all of them. Achieving the proper mixture is a rare feat, often only happening by chance. Glenn clarified. I would wager that only a choice few actually have *steel*. Really? That is a relief, IssaKala sighed. But even still, some of the survivors said that they saw these *steeyul* weapons cut through bronze cuirasses. If that is true, then I worry for our future if we cannot protect ourselves against their weapons! I agree. Glenn said with a nod. Fear not though, as soon as I make the proper iron tools, I will do what I can to create *steel* weapons and armor. I will certainly teach it to the smiths as well, so long as we have a steady supply. By the sound of it, we will need it sooner rather than later. Yes. We must be able to defend ourselves. Otherwise all of Ploria and everyone in it will be gone. IssaKala said gravely. I want to protect it just as much as you do, I am sure. Yes, of course I want to protect it. Glenn said as he looked all around him at the wonderful buildings carved with intricate designs. You all have been extremely kind and welcoming to me and the other *humans*. It would be wrong of me to not want to defend this place. I am glad we are in agreement. I eagerly await to see what you can come up with. IssaKala said with a clap of her hands. Are you going to come to the feast? I...think I will remain here and continue working with the iron. Glenn said, looking back towards the bloomery. I wish you would reconsider. Vitaska meat is something to be treasured after all, IssaKala said. But if you are adamant, I will leave you to it. With that, IssaKala bowed and took her leave. That was a load off her shoulders. Having been reassured that the creation of better arms and armor was well on the way, the only thing left for IssaKala to worry about was numbers. There was not much she could do to help speed up recruitment. At least not until the god-crop was harvested. She would have to see how much Ikatha, Quikila, and any other interested towns would pay for such a grain. No doubt if they paid enough, that alone could solve the issue. From there, an offensive strike wasnt far off. But as for right now, she had a feast to organize. \-------------------------------------- Glenn was soon all alone, stoking the flames for a few minutes before deciding that was probably long enough. He now just had to wait for the iron to cool down and form the bloom. Then he would have to heat it up again and work it with a hammer to remove any leftover slag to get a more pure iron. It would definitely not be steel, but it was a start. It would also allow him to switch from ceramic tools to iron. He had waited for some time before opening the bloomery to start digging around in the slag, looking to see if the bloom had been created yet. Hard at work again, Glenn? asked a familiar voice behind him. Glenn let out a small yelp and dropped his tongs in surprise. He turned to see KalEva, smiling and wiggling her head tentacles in laughter. KalEva! I am...surprised that you knew I was here. Oh it did not take much to figure out as it was not exactly a secret, KalEva said with a smile on her lips as she leant against the border fence of the smiths yard. I simply asked around and BloKoth told me you were here. Glenn shrugged as he picked up his tongs and continued digging around for the bloom. You know, the feast has already started. I was hoping to see you there. KalEva continued. But lo and behold, here you are working instead. I have been too lazy lately. Busy with translating and teaching Plorish to the other humans Glenn trailed off for a bit as he got a little distracted with something inside the furnace. ...I have been neglecting my duty to continue teaching you things. Come now, Glenn, no one thinks that. KalEva said with a slight huff. You should see how our glasswork has grown! So many different shapes and colors; you reignited the trade! There are more people interested in glassmaking now than ever before. Yes, but- And look at you now. Are you satisfied with what you have done and are resting? Not at all. KalEva said while crossing her arms. After the glass, you continued working, teaching the other humans. Sure you are not teaching things to us Plorians, but you are still busy. And now you are working with iron. And this is all after the creation of the pumps and the planting of the corn. Surely you deserve some sort of respite? I will rest when I am dead. KalEva tilted her head and scratched her temple with a head tentacle at that saying. She had never heard anything like it, but the meaning was clear to her. She quickly hopped the fence and started walking towards him. I am sorry, but that will not do. Come with me to the feast, Glenn. Come with you? Glenn said as he looked up from the furnace, a slight smirk on his face. Is that some sort of general invitation or are you inviting me personally to come with you? The latter. KalEva said with a straight face. The smirk quickly left Glenns face. He had expected her to stumble around at his attempt at teasing. Is that so? he asked as he dug around in the slag some more, trying to hide his blushing face. Yes, it is. KalEva answered again, moving even closer to Glenn. She could feel her second heart fluttering slightly in her chest as she approached. Glenn, do you wish to know the reason I asked you to fight me? I...do admit that I am curious about that, Glenn answered, looking up from the furnace. KalEva noticed that his face was covered in a light sheen of wetness. He had probably dumped water on his face to keep himself cool. After all, it wasnt as if he had head tentacles to help regulate his temperature. Then put down the tongs and talk to me, KalEva said, crossing her arms and lightly drumming her fingers as she waited for him to do so. Glenn sighed and closed off the furnace. He set aside the tongs and stood up, brushing himself off. Alright. Sure. You have my full attention. He said while looking up into her eyes. KalEva took a deep breath, she had expected him to take a little more convincing but here it was. First, let me ask you this. Do you know anything about traditional Plorian women and men, and how they are supposed to act? Glenn shook his head. Well it is traditional for women to be strong, fearless, confident and brave. For the men, they are to be kind, demure, and tender. KalEva explained. It is often the duty of the woman to make the man feel safe and protected, reassuring his fears. It is the duty of the man to make the woman feel appreciated and to raise her children. Glenn was about to open his mouth to say something, only to keep it closed. He wanted to see where she was going with this. When the man has fears, or doubts, it is the duty of the woman to be there for him. To be a pillar of strength that he can rely on. But...the opposite is frowned upon. If a woman expresses fear or doubts, she is looked upon as unwomanly, inviting ridicule from the man. She is said to be lacking in confidence. So often times, women confide in each other, but never to their partners. KalEva continued while Glenn listened attentively. So imagine my surprise when I finally realized that you are not a normal man. Glenn let out snort of sorts, quickly covering his mouth with his fist. I mean, that is fairly obvious, right? I am a *human*\- Not what I meant and you know it. KalEva said, putting her hands on her hips as she glared at him. When he muttered his apologies, she continued. After the fight, I came to the conclusion that you are a very feminine man. In a good way, I assure you. You are brave, willing to listen to my fears, and strong. In fact, with some training, you would be my equal in combat. When Glenn merely tilted his head at her words, KalEva realized she would have to explain herself further. Do you realize how...strange that is? For a man to be equal to a woman in strength? KalEva asked Glenn, her eyes widening in a silent plea, hoping that he understood her. When he nodded, she felt a small sense of relief. By tradition, a Plorian woman is to find a thin, demure, loyal man for her to protect and look after. What does it say about the woman if she finds herself attracted to a strong man who can protect her as much as she can protect him? To say that she fancies him even? What does that say about me? Does that make me less of a woman? I do not know how that would be taken among Plorians, but among *humans,* the answer is no. Glenn said immediately, causing KalEvas eyes to widen slightly in surprise at his answer. Among *humans* such differences between men and women are not so clear. Women can have masculine traits; men can have feminine traits. Does it not get confusing? Completely. Glenn said with a small smile. KalEva looked perplexed at that. She quickly shook her head. Even now, I find myself...showing you my doubts. Something that a woman is never supposed to do around men. I find that to be strange. Glenn said quickly, much to KalEvas surprise. I thought that was the point of relationships. You find out each others fears, hopes, doubts and desires. Sometimes it ends badly and sometimes the relationship comes out stronger for it. If you cannot show vulnerability with someone you fancy, how are they ever supposed to know who you truly are? I...never thought of it that way, but it does make sense. KalEva said, tilting her head slightly as she considered Glenns words. You are far more understanding of all this than I thought you would be. Just like when you understood my fears when I was caught trying to get into your home to see you. I told you how my reputation could be ruined and did you laugh? Did you berate me for showing you my fear? No, you understood and you lied on my behalf all just to save my pride. Much like a woman would. That was only a small thing. It was not such a big deal. It was to me, Glenn, KalEva said softly in a serious tone. It told me so much about you. It told me I could have this kind of conversation with you. That I could fully open myself up to you without fear of being ridiculed. Do you think I could have this kind of conversation with a typical Plorian man? If you could not, then that typical Plorian man is not worthy of you. Glenn stated with such sincerity that KalEva couldnt help but feel flattered. I...how can you be like this? KalEva said, trying to ignore the heat she felt in her cheeks. Be like what? You know what I mean. How can you say such...things with such a straight face? Are you not embarrassed? Why would I feel embarrassed when I speak the truth? Glenn asked while spreading his arms in a shrug. There, y-you did it again! KalEva said pointing her finger directly at Glenns chest. She only lowered her hand when she finally realized that he was not lying or teasing her. He did mean what he said. I am sorry. I...I am not making much sense am I? As Glenn opened his mouth to speak, KalEva hastily interrupted. No, no. Let me continue before I lose my nerve. She took a deep breath and rapidly shook her hands as if she were drying them. Both of those actions did nothing to ease the nervousness she felt deep in her chest. All I know is, the more time we spend together, the more we open up to each other and the more I fancied you. And after the fight we had, I knew you were no traditional Plorian man. I could be myself around you, telling you of my fears and worries and desires without being rejected. The fact that I can talk to you about anything is so...freeing for me that I...I could... She looked down at Glenn who was giving her a very curious look. The light sheen of wetness still on his brow, the color of his skin suggesting to her that he was sick when she knew he was not, that fur on his head and on his face...the strangeness of his appearance shouldve kept her at bay. Yet she could not ignore the loud, rapid beatings in her chest. Only getting louder the more she stared at that insufferable little grin that Glenn loved to give her. With one swift motion, she closed the distance between them. Glenn took a half step back before she pressed her hands against the sides of his head, her fingers sliding into the soft brown fur of his head as they moved to the back. She pulled him towards her as she bent forward and pressed her lips against his, closing her eyes as she did so. Glenns eyes widened a bit in surprise before closing as well, slowly wrapping his arms around her torso as he held onto her, eagerly returning the kiss. Two of her longer head tentacles wrapped around the back of his neck, pulling him ever closer to her in the warm embrace as a smaller one gently pressed against his cheek, sucker side down. After an eternity, or maybe just a moment, KalEva slowly managed to pulled herself away from him. She straightened herself up, her cheeks flushing a violent purple color as she stared into his eyes. She had finally done it, she had crossed a line that could never be taken back. All she could do now was wait to see his reaction. *Wow.* Even though she was quiet, she could barely hear his words over the rapid thumping in her chest. I am surprised you beat me to it. I was actually waiting for the right time to do that to you. You were?! KalEva said with shock on her face, before she laughed. Of course you were. Because you think like a woman. So does that mean...you fancy me? I thought that was fairly obvious. Or did you not notice my attempts to be with you whenever I had free time available? I did notice that, but I thought with the return of your fellow *humans* that you would That I would forget about the brave woman who put her complete trust in me, a total stranger, during the siege? Glenn asked while lightly pushing KalEvas shoulder. That I would forget about all the times you made me laugh or how you consoled me when I thought I was all alone here on Rithia? How you were there for me the whole night I was busy working with Renou on the ship *engine* and comforted me when I worried that I messed something up? I could never forget such things. KalEva could feel her second heart leap in her chest at his words. She couldnt resist as she leaned forward, kissing his forehead softly. Strangely enough, the water that was on his brow was slightly salty. Why was that? There were more pressing matters though. I will have you know...that this has never happened before. An ovathi with a god I mean. Ah, so it is new, uncharted territory for us both. Glenn said with a smirk. Some priestesses may not approve. Who cares about them? Glenn asked rhetorically. I am the god, right? I approve. That should be more than enough. KalEva smirked, then let out a strange, halting chuckle that sounded like some sort of wounded animal, causing Glenn to look at her with no small amount of concern on his face. Ah, sorry. I was trying to laugh like you do. It is so strange and unique how you laugh that I wanted to try it for myself, she said as started to laugh normally, her head tentacles oscillating wildly. I could help you learn how to laugh like I do if you wish. Glenn chuckled. Since it is fairly impossible for me to laugh like you do. I think I would like that. So are you going to ask me properly now? Glenn asked while tilting his head. Ask properly? What do...oh! KalEva clapped her hands as she remembered. Glenn, would you care to accompany me to the feast? I would love to, Glenn said with a smile as he reached forward with one hand, grasping her hand in his as he sidled up beside her. By all means KalEva, let us go together. One thing before we go, She said softly as she looked down at the human. Since we are together now, I would like it if you would stop calling me by my full name. You can simply call me Eva. Sure thing, Eva. Glenn said as KalEvas second heart did a twirl in her chest. Together, KalEva led Glenn through the streets as she headed towards the feast, his head resting against her shoulder as KalEva felt like she was walking on clouds. By the way, how was the kiss? A little prickly, KalEva answered honestly. I was worried about that. I can fix that for next time. Already thinking about next time? KalEva teased with a sly grin. Of course. Glenn teased back, winking at her. There will be a next time, right? Of course. KalEva responded. \------------------------------------------------------ The feast was well underway. Queen IssaKala had her hands full with her duties. She had to organize the feast and games, make sure that everyone could enjoy a meal without having to wait for too long, the normal feast problems. Or at least it wouldve been normal had the feast been for something else other than the first vitaska slain in over twenty years. Nearly everyone in the city showed up, so much so that extra tables had to be set up and down nearby streets as the whole square couldnt accommodate everyone. She was downright grateful that IssaVala was there to aid her. The only thing that seemed off was that neither Alvarez nor Glenn was there. Some of the other humans were already there, stumbling in their attempts at conversation. After some time, she noticed that KalEva left the feast, most likely to convince Glenn to join. After some more time, she was relieved to see KalEva return with Glenn. And with his return, the other humans quickly were able to converse and spread out among the various activities and games that were there. Renou went to the ones testing strength, such as wrestling and stone tossing, Miller and Schmidt went to some dexterity based ones that included archery. IssaKala was glad that the god changed his mind. It would help him see that Ploria was indeed worth protecting, and would drive him to work harder on the iron. She soon turned her focus elsewhere, making sure that some of the brawls did not get too out of hand. KalEva and Glenn had managed to secure a table all to themselves as the games were well underway. KalEva was busy showing off to Glenn. Specifically by tossing small chunks of meat up into the air and catching them in her mouth. Glenn eagerly copied her and the two had a mini contest about who could throw theirs the highest. With the last throw, Glenn tossed his meat incredibly high up, forcing him to stand up to move to catch it. He moved very precisely and carefully, only to have meat land smack in the middle of his face. Both of them laughed at that. KalEva grabbed a spare cloth and wiped his face clean. So, Eva, I am curious. When do you think you started to fancy me? Glenn asked as he started to dig into some thinly sliced and smoked vitaska meat. I would say during the siege is when I think the spark happened. KalEva answered after giving it some thought. Only I did not know it at the time. Want to tell me more? Glenn asked innocently, flashing KalEva that smirk of his. I suppose I have to now. KalEva responded with mock exasperation, giving Glenns shoulder a playful shove as he chuckled. We worked very closely then. Day and night, talking about strategies, you explaining exactly what I was to do and what to say Her voice trailed off as she remembered, her right hand absentmindedly moving to her right ear. Remember when I met with the Lokran Chiefs and how you talked with me with that small device that fit into my ear? I was scared that the Lokrans would not honor the shell of truce. Well it was not as if I was going to let you get hurt or die while I was watching. Glenn said. Exactly! KalEva responded. You kept reassuring me that you were watching closely, that nothing would happen to me. I knew I was safe. And you know how strange it is for a woman to feel protected by a man, right? Glenn nodded. And because it was so strange, you ignored it at the time. Yes. Exactly. KalEva said as Glenn drank from a jug of water, spilling some on his chin. That reminded her of something she wanted to ask him. Now it is your turn to answer one of my questions. Yes? What is it, Eva? Glenn asked with his elbow on the table. He rested his head in his hand as he stared into her eyes. Earlier, at the smith, you had some sort of water on your face. I assume it was something you used to keep yourself cool, since you do not have head tentacles. KalEva said while lightly poking Glenns forehead. Strangely enough, it was salty. Why did you use seawater to keep yourself cool? Glenns face quickly turned pale. That...is uh...that wasthat was not seawater. When KalEva tilted her head in confusion, Glenn felt a chill run down his spine as he tried to explain. Well, when a human gets very warm, they uh...they *sweat*. They...secrete water and salt all over their skin. So when the water hits the air, it cools us down. You...secrete salt water? KalEva said, her own face turning a lighter shade of purple. You...secrete it. And...and I tasted Her whole body shuddered visibly as she hid her face with numerous head tentacles her fist smacking into the table repeatedly. Please, tell me you are teasing. That this is some ill attempt at humor. I...I wish I were teasing. But it is the truth. Glenn said, mortified at the conversation. KalEva took a deep breath and tried to calm down. Obviously Glenn didnt know the implications of the act. That is a very, very intimate thing that I did without even realizing it. Alright. This is alright. This is fine. It is new for both of us. Next time, be sure to be free of this...*sweat*. At least for now. I...will do my best, Eva. Glenn said softly, his face growing only more perplexed when KalEva said it was an intimate act. He had half expected her to be sickened by it. Good. KalEva said with some satisfaction as she moved her hand under the table, reaching for Glenns hand to squeeze it gently. At least one thing is certain, I can always expect something completely unexpected when I am with you. I suppose so, Glenn said, somewhat relieved that KalEva took the whole thing reasonably well. He moved closer to her on the bench just as he felt a light tap on his shoulder. **Continued in Comments**"

PART 93 (SERIES),23,cz8lld,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/cz8lld/oc_legend_the_plot_thickens_part_93_series/,2019-09-04 04:16:40,"[Part 1] (URL [Part 92] (URL --- ELFINVALE, EDGE OF THE INNER WARD FOREST. &amp;nbsp; ""What the fuck was all of that about?!"" Mrazin exclaims, scarcely waiting for the tent flap behind herself to fall shut, so that the security wards would nullify any attempts at eavesdropping, as she asks her question of Theronus' back. Theronus doesn't even pause a step or attempt to reply, however, instead he strides over to his table, one that had a map of Elfinvale and little totems to represent soldiers on it, a cartogtaphy table in grids for conjuring up strategies, and Theronus grips the heavy planks of it by their side before he roars and flips it all upright. Sending the table, and it's contents, scattering about, before Theronus whips around and levels a menacing glare at Mrazin. &amp;nbsp; The look that the Dunrim wore in that moment causes Mrazin to gasp and instinctively flinch, and she backsteps a step in visible horror. See, Mrazin had been outside, right next to Theronus, when he had come under the effects of the Elfin Queens spell. A spell that Mrazin didn't recognize at first, but, the conversation that played out after it, and in the way that it did, it was more than enough for Mrazin to realize what the Queen had done to Theronus, especially now that Mrazin could see Theronus' face. You see, Theronus had quickly fled from the scene earlier once the Elfin Queens spell was over, basically staring at his own feet with his arms around his face as he slogged his way back to the tent hastily, leaving Mrazin and her soldiers chasing after him, and further herself, both; where the soldiers were slinging questions at them angrily, the voices of the Elfins even louder over the rabble, so much so that Mrazin was confident hundreds of them were probably outside their tent, screaming for their attention even now. Possibly even considering storming into it, and after what they had all just witnessed together, Mrazin couldn't blame them if that was their decision in the end. &amp;nbsp; And that was because the gig was up. Her worst fear had been realized, and the Elfin Queen had revealed Theronus deceipt. It didn't take her very long, once the Ascendant Elf started questioning the Elfin Queen, for Mrazin to realize the sword the Ascendant Elf was using was an enchanted item that made those it held contact with speak the truth. Realizing that then, Mrazin had did her best to intervene and call question upon the swords validity, since the Elfin Queen had not dissauded, but instead, had been encouraging any of the individuals present to relay any of their questions that they wanted to ask, so that the Ascendant Elf would then ask it of the Queen while using the sword. It was the first time Mrazin had spoken up, and the attempt to cause suspicion on the sword had ultimately failed miserably. &amp;nbsp; Nearly every Elfin present then had rebutted her questioning of the sword before Queen Anaryah had even spoken, Elfins on their side, in her own army, had all replied that the sword was indeed an powerful truth bearer, more or less, and she got the rundown of the blades history from Queen Anaryah herself shortly after she had asked her own question. Mrazins attempt to shuffle suspicion had, already by then, failed terribly, and by the end of the Elfin Queens narration of the history of the blade, even the Tutnans present were convinced of it. Turns out Inquistor Hai'O and his sword were famous even amongst Tutnan culture, too, apparently. &amp;nbsp; It had only gotten more catastrophic from there out, as well. Once they had established the sword as an legit enchanted artifact, the Elfin Queen had gone on to reveal, without an ounce of shame or embarrassment, that she and the Human, Alshwan, were absolutely not just lovers, but Tethered ones at that, even insinuating that Alshwan himself would be King of the Elfins if he had only chosen to be coronated, yet he had declined for the reasoning that it would make a gulf amongst the Elfin peoples and their culture. Revealing that Alshwan was an alien so casually amongst that tidbit that it would be easy to overlook for those that didn't already know Alshwan was Human. This snippet had flabbergasted Mrazin, the boldness of how she revealed her personal relationship with an Xeno, and Mrazin could scarcely picture the man she knew as Gnaz as the Elfin Queens lover, let alone as a King of Elfin! Thankfully, no one else seemed to catch the part where the Queen had called him an ""Human."" Otherwise the resulting conversations that the Queens admittance had inspired would have likely gone in an entirely different direction. Nonetheless, It had enraged a number of the Elfin present, too, for some of them had only just heard that news. The rumors, of course, had already made the rounds of almost any and all social networks and had reached all manner of ears, thanks to Theronus connections as the real leader of the Dark Guild, a fact the Queen most definitely pointed out a bit later from that, but it was all just rumors for most of the Elfin and Tutnans. And rumors they had remained up until the Queen admitted it while under effect of the sword. &amp;nbsp; It had been strange, then, actually. The Elfin Queen had spent the better part of an hour taking and answering any and all questions the army had shouted out to her, yet, Theronus had remained silent the entire time. Standing there with his arms crossed and smiling, just listening and occasionally chuckling softly, even up to the part where Queen Anaryah had ousted him as the real leader of the Dark Guild. Mrazin could tell that her soldiers dispositions had been steadily changing over the course of those questions during that hour, and she knew without a doubt that the moment where Theronus would be ousted would come, and she had silently spent a good deal of that hour wondering what Theronus would do to avoid it, the steps he would take to prepare for/ how he would avoid that topic coming to light. Yet, in the end, Theronus had only stood there with a smile, and silently watched the Queen while she unraveled all of his plans and strategy. &amp;nbsp; This part, the fact that Theronus just stood by and let it happen, confused Mrazin to no end, even now as she looks at his sweaty and pale face in horror. At first Mrazin had suspected that Theronus had some other back up plans, something that made whether or not he had an army at his back irrelevant, yet, that notion was just too silly. &amp;nbsp; 'If that was the case then why bother rousing the army in the first place at all?' &amp;nbsp; It just didn't make sense, if he could have done it without an army he probably already would have, and more, why risk rousing an army under pretexts when there was potential it could turn on you? Seeing the Queens strength firsthand, and further, the spell she used on him later, Mrazin knew that the Queen alone was strong enough to pose a significant threat to Theronus, and it was apparent to Mrazin that Theronus recognized this fact as well. He had actually even admitted as much in his later conversations with the Queen, but it was written clear as day on his gaunt face even now, his face and appearance having drastically changed from his appearance of shortly, only hours, before. His grey eyes were swollen and raw and the flesh all around his eyes was now suddenly midnight black, as if he had been unable to sleep for years, instead having been up weeping, rubbing at his eyes, at night time instead, and his face and entire body was practically soaking wet from sweat, his cloak and hair all matted and sticking to him; yet his face said clear as day, &amp;nbsp; 'I've underestimated her!' Without him actually having to say it. He was shuddering and tottering now, eyes focusing and unfocusing on Mrazin with lethal intent, though not directed at her particularly. His desire to kill kept hitting in waves, sending chills down her spine, but it was clear Theronus was lost in his own thoughts then, caught up in his own world. Looking as if he was reliving some horrid memory. For Theronus didn't seem to actively clock the fact her presence was even there with him, and this fact both scares and relieves Mrazin a little all at once. &amp;nbsp; It scared Mrazin for a couple of reasons. The fact he had been rendered into such a state by the Elfin Queen, so quickly and so easily, was absolutely terrifying, yet, more terrible was the fact that he was in that state at all. Theronus was already unpredictable and dangerous. He killed their own soldiers seemingly at his own whims, having killed nearly a dozen of her men in the time it took since they had left the Dalkan Plains camp and marched their soldiers here, to Elfinvales inner ward wall. Sure, half of that dozen had only just died earlier when he had cast the spell to break the ward, since the maliciousness that was his mana, unfettered and overbearing in his Mana Zone in that moment, alone had been enough to literally scare them to death, but, the others? Were the remainders accidental, too? No. He had done so on purpose. He had ripped out one of her soldiers throats only the night before, for accidentally spilling wine on his foot, and that was while he was in a relatively good mood. &amp;nbsp; Seeing him so manic and desperate looking now, shuddering and sweaty, unaware of his surroundings and looking inebriated, it was enough for Mrazin to make sure she stayed well out of his arms reach, at the very least, not that it would help much if Theronus did decide to attack her, but Mrazin wanted to make sure she was well away from the powderkeg that was Theronus in this moment, an genocide embedded in flesh and waiting to happen. &amp;nbsp; Mrazin skirts her way around him carefully now, making for a decanter of wine, so that she could calm her own nerves. She keeps one eye trained on Theronus, though, and never exposes her back to him, yet he didn't even bother looking her way, he only stood hugging himself, shuddering and muttering under his breath. So Mrazin doesn't even bother finding a cup, she lifts the whole decanter and gulps down several mouthfuls of the wine, messily spilling it about the floor and herself in the process, and with her eyes still trained on Theronus, she kept chugging as her mind immediately returns back to the Elfin Queen and what had transpired... &amp;nbsp; More importantly, that spell she had cast, one that Mrazin had only just now realized what it had done. After having seen Theronus. &amp;nbsp; Mrazin accidentally chokes on her wine as the realization hits her. 'She took one of his Souls!' The tart liquid gags her and stings heavily on the way out of her nostrils, causing her to heave and hack the fluid up and out of her mouth as she pivots and slams the decanter back on to the drawer that originally held it, sloshing a copious amount of it across the tent wall in the process. &amp;nbsp; She coughs into a forearm, after having freed herself of the decanter, to fight back the urge to vomit now, accidentally smearing a droplet of residual wine directly into one of her, already watering, eyes, when Mrazin realizes she had taken both of her eyes completely off of Theronus. The bloodlust from him hits her at the same time as the kick of fear, from her realization, had pitted itself into her gut, and she whips around and away in a pivot step, to find Theronus had been standing directly behind her already, wild eyed and grinning ear to ear. A twisted thing, abnormal and beyond creepy, the corners of his smile nearly touched his eyes, showing two rows of glistening sharp serrated teeth, and already creepy enough, though, this time Theronus eyes were manic and focused, as opposed to the unfocused obliviousness of before. His grey orbs were now laser beams, heavy and crinkle lidded, matching his smiles creep factor in their presented expressions of scrunched up euphoria. &amp;nbsp; Mrazin couldn't help it upon seeing him. Her body moved before she even thought about it, and she found herself freezing a hand on the way to her dagger when Theronus quips, sing-song and lascivious, ""Mrrrra-Zin! WhErE iS ThE QU-eeeeeN?! Teeheeheehuh-HuDt!"" And as he speaks his head and neck begin to jerk and crackle, and Mrazin realizes in terror that the sharp movements and sounds were Theronus snapping and crunching his own neck, purely with the force of moving it himself. Blood begins to pour, cascading from his smiling mouth, as Theronus continues to giggle and fling his head and neck about, it becoming limp and dangling before being slung in another direction, sounding like someone shuffling a sack of glass chip with each movement, and Mrazin immediately felt herself become sick. &amp;nbsp; Sour wine rushes up from her gut like a dam being released, and she hunches over quickly, hands to knees, spraying a massive puddle of the purple fluid at her feet for several seconds straight. All the while Theronus' warped giggle kept pealing off louder and louder in the background, only stopping occasionally when enunciated over by a particularly loud ""Snap!"", up until Mrazin felt suddenly drunk and sick all at once again, without ever having stopped puking in the first place, and her eyes visibly unfocus on her face as she feels weightless briefly, before she realizes she was about to kiss the floor for blacking out. &amp;nbsp; Even knowing it was coming, her falling and blacking out, Mrazin could do nothing to stop it, and she was perhaps a little grateful for that in that moment, since it meant she no longer had to see Theronus like that. By the time she actually does hit the ground inside the tent, Mrazin was no longer thinking about the look on Theronus face currently. She found herself cast back in time, into her own memories, and she recounted the earlier moments as they had happened in her mind. Beginning with the hour again that the Elfin Queen had spent talking and answering the soldiers questions. &amp;nbsp; In her current mind state, the topics of the conversations that had taken place then had come back choppy and incoherent. Like her mind was drifting and was causing the reel to skip frames, but even when the visuals and audio did line up, the scenes came thick and syrupily, with the buzz of a great horn in her mind. So that all Mrazin was really doing was recalling the Queens appearance and body language at any given prior moment. Watching her microexpressions and reactions to her interrogators. But that alone was enough, for Mrazin could see the regalness that was Queen Anaryah even in her drunken stupor. &amp;nbsp; Anaryah had laughed and smiled freely during those exchanges, when necessary, but Mrazin noticed in hindsight that not a single expression of it was wasted. Her laughing and small smiles were all directly in response to something. A threat or a joke from an solider at her expense, designed to enrage or cause her fear, but, every time it failed on all accounts. Anaryah had calmly stood there and dissected everything that came her way. Breaking it all down into functional basic components. Eventually even the hate that had flowed at her, too, until all that was left was pretty much as they had started it, except the angry soldiers were no longer throwing questions at Queen Anaryah anymore, but at Theronus and Mrazin herself. &amp;nbsp; It was almost impossible, the masterful way the Queen had navigated those pitfalls and precipices. She had told them all, without a single moment of hesitation throughout, all about Alshwan and their relationship, their Tethers, his being crowned, their Concubines and harem, and she had even answered a few questions about the Ascendant Elf, whom was still, in Mrazins mind, interrogating her, about who and what she was. That news, revealing that the female Ascendant Elf before them was the Dragon who had swapped forms during the initiation of the Dragon accords, as per the agreement, that had stunned everyone. Even Theronus, for Mrazin could see the gleaming excitement sparkle in his eye even in her drunken memory of it, but much more had been shared, too. Nothing was off the table, no subject or question too taboo or too secretitive. Anaryah had answered them all, and even though Mrazin still had a hard time picturing Gnaz as the same person the Elfin Queen was speaking of, during, she knew Gnaz well enough to know that the man she knew as Gnaz was just fictitious. A character conjured up from the entity the Queen kept referring to as Alshwan. Mrazin knew that full well, and she could even sense the same sort of calm approach to the world in the Queen that Mrazin had felt and seen in Alshwan. &amp;nbsp; But, there was one glaringly stark difference about their personalities that Mrazin noticed between them. Alshwan himself, at times, had seemed rather cynical when Mrazin had known him. Mrazin wasn't convinced this behaviour was just a motif for the character of Gnaz, either, but rather, Alshwan had seemed jaded and rather opinionable. As if it was his real personality bleeding through into Gnaz. The Elfin Queen had that same air about her, in the sense that she had unerring confidence in herself and her decisions, but, she lacked that pessimistic quality of Alshwans. The Queen spoke and weighed her words in the same loftily weighted fashion, yet, her decisions seemed further out of the box for their lack of a distinguishable background. It was almost impossible for Mrazin to guess what would be going on in the Queens head when she was silent, where, if it was Gnaz, Mrazin would be 90% certain he was likely cracking himself jokes over something or someone silly. The Queen also gave off that same air of danger as Alshwan, though, her ""air"" about her was no less lethal than Alshwans. In fact, in some ways, you kind of know when facing the Elfin Queen that she is powerful, where, Alshwan would surprise you in that regard. Since he was no mage, yet, when facing the Queen, Mrazin knew she was a mage, and though she couldn't quite sense the Queens mana until she used it, and only then could Mrazin see the mana being used by the Queen in that moment only, Mrazin could absolutely feel that the Elfin Queen Anaryah had access to an infinite mana source. &amp;nbsp; That idea just seemed crazy to Mrazin, even in her drunken and passed out state, as no one had access to infinite mana. That wasn't how mana worked, for not even Theronus, an amalgamation of hundreds of spirits souls and mana containers, even he was thoroughly limited to the souls containers inside himself, barring using outside mana sources. But, somehow, even in her memory of it, Mrazin could absolutely feel the infinite expanse of mana around the Queen. It was almost impossible to miss, at least in its presence if not its container capacity. It stuck out around the Queen like a neonsign, or a pothole, only, it wasn't until you looked closer at the neon that you'd realize that the neon isn't neon at all. It is entirely new colors in spectrums that had never even existed before, needing no lights or hardware to glow. Or, the pothole, it seems normal when you first see it, yet, the closer you get to it, you see that the thing is a never-ending sinkhole, one that likely pierced all the way down and out the other side of the planet. The mana around the Queen was a bit like that, obvious in its presence, but, still leaving you scratching your head and wondering about it even after you noticed it. &amp;nbsp; It's only thanks to Mrazin reviewing these memories that she notices this aspect about the Queen now, yet, she also realizes something she had missed entirely before now as well, something that she only pieces together when she notices the wooden staff in Queen Anaryahs hand. Her realization comes in tandem, however, with the realisation that Theronus had already noticed her discovery, that she just now made, well before, back when they both were still face to face with the Queen. Thinking of this, her mind subconsciously pulls that encounter to the forefront of her consciousness and slaps it on play. &amp;nbsp; The time was right after the Queen had caught her Hai'O sword, and further handed it to the Ascendant Elf, who had been a Dragon only moments before. This alone partially explained why Mrazin had not noticed the staff, since her and everyone else present then had watched the Dragon change, but add in the show with the Elfin Queens water dragon spirit weapon/ familiar from just before that, too, and the staff was all but invisible in Mrazins then eyes. It is somewhat ironic for Mrazin, since she is always pondering what's going on in Theronus ' head, thinking him impulsive and foolish most of the time, yet seeing now that he had noticed something she had not about the Queen. Even his questioning of the Queen next reflected that he had already noticed the staff when he says, &amp;nbsp; ""That's quite the collection of rare and precious artifacts you have there! That staff in particular catches my fancy, may I see it?"" But the Queen had responded, &amp;nbsp; ""It probably would seem familiar to someone who has absorbed an seeds essence!"" And Theronus had actually gasped in that moment, stumbling backwards a step as if the words had physically struck him. It had confused Mrazin then, but the memory kept playing, and the Queen had turned a smile to him in that moment, the Ascendant Elf also having already stuck the Inquisitor sword against the Queens bare arm in no wasted movements, Mrazin drunkenly notices now, meaning, if the Queens later description about the Hai'O blade was right, that absolutely everything she said next she believed was the truth, as she had turned to face Theronus and had continued. ""That's right, Dunrim, I already know who and what you are. I don't even need to use this sword on you because it does not matter what you call yourself, whether Theronus or lbrit, because I can see the remnants of it in your vessel. "" Mrazin could see the paranoia flood into Theronus eye for a split second when the Queen had said the name lbrit, but, her attention remains on the Queen, just like herself in the memory, for the Queen made an expression of visible sadness, wordlessly profound sadness etched deeply into her visage, as she had continued to speak. &amp;nbsp; ""It does not matter because it is too late... It's too late to retrieve it from you, to undo the death of millions... Your spirit, vile thing that it is, has already assimilated it, body and all. If only we could have met sooner! "" &amp;nbsp; Mrazin saw the anger in the Queens expressionless face at the end of that sentence, as much in the lack of the expression as opposed to if she had actually looked enraged. Mrazin thought that the Queens lack of anger was far scarier, and she, drunkenly now, wonders exactly the same thing as she had when she first initially witnessed it. Which was how Theronus not only managed to be unscathed by that threat, but had recovered enough already to sarcastically retort, ""Aww! You're envisioning me before having ever met me? How flattering!"" &amp;nbsp; In hindsight, Mrazin had to admit now that it was a wonderfully timed deflection of the narrative, one that Theronus had strategically utilized to avoid a subject he clearly had not wished to speak upon, and one that had ultimately succeeded. For, the Queen ended up going into the history of the sword not long after, after the subject swung that way thanks to the crowd and Mrazin herself, bringing up her question about the sword not long after that. Now that Mrazin found herself face down in a pile of her own wine vomit, with Theronus playing sackball with his own head and still singing in the background, Mrazin had the time to revisit all that had happened and it allowed her to make some new conclusions she hadn't had the time to make before. &amp;nbsp; By the time Mrazin fully rouses, and finds that the world no longer feels like it's spinning beneath her feet, she notices that Theronus singing, and making those awful crunching noises, was no longer present, and she feels convinced that she had stumbled upon some crucial information in her drunken hiatus. So that she calls out for him even before she starts to stand up, asking, ""Theronus?"" Outloud, leaving softly from her sour tasting lips. She arises and brushes herself off, clearing her throat and coughing up some sour sit spit in the process, when Theronus calmly replies. &amp;nbsp; ""Over here."" &amp;nbsp; Mrazin turns to find Theronus sitting at a table and in the middle of the process of casually eating a large steak, equipped with knife, fork, plate, and all. He sits slouched over the table, elbows on it, and looking back at Mrazin, and though there is still blood stains on his clothes, his mouth and face appear clean, and that warped smile and stare was no longer present. Making Theronus look partially returned to normal. Mrazin finds herself reinforcing some of her thoughts about Theronus, and the fact he was somehow still alive, as she approaches the chair opposite Theronus now, while asking for herself, ""Are you back to normal?"" &amp;nbsp; Theronus responds by chuckling, and as Mrazin sits, he stabs a steak off of a platter and drops it on a plate, shoving the whole thing toward her, across the tabletop, as he responds, ""More or less. Are you?"" &amp;nbsp; Mrazin turns a nose up at the food as she sniffs at it at first, and her stomach growls loudly at nearly the same time. Seeing some baked bread and a small pot of veggies present, Mrazin helps herself by adding a portion of both to her plate before she replies sarcastically, ""Never better,"" and she takes her first bite of food. The food was bland tasting but still fairly warm, and it immediately helped with the sour taste stuck in her throat. &amp;nbsp; Theronus nods back at this expressionlessly, though he sets about cutting up his steak, pre-arranging it all into bite-sized portions, and he remains doing this as Mrazin speaks between her own bites. ""We need to talk."" She says, solemn and serious. Theronus, for reply, only arches a grey brow and leans back in his seat slightly, so that Mrazin continues to speak. ""Our soldiers have begun to turn on us, no doubt they are outside right now waiting on confronting us, but, what happened to you? The Elfin Queen took a soul from you, didn't she?"" &amp;nbsp; Theronus grins at this, showing his sharp teeth, before he quickly goes about depositing a morsel of food into his mouth to chew instead. Mrazin visibly becomes annoyed at this, making it clear she didn't think Theronus would respond, and that she didn't appreciate that, but, before she could voice just how little she appreciated it, Theronus speaks up, talking even while having a mouthful of food. ""Yes, that is correct. She did."" &amp;nbsp; Mrazin, in the middle of scowling, freezes with her mouth hung open now as her expression melts away, and Theronus chuckles as he continues. ""What? Thought I'd try to hide it?"" Asks Theronus with a shrug, holding his fork upright, and he chuckles some more before continuing to say, ""Nope, so you're right. We do need to talk, and we need a new plan. I want to make sure this time we are all on the same page, that way nothing unexpected will pop up and affect our goal in the future. "" &amp;nbsp; Mrazin, having re-sorted herself, replies to this with a frown as she says, ""Unexpected?... You call that unexpected?.... That should have been impossible! "" Mrazin drops her knife and fork to her plate with a ""Clank!"" as she eagerly continues. ""You're a Dunrim, Theronus! The strongest one I've ever seen! You have hundreds of subjugated spirits all at your whim and mercy! How exactly did she manage to enter your defenses and take one back from you!? How?! And what do we do now?! Do we even have a plan to move forward?!"" Mrazin hops up from her seat now, sharp enough that she knocks over her chair, and she starts to pace around the edge of the table, using overexagerrated hand movements as she continues to speak. &amp;nbsp; ""I don't know if you noticed or not, Theronus, but our soldiers looked a errant leaf fall away from abandoning us!? They are all probably right outside, right now, awaiting for one of us to come out so that they can confront us! And what do we even say to them then?! The Elfin Queen has already revealed you're the real leader of the Dark Guild! We're finished!"" Mrazin was still, evergrowing, in her getting worked up, but, Theronus only starts to chuckle now, and he uses an arm to usher Mrazin into sitting back down. It doesn't work right away, Mrazin even launching a few more questions at Theronus, but, it quickly became clear that Theronus wasn't going to continue speaking, nor answer any of her questions, until she sat back down. So Mrazin huffs in annoyance a moment later as she sits her chair back up, and she plops herself down into it, where Theronus nods before he goes on to reply. &amp;nbsp; Theronus takes enough time to insert a morsel of food and chew on it for a few bites before he says now, ""I have to admit, Queen Anaryah makes for a far fiercer opponent than I had initially envisioned."" &amp;nbsp; "" Tch! "" Mrazin hisses, cutting him off as she retorts, ""You've severely underestimated her!"" &amp;nbsp; Theronus arches a brow at this and chuckles before he replies, ""No I have not. I've done no such thing. Underestimating someone is something an ego does when having detailed knowledge of their opposition, yet, I had no clue the Elfin Queen would come here alone, without her army. In our suppositions, we had expected either Alshwan himself to appear or the Elfin Army, perhaps, with the Elfin Queen in tow. It is not underestimation when our thoughts are proven entirely wrong."" &amp;nbsp; ""Tch! What does that even matter!?"" Asks Mrazin now in annoyance, but she picks up her fork and steals another morsel of steak quickly before she drops the fork again, where she speaks around the bite now, chewing while saying, ""Whether we thought she would show up or not is irrelevant to the fact that she alone is powerful enough to hurt you! Neither of us had expected that!"" &amp;nbsp; ""And I'm telling you that that is where you're wrong, girl. I have never been unaware of the danger the Elfin Queen represents, even before seeing her again today. I can honestly say that I am surprised at her power, however, it is still not underestimation, for, her strength is indeed quite within the parameters I had suspected... Though, with her artifacts, she is top tier on the power chart I had layed out for her... Probably firmly in the top 1% of it, actually."" Theronus says with a grin, and Mrazin can't help but ask now, &amp;nbsp; ""You've met her before? Is that why she called you lbrit? You two know each other?"" &amp;nbsp; Theronus is still smiling, a small fondness about his lips and eyes, making him look almost vulnerable to Mrazin, as he replies, ""In a way, though, I did not think she too would remember me... "" His smile draws taught for a second, giving the vulnerability in his expression even more tangibility, as he continues, ""I should have known she could feel the afterimage of the seed!"" Theronus taps a long fingernail at his plate, enunciating his further words of, ""If I underestimated her in anything, it would be that!"" with the ""Clicks!"" of his nails, and at Mrazins resultant expression of interest, where she arches a thin brown brow over a mocha almond eye, locking her gaze level with Theronus', he speaks up once more, further iterating. &amp;nbsp; ""I am a Dunrim, as you know, an amalgamation of spirits shoved into one container. One vessel. Most Dunrim, to even be considered a Dunrim, need a minimum of two extra souls cohabitating a vessel with them, whether they are under your control or have reached a platonic state is irrelevant, so long as there are at least 3 pre-existing spirits in one container. One organic vessel, for, forced eternal slumber in a gem or artifact is not so different in practice, but Dunrims only exist in possessing an organic body. A sentient and sapient life. That is a Dunrim. Depending on which spirit, internal to the Dunrim, takes charge of a Dunrims vessel; certain physical and non-physical characteristics and attributes unique to that individual may express themselves in/ on the Dunrims vessel versus where prior it was all culminated into the Dunrims sum total of knowledge. "" &amp;nbsp; Mrazin, still watching and listening to Theronus carefully, lowers a brow as she asks now, ""You mean like the way your face changed before? When you were spasming out and trying to handlessly wring your own head free of your own neck?"" &amp;nbsp; Theronus happily chuckles and hums as he deposits a morsel of steak into his mouth again, and says, ""Yes, exactly like that!"" And he quickly chews it, loudly at that, before he gulps it down and hastily continues. ""A Dunrim' knowdlege, memories, strength, mana capacity, affinities, everything, it's all directly proportionate in size to the amount of spirits the Dunrim possess. This is because it is all tallied and levied accordingly, the whole becoming a sum of the individual proportions it intakes. When I add a new spirit to my collection now, not only do I take their container size and apply it to my own, but I also take everything about that person. Their knowledge, their memories, their wants, their desires, all of it is mine. Only their bodies remain, in some cases, where one was present to begin with, in nothing but a empty husk. However, as a Dunrim, I could take that too, if I wished, but there is usually no point. Once I have the spirit in me, and under my control, I can shape my appearance according to their own memories, if I so wished it, but what it truly becomes is a game to see how long before they crack, and, with the more spirits internal to a Dunrim, and under its control already, the easier this game is."" Theronus pauses long enough to feed himself another fork full, where Mrazin had once again started eating, currently chewing a large helping and watching Theronus, before he keeps talking. &amp;nbsp; ""Mob mentality is a very real thing, and actually quite easy to steer if you know what to expect. The reason Dunrims are so few, though, is because it is exceedingly hard to reach this point. There are no step by step guides for Dunrim, no manuals at colleges telling you how to subjugate souls, not because this type of Magicka is illegal in Tutnan and Elfin society, but because there simply is no such thing. It is most definitely illegal, but that would only mean there's an demand for it, yet there are no books dealing with this subject for a Dunrim, have you noticed?"" Theronus asks, and when Mrazin cocks an brow over a bite of bread, Theronus continues. &amp;nbsp; "" That's because any guidelines given would be complete bullshit, and any mage worth their weight in mana stone already knows this fact. Any books written about the subject would automatically have to take the stance of assuming their audience was ignorant to be able to write it, and therefore even if any such publications existed, the material within it would immediately already be as useless as a paperweight, since any one who actually picked that book up, let alone read it, likely wouldn't know their left hand from their right hand. "" Mrazin chuckles at this, it made funny for the fact Theronus was absolutely serious, but Theronus once again continues. &amp;nbsp; ""That's because there are no clear cut paths to victory in soul subjugation. The end goal is always the same, a Dunrim, ideally, wishes to consume an individual, adopting their mana and knowledge and having done so in a way that provides the least amount of interference from the souls consciousness in the future, yet, that's not how it usually works. The individuals present make all the difference. An persons willpower, stubbornness, ego, all of it makes a difference, and even if you were successful in subjugating one, there is never any guarantees that the knowledge you used to do so will even be relevant in your next encounter, let alone it providing any useful assistance. What worked on one person likely won't even phase the next one, plus, there's the issue that if you fuck it up, and initiate a merger with a soul more powerful, in some hidden aspect unaware to you, then the soul you were trying to subjugate could then turn around and subjugate you, instead. This isn't just a one time risk, either, it could be long term, too. A soul within a Dunrim, one they thought long since subjugated, could suddenly one day have a change of heart and cause an abundance of problems for their vessel. Things like that happen all the time! "" &amp;nbsp; Mrazin, inbetween bites currently, pauses a fork full of veggies out front of her mouth as she remarks, ""I wish I had something sarcastic to say, but, honestly, that just sounds terrible. Why would anyone ever want to be a Dunrim? I would go insane if I had to share my head with one other person, let alone several."" And Theronus genuinely chuckles first, before he replies. &amp;nbsp; CONTINUED IN COMMENTS"

As the Terrorns say: *What bullshit is this!?* Don't get me started on him! *Ni?* I'm not speaking ill of my husband, I'm speaking ill of his decisions and break in protocol. As I told him that It's been 3 fucking days, Moe! 3 fucking days where you've been on that ship in dock. 3 fucking days of watching my mate from the command room when I want to smell you you! Not to mention the week that he was on Terrorn's surface! I don't care for the Terrorn *Ketama* about needing 3 days for  what's the Terrorn word?

Listen; When you leave my service and get your own mate, dear sister, you will understand how you come to miss his smell. My sense of smell, hearing and feelings of vulnerability are further heightened by the pregnancy. I admit that I feel insecure about my figure; I had to loosen my sash to accommodate the rapidly-growing Kittens. You better believe that I was hurt that Moe spoke down to me like I was a kitten! First the misunderstanding about the drugs, and now this... bringing up my past mistakes to shame me into silence! I told him Don't give me misunderstandings! I am *Ojo* of Clan *Machibuse* by birth, and Ojo of Clan *Hitogoroshi-* Because I bit your ear, and claimed you. He stated bluntly. Clan *Hitogoroshi* are mine via right of Conquest.

I feel Admiration as he leads the Terrorn Clan *Crusaders* and his Nekona Clans *Hitogoroshi and Machibuse.* Most importantly *I feel safe when he holds me in his arms and I can smell him.* I told him that before asking Do your Terrorns expect me to swallow that *ketama?* That damn Terrorn smirked at me *like he won* as he said You said an *Ojo doesn't swallow*... *Hairballs,* NOT *that* I had to correct that mating-focused trail of thought. I saw no cleaning going on! I had just poured my heart out, and he has to make a joke about that? It had been 10 days since he left. The antimicrobial wash needs time to work, as does the air filtration unit. Moe said the same *Ketama* as the doctors. I don't want to make you or the kittens sick, so you are going to have to wait a few more hours. As Ojo of the *Machibuse* and *Hitogoroshi-* Nekona, I demand that you come out now! I told him bluntly. Katrina won't let me have any Ethanol-drinks! I am your *Shogun*, The *Terrorn Grand-Master*, and your husband. Moe said coldly. Your thoughts on the matter are unsolicited, wife.

43,vulnerability,HFY,[Orange] conclusion,22,cdi23d,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/cdi23d/orange_conclusion/,2019-07-16 00:21:37,"We kept Beatrice in the dark about our progress in organizing the global resistance. The biggest hurdle had always been convincing people that such a reptilian race even existed. Now the world finally knew we were at war with an unseen, but very real adversary. Once the international activist organizations mirroring us were supported by their respective governments, our message was accepted by an expanding number of citizens worldwide. At that point, the word was out and there was no suppressing it. We had performed our sworn duty. Phase one was nearing completion. It didnt matter about maintaining our secrecy as much anymore but we still feared their vengeful wrath and retaliation. The Lemurians were lashing out wildly. They werent even trying to hide their violent actions anymore. Raids on major ISPs were their last-ditch efforts to stop the message from gaining even more momentum. The US military began protecting high profile targets and managed to foil several planned attacks. It was a very encouraging sign of things to come. I prodded our verified inner-circle members on how such a radically different looking enemy species could get around, so stealthily. All the while, they kept completely hidden from sight when they didnt want to be found. There was no way bipedal reptiles like them could blend-in to ordinary crowds of human beings. Either they were being assisted by a network of human supporters, or they had secret places to hide, all over the earth. We had to consider both possibilities. None of the enemy interrogations yielded a satisfactory answer to that pertinent question. Possibly because the embedded spies didnt actually know where the Lemurians dwelled. If true, it was withheld from them for security reasons. They had to assume that one day the network of spies would be compromised. The easiest way to avoid detection was to prevent any humans; no matter how sympathetic to their secret, from knowing. One of the many invaluable assets of being believed by a large cross-section of the global population, was that we had access to a stellar group of scientists! (Many of which had probably thought we were mad, only a month before). I asked this amazing team of learned people to concentrate on the possible logistics of how the Lemurians could move about so easily among us. Always without detection. In very short order, a scientist from the University of Milan offered an astute theory. Nearly all temperate parts of the Earth have large systems of caves. These subterranean passages could easily offer shelter, security, and an endless labyrinth of places to avoid detection by mankind. It might help to explain how such an alien race of creatures could show up and retreat with such ease. I was dumbfounded. Dr. Ferreras comment was absolutely brilliant. A noted geologist on our team created a topographical overlay of known attack sites and existing caves. It was nearly an identical match! Why hadnt we thought of that possibility before? It made perfect sense. As soon as an assault was carried out, the Lemurian army could simply retreat to a nearby cave. I shared our theory and the corresponding data with the other vetted countries in the network. It wasnt conclusive proof by any means, but it was certainly worth investigating. A hand-picked team of biologists examined the mouth of the nearest cave system to WRZB studios for evidence of a reptilian residency. Data was collected which strongly corroborated the working theory. We didnt dare enter the cave to confirm our suspicions; for fear of tipping them off. Instead we set up infrared surveillance cameras to monitor the area from our remote location. The first couple nights were a bust but on the third night, they made an appearance outside the entrance. It was exactly the evidence we needed to formulate a massive extermination plan. Coordinating such an effort was going to be the greatest logistical challenge. If we were to dynamite that particular cave, news would travel to the other cells and we would lose the invaluable element of surprise. It had to be a global effort and perfectly timed. It was probably wishful thinking or naive to believe we could get all of them in one coordinated offense but it was our first chance to turn the tables. We had to capitalize on their intrinsic weaknesses and vulnerability. Even if some escaped and regrouped, it was all about the battle of attrition and the numbers. We would be ruthless in hunting down any that escaped Operation Collapse. Convincing the authorities of over 80 countries to dynamite their caves shut was quite a tall order. After all, we only had proof of a single cave in the US inhabited by them. The rest was hunch and conjecture. It was a lot to ask purely on faith but it was too risky to obtain verification. Our organization had a lot of credibility in the international stage after uncovering the Lemurian scourge but we didnt exactly command NATO. We still had to convince leaders of those sovereign nations to join Operation Collapse. Our undeniable evidence of the Lemurian conspiracy to create havoc and chaos delivered a huge blow to them. Almost overnight, peace treaties were struck by once bitter enemies. Once the Lemurian spies were uncovered and arrested worldwide, it became obvious who the real enemies of peace were. That made it easier to coordinate our plans because there werent agents actively working against us anymore. Our incredibly ambitious plan was to orchestrate a simultaneous cave collapse initiative across the world. Through controlled demolitions from our partner nations where spies had been uncovered, we hoped to entomb as many of them as possible inside the interior chambers of their corresponding local caves. Once buried under thousands of tons of rocks, the Lemurian race would hopefully be crushed or suffocate. In honor of the brave individual who made the whole startling discovery possible, we agreed upon Darcys September fifth birthday as the date of the operation. The ironic time would be 10:31 PM, Eastern Standard Time. It was a fitting symbol of her sacrifice. While heavily involved in planning last minute details of the operation, I tried to make as much time for my daughter, as possible. She sent word through our babysitter that she needed to tell me something important. I sought to keep our living quarters and the official headquarters separate so shed have some semblance of normalcy. She was already freaked out about numerous strangers being in our home. On the rare occasions she felt the courage to leave the security of her room, I went out of my way to give her the attention she needed. Regardless of my intentions and diligence, I wasnt at all prepared for what came next. Her chilling words shook me to the core. Mama, they want to discuss peace terms."

The lights in the medical bay were not harsh. Gentle points of mysterious illumination on the ceiling cast everything around her with a faint blue tint, but she still had to blink away a faint sting of photosensitivity. Jumbled thoughts collided like confused birds trapped in her skull. She fought to piece together what felt like vital information from half remembered dreams. The developing headache not helping matters. Paralyzed by her own confusion, it was several seconds of dazed blinking before what should have been obvious occurred to her. The lights were stinging her eyes? How? Groaning like a hundred year old lady, she leaned forward to take stock of herself and her surroundings. Her uniform was broken. The fabric was all in place, but the sigils had been disturbed and shattered but an unknown force. She was without her defences. An alien feeling of nakedness came down upon her. Totally different to the vulnerability she felt when staring down a lost one. She was exposed to the world now. Anything could harm her. She could swear she felt her skin bristle at that moment. As if a cool breeze had touched her skin and teased her own fragility. She felt the goosebumps rise up everywhere except... &amp;#x200B; Sarah took a deep breath in preparation for what she knew was coming. She had woken covered in a silky blanket, it looked blue but that might have just been the lights. The shape of her body was clearly outlined underneath it, making clear the notable depression next to her right leg Bracing herself, she lifted the blanket away gently, as if afraid to wake a sleeping animal beneath it. A white bandage, wrapped with mathematical precision covered the stump of her missing left leg. There were, she noted with small relief, no signs of the creeping blackness. She had been saved from becoming something horrible. But the cost of that rescue was laid out before her. Sarah could swear she could still feel it. Her senses throwing up sensations where there should be none as if she could make the wound go away by simply denying it. She almost felt like she could wiggle the toes that werent there. She lay back down, breathing heavily and staring blank eyed at the ceiling. A spidery machine with metal limbs tipped in inexplicable instruments hung dormant over the bed she lay in like a mobile over a babys cot. She let herself focus on it, trying to puzzle out the purpose of each nook and cranny on the complex device and how it might have worked on her. Was that the one that had performed the amputation? Removing the infected tissue? Alva had told her the removed limb had been destroyed quite thoroughly. The corruption it now carried was an unacceptable risk. Sarah didnt think she would want to see it even if it wasnt so. &amp;#x200B; She had to blink back tears. An inexplicable feeling of loss was creeping down on her. AAlva? \[Yes Sarah?\] The synthesised voice was deliberately gentle, a mathematically perfect bedside manner. Can Can my leg be can it be grown back? A laughable question on the surface, but with the ultimagus, with Alvas help... \[Im sorry Sarah. While I do possess the necessary equipment to regrow missing limbs, void corruption causes damage that can never be restored to a perfect state I have prepared a prosthetic to your specifications.\] Sarah rubbed a grubby sleeve across her eyes, angrily trying to clear her wavering vision. Bring it out. \[At once Sarah\] &amp;#x200B; For an entire year, the only times Sarah had been without ultimagus protection had been when she was bathing or sleeping, and sleeping was done in the dark. For that entire stretch of time, all light entering her eyes had been filtered. Everything above a certain threshold cut off to prevent even the slightest potential of short or long term damage. The lights here were gentle, Alva had probably already considered the effect the sudden loss of protection would have. She thought of everything after all. Sarah could only imagine how much worse it would be if she had awoken in sunlight. She swung her legs old and new, off the side of the bed very slowly, not trusting her new leg to not simply fly off her body like the weakly attached weight it felt like. She knew it wouldnt happen. Alva had explained in depth that the prosthetic was essentially a near perfect artificial replica of the limb it replaced. Woven cords and magicrafted plastics replaced muscle and bone, the skin was plain white in colour and slightly shiny. Disquieting vibrations travelled up through her flesh as the tiny motors in the foot made a thousand tiny adjustments on the fly. She rested the false foot on the cool floor of the medical bay slowly, her remaining foot joining it a second later. \[Make sure to move slowly Sarah. The prosthetic will adapt to your balance changes and respond to micro stimuli in your calf, so you should have no problems balancing, but it will still feel odd. You may feel a sense of nausea when you stand.\] It was daunting. Sarah took a breath. She would not falter here, after all she had been through. She *would not* let this of all things be the thing that stopped her. She pushed forward off the bed, feeling more trepidation than when she had first launched herself from the edge of the city to truly test her newly acquired ability to fly. Dizziness struck her at once, her mind bizarrely brought for a moment to Charlottes skytag field and the sensation of vertigo acquired from standing atop one of the highest stakes. She swayed as she stood, hands outstretched and eyes rolling back. Then once again, she was standing on two legs. She took a step, pushing through the unnerving feeling of the leg writhing with every adjustment it made. Slowly, she felt the clumsiness slip away as she learned to trust it more. \[Well done Sarah, you are mastering the prosthetic very quickly. There is an old recreation room in the lower decks where you can practice movement more, I can guide you to it.\] Before that Sarah picked at her ruined uniform with a frown. Can you synthesise ultimagus uniforms? Like the one I was wearing? \[All the ultimagus uniforms are made aboard this ship Sarah, you can *only* synthesise them here.\] Alva was supposed to be a machine. By her own admission, a ludicrously complex machine, but still incapable of emotion. Yet Sarah could swear she heard a hint of pride in her last statement. \[Shall I manufacture a new outfit for you? I can make it to the exact specifications of the one you entered wearing.\] No For the first time since waking up, a slight grin split Sarahs face. I have some new ideas Id like to try &amp;#x200B; --- &amp;#x200B; Talos was confused, he didnt know what was going on. Talos was frightened, he had witnessed lost ones gathering in impossible numbers, a friend lose her leg, a fight he barely understood. Talos didnt quite know how to feel. And when he didnt know how to feel, he came here. For someone so obsessed with magical tools and their production, most would assume that his getaway spot would be down on the industrial layer. Somewhere the complex methods of engineering could be witnessed in their full glory. Or perhaps the science layer where the latest tech was being developed. But it was the greenhouse that truly let Talos feel at ease. The biggest single structure on the city, the greenhouse ran up and down all three rings, clinging to their outside as if it had been made separately and clipped onto the city like some gigantic accessory. And perhaps thats how it was added to the city in the first place? Talos would have to look it up sometime. At the base, sitting in the industrial layer was where the greenhouse bulged out to its biggest. It covered a wide area and provided all the fertile farmland and orchids where the city could grow fruit, vegetables and grain, as well as pastures for the livestock. Above that, the greenhouse became more tubular. A cylinder running all the way up to the top of the experimental layer, separated into segments. Just above the farm was where the temperature was lowest. A sealed compartment providing an environment for the plants that thrived in below zero weather. Above it, the chambers increased in temperature with every segment until the highest, an artificially maintained desert with blazing air. Simulating one of Captonia's zones where highly adapted life could just barely still survive. Within these sealed environments were samples of every kind of plantlife the ultimagi had ever found on Captonia. Arctic lilies that bloomed once every five years and looked like living crystals at the lower levels. Aggressive jungle fauna that sent out probing vines to ensnare and strangle passing animals for nutrients in the centre. Bizarre desert cacti with needles sharper than anything humans could make without magic and water retaining skin that was harder than iron at the top. It was all there, a garden of plants, trees and a vast collection of the insects and animals vital for their life cycle living and growing in magically controlled environments. A team of ultimagus botanists, known to be some of the most eccentric individuals on the city, kept the entire thing going. They maintained the sigils, studied the specimens for new biological revelations and fascinating information, published their findings on books for the network, and frequently left the city on expeditions to find new and exotic plant life for the city. &amp;#x200B; Talos was no botanist. He didnt know his high arctic shard flower from his South Divadan Sheridan fern. But he found something about being surrounded by nature, by the sounds of animals, insects and running water, extremely calming. He originally came here to study the impressive feat of engineering that was the artificial environment system. The greenhouse had more magic running through it than probably any other part of the entire city that most of the residents knew of anyway. The enchantments that kept everything from air pressure and moisture to temperature and even the gravity at particular levels to provide the ideal growing areas were seemingly limitless. Even the soil was rich with magical effects coursing through it, most of which Talos couldnt even hope to recognise. He smiled to think of how much he still had to learn. He loved that about the city, where others found frustration at the seemingly never ending line of unknowns, Talos saw territory to be conquered, it was that which drove him to the greenhouse. And after all this time it had become his place of peace. &amp;#x200B; He was on one of the mid levels, a more moderate strata both in its contents and its atmosphere. There was a beehive located a stones throw away in one direction, responsible for pollinating the rainbow of exotic flowers that crowded the wide space. A month ago, he had tested a simple, but useful little invention of his he had made with help and guidance from his tutors. A mobile chair. A simple metallic bar with interwoven spellcraft. When activated, it arrested surrounding air molecules within a very specific space, a space in the shape of a seat. The result was a mostly invisible chair that could be deactivated and placed in your pocket. It was somewhat uncomfortable, and there were almost certainly superior versions made by older ultimagi, but this was Taloss. He made it, he used it. &amp;#x200B; Crunching footsteps on the gravel path that ran between the orchids announced the presence of a visitor. Talos twisted in his chair to see his girlfriend approaching. Hey. Alley stopped right beside where he was sitting, inspiring a moment of panic as Talos realised he only had the one seat. Knew Id find you here. She flopped down onto the dirt, lying on her back with a tired sigh. Talos collapsed his chair and lay down next to her, waiting for her to speak. So She started. What do we do now?"
45,vulnerability,HFY,"Grand Design, Part 43",146,bzrjpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/bzrjpl/grand_design_part_43/,2019-06-12 23:57:21,"[First](URL | [Previous](URL Jesri glared defiantly back at Trelir, batting his outstretched hand away. You think you can?, she growled. Her words seemed to echo back behind her into infinite space, resonating and building within the network of linked consciousness. It stretched wide, encompassing the whole of the shell around Apollyons star and, behind it, deep into the inky black of hyperspace. Tiny motes drifted around the inside of the shell. Some burned bright with connections to the Gestalt and others remained dim, foreign. Anja, she realized, and the Emissaries closing on her position. She felt questing tendrils of her network reach out to investigate the Emissaries, trying to worm their way inside. Her minds eye saw others taking their positions in networks adjacent to the simulated universe, fortifying data nodes against the Gestalts relentless assault and preparing to strike outward. On every front they were met with meticulously laid defenses and swift counterstrikes - the true Confluence, vast and ancient, stirring itself to meet them. I do not speculate, Trelir replied archly. I know. He paced back around the table and slid out the chair opposite her, sitting and drumming his fingers against the hard surface. The solution space we are in now is quite limited, he said, and I doubt very much that you have any more surprises in store. This is the peak of your trajectory, Jesri Tam. You should be proud to have risen so far, it is truly a monumental achievement for you and your kind. He leaned back and steepled his fingers. However, you will rise no further. You will die here, and the experience of watching your brief, futile efforts to survive will enrich the Confluence. We will take your memory with us to our eternal existence. Content yourself with this - only a few earn the distinction of such notability. Trelirs words rippled through her ears back into the network and were rejected almost immediately, the violent consensus twitching Jesris lips into a smile. Yeah, no, she drawled, sitting down in the near chair. You cant expect us to just roll over and die. We have more of a chance now than weve ever had. But you *dont*, he said, making an exasperated gesture. You had no chance of victory. Not a small chance, not an improbable sliver of hope, *zero*. Multiply that by your recent growth and we get *still zero*. Please dont tell me that despite all of your newfound ability you remain unable to do simple math. Jesri shrugged, leaning back. Its true that none of us knows our path forward, but speaking on behalf of the group, she said, lacing her fingers behind her head relaxedly, weve got a pretty good feeling about this. Spare me further talk of your feelings, Trelir sighed. Fine, if you insist on wasting everyones time and resources we can continue our little contest. He placed his hand on the table, then drew it back. Not Go, this time. That game is expansive, rich with possibility and endless combinations. This situation calls for something a bit more limited, more savage. Something with an appropriate victory condition. Suddenly the Go board was gone, replaced by a simple eight-by-eight grid. Marble and onyx chessmen sat in neat rows, with Jesri as white. She picked up the queen and studied it, then replaced it and moved a pawn forward in a standard opening. --- The *Grand Design* shuddered under the strain as it swung in a quick pivot before firing its engines full-bore, lumbering through a series of maneuvers better suited for a small fighter than a kilometer-long cruiser. Their shifting inertia was briefly too much for the ships gravity to bear, and Anja gripped her armrests tightly as the brutal acceleration slammed her back in her seat. I dont think the ship is supposed to make that noise, David observed nervously. Can you guys hear that too, or is it just my connection acting up? The readings from the inertial compensation- Not your imagination, Anja said through gritted teeth, hauling herself forward to the targeting console once more. They seem to have forgotten how to shoot straight, but there are more of them now. Dodging remains a challenge. The ovoid shape of an Emissary sat squarely in the middle of their lower firing arc, and she sent another barrage of fire screaming their way before the ship bucked once more to dodge its counterblow. Ripples of distorted space streaked across their bow, tearing sheets of hull plating from the exterior as they passed. Rhuar!, Anja said crossly. That one caused some damage. He shot her an exasperated look. Fuckin-, he grunted, tensing as the ship rolled unsteadily into another hard pivot. Damage them back, then! If I dodge any harder than this well snap right the fuck in half. This ship was made by *Terran engineers*, ensign, Anja retorted, shouting over the roar of another barrage from the railguns. We will fail long before it does. We might just, Rhuar muttered, bracing himself against the deck. His muscles strained, and the engines spoke in concert with the howling guns. --- How blas, Trelir sighed, placing a pawn and slumping back in his chair discontentedly. This is literally a textbook engagement. Jesri glared at him. If you didnt want to see established openings you should have picked a different game, she retorted, following up with another pawn. And what more suitable game could I have chosen? Would you prefer checkers, perhaps? He shook his head in disgust. Go was too kind to you as a metaphor. A unity of identical pieces working together for a common goal, that isnt you, he scoffed. But chess, its so delightfully representative. An antiquated hierarchy of pieces, each one stubbornly limited by their individual failings. The most competent pieces on the board are ultimately slaves to the least capable. And, most appropriately, he murmured, making his countermove, the whole side wins or loses based on the fate of one piece. You keep hinting that youre going to come at me, Jesri snarled, but so far its just been bluster. She continued with a third pawn, feeling the endless tide of humanity in the back of her mind. They threw themselves against the fortress of the Gestalt in a ceaseless wave, although a few had peeled off and were interestedly looking at Jesris game. She let one part of her mind listen to their analysis and focused the rest of her attention on Trelir. Are you going to let the fight keep going without us, she asked, or are we actually going to get to it? Trelir sneered in distaste. So violent, so impatient, he tutted. And no, I have no intention of assaulting you here. Youve taken to this form of being far too well, and the misplaced enthusiasm of your supporters in such an event would be troublesome if only by dint of their sheer volume. He sighed and shook his head. Youve managed to become quite nettlesome, Captain. And here I thought you didnt like me, Jesri deadpanned, moving a knight forward. Oh, no, quite the opposite, Trelir replied, waving a hand dismissively. Ive said how much I admired your struggle to rise above your limitations, havent I? But they remain, Jesri Tam. They always will. The shortcomings of your individual form continue to bind you, cripple you, keeping you from the heights a more perfect being could reach. He reached down towards the board, but his eyes remained fixed on Jesri. You are shackled with chains of flesh that subvert your minds workings at every turn. Even now, at the height of your being, we must still speak as two individuals in this sad little simulacrum. I will do you the favor of freeing you from your tragic existence, my dear Captain, he said. I will destroy your body and end this faade. --- Holy shit!, Rhuar yelped, flinching as a blast rippled by the bridge. Cracks spidered across a few of the viewports before shutters clanged over them to reinforce the fragile panes. Anja, theyre really coming after us, he called out. I noticed, she grated, scanning through her displays. Tiln, report! His face popped onto a side screen, looking harried but unharmed. Theyre leaving us mostly alone, sir, he replied. You seem to be their priority target. Weve been able to move freely, enough to force one of them into stasis with a few well-timed volleys. Their focus on you has been quite helpful. Not the word I would use!, she shouted back, grimacing as Rhuar pulled them into another banking turn. They are keeping too much pressure on us for us to return fire effectively. Try and take a few more of them out, and make it quick! We can only keep this up for so long. I had some ideas about that, actually, Tiln said, scrolling through a display offscreen. Weve got some ordnance that would be more effective than our guns, but its intended for fixed bombardment- Anja made a frustrated noise and glared at him. Tiln!, she hissed, you are a *captain*. Stop asking me for permission and *act*! Yes... sir?, Tiln replied hesitantly. Its just that you had previously said not to fuck around with cowboy trick shots in combat situations, and based on my understanding of the term this- He cut off as the *Grand Design* jolted violently and Anja gave him a searing look. Um, he amended. Never mind. If I ram my ship into the enemy, please know that it was unintentional. He cut the transmission before she could reply, and David peered at her questioningly. That sounds ominous, he said. Maybe you should have let him explain. Anja spared a murderous glance for him, but kept a view of Tilns ship up on one of her monitors as she worked. The little craft arrowed towards the nearest of the three Emissaries penning them in, then slowed as the hull began to dance with white fire. Oh, *shit*, Rhuar groaned, sudden realization on his face. Anja, you should really- He cut off with a yelp as another blast from the Emissaries lanced towards them, forcing him to execute a violent lateral thrust. Anja was tossed hard against her armrest, but Rhuar simply toppled sideways. They both regained their bearings just in time to see Tilns ship disappear. He reappeared almost dead center in Anjas scopes, and she jerked her fingers away from the firing controls with a muttered curse. The Ysleli ship raced close across the Emissarys hull like a blazing comet before vanishing again into hyperspace - bare seconds before a jettisoned torpedo tore open the Emissarys starboard flank. --- Trelir frowned at Jesris lone knight playing havoc in the back rank of the board, now sitting proudly where one of his rooks should be. He moved his hand toward it, then rested a finger atop the adjacent knight while he contemplated the arrangement. The pinnacle of sentient life needs to think about their moves?, Jesri snarked. Come on, Trelir, you said you were going to kill me. Are you really going to leave me languishing in my fleshy prison this long? She let her chin rest in her hands, elbows on the table. Would you condemn me to yet more of my somewhat-less-than-optimal existence? Trelir didnt react, surveying the board without looking up. You dont fool me, you know, he said quietly. This bravado, this humor. Youre as scared now as youve ever been. You have no idea what youre doing. He moved his knight away, exposing Jesris piece to an attack from Trelirs queen. Jesri snorted and moved the knight to a safe space, leaning back in her chair with a sigh. You act like thats not the *status quo*, she said wearily. Ive been improvising my way out of mortal peril for millennia. Soul-rending terror is an old buddy of mine. She stretched her arms, then cracked her neck as Trelir looked on without speaking. Id say Im actually better off than normal, she remarked brightly, since now Ive got a few billion of my best friends backing me up. She smiled as a cheer rippled back from the network, the fierce support of her linked army rebounding in a wave. He laid a long finger on his queen, looking over the board again. Theyre going to die, he said, his voice still low and calm. All of them. The ones who joined you, the ones who didnt. You conscripted paradise to fight a war they cannot win, and now its lost to them forever. He moved his queen laterally, threatening the escaped knight. You really dont get humans very well, Jesri said, placing her finger on the beleaguered knight. What you built wasnt a paradise. Youre not some altruist playing the steward of all life or some bullshit like that, your only interest is self-interest. She lifted her finger and moved it to one of her bishops, moving it forward to imperil Trelirs other rook. They know that. I showed them everything I know about you and the Gestalt, and weve all agreed that the whole bunch of you are such colossal assholes that wed pretty much rather die than go back to your happy little paradise. She shrugged. If thats the way it works out, then at least we gave it a shot and made your life inconvenient as a bonus fuck-you. Trelir looked up from his study of the board with a mildly shocked expression. Im always amazed at how vindictive and spiteful humans can be, he tutted. Youd condemn them all to die for something so petty? Jesris smile dropped away, leaving a hard stare. More petty a reason than when you did it?, she asked softly. What was our offense, again? He shook his head and moved a pawn to block the bishop. That was different, he insisted. It was nothing personal, as you say. Trelirs pawn toppled to the board as Jesri slid the bishop violently forward, the chorus of voices around her rising in fury. Well, thats unfortunate, she growled. Because we kinda took it that way. --- Two more inbound!, Rhuar shouted, setting his shoulders as he took the ship through a punishing turn. Furious sunlight played across the bridge as the ship pulled around. One minute, maybe less. Seriously?, David griped, looking out at the sole remaining Emissary from their original group. Three spheres of golden light twisted and writhed where Tilns daring strikes had forced the others into stasis. We were almost done, too. Anja reset her targeting reticle and pushed a stray bit of hair from her eyes. Probably not a coincidence, she muttered. Tiln! Report! Doing all right, sir, he replied, although his voice was tight with stress. Our hyperdrive isnt enjoying this, but its holding up. We have four more torpedos, then well have to fall back to more conventional tactics. Save the torpedos for now, Anja said grimly. Support us for a run on the last target, I want to take him out before his friends show up. Aye sir, Tiln acknowledged, turning back to his crew. The two ships accelerated on a straight-line course towards the remaining Emissary, then began an evasive spiral as its first shots lanced toward them. Anja stabbed her fingers at the console and debris exploded from the Emissarys fore quarter. Grinning, she fired again - and looked at the display with a sinking feeling as nothing happened. Shit, she spat angrily. The whack-a-mole is empty. Rhuar, position us to engage with the plasma lance. Got it, he replied, although worry marked his face through the shipjack fugue. The ship banked again to bring the topside against the Emissary, and Anja focused a blazing column of light into the scar from her last barrage. The attack landed in a spectacular wave of billowing plasma, bright even in the radiant sunlight, but the Emissary remained active. Rhuar grunted as they were forced to dodge a pair of incoming shots, the nearer of which raced uncomfortably close by their port side. Metal screamed, and warning lights lit up red on several displays. Number one engine is damaged!, David called out, busily directing his fleet of repair drones to the site. Were at three-quarters output. Anja didnt comment, instead training the railguns to focus fire on what she hoped were weak points in the Emissarys hull. Blazing lines stitched out from across the *Grand Design* as the batteries spoke, but Rhuars frantic evasive maneuvering scattered many of the shots away from her intended target. Ive got it, Tiln broadcast, taking the *Subtle Knife* in for a supporting volley. The little ship fired her forward guns in a sustained burst that sent secondary explosions rippling through the Emissarys hull. Be careful, Anja warned, eyeing his trajectory. Were about to be- She cut off abruptly as the two new Emissary contacts burst out of hyperspace directly behind Tilns ship, their weapons charging for an immediate volley. Anja watched helplessly as the *Subtle Knife* juked to the side, narrowly avoiding annihilation as the twisted projectiles stripped ribbons of metal from its flank. Atmosphere vented in a glittering fog behind them to mark their course as the ship spiraled away from the Gestalts encirclement, but they were still too close. Anja retargeted their guns on the Emissaries charging weapons, watching them ramp up quickly, too quickly for her to stop- White fire blossomed over her scopes and was immediately outstripped by explosions of superheated metal from the Emissary closest to Tiln. The *Cormorant* streaked away from the glowing cloud, the plasma from their hyperjump blown outward as they lashed a second Emissary with their guns. Oh, *fuck* yeah!, Rhuar shouted, bouncing on his paws in exuberant glee. Tarl, you beautiful yellow bastard! Guns from all three ships pummeled the remaining wounded Emissary, and soon all of their opponents had retreated into their protective shells. Tarls face blinked into view on one of the displays, looking exhilarated. Behind him his crew worked frantically, his weary first officer bellowing orders in a hoarse voice. Major Tam, Captain Tiln, he said happily. Weve been trying to find you for some time now. Despite herself, Anja felt a smile creep onto her lips. Tarl, good to see you, she replied. And good timing. We had thought you might be dead. Dead?, Tarl scoffed. Major, I am the Warfather. Some Emissaries attacked earlier, but they did no worse than delay me. He sniffed indignantly, but Anja could see the scarred plating on the outside of his vessel where near-misses and grazes had ripped his hull open. Her sensors placed his reactor output at below-optimal, and two engines showed dead and cold on her readout. She shook her head ruefully. Ysleli, she muttered under her breath. At the risk of breaking decorum, sir, Tiln said, reestablishing his connection, I did tell you so. The bridge behind him was obscured by a haze of smoke, and Anja could see crewmen tending to casualties over his shoulder. So you did, Anja said tolerantly. Status? Weve been better, Tiln replied, surveying the bridge behind him. That last hit knocked out a lot of systems, but we think we can most of it back up in short order. Environmental controls are down, and its beginning to feel a bit warm in here. Anja pursed her lips. This close to the sun, that would be an issue. Come around in our shadow while you do repairs, she said. If we have a few moments we should use them to regroup. Excellent, Tarl rumbled. We will join formation as well. There are a few minor repairs He trailed off as one of his officers shouted something in the background, and Anja saw Rhuar go stiff out of the corner of her eye. What is it? she asked. Repairs will have to wait, Tarl said flatly. We have new contacts coming in, upwards of twenty ships. Anja exchanged a look with David and Rhuar. Twenty?, she asked quietly. Rhuar nodded. Twenty-three. And Anja He hesitated, then gave her a mournful look. If Tarl is alive then he completed his segment. We destroyed all of the targeted nodes, but the Gestalt is still coming. It didnt work, David muttered. Well, shit. Anja slumped into her chair, a gnawing dread growing in the back of her mind. She cast her eyes over the increasing number of red warning lamps, the dire assessments of the *Cormorant* and the *Subtle Knife*, at Jesris vitals brightly pulsing on their small display. She wrestled the dread back, looking up at David and Rhuar, at Tiln and Tarl on their monitors. One problem at a time, she said dully. We cannot make any sort of move to strike or retreat until we deal with these new ships. Well-stated, Tarl said, nodding his head firmly as if she had just given a motivational speech. We may not have defeated them yet, but the enemy measures us as a threat worth addressing with overwhelming force. He pointed dramatically to his bridges tactical display, on which a cloud of red dots loomed ominously. That is not a force to finish an ailing enemy or mop up a fleet of weaklings. That is not a fleet you send to defeat an enemy that has no hope of defeating you in turn. It is a strong, capable fleet to match a strong, capable foe. Even if we cannot see the path forward, the enemy sees its own doom in us. He bared his needle-sharp teeth in a smile. We only need to survive until we see it as well. I am simultaneously motivated and terrified, Rhuar complained. Anja, make him stop. Something flared in the darkness of Anjas thoughts, and a smile crept back onto her lips. No, she said, Tarl is right. The Gestalt has always responded with commensurate force. The concept of building in a margin for error is foreign to a mind that knows all details and calculates all outcomes. If it sends twenty-three ships it is because it believes we stand a chance against twenty-two. She stood up from her chair and gave Tarl a feral smile. So I say we trust its assessment. So, what, you want to just kill twenty-two of them and see how we feel?, David asked. Were pretty beat up, Rhuar observed. Our combat strength is lowered - but so is theirs. I can tell, watching how they fly and attack. They may not be crippled like we had planned, but something is degrading their responses. I cant say whether its us or Jesri and the resistance. Good enough for me, Anja said, trailing a hand absently over Jesris readouts. Get ready to move out. --- Jesri stared beyond the chessboard and across the roiling surface of Apollyons star, her mind settling on the cloud of light sailing toward the three darkened motes huddled together on the battlefield. Her forces had made inroads into the Emissary ships, slashing data feeds and hobbling predictive routines where they could - but the Emissaries were not wholly dependent on the Gestalt. Their core operations were walled off from her relentless assault, and the flotilla pressed on despite her efforts. You seem distracted, Trelir said knowingly. Quiet, Jesri muttered. Im thinking. Youre panicking, Trelir purred. Youre realizing what you should have seen from the beginning. You cannot touch the Emissaries, and they will destroy the remnants of your pitiful fleet. Jesri glared defiantly back at Trelir, drawing her bishop back to her side of the board. Even if I die, she said, you cant stop what I started. The people I freed will tear you apart. They wont, because they are still people, Trelir sighed. Individuals who communicate better than most, admittedly, but individuals nonetheless. Theyve made you their leader, their core, and when you are gone they will not be able to function. He leaned in close to her, his breath brushing against her face. She recoiled from his presence, but he merely advanced further. You werent ready, he hissed. You took people raised to operate as independent entities and tried to make them a collective. Even we couldnt make that work. It requires a mind tailored for the task, raised in the light of the Confluence, matured from its first day to be one with others. Were doing all right, Jesri retorted. You, on the other hand, seem to be a bit bothered. They only succeed because of you, Trelir replied, ignoring her. Because youre better than they are you can help them to some degree. Once youre gone, however, the entire mess will descend into a mob of panicked monkeys that cant help but hold ninety-nine percent of themselves back from the group. They will wail and scream, clash against one another in useless conflict. It will all dissolve into chaos. Jesri didnt answer, instead focusing on the force of Emissaries. They had executed another microjump and were now within direct striking range of the *Grand Design*. She saw the two larger signatures twist and evade, circling outward while the smallest ship flung itself in an impossibly tight microjump towards the lead Gestalt ship. There was a confused tussle that left the Emissary reeling into stasis, its lower hull blasted to scrap. Jesri smiled. Twenty-two, she said cheerfully. Keep mocking me if it pleases you, Trelir said dismissively. You have only seconds to live. I will be courteous and refrain from counting them. She joined in with the growing tide of minds flocking to torment the Emissaries, flooding their data feeds with sensor echoes and providing last-minute targeting corrections that sent their shots veering wide. Two more of the ovoid ships were forced into stasis, but Jesri worried at the poor state of the surviving human ships. All three had suffered heavy damage and even with the hordes of humanity on their side they were hard-pressed to dodge the oncoming projectiles. She saw armor peel off the spine of the *Grand Design* from a near-miss and winced. This is it, Trelir said, his voice oozing satisfaction. Time slows and the delicious details brighten. The solution space contracts to a point, a singularity. He moved his queen to the center of the board, placing her king in check. It was penned in on all sides, with only one move standing between it and checkmate. A pang of alarm from the linked minds pulled her attention back to the fleet battle where an Emissary had borrowed from Tilns playbook and microjumped directly next to the *Grand Design*. She saw their engines flare as Rhuar panicked, felt the growing pulse of the Emissarys weapon building up charge. They were too close to bend the weapons trajectory away from the ship - the only choice they had was where to send the hit. The Emissary had aimed squarely amidships, which would blow the entire back of the cruiser apart. She could nudge the projectile aft, which would destroy the engines and leave them dead in the water. Fore would still break the ship in half, dooming them. To the top was the bridge, where Anja and Rhuar would die instantly if struck. The remaining option was below, towards the belly of the ship. The secondary cargo hold, the pedestal - and Jesris helpless body. The cloud of minds spinning through her reeled, clustering within her chest and beating like a second heart. Millions of voices shouted options, suggestions, diversions, but none of them arrived at a solution. Slowly, with the wailing voices of billions tearing at the inside of her skull, she picked up her queen and moved it to block Trelirs. The weapons aim skewed low, drawing a bead that would tear a gash into the belly of the *Grand Design*. You see, Trelir murmured. It was always inevitable. There could only ever be one outcome. Jesris vision blurred as she felt the energys vibrations resonate within her skull. For me, maybe. Not for them. Theyre better than you think. Theyre nothing without you, Trelir scoffed. He reached over to the board and moved his queen to take hers, tossing the captured piece contemptuously to the table. They will die in an instant. The weapon brimmed with energy, milliseconds from releasing its payload to tear through spacetime towards the ship. Jesri shook her head and looked up at Trelir, her eyes dry and cold even as a maelstrom raged within her, all minds focused intently on the crucial nanosecond as they searched in vain for a faulty line of code or exploitable vulnerability. Well see, she said. In her minds eye she saw the projectile race out, covering the distance between the ships in an eyeblink. Huge swathes of hull plating were shattered as it approached, atmosphere venting from a hundred ruptured corridors and holds, bulkheads twisting in gruesome slow-motion until finally- --- Anja heard the dim blaring of klaxons and forced her eyes open, years of military reflex overriding her grogginess. The shuttered viewports of the bridge arced high overhead, their graceful curves lit red by the emergency lighting. She was on the floor, she realized. Why was she on the floor? Levering herself up, she looked around the bridge. Half of the displays had gone dark, and David had disappeared from his screen. Rhuar had fallen in a heap next to his duty station and was bleeding from a gash to his shoulder. He struggled to rise to his feet, his eyes clouded in a daze of feedback from his jack. She stumbled towards her chair and threw herself into it, keying up damage reports with clumsy, fumbling fingers. A diagram of the ship flickered onto her display and her heart froze to see the red warnings spidering over it. They had taken a hit belowdecks, just afore of engineering. Critical ships systems were spared, although the ship was currently rerouting power to compensate for several missing trunk conduits. The WCML was gone, as were the torpedo bays, the lower aft railguns - and the entire secondary cargo hold. Panic gripping her, she flung a hand towards the small display that had held Jesris vital signs. It sat dead and black in her hand, reflecting only her horrified face in the glass. --- I keep saying things like Here we go! at the end of these author notes, but this is actually it. One more chapter, and Im going to post it later today rather than making you wait a week - no court would convict you for my murder if I made you wait a full week after that ending. More notes from me and my editor in the second half. Here we go!"

Let me know if you like it in the comments.* &amp;#x200B; [First](URL &amp;#x200B; Major Litten opened an AR map displaying the compound and the surrounding hills on the ground in front of her. She watched as the blue dots indicating her people spread out to the exterior of the compound into defensive positions. She issued commands to a couple of her soldiers to change positions, their instincts had been good but they werent looking at the overall picture like she was. It wasn't till a minute later that she noticed that there was another blue dot near her own in the center of the compound. She turned to see Miller, rifle down, scanning her immediate area. Was he protecting her? &amp;#x200B; Of course Im protecting my little kitty cat, he said obviously read her mind again. She shot him a dirty look. &amp;#x200B; Come on Maj. You know as well as I do the Yuti go out of their way to take out commanders. I heard if they actually do ti, they get their first pick up mates or something gross like that when they get back. So you need a protection detail during this battle. Thats me. He punctuated his final point by locking and loading his weapon. &amp;#x200B; Fine, she replied after a moment. If you're gonna be here, you might as well help. Miller came forward as the 3-D map that Litten had been looking at suddenly appeared in his vision as well. &amp;#x200B; Id put even more people up top, Miller said. They might decide to just drop straight onto the roof of the compound. &amp;#x200B; I already have Specialist Kimura set up in a crows nest right at the top. She'll be able to pick off any Yuti that decide to drop right on top of us. Unless they all decide to drop right on top of us. The last part was a joke because the battle environment clearly favored a horizontal assault, but then again, Litten had never been particularly funny. &amp;#x200B; Before Captain Miller had a chance to pity laugh, a bunch of red arrows appeared on the top of the map pointing up. Major pushed her hand forward spreading out her fingers and the map zoomed out until she could see the cloud of red dots falling around their position. Some of the lights directly over the compound we're already starting to blink out of existence despite the incredible distance still between them. &amp;#x200B; Man that girl can shoot! Miller said. Can we keep her? &amp;#x200B; Litten didn't reply and Millers smile vanished. He stood up straighter and narrowed his eyes, he was taking it seriously now. That was the reason why Litten and Miller worked so well together. No other CO would put up with his constant goofing around, but he could apparently read her mind, which was incredibly useful, especially since she never needed to tell him when the time for jokes was over. &amp;#x200B; What's the sit rep in orbit? he asked. In response Litton pulled the map up until the view included various possible orbital trajectories above them. TSomething was wrong, the orbital seed wasn't live. The Andosian Navy had come in at a very low orbit to drop Major and her soldiers off, which meant they were on the other side of the Rogue planet Rilfashester 4 by now, but they should have left Communication and Observation buoys in geosynchronous orbit to maintain contact with the ground team and provide detailed insights on the theater of operations. Litten checked, the CO-OB buoys were dead. Whether they were destroyed or disabled didn't matter, she couldn't see the current situation in orbit. What the static map did show, was a Yuti light cruiser preforming hard retrograde burn on a pretty intense descent. Her brain assist program, TWILIGHT, spit out the most probable trajectories given the light cruisers current heading, delta-V vector, and technical specifications. &amp;#x200B; 23 minutes, she started. That's how long we have until they land, or until theyre done their orbital burn. &amp;#x200B; We're screwed either way, Miller said, obviously having done the exact same analysis on his brain assist program, GANDALF. If they land, well be overrun by the reinforcements. If they get into orbit, they'll just turn around and glass the compound. &amp;#x200B; Litten swung the map back down to the surface of Rilfashester 4 just as the red dots were touching down around the observatory. Kimura and her team had managed to shoot almost half of them out of the sky before they touched down, but they still had at least four times as many boots on the ground as Litten did. &amp;#x200B; Open general comms, she said to TWILIGHT turning away from the map. 23 minutes people, she started. That's how long we have until they get reinforcements, or they can just blast us from space. I expect to be 2 kilometers away from here, in stealth mode, with every Yuti on this rock dead. &amp;#x200B; Oorah! Her soldiers shouted in response. &amp;#x200B; Alvarez, Smith. Sweep the compound for anything we might've missed and take anything that looks good. Johannes. Miller and I are coming to help defend your position. Everyone else, good hunting. &amp;#x200B; Litten was walking toward Johannes's position before she had started talking. She never even looked back to see if Miller was following her, but she he was. They passed Alvarez and Smith heading in the opposite direction, just shy of the exterior of the compound. Miller started shouting at them, The Major said sweep the whole compound, not walk around it. Double time soldiers. They ran off as Litten stepped out under the black sky. &amp;#x200B; Down! Johannes shouted. &amp;#x200B; Litten crouch ran until her back hit the exterior wall. 19 minutes. A flurry of bright flashes and scorch marks rang out on the wall around the door. Right after they ended Miller glanced around the frame of the door then bolted to join Litten and Johannes against the wall. Both of the woman were turning up the juice on their guns. The Yuti were still far enough away that fewer precise shots worked better than a spray. Miller moved away from the others along the wall, Ill draw their fire. Three bursts. &amp;#x200B; Litten turned to face Johannes, Four shots then down and switch. TShe nodded in agreement. &amp;#x200B; Miller popped up from where hed been crouching against the wall. The horizon was covered in pin pricks of light indicating laser fire. He chose three clusters and opened up on each of them before dropping back down. He immediately started moving to a new position as bright scorch marks appeared all around where hed been standing. Litten and Johannes, vision magnify, focused in on the four highlighted targets each of them independently saw. Electricity surged through the coils in their guns and propelled the metal slugs forward with the equivalent force of 10 microtons of TNT. Each target fell in succession, green mist spraying into space behind them. 14 minutes. The Yuti were already returning fire on the snipers position when Miller popped back up with a new salvo. They continued this back and forth for a while. They all did. Each of The Broken were set up in groups of three, two snipers and one bait. Humans had been fighting the Yuti long enough to have detailed countermeasures to employ against nearly all of their tactics. 9 minutes. The Yuti were getting close enough that it was time to switch to a new one. &amp;#x200B; TWILIGHT sent up an alert that appeared in the top right corner of Littens vision just as she dropped back behind the wall and started reloading. She turned down the power on her on her rifle and change from single to burst. Johannes, Miller, Me. Johannes complied immediately firing three bursts at pre-highlighted targets before returning to cover. Every soldier got the same notification from their own brain assist program. Not only that but the brain assist programs also helped pick targets through swarm computing. Every enemy seen by any human soldier was put into a shared database which the brain assist programs then allocated to each soldier based on the soldier position, skill, and vulnerability to enemy fire. &amp;#x200B; Miller finished his turn with bright scorch marks appearing around him before he finished his last salvo. Litten stood to take her shots but only fired two bursts and dropped back down before the lasers struck where shed just been standing. Drop to two bursts, she shouted into the general comms. 7 minutes. &amp;#x200B; She was about to check the counts when Miller came in on her headset over a private channel. Too many of them and not enough of us. I recommend we decrease our safety margins. Hed read her mind again and now TWILIGHT was too, displaying the relevant information in the top right corner of her vision. She didnt really need it though, she trusted Millers judgment. He always said that his main priority was getting back home alive and that the best way to do that was have as many soldiers as he could at all times. He didnt waste lives. &amp;#x200B; Decrease safety parameters. Initiate maximum kill tactics. The words stun in her throat like acid. She was going to get some of her soldiers killed. 5 minutes left people. Give them hell. &amp;#x200B; There was an immediate cease fire as everyone changed positions and reloaded, then simultaneously, all 42 remaining human soldiers manning the exterior of the compound stood and opened fire. Thousands of bullets sprayed from the building like a fire hose. Green blood stained the rocks of Rilfashester 4 and red blood stained the walls of the observatory. &amp;#x200B; It took four such volleys before TWILIGHT indicated that all the Yuti were dead.17 of The Broken had also died. Litten sallowed, looked at the map, and started to run. &amp;#x200B; Rally point set! Evacuate the observatory!"

Erich muttered as soon as Sarah was out of earshot. After a few more minutes of painfully stilted conversation, the scarred woman had retreated once more to her room. Unfortunately, Gravity had not, and the heavy silence was beginning to get to him. Im not sulking, the woman muttered. Brooding? Angsting? Erich suggested, whatever it is, its getting distracting. The silence continued on, and he resigned himself to the painfully heavy atmosphere once more. Normally a little awkwardness wouldnt bother him, he was socially obtuse enough for it to roll off his back, but in the current circumstances well, suffice to say that it was bringing up unpleasant memories. *Christ, its like being back home again.* He was on the verge of standing up to go anywhere else, when Gravity finally spoke. Doesnt it bother you? He froze, mid movement. Does what bother me? He asked, genuinely confused. *Sarah pretty much taking over?* He wondered. If so, the answer was a little. He wasnt enamoured with the idea of being back under the volatile womans thumb. Not at all. Still, he was smart enough to recognize that he needed her. *For now.* This whole thing!? The woman spat, this was our chance to get out of all this crap. The woman stood up, hands glowing the faintest hint of green, sure, it wasnt ideal, but we didnt have to be *criminals*! We could have just sold stuff. Erich resisted the urge to scoff, you do realize where we are right? Criminal isnt a word that exists in this places dictionary. Gravitys eyes narrowed at him as her hands slowly lost their glow, you know exactly what I mean. The violence. The killing. The stealing. The constant power struggles. We didnt *have* to get involved in it. The woman slumped back into her seat, now my bitch of a sisters back, and were diving right back in. Erich turned back toward the harness in front of him and resisted the urge to point out that *he* was the one to get them into this mess. Sarah, or *Bronte,* he guessed, just planned to profit off it. *Which she probably would have done anyway,* he reasoned. What did you think was going to happen? He asked idly, that she would wake up and *not* start looking for ways to claw out her own little kingdom? Gravity shook her head in disgust, I dont know maybe? With the old man gone Seems to me that you have a very different perspective on things than Sarah. Erich murmured, you did what you did because you were terrified of the man. Gravity made some sound of protest, but Erich rode over her. Sarah *idolized* him. The sisters circumstance reminded him of his own situation with his sister to be honest. The thought brought a frown to his face. You may have come from similar circumstances, but youve both adapted to them in different ways. Gravity and Sarah were never going to be alike. Even he could see that. They might have both been damaged by their fathers presence in their lives, but they hadnt broken in the same way. One resented her role and the other embraced it. *Seeing that parallel again,* he thought irritably, dismissing it from his mind with a shake of the head. So, what am I supposed to do? The woman asked, the slightest bit of vulnerability hidden under her feigned irritation. Just accept it? Erich shrugged as he soldered the last few wires into place, seems to be whats going to happen. He wasnt about to tell her otherwise. He still needed her as well. The sound of Gravity standing up and striding angrily from the room made him sigh. *I didnt get chance to give her the new equipment,* he thought as he looked down at the recently completed shoulder harness. He could do it later, he supposed, for now he had work to do. Reaching over to the intercom, he tapped the button for the shop front, Grace, send in Limpy. I have a few changes I want to make. He wanted the drone brought up to snuff before he and Gravity went out to search for an Artificer. *How difficult could it be to find one in a city like this,* he mused. \--------------------------- *Very,* as it turned out. A week later, and they were grasping at straws. *Of course, it might help if one of the searchers wasnt dragging her feet,* Erich thought as he glanced over at Gravity. The woman in question refused to look back, steadfastly staring down the road as Limpy scanned the road in front of them. Her mood had not much improved in the days since their previous conversation. Sighing, Erich glanced over at Limpy instead. Not that the drone in question had a limp anymore. In fact, he had little in common with the initial Spartoi model. Instead, he was beefier, more armoured and rocking both a pulse blaster and shields. *A pulse blaster and shield stripped from my suit,* Erich thought irritably, feeling more than a little exposed out in public without it. Unfortunately, he had been forced to admit defeat on the suit front. Until they got a new Artificer he had no way of repairing some of the things key components. And between a fully operational and improved sentry drone, and a barely functional suit, he had been forced to admit that the drone won out. Hence Limpys current, and entirely temporary, upgrades. *At least Im not entirely defenceless,* he thought, feeling the comforting weight of the pulse pistol in his pocket, and the warm hum of the shield generator on his chest. Still, that didnt mean he was happy about being forced to walk through Portlands busy streets. Remind me again why Im being forced to walk like some kind of peasant? Erich asked irritably. Gravity turned away, and for just a moment he could see she was thinking about ignoring him. Because the *slavers district* doesnt allow any vehicle larger than scooter within two kilometres of the place. The woman finally snapped, turns out theyve had a bit of an issue with security in the past few years. In a very unladylike manner, she spat to the side, turns out that even over here, some people have issues with slavers. She chuckled bitterly, who knew? Wasnt really much Erich could say to that, so he wisely shut up. Gravity had made her opinion on Sarahs plan to obtain a meta-human through less than scrupulous means clear when there own attempts pulled up nothing. She had also apparently been expecting Erich to weigh in on her side, awkwardness between them bedamned. Unfortunately for her, he wasnt quite as bothered by the prospect of owning another human being as she was. *What can I say? Im desperate.* He needed an Artificer to continue his work. And with the way strays Metas were snatched up by the gangs in the city he couldnt see them finding one otherwise. *Would be nice if we just stumbled across one,* Erich thought, *but this isnt a fairy tale.* Fortuitous fated encounters like that just didnt happen to him. Everything he earned was through his own two hands. *No matter how dirty they might be.* Fortunately, he was distracted from any more thoughts about his slowly declining morality by the sight of the *bazaar.* Lovely, Gravity cursed, spitting to the side once more. Erich ignored her as he took in the view. *A shopping mall? An outdoor, neon-lighty, armed, shopping mall?* After a few moments observation, it was clear that, it wasnt much like a shopping mall at all, but somehow that image stuck with him. The principal was the same after all. Big colorful lights, posters, busy shoppers, and expansive windows showing the product within. In this case, though the product happened to be people. Somehow the familiarity made it worse. Sort of like an uncanny valley. Thought better of it yet? Gravity muttered to his side. No. He ground out, stepping forward into the mass of people and lights. Behind him Gravity sighed and followed. This is *wrong* Erich. She continued, undeterred. I am well aware. Erich muttered as he let Limpy clear a path. Then dont do this. Or better yet, do something about it. Erich looked at her incredulously, like what? Start a scene and up like that woman? He gestured to a lamppost from which a colorfully costumed woman hung, the words Vigilante on a sign around her neck. It had been a bit jarring the first time he saw one of those exhibitions, but by the third time the grotesque tableaus had just kind of faded into the background. Nowadays he just tried to pretend they didnt exist. *Sort of like seeing a homeless person back home* To her credit, Gravity didnt avert her eyes, staring at the would-be hero as she spoke, no. Just dont partake of all of this Erich scoffed, and Im sure my act of passive resistance would mean a great deal to the slave trade of Portland. Its not about that. Its about *being* better than this. Erich shook his head, gesturing to a storefront where a number of chained and nude, but remarkably clean, men and women were being leered at by a crowd and a large man shouted out there many benefits. As he passed, he overheard the words spider control. *Not a hell of a selling point there.* Do you know the difference between us and them? He said, dismissing the stray thought. These! He hissed, gesturing to the weapons at there sides and the shield unit on his chest. And that. He gestured at Limpy, who was, as they spoke, eying the surrounding crowds. Surrounding crowds that were subtly eying the bot in turn, along with everyone else. Thats it! He spat. Thats all thats keeping us from being the ones in those stores. And these things require components and money. Gravity scowled but didnt look away. Is that your justification for this? She grunted, survival? Erich shook his head, pushing forward into the crowd. That was all the justification he needed. He would survive. *Not without hesitation, but without a doubt.* &amp;#x200B; ***As ever, despite my best efforts, a few errors always seem to slip through. If you see one, don't hesitate to point it out. I'll fix it post-haste.*** ***Also, as always, two extra chapters are always available on Patreon:*** [***URL &amp;#x200B; [**&lt;&lt; Previous**](URL | [**First**](URL |"
48,vulnerability,HFY,(Lebab) XII conclusion,17,bop469,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/bop469/lebab_xii_conclusion/,2019-05-15 07:53:15,"The multi-national effort to combat the fanatical terrorist operation was coordinated by Dr. Benton. He safeguarded key details to prevent misuse later. Operation Babel was quickly staged to flood all safe zones with the ultra high frequency radio waves outlined in the brief. The plan went without a hitch and prevented millions of deaths on both sides of the paranormal fence. Of the fatalities that were incurred, 95 percent were between the attack organizers themselves. An unexpected positive consequence of the operation was that even unknown 'safe' areas were affected. Their leaders were in secret contact with each other through a network communication grid and also fell prey to the team's confusion warfare. Under the dire circumstances, it was the best possible outcome. As if that wasn't enough, even better news was to follow. After media sources revealed that the allied governments had orchestrated Babel II to foil the massive genocidal plot, many of its followers became disillusioned. They believed their 'divinely controlled master plan' could not be undone by mortal men. With the exception of a few isolated pockets of stanch fanaticism, the vast majority tempered their radical beliefs in favor of more moderate, peaceful ideologies. After a few months of false steps and growing pains, the Earth entered its most peaceful phase in 5,000 years. ------------------------------ So Eric... What being do you think sent that signal hundreds of light years across the Galaxy? Was its sole purpose to deliberately affect us on Earth as it did? Could it be...? Eric looked at Horace and lowered the rim of his glasses before responding. I have no idea what entity was behind the Babel signal but for whatever reason, it has stopped. Thats all that matters at the moment. Are you asking me if God sent those radio waves from the nexus of the universe? Of course we have no way of knowing. I'll say this; any being that can orchestrate and achieve all that humanity has ascribed to him, could easily destroy us from any distance in space. I choose to believe that 'Babel' was there because it needed to be. Like a 'cosmic safeguard' in place until we reached enough evolutionary development that our civility could catch up with technology. With any luck, the outcome we assisted with, justified having the signal discontinued. ------------------------------- The phone rang and Eric took special notice of the identity of the caller. This cant be good.; He remarked to his wife. Westcott only calls when theres some sort of catastrophe afoot. Let me see what he wants. Doc; humanity has been through some amazing transformations in the past six months and youve been a huge part of that.; The General began his spiel. Eric recognized Westcott's predictable pattern of flattery and praise. It always built up to something enormous. Eric was anxious to learn what 'the world's latest crisis' was, so he tried to hurry him along. No one could have predicted all the tumultuous social upheaval a year ago but with your teams diligence, weve managed to keep the peace. Unfortunately, there is a brand new development. Even compared to all the things you discovered before, it's unparalleled! Honestly I do not see us being able to adapt this time. This one I couldnt have dreamed of if I hadnt experienced it myself! I know we made a deal about not using 'Babel Waves' again but were going to have to turn them back on anyway! Eric was startled by the grave seriousness in Westcotts voice. He was normally the voice of absolute confidence. His demeanor projected an air of can do; which defied failure. In the rare moment of vulnerability, his words almost betrayed a sense of panic. What is it General? You make it sound pretty insurmountable. Surely Ive proven that just about anything can be overcome with the right attitude and teamwork! So, whats this all about? ""My wifes cat just TOLD me that she didnt like the pat cat food I was feeding her! I might have thought I was having a stroke but Delores witnessed the entire feline-to-human conversation too. I swear, If the cows start talking to us next, its going to greatly cut into my T Bone steaks! The carnivores of the world are going to be in BIG trouble! After a brief pause, Eric burst out laughing.Very funny General, you had me going there a minute! Did Horace put you up to it? Im as serious as a heart attack, Doctor. It really happened. It's probably happening all over the world at this very minute. As hard as it is to believe, we can understand animals now.. and they can understand us! The end"

I estimate it will be within weapons range in approximately 28.6 minutes. Katherine jumped out of bed, running over to the desk and tugging on her uniform. What class? There was a brief pause. It is an Imperial *Dreadnought*, Allie said at last. She felt the blood drain from her face. Allie? Can you fool one of their *flagships?* she whispered, half in hope, and half in terror. Of course I can Katherine, Allie replied. Their computers are no better than the ones on this battlecruiser. I will only require a data connection. I hope youre right, Katherine said fervently, as she raced for the bridge. --- **Captain** on the Bridge! Petty Officer Rothschild announced, standing up to relinquish the command chair. Sorry to wake you, Maam. Talk to me, she snapped, as she took her place. Whats the situation? Weve got a Zhaindei flagship closing in on our position, he informed her. Allie caught it early, thank God. So far theyre convinced *Kobolds Bane* is still under its original management. Wheres the Chief and Magro? Katherine asked. Loading the torpedo tubes, Rothschild explained. Zhaindei ships dont automate that, for some reason. Right, she nodded. Allie? What do you need us to do? Absolutely nothing, the AI said confidently. At the moment I am conversing with Blood Talon Ajqap, explaining why we are patrolling in this sector. And just who does *he* think hes talking to? Katherine asked, slightly dazed by the exchange. First Claw Vityrq, the former captain of this vessel, Allie related to her. There are many examples of similar conversations within *Kobolds Banes* databases. It was quite a simple matter to construct an image based on that information. And hes *buying* it? she said incredulously. I infer there is a 98.32% probability that Blood Talon Ajqap accepts the data I am presenting him as factual, based on voice inflection and physical mannerisms, Allie assured her. Katherine and the Petty Officer shared a look, both of them shaking their heads with a wry smile. I certainly like *those* odds, she grinned. So whats next? I am currently requesting a data link, in order to download updates to our orders and mission profile, the AI explained. Once that is established, I will deploy a Polymorphic Botnet to infect the *Dreadnoughts* mainframe. I estimate it will require from 8 to 13 minutes before the enemy ship is thoroughly compromised. And in the meantime? Katherine asked. Is there a possibility they could still attack us? There is a theoretical window of vulnerability, Allie admitted. I will endeavor to ensure the enemy vessel will be unable to launch weapons. However, if I am unsuccessful, warning you of the potential threat will be my utmost priority. Thats all I can ask, Katherine said gratefully. Keep us posted. Of course, the AI replied. --- **Blood** Talon? The Fleet commander turned from the screen, noting the presence of First Claw Uthqun, the vessels captain. Speak, he ordered. We are experiencing a sudden cascade failure in our computer systems, the First Claw reported in a rush. The Engineer Fifth Claw believes we have been infected. *Impossible,* Ajqap rumbled. The only other vessel we have come into contact with is *Kobolds Bane*, and His eyes widened in shock. *Traitors*, he hissed. So it would seem, Blood Talon, Uthqun agreed. What are your orders? The Fleet Commander rose to his feet, pointing at the screen. *Destroy them!* --- **Katherine,** they have become aware of my deception, Allie announced suddenly. They are charging weapons as we speak. Evasive maneuvers! she ordered. Can you keep them from firing? I shall try, the AI vowed. --- **Launch** torpedoes! First Claw Uthqun roared, as the gunners raced to obey. The warheads were slammed into their tubes and locked into place, as the Second Claw slammed his fist on the firing stud. Explosions ripped through the massive vessel, exposing whole sections to space, as the *Dreadnought* began to list. *What has happened?* Blood Talon Ajqap howled, as more and more sections went offline. We have been *sabotaged!* the First Claw answered. It must be some new Alliance trickery! We *must* inform High Command! the commander shouted. Rip the communication devices from their *mounts* if necessary, *but the Emperor must know of this infernal weapon!* At once! Uthqun replied, as the crew bent to their task with a renewed frenzy. --- **Woah!** Rothschild exclaimed. Half of that flagship just *blew the hell up!* *Allie?* Katherine said cautiously. I was able to arm the enemy torpedoes while they were still in their tubes, the AI responded. They no longer appear capable of offensive action. After you *wiped out* their torpedo bays? she said in disbelief, I cant say Im surprised. Katherine paused for a moment, considering their options. Do you think we can take whats left of the ship intact? This could be a *huge* Intelligence coup for us. Oh, Allie said quietly, you did not state you wished to *capture* the enemy vessel. ...I *know* Im going to regret asking this, but what did you *do*, Allie? Katherine said evenly. A huge flash of light suddenly filled the screen, momentarily blinding them. I ordered the containment bottles to implode catastrophically, the AI explained, as the debris field began to expand. Well...we *did* win, the Petty Officer pointed out. Did I err, Katherine? Allie asked. There seemed to be an almost anxious tone in her question. No, you didnt, Katherine sighed. The fault is mine. I didnt articulate my intentions clearly enough. Lessons learned. I will endeavor to better anticipate your wishes in the future, Katherine, the AI said contritely. Its alright, Katherine said gently. You saved our lives, and in the end thats all anyone can ask for. Thank you, Allie. Yeah, thanks Allie, Rothschild chimed in, grinning from ear to ear. You can sail with me anytime! You are most welcome, the AI said contentedly. [First](URL I [Previous](URL"

Loading the torpedo tubes, Rothschild explained. Zhaindei ships dont automate that, for some reason. Right, she nodded. Allie? What do you need us to do? Absolutely nothing, the AI said confidently. At the moment I am conversing with Blood Talon Ajqap, explaining why we are patrolling in this sector. And just who does *he* think hes talking to? Katherine asked, slightly dazed by the exchange. First Claw Vityrq, the former captain of this vessel, Allie related to her. There are many examples of similar conversations within *Kobolds Banes* databases. It was quite a simple matter to construct an image based on that information. And hes *buying* it? she said incredulously. I infer there is a 98.32% probability that Blood Talon Ajqap accepts the data I am presenting him as factual, based on voice inflection and physical mannerisms, Allie assured her. Katherine and the Petty Officer shared a look, both of them shaking their heads with a wry smile. I certainly like *those* odds, she grinned. So whats next? I am currently requesting a data link, in order to download updates to our orders and mission profile, the AI explained. Once that is established, I will deploy a Polymorphic Botnet to infect the *Dreadnoughts* mainframe. I estimate it will require from 8 to 13 minutes before the enemy ship is thoroughly compromised. And in the meantime? Katherine asked. Is there a possibility they could still attack us? There is a theoretical window of vulnerability, Allie admitted. I will endeavor to ensure the enemy vessel will be unable to launch weapons. However, if I am unsuccessful, warning you of the potential threat will be my utmost priority. Thats all I can ask, Katherine said gratefully. Keep us posted. Of course, the AI replied. --- **Blood** Talon? The Fleet commander turned from the screen, noting the presence of First Claw Uthqun, the vessels captain. Speak, he ordered. We are experiencing a sudden cascade failure in our computer systems, the First Claw reported in a rush. The Engineer Fifth Claw believes we have been infected. *Impossible,* Ajqap rumbled. The only other vessel we have come into contact with is *Kobolds Bane*, and His eyes widened in shock. *Traitors*, he hissed. So it would seem, Blood Talon, Uthqun agreed. What are your orders? The Fleet Commander rose to his feet, pointing at the screen. *Destroy them!* --- **Katherine,** they have become aware of my deception, Allie announced suddenly. They are charging weapons as we speak. Evasive maneuvers! she ordered. Can you keep them from firing? I shall try, the AI vowed. --- **Launch** torpedoes! First Claw Uthqun roared, as the gunners raced to obey. The warheads were slammed into their tubes and locked into place, as the Second Claw slammed his fist on the firing stud. Explosions ripped through the massive vessel, exposing whole sections to space, as the *Dreadnought* began to list. *What has happened?* Blood Talon Ajqap howled, as more and more sections went offline. We have been *sabotaged!* the First Claw answered. It must be some new Alliance trickery! We *must* inform High Command! the commander shouted. Rip the communication devices from their *mounts* if necessary, *but the Emperor must know of this infernal weapon!* At once! Uthqun replied, as the crew bent to their task with a renewed frenzy. --- **Woah!** Rothschild exclaimed. Half of that flagship just *blew the hell up!* *Allie?* Katherine said cautiously. I was able to arm the enemy torpedoes while they were still in their tubes, the AI responded. They no longer appear capable of offensive action. After you *wiped out* their torpedo bays? she said in disbelief, I cant say Im surprised. Katherine paused for a moment, considering their options. Do you think we can take whats left of the ship intact? This could be a *huge* Intelligence coup for us. Oh, Allie said quietly, you did not state you wished to *capture* the enemy vessel. ...I *know* Im going to regret asking this, but what did you *do*, Allie? Katherine said evenly. A huge flash of light suddenly filled the screen, momentarily blinding them. I ordered the containment bottles to implode catastrophically, the AI explained, as the debris field began to expand. Well...we *did* win, the Petty Officer pointed out. Did I err, Katherine? Allie asked. There seemed to be an almost anxious tone in her question. No, you didnt, Katherine sighed. The fault is mine. I didnt articulate my intentions clearly enough. Lessons learned. I will endeavor to better anticipate your wishes in the future, Katherine, the AI said contritely. Its alright, Katherine said gently. You saved our lives, and in the end thats all anyone can ask for. Thank you, Allie. Yeah, thanks Allie, Rothschild chimed in, grinning from ear to ear. You can sail with me anytime! You are most welcome, the AI said contentedly. [First](URL I [Previous](URL"

It looked relatively large for its size, and the fact that he could potentially drive it around definitely had its uses. &amp;#x200B; ""I figured that if you ever wanted to move in with me or just wanted to stay here overnight, something like that thing would be pretty cool!"" &amp;#x200B; William scratched the back of his head. ""I'm not sure what to say. This is really sweet of you, Ana, but how did you afford something like that?"" &amp;#x200B; ""It was actually pretty cheap!"" she practically chirped. ""Keep in mind, I get like two hundred thousand energy credits a year with my part-time construction job. This only cost me around ten thousand creds since it's used."" &amp;#x200B; ""They pay you that much?!"" &amp;#x200B; ""Well, yeah. I'm a Zmaj. Our living expenses are much higher than humans, and we get paid more for both that and doing more work."" &amp;#x200B; ""...I suppose that makes sense. Thank you Ana, this is really cool!"" &amp;#x200B; ""Just wait until you see the inside!"" she replied with a slight smirk. ""Go on then!"" &amp;#x200B; At her insistence, he opened the door to the mobile home and strolled inside. Although the front passenger seats immediately caught his attention, there was also a kitchen adjoined by a small living room. Quickly walking his way through it, he went to the back and found a bathroom and a bedroom. Despite the overall cramped and compact design with synthetic wood furnishings, it was surprisingly spacious and cozy to such a point that one or two humans could comfortably live within it. &amp;#x200B; ""What do you think?"" asked Anahita as her muffled voice filled the air. &amp;#x200B; The human opened some curtains, exposing one of Anahita's massive heads attempting to peek inside. After momentarily recoiling, he smiled. ""I love it!"" &amp;#x200B; ""I knew you would like it!"" she replied with another broad smile of her own. ""I'd imagine that it must be stressful for a human to be around Zmaj all day. Especially at your size. If you ever want some privacy or a place where things feel safe or normal, feel free to find some solitude in your new mobile home!"" &amp;#x200B; ""Too bad you can't come in here with me. Besides that, it's fantastic!"" &amp;#x200B; ""That might be a good thing."" she said while looking away. ""Like if you ever want some alone time at any point, I won't be able to bother you too much."" &amp;#x200B; ""You don't really bother me, Ana. But yeah, I get it, we both might need some space every now and then. Just try not to step on my new RV."" &amp;#x200B; Anahita giggled. ""No promises!"" In response, William crossed his arms, causing her to frown. ""Seriously though, I'll try to be careful. It's not really that small though, so I don't think something like that will be an issue."" &amp;#x200B; In return, the human chuckled. ""You're so cute."" &amp;#x200B; ""What?"" said Ana as she blushed slightly. &amp;#x200B; ""I don't know. You're just so compassionate and considerate. Being around you seems to make me happy, and I smile for absolutely no reason I haven't ever met anyone capable of doing that before, much less someone going out of their way to give me gifts like this!"" &amp;#x200B; ""Aw! Thanks! You make me happy too, yum yum. Any time I have a problem, you seem to know how to fix it!"" &amp;#x200B; He rolled his eyes. ""Yeah, I'm able to function as your free tech support. You're welcome."" &amp;#x200B; ""And I can protect you from any of those big, bad menaki."" she said with a wink. ""I guess we do complement each other in that regard!"" &amp;#x200B; ""Yeah, yeah I'm the brains of this operation, and you're the brawn."" &amp;#x200B; ""I thought I was the heart!"" &amp;#x200B; ""Sure, that too!"" &amp;#x200B; He could hear her laughing to herself as he made his way outside. There, he found the familiar sight of Anahita's hand on the ground, making it evident that she wanted to pick him up. &amp;#x200B; ""Let's go get you cleaned up!"" &amp;#x200B; Moments later, they were in a bathroom. Ana activated what appeared to be a sink, and William awkwardly stood next to it while holding his dirty dress shirt. She sat there and happily hummed to herself as she waited for the water to get warm. &amp;#x200B; ""...You know I could have just used the restroom in the RV, right?"" &amp;#x200B; ""I know! You're a smart guy, so I'm assuming you figured out why I actually brought you back to my place besides just showing you your gift."" &amp;#x200B; William raised an eyebrow, arousing a sigh from Ana as she continued. &amp;#x200B; ""The Zmaj are having a fertility festival"" &amp;#x200B; ""And?"" &amp;#x200B; ""It's not just for the harvest, yums. You and I are mates now."" &amp;#x200B; He responded with a dumbfounded look on his face. It was enough to make Ana shake her central head. ""Alright, maybe I should stop beating around the bush. William I'm in heat."" &amp;#x200B; His eyes went wide as something finally clicked together in his head. ""Ah I see"" He made a sly smile. ""Are you going to strip down too?"" &amp;#x200B; In response, she took the yellow bow off her central head and temporarily set it aside. ""Done."" The human laughed before she put it back on. ""Seriously though, I'm going to keep wearing the bow since it holds my translation device."" &amp;#x200B; ""Don't worry, I like that bow. It looks cute on you!"" At his compliment, she smiled. ""It's not your fault that you're a member of a species that doesn't usually wear clothes."" &amp;#x200B; Ana rolled her eyes. ""Well, humans do. I guess I'm lucky since I have a tail to cover my more private bits. As for you, I think you know what to do now..."" &amp;#x200B; With some hesitation, William set his dress shirt aside. Some insecurity ate away at his mind as he looked at his upper body. Although the human knew that he was working out with Anahita and cutting down on stuff like drinking soda, he was still a bit overweight due to his sedentary lifestyle. Then again, it's not like he was expecting significant progress after only a few weeks of exercise. &amp;#x200B; ""...Is something wrong?"" she asked with a hint of concern. &amp;#x200B; ""Sorry, it's just a bit awkward is all..."" &amp;#x200B; ""It doesn't have to be awkward, yums. I know that your species has a nudity taboo, but if we're going to be mates, we need to be completely comfortable around each other. I mean, I'm technically naked around you all of the time, and it would only be fair if you allowed me to see what you really look like!"" &amp;#x200B; ""Alright, alright"" &amp;#x200B; He hesitantly continued stripping down until his shoes, pants, and other garments were thrown aside. The human refrained from looking at Anahita directly in the eyes once he was finished, instead deciding to stare at the nearby sink. However, out of the corner of his eye, he saw Anahita smile with one head, causing him to blush as blood flushed his face. &amp;#x200B; ""See? That wasn't so hard. I think you look very handsome!"" &amp;#x200B; When William finally looked at Anahita, vulnerability managed to momentarily overwhelm him. He was completely exposed in all of his glory as a giant alien woman happily looked down on his small and naked form. It didn't help that a gentle breeze was repeatedly sending shivers down his spine and making him go limp. &amp;#x200B; ""Uh it's kind of cold Ana, am I going to need to be like this the entire time?"" &amp;#x200B; ""Oh! I almost forgot"" She promptly procured a cloth bag around his size that was neatly tied up, and she set it next to him. ""That should contain some cleaning supplies, towels, and appropriate clothes for a human. I want you to be squeaky clean if we're going to try anything. Also, I have my own preparations to make, so send me a message on your smart device whenever you're ready!"" &amp;#x200B; ""...Will do."" &amp;#x200B; With that, she walked out of the bathroom and shut the door, leaving William alone. He internally questioned and doubted himself, more specifically about whether or not he was fucked in the head for wanting to fool around with a Zmaj. Regardless, he untied the bag provided to him and found some basic toiletries such as shampoo, soap, and towels, among other things. &amp;#x200B; After he finished thoroughly bathing himself in the warm water of the sink, he wrapped a towel around his waist. He also noticed that there was a bathrobe amidst the other towels, and promptly put it on. Last but not least, he grabbed his smartphone from his dirty pants and typed a single message. &amp;#x200B; **Ready.** &amp;#x200B; The human heard some heavy footsteps in the distance accompanied by the door gradually opening moments later. Then he saw Anahita's three heads, which were blushing quite heavily with the color purple filling her cheeks. ""Don't tell anyone that I have these, it could cause a scandal"" &amp;#x200B; After saying this, she fully opened the door. William found himself confused until he looked down, where he saw some open-toed yellow stockings on her legs and feet that went up to her knees. &amp;#x200B; ""Do you like them?"" she asked while flexing her toes for emphasis. &amp;#x200B; It was at this point that William came to a particular realization. For all of his flaws, this woman seemed to love him when he occasionally struggled to love himself. Maybe that irrational joy and pleasure that he got from being around her was what love actually felt like, even if it was juvenile, and it's not like taking things to the next level would actually hurt anyone. &amp;#x200B; Or at least he hoped that it wouldn't. Nonetheless, a single thought entered his mind. *Fuck it.* It was time to come up with a creative compliment &amp;#x200B; ""Hmph. Your legs were already lovely to look at, but now they look even better."" &amp;#x200B; In return, Anahita giggled as she approached him. ""And you're looking pretty spiffy yourself in that robe of yours!"" She placed her hand on the counter, and the human instinctively walked into it. ""Are you just saying that to flatter me or are you serious?"" &amp;#x200B; ""I'm not kidding."" he replied. ""Sure, you might not be a human, and you don't have the parts that I usually find physically attractive, but you have nice legs and hips by my standards."" &amp;#x200B; Anahita blushed once more at his words. ""Oh, yums"" She shook her central head. ""Sorry, I don't really know what I'm doing. I've clearly prepared for this, but I'm not usually used to being seductive or sexy, so to speak. At least the stockings are helping..."" &amp;#x200B; ""What makes you think I know what I'm doing?"" he asked as he crossed his arms. ""I'll admit, I never really got out much when I was younger. I was kind of shy. Even if I haven't done something like this before, you helped me come out my shell, and I'm taking the approach of faking it until you make it!"" &amp;#x200B; Ana pressed her nose against his back for just a moment, causing him to smile as she nuzzled him. ""To be fair, I don't think most people know what they're doing in an interspecies relationship!"" As Anahita spoke, she walked towards her bedroom. ""But I get what you mean. I'm the same way. My father was a bit overprotective when I was young, and being shunned from being allowed to use advanced technology hasn't helped my dating prospects. I never really wanted to admit that since I didn't want to sound desperate..."" &amp;#x200B; ""Really? The other Zmaj men must have been mad if they avoided you for superstitious reasons. I'd rather not kill the mood by dwelling on that though."" &amp;#x200B; ""I definitely won't kill the mood."" she said before entering her bedroom, where her circular bed with low lighting and scented candles awaited them. ""We might not know what we're doing, but we'll find a way. The two of us can talk about it before we try experimenting. My only question is are you ready for this?"" &amp;#x200B; ""Definitely."" &amp;#x200B; ""And are you having any second thoughts? You did say that you had a problem with us only knowing each other for a few weeks"" &amp;#x200B; He shrugged. ""Maybe that's just a human thing. It can be a bit arbitrary. I'll admit, I was hesitant at first because I wasn't sure if you wanted to wait due to our physical and cultural differences. If you're comfortable with it though, we can at least figure out if we're compatible for lack of a better term."" &amp;#x200B; ""I am comfortable with it!"" she chirped. ""It's mating season. It only happens once a year, and I'd prefer it to be you rather than someone else. I'm just afraid that I might accidentally hurt you."" &amp;#x200B; ""It'll be fine!"" he said with a dismissive gesture. ""I'm all yours, and you're all mine."" &amp;#x200B; Ana made a sly smile as she reclined on the bed, allowing William to join her as she placed him on her chest. ""Very well, then. Now we can express our love for each other in a much more physical manner"" &amp;#x200B; She stopped talking and started whatever awaited them by giving William an overwhelming kiss with all three heads. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \~\~\~\~\~ &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; The siren of an ambulance wailed as it drove past the Zmaj enclave. &amp;#x200B; It caused Anahita to perk her head up. ""What was that?"" &amp;#x200B; William, who was still standing on her chest, took off his robe. ""It sounds like an ambulance."" &amp;#x200B; ""That's not a good sign, yums "" &amp;#x200B; ""It's probably just a coincidence."" &amp;#x200B; Despite his words, anxiety still plagued her mind as she nervously looked away. ""I don't know I mean we still need to figure out how to make it work."" &amp;#x200B; ""Like I said Ana, we can talk about it or try the methods you mentioned earlier. It'll be fine!"" &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \~\~\~\~\~ &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Approximately two hours later, William was in a hospital. His entire body was lying on a bed with a broken leg being suspended in the air alongside other injuries. Doctors frantically tried to calm Anahita down as she cried outside of a nearby window, and the human struggled to stay conscious as a cocktail of drugs overwhelmed his systems. &amp;#x200B; ""IM SO SORRY, YUMS! I I didn't mean to get carried away!"" &amp;#x200B; ""Doesn't matter, had sex."" &amp;#x200B; She stopped sobbing as her face scowled up. ""Ugh! Really, yum yum?!"" &amp;#x200B; ""That was the morphine talking, not me!"" &amp;#x200B; In William's delirious state, he spotted some flowers and chocolate next to his bed. There was also several wires and tubes connected to his body, not that he knew what they did. As tears streamed down Anahita's only visible face, a Kalika doctor accompanied by several assistants and nurses slithered into the room. &amp;#x200B; ""Why is it always the humans"" hissed the doctor as she approached William. ""At least this isn't as bad as that accident with the Zmaj man trying to mate with a human woman."" &amp;#x200B; ""Uh what?"" muttered William. &amp;#x200B; ""Nevermind that."" said the doctor before crossing two of her four arms. ""It's a miracle that you didn't suffocate or get crushed by her womanhood before we got you out of there. Miracles come at a cost, however"" &amp;#x200B; At her words, a nurse handed the human a digital tablet. His eyes went wide upon seeing that it displayed a medical bill. Combined with treatment, medication, and food it all cost fifty thousand energy credits. &amp;#x200B; ""You only have McBronze medical coverage, hence the high price."" continued the doctor. ""We also put some cheeseburgers in a blender and used the resulting sludge to feed you, but we are charging you fifty energy credits per burger."" &amp;#x200B; Rather than responding, the human allowed himself to pass out. &amp;#x200B; *** &amp;#x200B; [First](URL | [Previous](URL | Next"

""Indeed XO, it seems mighty mo is back amongst the living....and she's making minced meat out of those fucking birds (as the captain said this he saw as what looked like a string of fire touched one of the giant 15 meter birds immediately tearing its body asunder, what looked like a string of fire was actually the few tracer rounds intermingled within the Barrage of 20mm Munitions fired by the Missouri's 4 CIW Volcan cannons) ain't going to take her long to clear the sky, But we ain't got time to just sit around and watch the show, you said my Guns are back online right?"" ""Yes Sir."" ""Very well then tell the boys to get a move on! I don't want a single one of them Long eard Bastards making it to my island you hear!"" ""Yes sir!"" My Guns began to move for the first time in decades, 9 enormous towers of Steel hallowed and rifled for gigantic shells 16 inches thick and 50 calibers long, Within my turrets over 600 of my children swarm, they fight and struggle to reawaken ancient machinery ment to help them feed my powerful arms, I can feel them as they struggle, their hands feal awkward as they try to do a job they know not how to do, the feeling is refreshing and far from unkown to me but it is far from reassuring, it is the feeling of a brand new crew, it is the glorious feeling of new children, it is a reassurance that the bloodline of my children continue, yet in the heat of battle it is a feeling I would rather not feel, new children are always do slow so inefficient and in battle that could well be their death. It takes my children an eternity to load my guns, and the fire director is no faster to aim them, had this been my last children I would have already fired 3 salvos and been long into the reload of my fourth but I maters not, 9 ships had been chosen by my children And now there was no force that could stop me from annihilating them. Bam! Bam! ""Retargeting Number 2!"" Bam! ""Retargeting 1!"" Bam! Bam! Bam! ""All barrels empty in number 3!"" Bam! ""Retargeting 1!"" Bam! ""1 is Empty!"" Bam! ""All shells flying in number 2, bombardment complete!"" At 2,700 pounds of steel and high explosive each of Missouri's Super heavy Shells where designed to punch trough and savage the Yamato the most powerful Battleship humanity ever created, yet rather than this making them the perfect shell I created a great vulnerability, a vulnerability that would keep all 9 ships alive even after being hit by such a weapon. As the shells flew true and found their target they impacted on the Magisteel plating that protected the Dominion Warships, The shells cut trough the relatively thin armour like a bullet trough a sheet of paper and then continued all the way through the ships and out into the water where the concrete like resistance of the water finally triggered their explosive cores, besides a 16 inch hole cut straight trough the vessels they remained otherwise unharmed. ""Fuck! Minimal effect on Targets, all shells failed to detonate!"" ""Calm down!, Call turrets 1 and 2, tell them load High expo, tell 3 to load submunition cluster shells"" ""Submunition cluster shells captain, we have such a thing?"" ""They were built in the 80s, they were decommissioned before they entered mass production, they never saw combat but we decided to keep the prototypes just in case of a rainy day."" ""Alright sir sending out orders"" They were unbelievably slow, their training and experience was well below that of any children I had ever had, it took them entire minutes to load each of my guns, yet as they did I continued my vengeance upon the enemys that swarmed the sky, it had been a full 10 minutes since I had awoken and already half their number had been torn out of the skies, but they were getting smarter, no longer did they cluster together allowing me o whipe out entire groups in a single burst, now I had to waste much more amunition then necessary to kill each one, amunition Wich was quickly becoming scarce, I no longer believed I could whipe out all of the enemies in the sky, but as the last of my guns was loaded and my turrets retargeted the enemy warships I became certain that I could at least scorch the seas. Bam! ""Retargeting 1!"" Bam! Bam! ""Retargeting number 2"" Bam! ""Retargeting 1!"" Bam! ""Retargeting Number 3"" Bam! ""Retargeting Number 3"" Bam! ""Number 1 is dry!"" Bam! ""All rounds out in number 2!"" Bam! ""Number 3 is clear!"" ""Bombardment complete sir."" The Heavy shells that flew twards the ships this time where not like the last ones, in deed they would have been worthless against the thick armour of a battleship or a heavy cruiser, but against the thin skin of a Destroyer or a cargo ship? Against such foes the high explosive shells where almost Apocalyptically Effective. As the first Shell made contact with a Magisteel Clad Dominion Man O War it's effectiveness was made Clear, the enormous shell cut trough the armour Wich offered enough resistance to trigger it's fuze, fractions of a second later as the shell flew but a few feet past the armour and within the vessel it exploded, the wooden Magisteel clad ship never stood a chance against such a weapon, the explosion ment to obliterate armoured bulkheads and eat trough steel hallways and rooms simply raged unchallenged, the unstoppable wave of destruction simply consumed all it tuched, finally the ship it's self burst open revealing the Hell within for all the world to see, all of this happened in but fractions of a second and was repeated through out 6 more ships across the Dominion Fleet, all 6 ships had been completely and unmistakably obliterated, their crews had been exterminated so quickly after the explosion that none even knew they had been hit, and now the dead hulks quickly began to sink, their Grisly wounds having completely destroyed their ability to float. But 2 ships survived and even though the 3rd had been fatally wounded she was still struggling to stay afloat, this ships had been hit by Cluster shells, the shells released over a hundred submunitions, each submunition was as powerful as a hand Granade but had never been designed for use against Ships, the submunitions had next to no armour penetrating capacity as they had been designed for use against infantry. ""Confirmed 6 kills Captain, all High Expo shells where extremely effective against the enemy warships, Cluster Shells had limited effect against their targets."" ""Hum...So the pointy eard bastards actually armour their warships then? I'm going to have to make a note of that, XO order all guns to load High Expo and to keep Shooting until all enemy ships are under the waves."" 35 minutes, it took only 35 minutes for Missouri to Obliterate every single enemy ship, many tried to escape her wrath but with a range of almost 20 miles none managed to escape her main guns, when the last few warships went Bellow the waves the enemie's savaged air Force finally retreated. &lt; 4 hours later&gt; Captain Morgan kicked the blood and water drenched head of an enemy on the beach, he noticed the fact that it had not only been completely separated from it's body but that most of it's neck had been ripped apart, he immediately knew this was the result of a direct hit by a 20mm and he felt no remorse at all as he saw the head fly far into the pitch black ocean. ""What kind of sick bastards would do This?"" "" What do you mean cauptain?"" "" Launch an attack like this, I mean look at this (the captain gets down and picks up a severed finger, tight on the finger is a masterfully crafted golden ring with a blue stone on the center, the stone glows an eary dim Light.) This is a magic Amp, according to Mr. Stone Beard and Mis. Elder wood this thing magnifies magic making it far more powerful, this thing is apparently also worth 30 or so times it's weight in gold."" ""Holy shit, 30 times! And you just found that laying on the beach!?"" ""That's my point look around us, this Bodies are heavy with expensive magical junk and weapons, I don't know all the specifics of how this world's economy works but I seriously doubt just random soldiers would be equipped with something this rare."" ""Couldn't it just be standardization, and mass production?"" ""Nah, I don't think so Jonson, Mr. Stone Beard said there ain't no way something like this can be mass produced, the ring maybe but the Amp stone on it is a hard no, he said it can take over 1000 hours to make single one, no I think what we faced was some's special little Expeditionary Force."" ""Do we know who's?"" ""Yup, the Veltak Dominion a High elf Nation So anti-Semitic and racially Supremacist it would quite frankly make Nazi Germany Blush, I'll give you 3 chances to guess why they chose to attack us."" ""I only need one, it was the refugees wasn't it?"" ""You are partially right commander, but they weren't the only reason, apparently the Bastards though we where just Another flavor of elf to ad to their collection, or so I have deduced from how detailed the prisoners have made their insults, they truly are quite imaginative when it comes to what they wish to do to our daughters and wifes you see."" "" The Veltak Dominion Right? I'm pretty sure I've herd that name before...........Wait a minute you don't mean the same Veltak Dominion that is one of the 10 world powers Right!?"" ""They are number 8 on that list, they apparently have an extremely powerful Navy and an overwhelming air Force."" "" So long as we can find more high Expo for the 16s I think Missouri should be able to handle their Navy, although I would prefer to get at least some ammo for the 5s and to get the box launchers back online just in case something particularly nasty shows up, the real problem is their air Force."" ""Mo's 4 CIWS just couldn't cut it hum?"" ""They where damned effective, but they were simply not enough for such a flood."" ""....if only we could use our Drones (The captain thought back to the 300 perfectly functional UAV F-99s collecting dust in the near by hangars) but the fucking things require satellites to be controlled!"" "".....wait what about the .....no it's to damaged.... But... could any of it's birds have survived?"" ""What are you talking about son?"" ""Sir what about the Washington!?"" ""She's dead, her Hull got wreaked and is grounded about 1 and a half klicks in land."" ""I don't mean The ship I mean her birds!"" ""Tried it son, those birds are radiated to hell ain't no one going to be able to use em unless they are the hulk."" "".....or a Goblin!"" ""What.......?"" (This is super rough but I just couldn't hold back no more, I really want to Know if you guys like it. I will upload a cleaner version later when I'm done editing it.)"

Thanks to the great idea of* /u/Xaar666666 *this is the prequel to my previous post The Oceans of Blood found* \[Here\]([URL *Since the people seemed to like the last one, who am I to refuse to write more? Constructive criticism is always taken and I hope you enjoy reading my story!* &amp;#x200B; T-Vok-Varkus Tharnus of the T-Ton starship *Valient Bringer Of Justice* left his sleeping room with a crick in his back. That was a bad sign. Days that started with pain usually ended with pain as well. Usually, it was the pain of someone else. He managed to get to the bridge without stabbing anyone, witch for him, was a personal achievement. Report! His first officer, T-Vok-Varsus Taavus, stood up from the chair and stepped aside, raising his hand in a gesture of respect. The rest of the bridge made the same gesture and went back to their work once he waved them aside. All systems are operating at peak efficiency Vok-Varkus. The forbidden line is still quiet, and we have no new contacts to report. Tharnus grunted in response and sat down in the chair. At first, patrolling the edge of the Forbidden zone seemed like a great idea, but as the cycles came and went, the novelty had worn off rather quickly. By WAYLaw any empire with a border to the forbidden zone was mandated to patrol it, to make sure no ships went inside. No one knew what was inside the forbidden zone, but the WAY was very specific. The Forbidden zone, its location mandated on page 509 section 9 subsection 5, shall not be intruded upon by any ship under pain of torture and death. And no exploration of the Forbidden Zone shall be attempted. Pirates often used the very edge of the zone as a base to store their loot and build their ships. They knew that the races of the galaxy could not pass the line in their mighty warships. To combat this new problem the WAYFinders of the galactic council determined that drones and seeking missiles were not classified as ships, and could enter the zone freely. As long as their drones did not explore the area, the WAY was not violated. The races of the galaxy were always trying to finding new loopholes in the WAY, trying to always one-up their peers in the game of interstellar politics. And so the day went. Tharnus sat in his chair brooding on his situation while all around him the mostly controlled chaos of the bridge of a ship ebbed and flowed. The last few days had been strange, to say the least. Pirate ships all across the border were leaving the forbidden zone at full warp, and the pickings were easy. At first, they had wondered if it was another Scourge, but then again, if it was the Scourge, no ships would be left alive to run. And the Scourge had been defeated its fleets were destroyed, their warforms all incinerated. The galaxy had come to the brink of destruction, and the WAY had saved it. Without the WAY the galaxy would never have united and destroyed the Scorge. Much was lost from that time, the only thing that's certain is the WAY. The silence in the bridge brought him out of his near slumber. Silence on a Warbridge is almost unheard of, there is always someone talking and doing the millions of functions required to keep a ship from exploding. Vok-Varsus, What do you want us to do? He straightened up in his chair, evidently, he had missed the question. Every eye on the bridge was fixed on him, and he did not like that. Get back to work! He snarled. The crewmen hurriedly turned back to their workstations, although they were still listening hard. He motioned his First Officer to come closer and said in a low whisper. What was the question. The first officer replied in the same low whisper. There is a ship, coming toward us from inside the Forbidden Zone Tharnus quickly grew angry, and the need to whisper was forgotten. Then arm missiles and kill it! It's only a pirate! The first officer shied back, expecting a hit from the pommel of the ceremonial dagger. But Vok-Varsus, the ship is not a pirate, it is traveling past max warp! Tharuns was stunned. The highest warp speed allowed by the WAY was warp 5. Anything beyond that would only destroy the ship. His ship was capable of Warp 6, but that was only theoretical and definitely illegal. The development of new technology was heavily regulated by the WAY, and certain fields were restricted to the point of stagnation. Even pirates, with their routine breaking of the WAY, would never try such Blasphemy! His next words came slowly, as he needed an excuse to think of what to do. Are. Are they broadcasting anything? His first officer nodded and touched a button to play the sound over the bridge speakers. It was a sequence of pulses, 2. 3.. 5.7.11.13..17.. His brow furrowed and he tried to figure out what it meant. One of the science officers perked up Vok-Varsus! Its the prime numbers! They are trying to see if we understand them! Tharnus smiled as if he knew that all along. Very good Vok-Sarus! Of course, it is the prime numbers! Open a channel, I want to talk to these aliens, such blasphemy must be punished. The First officer nodded and pressed another button on his console. Tharnus straightened up in his chair and put on his best WAYEnforcer voice. Greetings unknown vessel, I am T-Vok-Varkus Tharnus. You are in direct Violation of the WAY. You will drop to sublight speed and cross into normal space to revive judgment. He turned to one of the messengers by his side and whispered. Bring me the WAYFinder, tell him to read the papers of judgment. The alien starship dropped out of warp just across the border, a mere light second away, its transmission stopped and it seemed to be waiting for something. Scan the ship! I want to see what it looks like. A few more tense seconds passed with agonizing slowness before the visual came up on the screen. What in the many hells is that. Across the 10 light second gulf, the captain of the alien starship was equally as confused. What do you mean its Latin? His science officer, Emma Valdez, shook her head. I don't know what else to tell you Captain, the alien ship is speaking Latin. It's a little weird however, new words have been added, and the basic words have changed drastically. However, the basic syntax is still there, and the translation program is making short work or it. Marcus was astounded. The events of the past few days had been certainly interesting. They had found alien ships! Unfortunately, the ships hadn't been too interested in them, as soon as they started broadcasting the ships just turned and ran away. Of course, they could easily overtake them, their ships relied on outdated warp engines. They were painfully slow, and seemed to be held together with duct tape and prayers. One ship, upon activating its warp drive, simply exploded. There were no survivors. All in all, this new alien race was not presenting the most intimidating profile. Many theories were circulating, and the most prominent ones guessed that the new ships were outcasts, or pirates, given the nature of their ships shoddy construction. But this new development was simply too hard to understand. The aliens were speaking Latin? And his ship evidently had committed a crime against this way??. Is the translation routine ready? Emma waved her hand in a so-so gesture. I need more information, so just keep them talking. Marcus rubbed his head, he could feel a headache coming on. Alright, open a channel, let's try common first. Vok-Varsus! A transmission is coming from the enemy ship! It's their language? Why would they not be speaking WAYSpeak, what kind of savages are these? Tharnus frowned, more blasphemy. They weren't moving to cross the border, and they certainly were not preparing to receive judgment. The design of the alien ship was completely different than the norm. There was no upper bridge section, there was no viewing room, there were no windows! No gold decoration, nothing denoting the wealth of their race, no markings besides some letters and numbers on the side. There wasn't even a kill count! All respectable ships had their amount of kills painted on the side. The thing was ugly and seemed to be designed with nothing but functionality in mind. What kind of race would do that? Send the full transcript of the WAY, these aliens clearly need reminding what the rules of this galaxy are. Also, prepare missiles and drones, the light of the emperor must be brought to these savages. His first officer grinned, showing his rows of pointed teeth. Judgment is near! The battle cry of the WAY was echoed all through the ship as the crew took up the cry JUDGMENT SHALL PASS! The WAYFinder finally showed up, clutching a sheaf of papers in his hands.. The papers are here His first officer notified him. Good, Start the process, I want this over as soon as possible. Captain, they are arming missiles and drones! The shout came from his tactical officer and Marcus wheeled around to face him. What? Another shout came from his science officer. Captain! We are receiving another transmission. It looks like a legal document? Emma looked at him, confusion etched on her face. It's over 800 pages long Marcus sat back down in the captain's chair. Is the translation program working yet? She frowned I'm no miracle worker, but it should be good enough. Marcs tried to remember the first contact greeting, failed, and decided to channel his best Picard Unknown ship, I am Captain Marcus Sanson of the Federation starship *Hawking*. You are arming weapons, if you fire them, this could be construed as a declaration of war. Be warned, we will defend ourselves. Laughter erupted across the *Valiant Bringer Of Justice* as the message came through. Those primitives think they can defeat us! We will end them and their puny ship! Death to the WAYBreakers! Tharnus stopped the laughing with a gesture as he signed the last document. Prepare for Battle! Destroy the Heretics! The Fury of the Gods launched from the *Valiant Bringer Of Justice*, the Hammer of the gods class was the most powerful class of battleship ever constructed, and nothing could withstand its barrage of missiles. As he waited, Marcus looked at an image of the ship in the holo-pit. It was incredibly badly designed, everything seemed to be designed to look as intimidating as possible. The end result of all this was a slightly gaudy and less than functional design. I mean, who has windows on a starship?? Why would you want that structural vulnerability when you could just use video screens? Granted, the ship was 10 kilometers long, and the *Hawking* was only 500 meters. Vlad, the tactical officer, a giant of a man with a soft Russian accent spoke from his station. Captain, they are launching missiles. They are very slow, their acceleration is 26.55 Gees, and their yields are only 500 kilotons. However, there are four hundred of them, and we will be undoubtedly destroyed if they all hit us at once. I predict a 99.9 percent chance we can easily destroy all the missiles if they have countermeasures equivalent to their seeming technological level. If they have countermeasures equivalent to us, I would advise retreat. Marcus smiled at calm and matter of fact assessment of the situation, Vlad always gave the facts straight, never any hint toward optimism or pessimism. Very well, Let's test our that theory, set 2 missiles to their lowest setting and fire them at the enemy missiles, we have to find out their capabilities. Hernandez, find out what this WAY is and why they aren't moving closer in to engage us. Hernandez, his legal officer, nodded and started to scan the document. 2 Eagle class missiles shot out of the tubes and immediately accelerated. The variable yield missiles could easily accelerate up to a thousand gravities and had a yield of anywhere between 5 and 100 megatons. They were one of the smaller missiles. Tharnuss mouth fell open. The missiles the enemy launched were traveling at simply insane velocities. The WAY limited missile acceleration to 5 gravities, and their yields to 10.47 vagons. This was so far off the WAY that he couldn't comprehend it. And then the missiles detonated. The explosion took out 72 missiles in an instant. 84 more missiles were destroyed by the radiation and debris wave. It was illegal to destroy missiles with other missiles, and while he hadn't expected heretics to follow the way, their sheer disregard of it astounded him. For the second time today, complete silence reigned on the bridge. Across the gulf of space, soft laughter and sighs of relief filled the CIC of the little human ship. Vlad, always the analyzer, calmly stated: Given the new information, and if the alien ship has no more hidden weaponry we cannot detect, we will win this engagement with very little chance of risk to the *Hawking*. Marcuss eyebrows raised. Vlad not using a percentage meant that the odds were very low indeed. Almost guaranteed. Very well, wait until the missiles get into laser range and destroy them. No sense wasting any ammo. Send out a few missiles on standby, just in case any get through. Vlad nodded and the ship shuddered slightly, two missiles took up positions around the ship to intercept any missiles the lasers missed. A few more seconds passed and the missiles passed into laser range. The powerful antimatter lasers destroyed them easily, and soon the field of battle was empty. The enemy has no more weapons besides low power railguns and short-range plasma coilguns. Their remaining missiles can be easily dealt with. Vlad said matter of factly. Marcus pressed the button that opened comms. Enemy ship, you have no weapons left. Please stand down or we will be forced to destroy you. The reply came shortly. We will never surrender to you heretics! You will all die! Marcus sighed and rubbed his head again. Oh yeah. Definitely a headache. Vlad, fire the two standby missiles, set for minimum yield. Time their arrival with 2 railgun shots from our main cannon. Vlad nodded and then sighed. Captain, they are firing the rest of their missiles. They will take several minutes to get here, so we have some time. Marcus considered for a moment. Good. Turn on stealth mode and coast the missiles past theirs, if they are firing everything they have we'll only have coilguns to deal with. And based on the past performance of their tech, I believe that is a battle we can win. I don't want to destroy the ship, I just want to teach them that the federation is not a pushover The sensors detected the missiles when they were fired, but they could not achieve a proper lock on the target, the missiles seemed to be disappearing and reappearing from the sensors at random intervals. As the enemy missiles passed his own wave of missiles, Tharnus realized his mistake. Raise shields! Blind fire the coilguns! We must destroy their missiles! Remarkably, the sheer amount of coilguns actually succeeded in destroying one of the missiles, and the second one impacted the shields with an explosion that would be seen in a few years on T-Sarvuvs with a good enough telescope. Then the railgun rounds hit. The first one smashed through the shields and scattered white-hot plasma all across the flank of the *Justice* at relativistic speeds. Major damage across all decks! The main reactor is down! Ftl drive is down! Tharsus got up off the floor from where the massive jolt had knocked his chair over. Prepare to fir- Then the second railgun shot hit. This one was set to scatterfire, and when it was less than a kilometer from the enemy ship, it exploded, sending more shards of metal into the enemy ship at a frankly insane velocity. The *Valiant Bringer Of Justice* simply went pop. The two halves of the ship were sent spinning into space, spraying frozen fluids and bodies into the void. And now, on the human ship, Silence reigned. &amp;#x200B; \[Previous\]([URL \[Next\]"

Theres no need for your presence here on the station. If you want to talk to the Erialyichi, theres no reason why we cant simply use coms. Having you here is an unnecessary risk. Prime Minister Tehrani waved his concerns aside. General, at this level of negotiation, a face-to-face meeting is absolutely essential. To hide behind a viewscreen would be a sign of weakness, and considering the situation we now find ourselves in, we dare not show even a *hint* of vulnerability. Besides, I have every confidence in the ability of you and your Gendarmes to keep me safe. She picked up a folder, briefly perusing its contents. This*Sophoi* Enuzai. Do you believe him? I do, he said quietly. His story hangs together all too well, and after speaking with the Doctors Liao, the technical data he was able to provide...what there was of it...supports their working hypothesis in regards to the object. And after the way the Erialyichi reacted He sighed, and shook his head. My gut tells me hes on the level, *although* Im also willing to bet hes not telling us everything. She nodded in agreement. If I were in his position, I wouldnt reveal my hole cards either. The question is, whats he holding? A Full House...or a busted Flush? I wish I knew, the General said unhappily. His anger towards the Erialyichi is real, theres no doubt in my mind about that. The problem is that as long as hes cooperating with our investigation, I cant exactly lean on him to learn what hes hiding. Im convinced that as long as he sees us as a way to strike back at them, hell help us anyway that he can. But hes got another agenda, I can damn well *smell* it. I just have no idea what it is. Politics...and Diplomacy...makes for strange bedfellows, the Prime Minister said with a shrug. Its a fact of life. But keep digging, whatever else he has planned, I want to know about it. Understood, Mrquez nodded. Meanwhile...its time I prepared for my meeting, she said smoothly. Any last minute advice? Yeah*stall*, he answered...though there was little optimism in his tone she could pull it off. --- **Captain** Tsushai, the Prime Minister said with a warm smile, I am pleased you were able to make time to speak with me. The honor is mine, Prime Minister, he replied, gracing her with a formal bow. Your request for a meeting was *most* unexpected. *Like* Hell *it was*, she thought grimly, as she motioned for them to take their seats. If she hadnt extended an invitation, there was no doubt in her mind he would have been requesting an audience on his own. But that was how the game was played, with lying smiles...and concealed daggers. As they made themselves comfortable, one of the General Mrquezs security experts...in disguise as a waiter...wheeled in a small cart and parked it beside her, before disappearing back the way hed came. I understand you have a fondness for some of our more exotic teas, she said as she reached for the glazed teapot and began to pour. This is aged Narcissus Wuyi Oolong, quite possibly the finest example you are likely to find. Setting the pot aside she passed a cup over to him, before taking a sip from her own. Tsushai waited for the Prime Minister to drink, before responding in kind. There was formality to these meetings, most important of which being that rank must always be observed. The leader of an entire world took precedence over a mere ships captain, so it was simply good business to wait until she had tasted the proffered brew herself. ...all of which was yet *another* lie, of course. In their eyes, *any* Erialyichi stood higher in rank than a mere alien, world leader or no. Besides, it was simple prudence to let her drink first. Less chance of being poisoned that way. They took a moment to enjoy their drinks, before readying their opening salvos. First off, allow me to apologize for that distasteful scene in the Bazaar, Georgianne Tehrani said with disapproval. I have spoken with General Mrquez, and expressed my displeasure in the strongest terms possible. I can assure you, it will not happen again. No apology is necessary, Tsushai replied. In fact, his restraint during the encounter was quite admirable. The Prime Minister inclined her head, and set down her cup. Well, to business then. I understand you are still interested in purchasing the object in question? I am, the Captain agreed. As you know, the Erialyichi Plutocracy is *always* interested in new and unusual discoveries...of which this most certainly qualifies. Even the most cursory of examinations reinforce my belief. In the spirit of trade, I am prepared to offer a sum of ten million credits, in either direct currency payment, or an equivalent of goods and technology transfers. He smiled politely, as he awaited her response. It was only a lifetime of politics that kept her expression neutral. Ten million credits was *unheard* of, in fact the last five Bazaars combined wouldnt even come close to that amount. But it wasnt the money that sent a sudden chill down her spine. Tsushai had overplayed his hand, sending a clear signal of just how badly his superiors wanted that strange black object safely in their possession. She had hoped for a much lower opening bid, allowing them to keep up the pretense of a simply business arrangement, at least in the beginning. But *this*...ten million wasnt simply an opening bid. It was a gauntlet hurled at her feet. She busied herself, refreshing her cup, as she pretended to mull it over. A *most* impressive offer, Captain, she said carefully. It seems...uncharacteristically generous, in fact. Not at all what I have come to expect from the Erialyichi. Her eyes twinkled as she twisted the blade. You havent gone *soft*, have you? My superiors and I simply wish to ensure a smooth and uneventful transfer, Prime Minister, he said serenely. In addition, we are prepared to add an additional incentive. His smile grew slightly more sharklike. We are also willing to pay a further million credits...directly to your personal account. The Captain leaned back in his chair, sipping his tea. Call it a fee, for services rendered. Georgianne closed her eyes, and set down her cup. A straight up bribe. To someone like General Mrquez, the closest thing Earth had to a soldier these days, Tsushais offer would be an insult to his honor, but not a *threat*. To him threats involved physical violence, not a few words bandied across a table. But she and he came from very different worlds, and fought on very different battlefields. By offering her a bribe, without pretense, it was a clear sign the Erialyichi were playing hardball, and that they would *not* take No for an answer. Again...quite generous, she murmured. Unfortunately, it seems there are larger issues at hand that could...complicate matters. For one, my scientists inform me that their initial findings may have been premature. They would like additional time to examine the object, in order to give a more complete report. That will not be necessary, Tsushai replied tersely. Our own scientists are quite capable of examining the object, should that be required. Of course, she said evenly, however, they are being quite...insistent. They are even prepared to raise the issue before the Assembly, in open session. Questions will be asked. I simply ask for time to deal with this matter, quietly. Surely there is no rush? Even as she said it, she knew how weak the ploy was. Shed walked into that room with a pair of deuces, and whats worse, Tsushai *knew* that. The Erialyichi held all the cards in this game, and they were bound and determined to keep it that way. She could bluff and bluster all she wanted, but when came time to lay her cards on the table...a pair of measly twos werent going to take the pot. Im afraid thats quite impossible, Tsushai informed her, as all traces of good humor disappeared. *Acquisition* is on a rather tight schedule, as we are expected shortly at our next port of call. So, I must *insist* we conclude our business in a timely manner. His eyes seemed to bore into hers. You understand, of course? I do, she said quietly, but Im afraid at this time, I must refuse your request. Such simple words. Such...final words. Prime Minister, you are making a grave mistake, the Captain said cooly. You are being influenced by an individual who is...mentally unbalanced. He managed a sad, remorseful grimace. *Sophoi* Enuzais homeworld suffered a great catastrophe, many years ago, and Im afraid the loss was too much for him. While the disaster was completely natural, he needed someone to blame, and focused that rage and despair upon my own people. I do not blame him for this, but you should not allow yourself to be swayed by the ravings of a madman. I simply ask for more time, to study the situation, she said desperately. That he was trying to paint Enuzai as a lunatic was no surprise. That he had waited this long to do so simply showed how hollow the lie truly was. Time is a luxury I cannot grant you, Prime Minister, he said darkly. You are courting a dangerous insult to the Erialyichi if you continue on this course. Perhaps even to the point...of Embargo. And there it was. The ultimate threat. Or perhaps penultimate, given what theyd learned. I would regret that, she heard herself saying, but we have survived eons on our own. We will do so again...if we have to. A pity, Captain Tsushai said quietly, setting down his cup and rising to his feet. My ship will remain docked for one planetary rotation, in case you change your mind. He bowed his head. Thank you for the tea. I will see myself out. He turned, and left the room. Georgianne Tehrani, Prime Minister of Terran Confederacy, sat in silence in the meeting room, as she stared into the abyss. Woodenly, she reached for her com unit. Mrquez responded immediately. How did it go? he asked. She took a deep breath. Batten down the hatches, General, she said sadly. ...it seems that a storm is coming. [First](URL I [Previous](URL"

So far, there have been no breakthroughs. Except that subject D-1 found a vulnerability in the system. A systematic approach? I hadnt expected that from someone like him. Not really. Its just that, when hes shooting from extreme distances, he so sincerely wants to hit ""at least something"" that the system counts any hit as an ""accurate shot"" and increases its damage to that of a critical one. Funny. But we should get rid of that bug. Send an explanation and some compensation to subject D-1. **Emma Sullivan** When, after sleeping in his office, Dan called me first thing in the morning, I immediately figured that it would be the best moment to apologize. But he behaved as if nothing had happened. He winked at me with a surprising degree of familiarityit was clear that hed learned who I was and had decided to turn the tables. This was so despicable, especially for a person Id respected so much. It would be better if you told me how I can write myself a bonus check for doubling our turnover. At first, Id thought he was joking, but the figures on the screen said the opposite. How could he have made so much money in one night? To be honest, I didnt know of any possible way to do so, including the illegal ones. I instructed him on how to fill out the necessary form, returned to my seat, and tried to track the movement of the funds in our accounts during the night. But once again, it was a dead endthe very first transaction went to a counterparty, and none of my programs were able to track it and break through the data protection to discover which one it had gone to. *Well, Dan, youve covered your tracks well and decided to play with me. Do you think you can get away with this?* **Samantha Hollins** Id called him to discuss the details of our business meeting but he was so earnest about making it a date that I simply couldnt refuse. Id read about such things in books, Id fantasized about it even more, but how was it actually done in the real world? **Author's note:** Hi! The next update will be on Monday!"
56,vulnerability,HFY,Variance,319,b6baaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/b6baaf/variance/,2019-03-28 10:11:57,"Professor Karrakzal didnt get many visitors, let alone those wearing onyx-scale suits. The government types cared about the work done on the lower tiers of the spire. The handling of uplift, and Class Four and Class Five sapient relations constituted important, valuable work. Low-class sapient analysis was a mundane, boring endeavor. The professors domain was that of nerds and theoreticians. Onyx-scales had no business here. Except today, evidently they did. Weve reviewed the data from the initial probe, and in your archives. The suits made it impossible for the professor to tell the two apart, but the one on the left spoke up first. However, we would appreciate it if you could provide any additional analyses you may have completed on species C2-5746114-03, with alternate self-identifications human, homo sapiens, mensch, Rn de, mnsklig, vete a la mierda, and chelovek. Karrakzal waved his tentacles across the screen to bring up the data he had. Glancing at it, nothing stood out as particularly abnormal, certainly nothing that might explain such high profile visitors. Rather standard class two sapient species, The professor said, reading off the screen. The probe caught them more or less at the height of their civilization. The probe identified steam powered transportation and mechanical manufacturing techniques in some regions but not others. The analytical perception test we administered puts them smack dab in class two territory, and this level of technology is consistent with the maximum expected from that level of sapient. Its likely theyve been in a holding pattern for the last few thousand orbits. The regions that stumbled on the necessary designs will dominate the others, withholding the technology to prevent resource depletion. May I ask why you are interested in this species? Weve found thousands just like them. There was a testing anomaly. Right onyx-scale said. One of them obtained a perfect score. The professor glanced back at his screen, then sighed. I wouldnt worry about that. As I have to explain to everyone who comes through here, it doesnt mean what you think it means. Analytical perception tests have a high level of variance between individuals of the same species. Theres also the possibility of pure dumb luck. We have thousands of probes, and each tests hundreds of species. Given that testing is automated, anomalies are inevitable. We get outliers. Thats why we go by the median score. Its not as if the intrinsic aptitude level ever varies within a species to the same degree as the test reports. That phenomenon is a statistical artifact. Suppose it wasnt, Right onyx-scale suggested. How would you know? The professor waved his eye stalks in confusion. Thats ridiculous. Of the hundreds of sapients weve studied in-depth, not once has such a thing been reported. Its down to evolution. After a certain point, intelligence is the most valuable trait a species can have. Selective pressure ensures that the smartest individuals survive, and the less intelligent die. High intellectual variability doesnt make any sense, the less intelligent individuals will simply be bred out of the population. But why does that mean intellect will be consistent within the population? Why doesnt it keep increasing, a class two civilization graduating to class three or class four? Left-onyx asked. Well, sometimes sapients do evolve into a higher class. The professor agreed. But its rare, and if it happens, it happens slowly. Millions of orbits slowly. Usually though, species hit what we call a local maximum. A given biological body-plan can only attain a certain level of ability. They plateau there, and then they stay there. Over time, anyone who doesnt measure up dies, and eventually they die from the inevitable consequences of resource depletion. It takes a minimum of class four intellect to develop the fusion technology to overcome the problem. So they're stuck, and then they die before they can evolve. The professor snapped his beak in irritation. He felt as if he was lecturing a dim-witted pupil. It takes millions of orbits for even a class five civilization to develop from the first use of primitive metals to the point where theyre ready to leave their home world. Longer for the less intelligent, lower class civilizations. Over that length of time, evolutionary pressure will inevitably maximize and then homogenize intellectual capacity within the species. You didnt answer my question, Right-onyx said. Suppose, just a for a moment, that such variability is *possible.* How would you go about testing for it? The only way to tell would be to test a much larger sample-size, Karrakzal. That is, you would need to test far more individuals, more than a standard probe could realistically handle. Their technology level at the single time-point the probe does its work doesnt tell us anything. If you could analyze the language, there might be tell-tale signs of it, but again: youd need a very large sample size of their language to decode it properly. Those designations we record? They mean nothing to us, we cant decode them without a data set far larger than the probes are designed to provide. But, as Ive been trying to tell you, there would be no point. Theres no such thing as an intelligent civilization that has significant intellectual variability! Oh, a thought occurred to him. Were not talking about species with internal variants are we? There are species with different forms, with only one intelligent one. However, the probes can distinguish between significantly different life stages, and focus on only the intelligent stage of development. But that isn't something that applies to the species you were asking about. The eye stalks of the two visitors stared back at him. They remained silent, the lack of response communicating that his previous comment was not, in fact, helpful. Right Onyx broke the silence. What do you think a class six civilization would look like? Karrakzal folded his eye stalks into a spiral shape to communicate his amusement. Given weve never met one, its impossible to say. At this point, that ones down to the entertainment networks to figure out. Those of us who prefer to ground ourselves in fact can only say that its impossible to know. Allow me to clarify my question, Right-onyx said. Consider a species with sufficient aptitude to be classified as a six. Such a species would advance *faster,* would they not? What if they went from metal-working to interplanetary exploration in less than five thousand orbits? Would evolutionary pressure be sufficient to homogenize their aptitude that quickly? Um. Well. . . That was a genuinely novel idea, in the professors own field of study that he had never heard before. That didnt happen very often. Oh, wait! He exclaimed. Youre not actually from downstairs, are you? You had me going there. This is for a new high-budget entertainment syndication, isnt it? I have to say, its brilliant. An entirely new take on the whole Class Six encounter. I'm impressed! Right Onyx twirled his left eye stalk, communicating wry amusement. ""Let's suppose you're right. Well done. Why don't you describe how you think it would be best to proceed with such a syndication? How would expect such a class six species that evolved in this manner to behave? What narrative would be consistent for the first contact in the pilot episode?"" ""Oh, wow,"" The professor was excited now. ""I have to say these syndications are often so unrealistic, it's a real pleasure to be part of something this original. Although..."" he hesitated. ""Please go on,"" Left Onyx insisted. ""I understand that you've put a lot of thought into this idea, but you have to realize, this won't work for one of the high-value cerebral syndication channels. What would actually might happen, well... You know the low-budget, generally terrible, shock-style programming that's more popular with the Class Four members of the consortium, than the Fives? That's what you might get. It could be really ugly."" ""Explain."" Once again the professor was forced to elaborate on concepts that any first-orbit researcher would be familiar with. ""High intelligence is associated with increased capacity for strategic thinking and delayed gratification. This, more than anything else is responsible for reigning in whatever violent tendencies exist within a species. No matter how aggressive, violent or bigoted a species may be, we've found the capacity for long-term planning to the most important requirement for negotiation. The ability to delay gratification of baser instincts in order to serve a higher goal, however objectionable we may find that goal, is what makes rational diplomacy possible."" Karrakzal stretched out his left eye stalk and retracted his right. ""On the other stalk, Class Two levels of impulse control have some very negative implications for diplomacy. Irrational outbursts and violence are the norm. There will be frequent discussion and obsession with primal urges such as nutrient consumption, procreation and waste excretion. Now, consider: If we have a society that's actually a heterogeneous mix of Classes stretching from One or Two to Six, then it's going to be borderline absurd. Imagine if a Class One or Two was put in a position of leadership over Class Six. Which, as far as we know, doesn't actually exist. Say, Is this a comedy? You could probably make a comedy with that premise."" ""Hmm,"" Right Onyx mused. ""Obsession with procreation. Would a religious crusade to eradicate incest fit the bill?"" ""Umm. Wow."" These suits were full of surprises. ""Yes, that would be very much in line with a Class Two mentality. So, what's the next step? Do I need to sign a non-disclosure agreement for the project?"" The eyes of his two visitors turned towards each other, then back. ""There is no syndication planned. We are from downstairs."" ""So, what are you doing here?"" Once again, Karrakzal was confused. ""As I'm sure you are aware, standard testing cycles are every two to three hundred orbits. The species in question is due for another,"" Left Onyx said. ""Yes, so?"" ""The probe assigned returned ahead of schedule, two days ago,"" Left Onyx said. ""There was a second testing anomaly."" ""Ahead of schedule? Was there a new Class Four discovery?"" A high-class discovery was the only reason a probe would return ahead of schedule. ""I didn't hear anything about that. Unless-- Did this species jump classifications to a Four or Five?"" ""No. On both counts."" Right onyx said. ""The median is still a Two. But there was another testing anomaly. And there were fewer samples this time."" ""What?"" That didn't make any sense. ""The probes always collect the same number of samples. How is that even possible? Was there data corruption?"" ""As my colleague just informed you,"" Right Onyx said, ""There was a testing anomaly."" ""Yes,"" Left Onyx confirmed. ""One of the subjects escaped the testing chamber. Would you call that a -- what was the phrase you used? A 'statistical artifact?'"" ""That's impossible,"" The professor insisted. ""Once inside, they're more secure than prison cells!"" ""We thought so too,"" Left Onyx agreed. ""The reason we know that it isn't impossible is because we have high-def holos of one of these creatures doing it. This thing dismantled the input pad connected to the testing station, reverse engineered a system completely alien to it, and then exploited a vulnerability in the programming to gain access to the other systems in the probe. We've never seen anything like it."" The professor stared, gaping at his guests. ""Now, The question you *should* be asking, is this:"" said Right Onyx. ""If the creature took control of the probe, how did we receive the data back? Is that what you're wondering?"" In fact, he was still trying to decide whether or not this was a prank of some sort. He wasn't sure what to say, so he merely waved his middle three tentacles in agreement. ""Good. The reason we know this is because, as I said, the probe returned early. It turns out these creatures have already advanced to building primitive space vehicles. They've not only reverse engineered the probe systems, they have bolted one such vehicle onto our probe and navigated back into our territory. They failed to deactivate data-broadcast feature of the probe, though we have no way of knowing whether this was intentional. There was also sufficient information in this data for our translation systems to at interpret much of their language."" ""*What?*"" Karrakzal reiterated. ""That's impossible. Less than three hundred orbits ago they were using steam power. Even a Class Five--"" ""Class Six."" said Left Onyx. ""Definitely Class Six. Anyway, as I was saying, we don't know whether they intended us to get the main data dump. However, they explicitly made a broadcast of their own on a separate channel. This was fifty centirotations ago, just after they arrived at Tallzan Four. That was where the probe was originally assembled, though the creatures have since detonated enough fusion devices to turn the entire surface into a lifeless wasteland."" ""*What???*"" ""There will be a public announcement within the next twenty centirotations. Teams are gathering as much information as we can from experts such as yourself before that time. Here is our best attempt at a translation of the message they sent prior to ending over twelve billion lives."" The dull monootone of the translation failed to convey the emotion that was likely intended in the message. ""Listen closely, progenitor breeders. We know you were testing us. But, we found your probe, which resembled excrement. Your computer coding resembles excrement. We thought our own excrement-laden code was full of buffer overflow vulnerabilites but yours is even more excrement-laden than anything we have created. You managed to surprise us. Congratulations. ""We know you were testing us. Now we think it's time to test you. We have what we call a test ban treaty at home, which means we don't test certain excrement on our home planet. We do not wish to breed with our home planet. Therefore we are going to test some excrement on your planet. Evaluate what is to come closely, progenitor breeders."" ""Then they blew up the planet,"" Right Onyx said. ""We're pretty sure the references to excrement are metaphors, but we're not certain whether this progenitor breeding obsession is another metaphor or some sort of fanatic religious imperative against incest. Can you offer any insight on the matter?"""

I know what it is, Daniels gaze didnt budge from the weapon. Ive just never seen one this close. Or at all. Well, not - you know - in the flesh. Well Ive never seen a human - you know - in the flesh, but you dont see me gawping at you. I want to send it to Zone 19A. I was told this was the place to come to. Daniel looked up, slowly and reluctantly, as though the gun had a strong magnetic pull that only his eyes were attracted to. Looking back at him were the seventeen blinking pupils of a Bestia. It wore a knitted cardigan and a pair of blue jeans which were secured to the sinews of its waist with a piece of fraying string. Daniel had seen pictures of them, but, much like the gun, he had never been close enough to touch one. This one was taller and uglier than he had imagined. Sorry- Daniel hesitated. Was this a sir or a madam? Or something else entirely? It was hard to tell. The translation glass had a habit of morphing voices, furnishing them with a robotic quality that often masked feminine and masculine tones. Did Bestias even have feminine and masculine tones? Daniel suspected that they probably did not. Suffice to say, there were no visual clues to aid his enquiry either. Sorry, but any contraband items can only be sent with a license. Are you in possession of a license? The question had an almost rhetorical whiff, as though Daniel had already concluded with absolute certainty that this Bestia was more likely to have a crippling drug habit than a license for sending weapons interdimensionally. But the Bestia began to shuffle through the pockets of its jeans. Daniels chair creaked under the shifting of his weight; a hot, heavy dread thawing away at his initial cynicism. He had worked at the Interdimensional Delivery Office for just three days, and was yet to complete his Basic Training Programme. He only knew about the license thanks to the crude posters plastered onto the walls of the waiting room. *Speciesism is NOT Tolerated in This Office. Our First Class Service Promises Instant Delivery. Posting Contraband? Youll Need a License.* The shuffling stopped, and a triangular card no bigger than an Earth apple emerged from its right pocket. Its lettering morphed as the Bestia slid it underneath the translation glass. Daniel scrutinised it, though he was unsure exactly what he was supposed to be looking at. Its been poking my leg all day, it said. Gods only know why they made it a triangle. *Name: Ineta Blaine* *Age: 192* *Sex: P* *Birthplace: Exeus 13* Daniel was out of his depth. The picture couldve been of any Bestia, though Speciesism regulations were strict and any query into the likeness could be interpreted as a contravention. Exeus 13 had a reputation, too. Daniel had heard things about it. Humans kept in cages, farmed for their skin. Stories. Probably just stories. He swallowed the thud of his heart, which had grown within him like a beast waking from its slumber. Im afraid Ill need to talk to my manager. Ive only been working here for three days, you see. Daniel was alone. His manager, a portly human from New Earth who wore too much makeup to cover too little sleep, had made it very clear that she did not work nights. This, she explained, was why Daniel had been hired. Bring a book, she had said on his first shift, nobody comes in after 50. The Bestia leaned on the counter, exposing its grey, fibrous wrists. Its breath steamed the translation glass as it spoke. Daniel - it is Daniel, isnt it? My pronunciation isnt the best. Daniel nodded, wondering whether his name tag was a blessing or a curse. Daniel. I know someone else called Daniel. He was a human, too- I thought you hadnt seen another human before? Daniel said it without realising, and immediately wished he hadnt. The Bestia ignored him. Daniel liked to play instruments. Daniel was a good cook. Daniel had three daughters. Daniels throat throbbed - the human body was not built for concealing fear. The Bestias mouth curved at the edges; a sickening smile. Its eyes flickered over the lines in Daniels face; studying it, searching for vulnerability. It leaned even closer. You know, he looked a lot like you actually. Daniel tried to force indignation. There must be a lot of Daniels in the Universes, he shrugged. The smile bulged. Daniel could hear the saliva click in its mouth. The four fingers on its left hand began to tap the counter in a wave. Not many with a birthmark on their left shoulder, though. Daniels eyes widened on the Bestia. How...how did you. I dont ha-, You do, Daniel. Its actually shaped a bit like my license there. Its usually red but it turns brown in the sun. You hate it. Daniel did not speak. He could not speak. He was paralysed. Ive met you, in Zone 19A, of all places. Another you, of course, but you all the same. Can you believe theres another Daniel Peterson in these universes that is a father to three children? That means theres another Daniel Peterson that has actually gotten laid - three times, no less. I would say congratulations, but I cant say you deserve too much of the credit. Daniel clasped his palms together, moist and trembling. His mouth was suddenly dry, as though his sweat glands had drawn all of the moisture from his body. Id love to help, but Im not authorised to- Daniel. Perhaps this will help. The Bestia produced a padded envelope from the pocket of its cardigan. Daniel had been warned that bribes in the Interdimensional Delivery Office were common and, of course, incredibly frowned upon. He didnt look at it. Im afraid I cant accept- Just look at it, Daniel. Just look. Daniel was afraid of what he might find in the envelope. Another weapon? An explosive? A lock of his own hair? He reached inside, wincing internally as his fingers searched its insides. But they found nothing. Its empty? he said, relief carried by the tremors of his voice. The Bestia gestured toward the underside of the envelope. Look *on* the envelope. Daniel rotated it and peered at a white label, upon which were scrawled letters in handwriting he recognised. It was his handwriting. *Daniel Peterson* *Flat 237, Street 117B* *Citadel 04* *Exeus 09* *Zone 19A* You see, said the Bestia, slapping the counter. Its for you, silly! Well, for another you. I am merely the interdimensional courier you hired. With that, it bowed slightly and laughed. The translator glass interpreted the laughter as the vowel-based dialect of the Plexor region, but Daniel didnt notice. Instead, he continued to stare at the address, trying to comprehend everything that was happening. Why does the other Daniel need a gun? he said at last. The Bestia straightened. Ah. He said you might ask that. Im afraid Im under strict instructions not to tell you. Not worth the hassle, he said. Well, I work at the Interdimensional Delivery Office. I need to know what the weapon is going to be used for. The Bestia placed its elbows on the counter once more. Daniel, what are weapons usually used for? It took the gun and placed it inside the envelope, sealing it with the knuckles of its coiled fingers. Itll need to be sent First Class. In fact- it glanced at the clock, hell need it in about 37 seconds. Do we have a deal? Daniels eyes shifted between the envelope and the Bestia. Could he trust this thing? How did he know that an alternative him wouldnt be shot with this very weapon in Zone 19A? Did that even matter? These thoughts raced across the landscape of his mind like escaped horses, vanishing almost as soon as they materialised. Only one thought presided: that he was just an employee at the Interdimensional Delivery Office. Who was he to deny a postage request? Ill post it, he said at last. Tell him I wish him luck. The Bestia chuckled. He doesnt need luck, Daniel. Hes used one of these before."

Can't wait to see what some of you theorize! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [Previous](URL -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This whole time, you were hiding the fact that you had a goddamn AI in your head?! Saint shouted. THIS WHOLE TIME?! He's just a baby! James retorted. If you say he's harmless, Saint leveled a metal finger at him, I'm gonna smack the shit outta you. He's not harmless, James held his hands up defensively. But he *is* on our side. Yeah, for now. Saint shook her head. And he may be a 'baby', but do you have any idea how fast an AI can grow and learn?! In a couple weeks, he'll be planning the economic downfall of the whole system! Not if he's helping us exact our own brand of revenge. James offered. Oh, fan-fuckin'-tastic, Saint threw her hands in the air. We have our very own anti-Fed rebellion leader! You are certifiable! Now you're just being rude. James crossed his arms, ignoring how his body pinched his skin. Saint turned from James, ignoring the quip. Anything to add, Doc? Doc had found a small med kit under one of the holo-stations, and was patching up a near miss that left a long, red streak across Iso's left shoulder. Having had extensive experience with a number of successful, and unsuccessful, AI, I am inclined to agree with James. Otis seems quite well made. Additionally, if we even attempted to return home, we would be immediately arrested and returned to whomever did this to us. I believe we have no choice, *Ja*? Oh, goddammit. Saint pinched the bridge of her nose. What about you, Iso? Anything? For once, emotion flooded Iso's typically stoic facade, as a wide grin spread across his face. He lifted his unwounded arm, and gave a thumbs up. Fuck all of you. Saint said with a sighed, resigned. How are we even gonna run this ship? These Fed assholes struggled with a skeleton crew, and we don't even have half of that. [Now that I have control of the ship,] Otis chimed suddenly, [I am able to perform the large majority of ship-wide functions on my own.] You've been listening this whole time, haven't you. Saint said after a pause. [Affirmative.] Otis replied. [I understand your trepidation, Saint, but please understand that I only hold ill intent for my original creators. James is a wonderful host, and I would never question his choice in friends.] Yeah, that's not horrifying at all. Saint rolled her eyes. [James, I have completed a ship-wide scan, and have located two more occupied cells. I suspect they are byproducts of the experiment, as well.] Otis ignored Saint's comment. Let them out, Otis. James didn't hesitate. And lead them here. It'll be important to get an official headcount while we set off. We should do introductions when they get here. Saint added sullenly. Get everyone *completely* introduced. Names, nicknames, origin of nicknames, skill sets, stuff like that. Important shit. James smiled at the not-so-subtle jab. Sure, that sounds like fun. I might have to re-introduce myself once I start remembering things, though. Fair enough. Saint set to work gathering what weapons were left from the fire fight, ignoring the cleaning drones that Otis was using to clean up the bodies. Otis had dozens of them neatly disassembling larger pieces into smaller ones, and ushering the smaller pieces deeper into the ship. Doc and Iso were content in watching Saint and James bicker, seemingly unfazed by their new, and somewhat improved, situation. Iso's comfort, James could understand. If he was a criminal in his previous life, this kind of chaos wouldn't faze him. Doc's calm, however, filled James' mind with questions. With his skill set, ranging from medical know-how to an apparent knowledge of cybernetic engineering, Doc could have had any number of jobs before ending up here. James would have to ask him later. In private, if Doc preferred. James refocused on the bridge around him. He hadn't had time to take in his surroundings during the fight, but now... Given the size of the halls they'd come through, James knew the ship had to be huge. But, the bridge gave a whole new meaning to the word. It was a half-oval, a hundred feet across at the widest, and a hundred feet long down the center. Two curved stairways sloped up the side walls, allowing for easy access to the observation deck. The high ceiling that angled slightly fifty feet above gave the bridge a vacuous feel. The main floor had three concentric half-rings formed by officer stations with a wide array of holo-screens that constantly displayed a variety of ever-changing information. The soft, blue glow from the holo-screens was nothing compared to that of the huge holographic display directly beneath the observation deck. The square table-like display sat in front of a large chair, awaiting any number of input commands. If it weren't for the incredible view, the room would be more of a battle-ready command center instead of the bridge of a ship. James spent time wandering around the main deck, occasionally staring out at the countless pinpoints of starlight that peered back at him. Where would they go now? What was the next move? H-hello? A small, shy voice pulled James' mind back to the bridge. Come on in! Saint replied. Don't be shy, nothin' but friends left. A mousy looking woman peered around the bridge threshold with a mixture of wide-eyed fear and wonder, undoubtedly staring at the motley crew of altered humans staring back at her. There's a lot of bodies. The woman shrank back around the corner. Not a very friendly sign. They're the ones responsible for what happened to us, sweetheart. Saint propped her rifle up against the railing of the observation deck. We're the ones that let you out. Oh. The woman stretched to her full six and a half foot height, and stepped into the room with a series of metallic clacks. Her legs had been replaced, but they weren't made in the same style as James'. She had backwards-pointing, extended ankle joints that gave her legs a raptor-like appearance. James noticed Doc's eyes extend and retract with poorly hidden interest. The dark gray metal, which looked lighter than the metal that made up James' body, extended up past her waist and disappeared beneath her scrub-like shirt. Damn, girl! Saint laughed. You've got legs for days! The woman's face turned red as an embarrassed grin spread across her face, but James could see the sadness in her eyes. I just wish I had pants. She kept her eyes on the ground, giving a small, surprised gasp when a cleaning drone wove a tight figure eight around her feet. Dickless wonder over there doesn't even have a shirt. Saint aimed a thumb at James, making him feel very naked. No need to be shy about any of that. What's your name? I'm Amy. The shy woman spared James an embarrassed glance before pointedly staring at the drone by her feet. We followed this thing here. I'm Saint. Saint was more than happy to provide names. Old guy's Doc, quiet one's Iso, and that's James. Wait, 'we'? Oh, um... Amy turned and offered an encouraging wave to someone still hiding outside the bridge. The man that entered seemed perfectly normal at first, but when light hit his skin he looked...rubbery. He was entirely hairless, without eyebrows, eyelashes, or even a hint of facial hair. As he padded in silently on bare feet, he stepped up next to Amy and provided a single, polite nod to the group. He doesn't talk too much, and he doesn't seem to remember anything. Amy placed a hand gently on the man's shoulder. But I call him Ken, because he looks like a hairless doll. Fascinating! Doc had been steadily creeping forward, and was no longer able to contain himself. The only organics that remain seem to be his brain, eyes, and skeletal structure. This should be impossible, but- Keep it in your pants, Doc. Saint gave him a heavy pat on the back. Let's find a place to sit and eat, then talk. Give Otis time to finish cleanin' shit up. Otis? Amy asked. Long story. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- James stood at the head of one of the long tables in the ship's main mess hall, shifting awkwardly from one foot to another. Iso had immediately made his way to the large kitchen area, and was cooking with a silent grace that surprised everyone. Now, everyone was staring expectantly at James. Well, my name is James. I've had a lot replaced, so I don't know the full extent of what my body can do. I seem to have a lot of combat capabilities, which is handy. James realized he was tracing the skin-metal border on his face again, and quickly put his hand down. I also had an AI put in my head, I decided to name him Otis. He's brand new and learning fast, so be nice. He has my memories locked up, but I plan on getting those back pretty soon. Oh, I'd also like to wait on a nickname until after I remember who I was before. Take it away, Otis. [Greetings, new friends!] Otis' voice chimed through the speakers as James took a seat. [I am Otis. I am a symbiotic artificial intelligence, and in the last two hours, I have completely taken over this ships functions. We are currently headed towards an area located along Pluto's orbit, where there is little to no Federation presence. Due to the number of audio receptors throughout the ship, please feel free to ask me questions at any time.] That's not creepy. Saint grumbled. He seems nice. Amy said with a small smile. Nice, my ass. Saint stood. Alright, dipshits, listen up. My name's Meredith Kamali, aka Mary. The first nickname I got in the IPF Marines was 'Bloody Mary', thanks to the fight club I set up for a couple battalions. When I became a Marine Engineer, the officers started calling me 'Saint Mary' or just 'Saint' because of how often I mouthed off. It was an irony thing, or whatever the fuck. Unfortunately for them, I liked the name. You've seen my arms, that's about it for me. Saint sat down with a smattering of polite and mechanical applause from Amy and Ken, respectively. Iso returned to the table with two trays. One was piled high with an assortment of carefully made sushi and unlabeled bottles of alcohol, while the other had six steaming bowls of ramen. All in all, the assortment was nothing less than beautiful. Gourmet, even. I am Isssonade. Iso's words were accompanied by a metallic hiss. I wasss heir to Yakuza-Triad Corporation. I like cooking. Damn, Iso, you made it sound like you were a common criminal! Saint chuckled. You're more like a crime *lord*, or something. With a shake of his head, Iso bared his teeth. His upper and lower jaw each had two rows of pointed serrated teeth that would have looked like shark teeth, if they weren't made of metal. Iso carefully clamped his teeth together, showing how they locked together to form a seamless, steely mouth guard. My name comesss from a myth. A great ssshark monssster. My father named me, ssso that I would alwaysss know what I ssshould not become. Now, with thisss, I can never return home. Saint leaned forward and took a bottle of unlabeled liquor for herself as an extended silence fell over the room. *Shit*, no wonder you don't talk much. In a moment of surprising vulnerability, Iso gave a quiet chuckle, and pulled a bottle of liquor he'd hidden in the loose pockets of his simple white pants. He gave the group a small, sincere bow, and took a seat at the table. Amy stood up next, teetering slightly on her strange legs. I guess we all have sob stories of our own. I wish that made me less nervous. Amy's voice softened to the point of a whisper. M-my name is Amy Polatzki. No fuckin' way! Saint nearly spat her drink out, I cheered you on, years ago! Please explain, Doc interrupted. A few of us are a bit...lost. Okay, okay. Amy rubbed her arms nervously. I've competed in two Inter-Planetary Olympics, and won three gold medals and two silvers. I had an accident a year and a half ago, and woke up here three months ago. I don't know what my legs can do, but I just hope I can still run. It's the only thing I ever loved doing. I hope so, too! Saint cheered. You were fast as fuck, and those silver medals were bullshit! You should have five golds. Thanks. Amy sat with a bashful smile. We should call you 'Runner'. Saint slammed the table with a metal fist, leaving a sizable dent. Even if you can't run anymore. It's only fitting. Actually, I should be able to aid in that regard, *Fraulein* Amy. Doc piped up. From what I can see, you'll be able to run faster than you ever could. Runner, it is! Saint lifted her bottle high and took a celebratory swig. Amy could only smile wider, and gave Ken a gentle nudge. You know most of it, already. Ken's voice was deep, and resounded with the same artificiality that Otis' did. Amy says my name comes from some kind of doll. Since I don't remember, I don't mind. I don't know what I used to do, but I'd like to learn whatever I can. That's why I don't talk too much. Everything is new, so it can be overwhelming sometimes. It was short and sweet, but everyone clapped when he finished. And every eye shifted to Doc. *Scheie*. Doc stood slowly, locking his hands behind his bent back. I suppose there is no avoiding it. My name is Doctor Heinrich Krauss. I have a number of doctorates in medicine, ranging from chemistry to cybernetic engineering. I am often referred to and reviled as the 'Father of Modern Cybernetics'. I am, therefore, indirectly responsible for what has happened to us all. I...am so sorry. It is because of this that I feel solely responsible for your well-being and success. I hope that, by providing whatever assistance I can, I will one day earn your forgiveness. Doc didn't sit back down. Instead, with a heavy sigh, his shoulders sagged with an unseen weight. Silence swallowed the mess hall. I know your work. Amy finally broke the silence. Your interests were always about helping people. My trainer was able to walk without a cane, thanks to you. I can't imagine what it's like to see your work forced into people like this. I don't blame you, and if anyone here does, they shouldn't. Same here, Doc. Saint raised her half empty bottle. You didn't do this to us. Besides, that just means you can upgrade us. Happy to have you with us. They're right. James added. You made an incredible scientific discovery, but you can't be held accountable for what people do with it. A wave of agreements echoed across the table, even one from Iso, and Doc was welcomed back to the table with drinks and food. For hours, the six of them ate, drank, and joked, growing more comfortable with each other over a shared need to push aside their individual miseries. Well, even though we got here through pretty terrible circumstances, James said as the revelry died down. I'm glad you're all here. I don't think I could have asked for better friends. What do we do now? Amy asked. We become pirates! Saint was clearly drunk, but it only seemed to heighten her enthusiasm. *Space* pirates! Okay, relax. James laughed. Otis told me we have some time until we're officially off the radar, so let's just take a few days and enjoy our freedom. We'll plan later. Can we explore the ship? Amy asked excitedly. Sure! James shrugged. Find yourselves some rooms, go exploring, do whatever you want. I'm going to get my memories back from Otis, since I have the time now. I can stand by in case you need medical or mechanical assistance. Doc offered. I don't know if I need that, exactly. James tilted his head. But I'll have Otis give you a heads up if things start leaning that way. Otis? Amy spoke to the air. How many days until we arrive at...wherever? [Approximately four days until we arrive at the Federation-free zone.] Otis replied immediately. [I will alert you all if anything goes awry.] Yes! Amy did a little dance before turning to the group. I'm going running! She tore out of the room, a chorus of laughter at her back. Damn, she really *is* fast. James laughed. But she has the right idea. What, running? Saint's words had a steady slur to them. No, exploring! James stood and began walking out of the mess hall. I call the commander's quarters, which I'm off to find! Then I'm gonna look for the hangar bay! Saint pouted. Engineer's gotta keep her hands busy. Med bay for me. Doc stood and took an unsteady, drunken step, then sat back down. Maybe later. I like thisss kitchen. Iso said with a nod. You're all drunk. Ken mumbled from the floor."
59,vulnerability,HFY,[OC] Welcome to the Jungle,181,ars8yw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/ars8yw/oc_welcome_to_the_jungle/,2019-02-18 13:38:34,"This is another series thats set in the same universe as my previous mini-series [Nine Out of Ten](URL Its standalone so you dont need to read Nine Out of Ten to understand anything going on here but it would give you a little bit of extra background. Hope you like it. ----------------------------------- PART ONE: I dont give a damn what you have to do! Just find him and get it done! If youre not off this station and on that fracking planet in three fracking days youll never work in this sector again! Youll be cleaning waste fermentation tanks on Gamma VII because no one else will have you! Your children will quiver with scorn for what a pitiful loser you are! Mallor looked at Dennicks image on his datapad. The grub-like Borskian that was his boss was so angry that his hide was flushing bright green, pulsating veins looking like they were ready to pop. His mandibles were working overtime grinding themselves together with a sound like a steel rod being dragged over ceramic hull plating. JUST GET IT DONE! Dennick screamed before his image abruptly disappeared. The screen briefly showed the words CALL TERMINATED before reverting back to the map it had been showing previously. Mallor checked again for the tenth time. This was definitely the address hed been given, but all that was in front of him was a single door, recessed slightly into a drab grey wall. His eyes scanned up and down the busy street as beings of many species hurried about their business. To his left was a medium sized pan-species restaurant, catering to anyone who ingested organic matter as their primary method of sustenance. It was one of a popular chain of restaurants, aptly named Eat by its Borskian parent company, Business Concerns Incorporated. There were many races that sat at the lower end of the creativity spectrum, but as he regarded the restaurant Mallor thought the Borskians had elevated blandness to an art form. It was almost as if any concept, artistic or otherwise, that didnt impact their bottom line was invisible to them, or at least certainly wasnt worthy of their attention. Despite this BCI was the biggest and most successful corporation in this arm of the galaxy. What does that say about the rest of us? Mallor muttered out loud. To Mallors right was a department store named Buy, one of BCIs other successful brands. In addition to the name above the door, written in galactic common, the only other thing of note painted on the front of the store was BCIs logo. Mallor stared at the logo for the millionth time, searching for some hidden meaning, some sign that at least one Borskian had a sense of humour. No, he decided, there was no denying it. It was single brown box, possibly just a square. It also happened to be the same logo adorning the breast of his jacket, along with a line of common script. Mallor Fallspan: BCI Level 4 Employee. He sighed and turned his attention back to the door in front of him. Was this really it, the roughest bar on the station? Nestled amongst this bland innocuous corporate wasteland? He started to suspect that his boss was playing a trick on him. This hardly seemed the right place to find a seasoned adventurer slash hunter slash bodyguard. He pushed aside his suspicions, and the feeling of self-disgust they produced, then opened the door. Behind it was a short corridor ending in a set of stairs leading up. All but one of the overhead lighting strips had been smashed, giving the corridor a dark and dingy appearance. On the floor at the foot of the stairs was a greasy stain. It seemed something had dripped down the stairs and pooled there for some time, before being given a cursory mop that had done little to clean it up. Was that blood? Maybe this was the right place after all. Mallor started up the stairs, now somewhat less suspicious that he was the unwitting victim a joke. As he neared the top he heard faint music coming through a second door in front of him. It was too fast to be Ovidian music, with too much bass to be the traditional Dranian music he grew up with. Of course the Borskians didnt make music, so that ruled them out. Human then, or possibly Galden? Taking a deep breath he made sure his wings were securely tucked away, then pushed the door open and walked through. The bar was a small space, only twice as big a standard shipping container. Looking around Mallor realised thats exactly what it was: two shipping containers that had somehow been disassembled and snuck into the empty space between the BCI stores, before being reassembled and connected to the door outside. How the hell had they managed that without alerting the station authorities? And how did they manage to keep their drain on the station power and life support systems from getting noticed? Most likely the authorities had indeed noticed and were too afraid to do anything about it. A table against one wall seated four Galden talking quietly. The smoke from their narc-pipes twisted slowly upward, the four tendrils joining in a spinning vortex that was quickly sucked into a ventilation duct directly above the table. Against the other wall was a bar running half the length of the room. Seated there with a drink in its paw was a Dendrac, its dreadlock-like head spikes running through a subtle repeating pattern of bioluminescence. Mallor thought he also spied the huge shadowy outline of a Cranite, one of the rare rock-people of Boulderon VI, sitting at the bars far end. A veritable cornucopia of dirtbags. This was the right place. Mallor suddenly wished hed worn a different jacket. He was uncomfortably aware of the way the BCI logo on his chest was drawing the attention of nearly everyone in the room. He walked awkwardly to the bar, sat on an empty stool and signalled the bartender, a hulking cyborg creature of unknown species whose metal and composite components heavily obscured its original form. Half-full bottles of both mainstream and somewhat more obscure alcoholic beverages protruded from its back like the spines of some forsaken hell-beast. What are you drinking? The bartender asked, a synthesized voice issuing from a speaker grille on the front of its body. Nothing thanks, Im just looking for someone replied Mallor. The look of hostility from the cyborg was impressive given its lack of a discernible face. If youre not drinking then get out said the bartender. To emphasize the statement two of its deadlier looking manipulator claws settled on top of the bar, accompanied by the soft whine of servo motors. I suppose Ill have a glass of water then Mallor said meekly. Ethanol it is. Before Mallor could protest a glass appeared from under the bar and was filled by a small nozzle that extended from one of the bartenders metallic fingers. An uncomfortably large number appeared on a small screen attached to the side of the bartenders head and Mallor begrudgingly transferred the requisite amount of credits into the bars account with a swipe on his datapad. Ignoring the drink now in front of him he once more cast a glance around the bar. Turning back towards the cyborg Mallor said Im looking for a Terran. Im told he comes here often but I dont know his name. Only one Terran who comes here replied the cyborg gruffly as an arm rose to point at a dark booth in the far corner of the room. Mallor had missed the figure sitting there during his earlier scan of the establishment. The Terran was sitting quietly by himself with one arm resting on the table, the other propped up on its elbow holding a glass in front of his mouth, which hid the lower half of his face. The eyes that watched him over the rim of that glass scared Mallor more than all the other lowlifes in the place combined. He gulped nervously, picked up his glass and walked to the booth with as much fake confidence as he could muster, stopping at a distance he hoped to be just out of reach in case the human didnt take kindly to being interrupted. Dispensing with pleasantries Mallor ventured a short opening statement. Dennick sent me he said in a voice that he hoped was both cool and calm, but in reality was neither. He said there was a human here who would be open to short term employment opportunities of a rather non-standard kind. The Terran arched an eyebrow wryly. He was not the biggest human Mallor had ever seen but he was lean and powerfully built. He seemed to be tense and ready for violence at a seconds notice. Mallor was no expert in human anatomy but he suspected this one had augmented himself with more than a few military upgrades. There seemed to be an unusual number of bulges and lines under the skin of his forearms and shoulders, probably from synth muscle and tendon implants. Terrans, unlike most species, had no qualms about self-modification and Mallor had heard tales of humans who could do amazing things, from tearing steel plate with their bare hands to surviving in extreme environments. Mallor thought this human could probably give the rock-man a run for his money when it came to raw strength. The most unsettling feature was his eyes. In the low light of the bar they shone softly, ambient light reflecting off a synthetic membrane behind the retina that enhanced vision far beyond the humans normal visible spectrum. Mallor had seen this feature once before when a Terran platoon of Federation Special Forces had docked at the station after quelling a rebel uprising in a mining colony on the systems outskirts. The eyes of those troops hadnt scared him as much as these ones did now, drilling into him with a cold calculating intensity. Mallor suspected that the Terran saw every weak point and vulnerability of his small avian body and had already devised five different ways to hurt him if the situation ceased to be to the humans liking. He also got the impression that for this particular human such evaluation was standard operating procedure. No doubt about it, the Terran was a killer. But was he for hire? The human put his glass down and leaned back nonchalantly, the shining eyes never leaving Mallors face. Go on were the only words he spoke, his voice low and emotionless. My employer, BCI, is sending me to Wralangu. Its a newly contacted planet in the Halphian quadrant. Formal diplomatic relations with the local Wralangian people have only been established for a couple of years, but theyve just been granted Federation Protectorate status. The planet itself is mostly jungle. The locals only have one city well, its more like a town really, but Ill need a bodyguard while Im there. The Terran held up a hand to silence Mallor. He took a sip of his drink before speaking. Lets cut the shit, shall we? We both know this planet is dirt poor. Its no untapped market for BCI to sell their crap to. That means you want something else from it. He stopped to take another sip before continuing. The locals have Protectorate status, so it cant be slave labour or sport hunting. Theyre also only slightly higher than plush toys on the threat scale, so we both know you dont need a bodyguard. Whatever youre after must be in that jungle, and if you need someone with my skills it must be something hostile. But last I heard BCI doesnt have a bio-weapons division, so the hostile itself cant be the objective. He paused and thought for another second before a look of realisation spread across his face. The hostile is between you and your objective, some other biological. And theres only one biological worth importing from halfway across the galaxy. He smacked the glass down on the plastic table with a thud. Youve found another source of Flux matter. Surprise left Mallor stunned. Dennick had explicitly instructed him not to tell the Terran the primary mission objective. He was supposed to pitch the job as a simple bodyguard escort and only reveal as much as was necessary later when they were on the ground. The human had made an intuitive leap and seen through the pretence immediately. Mallors facade of confidence shattered and he started stuttering. Thats thats not we havent. The Terran grinned, his suspicions confirmed. Mallor looked around furtively, checking that none of the other denizens of the bar were listening in. They all seemed to be occupied with their own thoughts or conversations and none were paying them any undue attention. Relax company man said the Terran, Fill in the blanks for me, but no more bullshit. He wasnt quite sure what a bull was but Mallor didnt think it wise to try any further subterfuge. He was clearly outclassed. The Terran gestured to the empty seat on the opposite side of the booth. Mallor let out a sigh of defeat and flopped down into it before continuing his briefing. Weve detected Flux matter readings deep in the Wralangian jungle. Theyre centred around a large tree approximately a five hundred klicks out of the capital city. Were hoping that its producing the Flux matter organically in the same way Luminar plants do on Corlis. If we can confirm this is true then we may have a chance at finally breaking the Galden monopoly on Flux and capturing a huge slice of the warp fuel market. The profits would be astronomical. The Terran wasnt impressed with Mallors pun. You want to find a single tree in the middle of a jungle planet? he asked with more than a hint of cynicism. Mallors head crest stood up slightly, the Dranian equivalent of a smile. It was his turn to surprise the human. The tree in question is over four kilometres tall, and its the only one of its kind on the whole planet. The Terran let out a low whistle. Ok, colour me impressed he said. And the locals? Whats their take on this? Theyre evasive when asked about the tree. We think it has some kind of cultural or religious significance to them, but they wont give us a straight answer. The Federation is about to help them skip a few rungs on the technological ladder so theyre trying to seem as cooperative as possible, but so far all our requests for a guide to take us to the tree have been politely declined. They keep saying its dangerous to go there. Theyre quite keen to sell us local textiles and foodstuffs though. They dont really have a good grasp on the economics of interstellar trade yet. It would be endearing if it wasnt so damn frustrating. The Terran pondered this for moment. Do you think theyll try to prevent you from reaching it? We dont believe so, they seem pretty peaceful. They havent been observed committing a single violent act since they were first put under observation by the Federation Contact Division twenty years ago. And the hostile? Or is it hostiles? Were not sure. The months following first contact with the Wralangu were uneventful but over the last year and half thereve been increasing reports of something strange in the jungle. Initially our scouting teams reported strange noises, particularly at night, but they couldnt find the source. Then they started finding their observation stations destroyed, smashed to pieces, and strange tracks left in the dirt. Eventually the destruction spread to their campsites. More equipment smashed and more strange tracks, but nobody was hurt and nobody saw anything. As Mallor spoke he placed his datapad on the table between them and flicked through a series of still images. An alien jungle, ruined scientific equipment and huge three-clawed prints sunk deep into the mud. He stopped swiping through the images and continued his explanation. After the losses started to mount the scouting parties began posting constant guard watches around their camps and two months ago a member of one team opened fire on something during the night. By the time his teammates jumped out of their hab-domes and ran to help the only thing left of him was his helmet cam. This is the video it captured. Mallor touched the datapad again and a video began playing. A first-person perspective showed a small plasma pistol firing wildly into a moonlit jungle. Suddenly a dark shadow detached itself from the tree line and bounded with frightening speed towards the camera, which struggled to focus on it. All that was visible was the creatures general outline. It seemed to switch its running style, first on four legs and then on two before it leapt high into the air and came down on top of the helpless scout. The video froze on the last frame, the blurry creature silhouetted by a bright moon, one of its thick limbs scything down towards the camera. The picture quality was poor and other than the general shape no further detail was visible, save for two red eyes which glowed in the middle of a wide head. Mallor stayed silent while the Terran stared at the image for a full minute. When he looked up Mallor continued the briefing. Weve now lost contact with every one of our scout teams. None of them have returned on schedule. Drone flyovers have found nothing but ruined and abandoned campsites, when they found anything at all. Why were you sending scouts in on foot? Why not shuttle them out to the tree? the Terran asked. The Wralangians wont let us. Apart from the vicinity of the new spaceport and capital city the whole planet is a no-fly zone. The treaty with them has banned any flying machine bigger than a fist. No shuttles, no grav-packs. Not even a fracking hot air balloon. The drones are the only thing we can use to get close to the tree and they dont have the capability for the kind of scientific observations that we require to confirm the presence of Flux matter. So, a five hundred kilometre trek through dense jungle, brining only what we can carry. No air support, no emergency extraction, and, the Terran tapped his index finger on the datapad which was still displaying the image of the shadowy hostile with its glowing eyes. that thing waiting for us somewhere along the way. Thats the gist of it, yes. How many on this expedition? Just us two. I want to keep a low profile. In and out before that thing knows were there. The Terran eyed Mallor, deciding if he wanted to go up against such an unknown threat with only a skinny Dranian at his back. How much? he said, his voice once again low and emotionless. Two million credits, half upfront, half when we return. Another two if we confirm that the tree is producing Flux matter and bring back viable samples. An extra two if you manage to kill that thing. Whats your stake in this? If BCI gets its hands on this tree and manages to harvest Flux from it then it will become the biggest corporation in the galaxy, maybe even more powerful than the Federation. I dont give a fuck about BCI. I mean you personally. Youre a salaried company peon, not a shareholder. Why risk your life for their gain? Do you know how hard it is being a Dranian in a Borskian company? Ive been shovelling their shit for years just to get to level four. I cant go any higher. Im tired of working my tail feathers off for those fat worms. This is my ticket out. The Terran nodded sagely. Good, so youre not just some corporate lackey. I dont want any pampered desk jockey being dead weight on this expedition. If you cant keep up and do your part Ill leave you behind for the hostile. Understood. Youll do it then? I will. Great. Something occurred to Mallor then. Sorry, I didnt catch your name. I havent chosen it yet. What do you mean? You dont have a name? New mission, new name. Mallor was puzzled. No name? This wasnt a human custom he was familiar with. Perhaps this Terran was trying to distance himself from his past. From the look of him there was no doubt hed been involved in many activities on both sides of legality. Perhaps he preferred his original name be forgotten. Then what do I put on the employment contract? The Terran grinned once more. Being hunted by a predator in the jungle? Call me Arnold. Mallors baffled look said more than his words ever could. "

Captain Ngrezhen-of-Rargtk snapped at the Dorarizins lined before her, their ears folded back, tails limp behind them. {You directly ignored an emergency evacuation in order to *play in snow*, potentially putting your fellow crew members in danger!} There was a whimper from one of her crewmembers, the smell of fear emanating heavily from the group. Each had their heads bowed, refusing to meet her gaze. Submissive. {Did you all forget what happens to Jornissians when exposed to the cold?} A pause. Silence. {They are cold-blooded. They *will* freeze, and they will *die* if exposed long enough. You jeopardized your fellow sapient because you were too busy having *fun.*} The Dorarizins before her shied backwards, shame etching itself on their features. {What do you have to say for yourselves?} Silence. The red furred Dorarizin stood taller, letting the atmosphere steep, before moving. The sharp *clack* of claws tapping on the metal floor sounded thunderous in the silent room. {I would also like to note that one of you nearly killed our new Engineer.} A sharp whine pierced the silence. {If our Chief of Security hadnt intercepted the projectile on time, there would be Human splattered across the rear wall of the Engineering wing. I hope you realize that if she had reacted a moment later, you would be responsible for the first murder of a Human on a Zephyr Station. On a *Senate owned ship*, no less.} She heard the sharp intake of breath from the Human behind her. The Captain strode forward powerfully, heavy footsteps shaking the deck as she came to a stop before a blue furred Dorarizin. The crew member shrank further into himself, ears folded so far back they disappeared into the fur of his head. The Captain put one hand under his jaw, and slowly guided his head upright. The Dorarizins jaw shuddered in her grasp, and a quiet whine escaped his rippling teeth. He shot his gaze to the side, immediately locking onto Samuel, bright blue eyes meeting brown. {No, no. Look at me.} The Captain spoke softly. The gaze shifted, soft brown eyes meeting a furious purple. {You nearly destroyed the entire fragile relationship the Senate has with the Human race, because you decided to ignore protocol.} A pause. {You nearly killed a member of a species that has less than ten-billion members. Every species in the Senate can make up that number in births in a *fraction* of a cycle. Every one. *Except. For. Them.*} The brown eyes of the blue furred Dorarizin began to water. {If you had killed him The percentage of Humanity killed in that *one* careless action would be equivalent to the destruction of *several* major Senate cities, and *all* Sapients within them. Do. You. Understand?} The sharp scent of urine pierced through the haze of fear. A dark spot grew on the Dorarizins uniform, running down his leg. Brown eyes closed, a tear escaping and vanishing in the blue fur of his muzzle. {Y-yes, Captain...} A sharp, shuddering breath was taken. {I understand a-and,} another inhale, {I I take f-full responsibility.} {Good.} A twist of her wrist jerked the Dorarizins head to the side as she released him. She took several strides back, facing the shivering group of crew members once more. {You six have tainted your names, my reputation, and the history of this vessel. The *only* reason you are not currently scraping Human off the wall and prostrating yourself in front of the council is the quick reactions of Security Chief Xarlenpcli.} There was a brief pause as the Captain turned towards the off-white Dorarizin, giving her a brief nod. {You six shall wait in your personal quarters, isolated, until I come to see you personally. The external communication features of both your implants and terminals will be blocked. The only line available will be with myself, the First Officer, and the Security Chief.} She turned her back to the quivering Dorarizins. {Dismissed.} There was a scrambling for the door, claws unable to get enough grip on the metallic floor to allow for their quick movements. The door to the room swished open, and the six left without a whisper of speech. The door closed softly behind them. Captain Ngrezhen ignored the four individuals left in the room, opting to pace before them instead. She folded her hands behind her back, her tail giving a single, irritated flick. She moved, step by step before the four, claws tapping softly in the silence of the room. *Click*. *Click.* *Click.* A pause in movement before she turned. *Click.* *Click.* *Click.* She stopped. She faced the four lined in front of her, purple eyes gazing at each one, reading them, before jumping to the next. The Chief of Engineering, ashamed. The Team Leader of Engineering, trepidatious. Security Chief Xarlenpcli-of-Rargtk, standing straight, confident. The trembling *Human.* {Where do I start with you four? The careless one?} Her gaze shifted to the green Dorarizin. {The coercer.} She set her purple orbs on the Jornissian. {The instigator.} The Security Chief. {Or *You.*} The Human quivered under her gaze, but he stared right back at her, blue eyes unwavering. {Captain, if I may begin, I had told Samuel to-} {Silence!} She *snarled*, teeth snapping at the diminutive Dorarizin. His mouth closed with a clack of teeth. {Fine, well start with you.} The captain padded her way in front of the green Dorarizin, coming to a stop just centimeters from him. {You left our newest engineer alone, without supervision of an individual who was versed in the project he was undertaking. You left for a significant period of time, leaving the Human alone with technology they wouldnt have normally. What do you have to say for yourself?} \[Captain, I-\] A sharp glare from the red furred Dorarizin silenced Esshvar. {Well, to begin, I *did* actually alert Team Leader Esshvar to our Apprentices project. I had requested she be present, but off to the side to watch from a distance. I had hoped to put Samuel under her tutelage for his time aboard the *Undoing of Mystery*. I told her to work on a minor project while attending in order to get Samuel used to her presence without strictly introducing her.} {Did you now?} The Captain asked. A nod. {Continue.} {I asked for \[Esshvar\] to take my place for but a few moments while I nano-fabricated a tool I had forgotten to make for our Apprentice Engineer. I hadnt thought Id be gone for very long, but it turns out there was an error with one of the nano-fabricators that had been trying to create biological material requested by the Research and Development department. The configuration was incorrect for the-} {Why did you not have all the necessary tools already made in preparation for the job?} The Captains eyes narrowed. {I had already fabricated all the necessary tools for the job, which is why I had let Samuel continue to work while under the supervision of our Team Leader. I had forgotten to make that one Human tool because First Officer Shrissnerisshad requested I perform maintenance on the medical departments biological scanner. He had told me there was a minor problem in verifying accuracy after Samuels results had been sent to you. I checked the machine but could find nothing of-} {Very well.} The Captain stood back, removing herself from the diminutive green Dorarizins presence. {I would like to instate a new policy for the handling of temperature related equipment. All the repairs of such equipment are to be done in an isolated room with no Jornissians present without proper protective equipment.} She turned to face the red Jornissian who was holding the tip of her tail nervously, before turning back to the Chief of Engineering. {You *personally* are to check over each repair our Apprentice makes from now on. Do I make myself clear?} {Perfectly clear, Maam.} {Send me your report on the footage Security Chief Xarlenpcli has sent you of our Apprentices repairs. Dismissed.} The normally talkative Dorarizin remained silent as he walked to the exit. He turned momentarily, locking eyes with Samuel, trying to pass some kind of message to the Human through his brown eyes. Then, he turned, doors closing behind the Chief of Engineering with a quiet sound. Then there were three. {On the topic of our new Apprentices repairs} The Captain strode forward, placing herself in front of the red Jornissian. Esshvar flicked her tongue out nervously, her tail shifting in her grasp. {Why did you allow an unchecked repair to become active? If my memory serves me correctly, all repairs done by an Apprentice should be checked twice over by other *qualified* individuals before becoming active.} The Captain leered down at the snake-like alien. Esshvar stood silently, vibrant green eyes clouded by fear. She Captain leaned forward lightly, bringing her face to face with the Jornissian, purple eyes narrowing, red fur bristling. {I asked you-} \[I-I didnt t-turn it on.\] Samuel stammered out breathlessly. Purple eyes snapped to his blue. From the corner of her eye the Captain saw Xarlenpcli grimace. The Captain soaked in the Engineers appearance. He was standing shakily, chest spasming in the pure terror that *rolled* off his tiny form. One hand was held tightly against his abdomen, the other clenched in a shaky fist by his side, grasping the material of his uniform in a white-knuckled grip. His eyes were glistening in fear, a tear threatening to escape, balancing precariously on the edge, before rejoining the rest of the water. His breaths were short and fast, much too quick for a Human to be breathing. The quiet gasps grew in volume as she focused her eyes on his, allowing herself to stand slightly taller. The Captain took two slow, methodical steps toward the trembling human, claws tapping menacingly against the floor. She raised herself to her full height, towering over the tiny human. He had stopped taking in breaths, too fearful to function. She could *hear* his heart rate increase, the small organ producing such a loud, powerful sound. A quiet snarl escaped the Security Chief. {Would you like to interrupt me again, little one?} {Captain!} The Security Chief barked, her thunderous voice echoing off the walls. {I must ask you to refrain from using physicality to intimidate or threaten Samuel! It has been declared illegal by the Senate following First-Contact for any member of the Senate to use physical presence to intimidate or persuade others.} The Captain snapped her gaze to the furious Amber eyes of her Security Chief, her packmate. A quick glance downward revealed her legs were tense, leaning forward slightly, and her claws were partially unsheathed, the dark material glinting dangerously in the light of the bridge. She had been ready to jump at her. Ready to defend the Human. The Captain had chosen properly after all. Ngrezhen stood for a moment, before nodding to her Security Chief, taking several steps away from the too-pale Human. She heard him let out a shuddering sigh, diaphragm twitching powerfully from the trembling of his body. Samuel staggered on his feet for a moment, before regaining his balance. Captain Ngrezhen turned her gaze toward the Jornissian in the center of the group, allowing herself to adjust her posture slightly. Less intimidating would be the proper appearance, it seems. {I apologize.} She cast a glance to Samuel, before locking her eyes onto the green orbs of the Jornissian. {Team Leader, if you will?} \[Oh. R-right.\] The Jornissian took a deep breath, and exhaled, a hissing sound escaping her teeth. \[I wasnt able to prevent the machine from being activated, because\] She steeled herself, closing her eyes for a moment, breathing deeply once more. \[I didnt I didnt recognize what he was doing.\] {Could you explain?} The Captain furrowed her eyebrows lightly. \[The Apprentice- Samuel, didnt use any one particular *style* to repair the unit.\] Noting the Captains expression, she continued. \[Each species of the Senate has a particular style for using certain technology in different ways. While a Karnakian might set up one type of technology one way, a Jornissian or Dorarizin might use that same technology in a different configuration.\] Esshvar paused for a moment, turning her head to look at the still quivering Human. \[Samuel didnt really use any style Im familiar with. He used *all* of them, and then he did something else entirely. Im still not sure how the unit had enough power to run in the first place.\] {I see.} The Captain turned her purple gaze toward Samuel once more, her eyes lingering on the hand still on his abdomen. {Apprentice, could you describe what you did in order to prevent this situation from occurring again?} There was a sharp breath from the Human as he was addressed once more, a grimace flashing across his face. \[Yes, C-Captain. I u-um\] There was a panicked expression on his face, eyes blinking quickly as he struggled to even his wavering voice. He turned toward Esshvar, avoiding any and all eye contact with Captain Ngrezhen. \[I-I had,\] a deep breath in, \[I t-took the secondary power source from the drone a-and wired it to the circuit of the machine which w-would take heat energy from the water it d-drew in\] His voice was still shaky. He moved the hand grasping onto his uniform upwards, closing on some small object near his breastbone. Another breath. \[I forgot to to discharge the power core. It was a stupid mistake. The energy left inside it melted one of the wires I had connected and fused it to another portion of the board. The remaining amount passed through the unit and started removing heat energy from the water molecules. This was converted into electrical energy which fed through the output of the circuit and into the gravity core, before looping back through to the secondary power source. After that it just Kept going.\] Security Chief Xarlenpcli blinked. Captain Ngrezhen furrowed her expression once more and turned to the Jornissian. Team Leader Esshvar looked bewildered, scared, and genuinely upset all at the same time. The tension in her frame vanished in seconds, releasing her tail and letting it hit the deck with a loud *thwap*. \[Wait, but that- How did-\] Her arms began flailing around as she gestured in confusion, her tail coiling and uncoiling itself rapidly. \[That isnt how *any* of that should work! Theres not nearly enough heat energy in water molecules to allow the removal to power the anti-gravity core from the drone! Additionally, you cant just-\] {Team Leader Esshvar, please, control yourself.} The Captain spoke neutrally. The Jornissian continued her hissed muttering under her breath, flexing her hood agitatedly once or twice. Captain Ngrezhen turned her head toward Samuel, who froze up once again when he turned to face her. {What you said is accurate to the best of your knowledge?} A nod. {Very well then.} She paused for a moment, choosing her words carefully. {Why did you willingly ignore your superiors instructions?} \[I, umm\] It was Esshvar that spoke up. \[I told him to.\] The Jornissian cringed backwards lightly, seeming to realize how dangerous those words sounded. Her tail curled up to her hands once more, jerking lightly in agitation. The Captain stared at the Team Leader, purple eyes boring into the vibrant green. {Why would you think that would be a good idea, Essvar?} A pause as the Captain took another step closer, tail giving an irritated flick. {What gave you the *right* to disobey your superiors direct orders?} She asked softly. There was no response. {I see.} She Captain straightened herself out once more, and resumed her slow strides before the trio. The soft padding was for more subdued than before. {Samuel.} The Human stiffened. {I would like you to know that you are not to receive any discipline for listening to Team Leader Esshvars instructions. She told you something she *should not* have, and you listened to your superior. However, from now on you will strictly listen to the Chief of Engineering. Do you understand?} \[Y-yes, Captain.\] He responded, looking her in the eyes. She noted he was still holding his abdomen, while his other hand was by his side once more. {You had mentioned you had forgotten to discharge the drones secondary power core before using it in the repair.} She paused in her motions, turning to face the Human once more. She noted he wasnt trembling nearly as much as he had been. His breathing was smoother, not nearly as panicked as it had been before. {Why did you make this mistake?} \[I I believe I lost focus, Captain.\] He shuffled lightly, taking a deep breath. Another grimace passed over his features for a moment, before settling once more. Captain Ngrezhen hummed lightly, turning her attention toward the Security Chief for a moment. There was an exhaustion to her features, the Captain noted. Her tail lacked a certain peppiness that it usually held, and her fur lacked a luster that was usually present. She had been working herself too hard in her quest to help Samuel, often forgoing sleep to spend hours researching Human coping mechanisms instead. The Captain had received several complaints from the medical staff about Xarlenpcli interrupting their routine work or sleeping hours. {Tell me, Samuel.} The captain padded a little closer to the Human, but still maintaining a respectful distance. {When was the last time you slept?} \[Maam?\] {You heard me.} {Captain,} the Security Chief began, {Samuel was in the communal sleeping hall last night, partnered with-} Captain Ngrezhen raised a hand, silencing Xarlenpcli. The off-white Dorarizin turned her Amber gaze to Samuel, a burning curiosity making itself apparent. \[I havent, Captain.\] Samuel said with a wince. \[Not since the night before I came aboard.\] A sharp hiss came from Esshvar, vocalizing everyones thoughts. The Human had been aboard for roughly 4 of his sleeping cycles, and that he hadnt rested once was worrying. The Captain shot Security Chief Xarlenpcli a concerned look, purple eyes meeting amber. The white Dorarizin shook her head, signifying that she hadnt been aware of this. Humans were meant to sleep for one third of their day, and yet- A quiet gasp startled the Captain from her thoughts. Samuels grasp on his abdomen tightened for a moment before he relaxed once again, releasing the tight grip on his uniform. {Samuel} The Captain began lowly. {Are you alright?} \[Im fine.\] Ngrezhen paused for a moment, scenting the air. It hadnt been readily apparent from the cloud of fear that had been radiating from Samuel, but now that he had calmed There was a light scent of iron surrounding him as well. It was faint, but it was there. She had taken the Human Safety and Care courses, and she knew that scent well. Human Blood. {Remove your shirt.} {Captain?} \[What?\] Captain Ngrezhen shot him a look. \[O-oh wait. Dont blame \[Esshvar\] for this, I-I threw snow first. Then after she did, \[Xarlenpcli\] had thrown-\] {*Now!*} The Captain snarled, claws unsheathing slightly. Already the scent was bothering her, putting an odd strain on her instincts. Her tail flicked in agitation behind her, the tip snapping angrily in the air. The scent had her teeth rippling, and she had to crouch lower to the ground to prevent herself from rushing the Human. The scent of fear came back in full force as Samuel looked around, watching the tense expressions in the room warily. The two Dorarizins in the room didnt lose focus of the iron smell now that it was apparent. His hands shook as he grasped the hem of his shirt and started lifting. The hem slid upwards, revealing dark skin, light abdominal muscles, and- Xarlenpclis thunderous growl shook the room, her hackles raised and ears folding back in outright *fury*. Her amber eyes flashed dangerously as she took in the sight. Ngrezhen couldnt help the quiet snarl that escaped her lips, adding to the thunderous noise of the room. Esshvar had coiled into herself, tail snapping agitatedly against the floor, her hood expanding to make her appear larger. Poor Samuel was paralyzed in the face of the three super predators, each one looking as if they were going to tear him to pieces. Sitting neatly near the center of his torso, sat a large purple bruise. The edges were a dwindling green, leading to the raw, angry reddish purple nearing the center, with a small split down the middle, gently oozing the red fluid. But that was far from the worst of it. His torso was littered with scars, rough, jagged looking things, healed marks raised above the height of the surrounding skin. There were the obvious surgery scars, a jagged mess of lines centralized between his shoulders. There were the attack scars, the flesh torn and healed repeatedly over long periods of time. There were remnants of a bite mark on his left shoulder, the flesh puckered and bruised. Healed burn marks were scattered liberally across his back, puckered little things that had healed slowly over time. Both Ngrezhen and Xarlenpcli knew the signs of abuse well, their previous careers attributing heavily to that knowledge. Esshvar, on the other hand, didnt understand what she was seeing. She took in the markings, the raised grooves and obvious *wrongness*, but she couldnt *understand* what felt so wrong. {Xarlenpcli Esshvar} A deep breath as the Captain struggled to control herself. {I need you two to leave. Now.} Neither moved. Neither acknowledged her command. Neither payed her any mind. She didnt exist to them. {*Esshvar!*} The Captain snarled, the gunshot like sound bouncing from the walls. The Jornissian looked at her- No. She looked *through* her, eyes unfocused. {I need you to leave. Right now.} The Team Leader blinked unseeingly, before giving an almost hypnotized nod, *slowly* moving herself toward the doors of the room. The doors cracked open, and the maroon Jornissian hesitated for the slightest moment. She turned her head, gazing through the Human standing fearfully in the center of the room, before continuing. The doors closed. Xarlenpcli had not moved. The Captain curled her fingers into her palm, the claws digging painfully into the flesh, before releasing the motion. The sharp pain helped centralize her mind, pushing down the instincts just below the surface. She took a step forward, paws padding softly- Amber eyes whipped to her, the hulking, snarling form of the Security Chief sending a shiver up her spine. Her eyes glowed in a furious, *feral* rage, lips pulled back, teeth bared to Ngrezhen. The hackles on Xarlenpclis shoulders expanded, and the fur under her uniform bristled, stretching the cloth far too tightly. Seams stretched too far began snapping, light tearing noises echoing hauntingly in the silent room. Xarlenpcli hunched her shoulders, keeping her eyes locked on the Captain as she dropped to all fours. The Dorarizin flexed her claws, allowing the shrieking of metal to sound off. The Security Chief prowled forward, placing herself between the paralyzed Human and the Captain, a rippling snarl tearing from her jaws. A trail of shredded metal followed her, and there was a quiet tinkling of metal shards dropping from her paws and to the ground. Captain Ngrezhen stood firm, meeting the feral amber eyes with an unflinching purple. The Captain was suddenly reminded why she had chosen her as Chief of Security. {Xarlenpcli. Stand down.} There was an unintentional quiver to her voice. She bit back the curse that nearly followed. Xarlenpcli slowly shifted herself backwards, eyes locked onto Ngrezhens upright form. She slowly placed an arm around Samuel, dragging the still Human into her chest, hovering over him like some feral protector. An unwanted guardian, defending against a threat that did not exist. {I need you to stand down. Now.} Ngrezhen spoke firmly, no waver to her voice this time. She only received a snarl in response, spittle flying from the jaws of the hulking, white Dorarizin. {Fine.} The Captain took a deep breath, and let loose her own challenging snarl, rattling the walls of the deck. The thunderous roar Xarlenpcli responded with sent her ears ringing, the noise shaking the very floor beneath her. Ngrezhen shoved her claws into her palms once more, allowing the nails to pierce her flesh. She slow *drip, drip* of blue blood sounded as the fluid oozed down her fingers, pooling beneath her. She shoved her instincts away once more, ignoring the urge to submit to this overwhelming force of nature before her. She was the Captain. This was her ship, and shed be damned if she came this far to be killed by her packmate. Ngrezhen flexed her legs, and *moved*, launching herself forward at the snarling form of her packmate. Xarlenpcli responded in kind, shoving the Human to the side as the pair clashed, a thunderous *crack* sending senses reeling. Ngrezhen was the first to respond to the clash, shifting her weight beneath Xarlenpcli and *heaving*, sending the heavy mass of white Dorarizin across the room. The airborne form of the Security Chief twisted in mid air, impacting the wall heels first and shoving off, cratering the military grade metal and careening toward the Captain once more. There was no time for Ngrezhen to respond, still recovering from the throw. She saw the incoming form of Xarlenpcli far too late, shifting herself to the side and pushing off in an attempt to dodge. Dark claws flashed, tearing towards the red furred Dorarizin. There was a shredding of cloth and a heavy impact of two titans colliding, one sent spinning across the room and into a navigational console. Ngrezhen shook herself free of the sparking metal, quickly getting back to her feet. She glanced down at the grey plates of her body armor, sighing in relief at the deep gouges in the metallic material. It payed to be paranoid. Xarlenpcli hadnt accounted for her momentum carrying her headfirst into the wall across from her, sending her reeling from the impact. She struggled to all fours, grasping her head in one hand, attempting to shake off the dizziness. It was too late though. Ngrezhen raced across the deck, paws denting the metal and claws tearing the flooring to shreds. She slid under a disoriented swipe from Xarlenpcli, and *pushed* upwards, wrapping her arms around the throat of the towering white Dorarizin. Using her momentum, and the proximity to the wall, the Captain twisted herself. She buried her feet into the wall, and heaved Xarlenpcli downwards, using the massive Dorarizins mass against her. Ngrezhen fell with the towering Security Chief, using the momentum to pull herself free from the wall and wrap her legs around the hulking Dorarizins arm, pinning the other beneath their bodies. With a gasp, she recovered from the fall, and *pulled* upwards, forcing her arms to pull against the throat of her packmate, while her legs forced the other arm down in a pin against her side. Xarlenpcli struggled, straining against the pin of the Captain. She took shallow, gasping breaths as her throat was constricted by Ngrezhen. With a minor shift in position, the red furred Dorarizin moved her arm upwards, unsheathing her claws and letting them prick the soft flesh of Xarlenpclis exposed throat. {Give up! Yield!} Ngrezhen bit out, straining against the might of the white Dorarizin. A snarling retort was cut into a yelp as the Captain dug her claws deeper into the flash of her packmates throat, the skin straining against the sharpened metallic tips. There was a minor jolt of movement and the claws punctured the top layer of flesh, allowing a gentle stream of blue to trickle down the unnatural claws. Slowly, the struggling stopped, Xarlenpclis instincts screaming out that she had been beaten. She had been defeated. A pitiful whine left the jaws of the Security Chief, her limbs going limp and lolling her head back further, baring her neck to her alpha. {Look! Look at what you did to him!} The Captain shoved Xarlenpclis head downward, gazing over their intertwined forms at the prone shape of Samuel. {You were supposed to keep him safe! Look at him!} The Security Chief blinked her eyes heavily, the empty look receding quickly. She shook her head lightly, grasping her head between her paws as the Captain let her up. She struggled to her feet, staggering and burying her shoulder in the ruined remains of the wall. She shook her head once more, a light snarl sneaking its way out before being bitten off entirely. She looked around the room in confusion, her ears folding back in horror, before she focused on the limp form before her. Samuel lay crumpled against the wall, head lolled backwards, limbs splayed out haphazardly. The recent welt on his torso had reopened, blood trickling down the side of his form and puddling lightly beneath him. There was another gash across his temple from the impact with the wall, leaking blood freely and smearing it across the wall. And on his chest Three jagged claw marks spanning the length of his chest, bloody wounds that leaked openly. The white of bone was exposed, and the heaving shudder of his chest barely helped to ease her worry. Xarlenpcli took a hurried step towards the broken form of Samuel, amber eyes water freely, before she was suddenly tugged backwards. The Captain strode past the toppled Dorarizin, leaning down next to the unresponsive form of their Human engineer. The doors to the deck burst open, metal wedges sent skittering across the room, kicking up sparks. The heavy whine of energy weaponry flooded the room as First Officer Shrissnerisshad darted into the room, the lime green and black constrictor quickly taking in the room. \[Captain! I heard there was a-\] {Take Xarlenpcli to medical, now!} Ngrezhen leaned down and scooped the broken form of Samuel into her arms, cradling his body against her torso. {What about the Human?} The First Officer asked, looking at the bloodied form of their newest crew member. {I have a med-bay in my quarters! Keep her away from Samuel!} Ngrezhen shouted, quickly shoving herself through a door near the front of the command deck. Security Chief Xarlenpcli sat in muted horror at the blood trail that had followed the Captain to the end of the deck. Slowly, she traced it backwards, toward herself, and then to the puddle of red that sat just meters from her. She slowly looked down at her claws, her hands trembling in shock. One her left hand, blue blood. On her right, a deep, unsettling red. She had done it again. She had lost herself. Xarlenpcli wept. \~{o}\~{o}\~ Captain Ngrezhen paced furiously back and forth, casting quick looks to the medical pod that held the far too small Human, and the various vital signs that her hard-light projector was displaying. Her Chief of Security had suffered a relapse. Ngrezhen had almost fallen to her instincts. Esshvar was traumatized, curled up into a ball in the corner of the medical bay. Samuel He was going to live. {Dammit!} The Captain *roared*, burying her fist into the wall nearest to her desk. The hard-light projection shuddered for a moment, before regaining clarity, displaying the healthy heartbeat of her Human engineer. Samuel. {Fuck You were supposed be better, Xarlenpcli.} Ngrezhen muttered to herself, removing her hand from the wall. She cast a glance at the discarded uniform on the floor, and the partially shredded armor that now needed to be repaired. {You promised me you were done. Promised you wouldnt slip anymore.} There was a sharp beep from the medical pod as the top slid open, allowing access to Samuels prone form once more. Ngrezhen padded over to his form quickly, looking upon the newly made scars that layered his torso, and the light blemish of discoloured skin on his temple. The medical technology she had at her personal disposal was top of the line. Miniature biological nano-fabricators worked together with airborne nanobots to repair damaged tissues and accelerate the healing process of injured individuals. Her ears fell flat against her head, tail hanging limp behind her. She was well aware that she should close the pod back up and leave the Human to recover in the medical bay. She knew she shouldnt be feeling this useless to a situation that had fallen out of her control. She wasnt supposed to be this *upset*, and her best friend wasnt supposed to slip back into *that*. Not again. Ngrezhen felt too cold, even though her quarters remained her preferred temperature. She felt too alone, too small in this suddenly massive ship. Her command had nearly been torn from underneath her, and the reports that she would have to send after this would leave her career crippled outright. Humanity would withdraw from the Senate, citing this incident as a result. Her usefulness to the Galactic stage would crumple, and she would be forced into her old ways if she wanted to stand any chance of surviving, let alone exploring the stars. The indomitable Captain of the *Undoing of Mystery* felt far, far too small. She was just one sapient in a galaxy filled with hundreds of trillions. Her life was meaningless, in a way, which was satisfying. She would fade into the background of history with little more than a blemish on the Senates record. An experiment gone wrong. A rogue, gone rogue once more. She let a tear escape as she pushed her thoughts to the back of her mind. She would deal with them tomorrow. For now She leaned down, gently cradling the far too still form of Samuel in her arms. She had watched the footage her Chief of Engineering had sent her, along with his report. The Human had been animated, and the green Dorarizin thoroughly impressed with both his skill and enthusiasm for the craft. He had wanted to take Samuel as his personal apprentice. He might not get that chance now. Ngrezhen permitted herself to let out a whine at the events that would fall around her, hugging the warmth of the Human against her torso. She suddenly understood why her packmate, Xarlenpcli, had liked Humans so much. They were just a little too perfect, in their own way. Too innocent, like forever-pups, but at the same time, their own independent species. She would allow herself this vulnerability for tonight, before forcing on her mask once more. The red and white Dorarizin padded her way to her bed, carefully cradling the Human to her chest as she lay down, taking care to lay on her side. She positioned him in the center, putting herself directly against the still form of Samuel. She couldnt be alone right now. Not now, when this might be her last night as a free member of the Galaxy. Ngrezhen lightly ran her claws through the Humans hair, watching the light material flow around her metal nails, before jumping back into place. The gentle scent of pup floated to her nose, nearly lost to the scent of Dorarizin on him. But she could tell. She could always tell. A low groan sounded from the Human tucked close to her, and Ngrezhen froze in her motions, heart coming to a stop in her throat. Please, not now, not now. She needed this. She was far too close to breaking. She needed to keep someone safe tonight, to ward away the memories of her failures. Of the times she failed to keep another helpless soul from dying. The Humans eyes opened slowly, unseeing, bleary blues meeting a misty purple. There was a pause, before the eyes closed once more, and Samuel shifted slightly, burying his face into the warm fur of her underbelly. Captain Ngrezhen allowed her tail to give an uncertain flick, before putting her paws on the Human once more, pulling him closer to her torso. Her paws traced lightly down his form, as if making sure that yes, he was real. She hadnt failed this time. Thank the Gods she hadnt failed this time. "
61,vulnerability,HFY,[Fantasy 5] The Curse,61,auy4y5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/auy4y5/fantasy_5_the_curse/,2019-02-26 21:52:05,"\[Sword and Sorcery\] &amp;#x200B; The Curse Talwin looked down his long, aristocratic, Elven nose at the beaten, scarred human bound to the chair before him. The human looked back at him, and though he was battered, and bruised, he gave the Elven nobleman one of those infuriating human smirks. ""I would not be so amused at your predicament human. You are hundreds of leagues from your army, and you are in the capitol of our Empire, a city which few of your kind have ever seen, and none have ever left alive."" The man chuckled as he spit a tooth on the floor. ""I know, we have been searching for Var-el-thon since we came to your lands, but your spells have kept it hidden from even our most accomplished mages. The only hope we had of getting here was to get you to bring us here yourselves."" Talwin, feeling the twinge of uneasiness he always felt in the presence of these damned humans, gathered himself and spat. ""Do not act as if you are here by choice human, you were captured in battle, and our spells guarantee that no one can fix the location of this city, and even mightier magics make our walls unbreachable once the gates are closed. No mage born can teleport into or out of the city, your compatriots will never be able to locate you and your friends to effect a rescue."" That damned grin was back, as the human chucked roughly. ""Rescue? Who the in the Seven Hells told you we needed to be rescued? Do you have any idea how we have fought you back across half a continent? We adapt, we improvise, we overcome every obstacle. We wiped out the Orks by playing tribe against tribe, allying with one tribe to kill of its neighbors, before turning on that same allied tribe. Now, they are so few, they only exist in scattered, dying pockets in the Wild Mountains. When we realized how slowly the Dwarves bred, we engaged them in a war of attrition until they were too weak to fight us any longer, and now they are naught but a memory. We brought axe, and fire to the Dryad Realms, and the plow to the lands of the Pixies, each time finding their weaknesses, and designing our tactics to fight them."" He nodded to the nobleman. ""Like your vulnerability to iron. Once we knew of it, we adapted our weapons and equipment to fight you. That's why we have been steadily pushing you back."" The tall nobleman sneered as he pointed to his burnished, golden breastplate. ""Yes, but we adapt as well, our newest armors will cover us completely, and though we do not use iron, or steel, our magics make our bronze alloys stronger than either. Your cursed iron will be useless against it."" The human nodded, and smiled once more and looked out the nearest window. Night had fallen, and the stars were beginning to make their appearance. He looked back at the tall Elf. ""We knew about the armor, and our Auguries also foresaw that your Emperor was gathering all his noblemen, and mages to outline his plans for the coming campaign, that's when myself and my friends were deployed to get captured, and bring our particular 'curse' to your doorstep."" The Elf laughed in relief. ""Disease? You thought to bring a disease to Var-el-thon, and our people? You pathetic monkey, we are not susceptible to the sickness, and agues that plague your race. The Elves are Eternal, and you are insane..."" His voice petered out as he looked aghast. The first rays from the full moon stroked the face of the human. Dark hair began sprouting from his skin, and the ropes securing him, snapped as his body swelled with slabs of muscle. His face began elongating, and huge canines emerged from his gums. A guttural laugh came from the beast that was once a man. The last words he could make out were. ""Bronze... nothing but bronze."" Before the werewolf's jaws closed around his throat."

The wind and rain had been its most bitter enemies once upon a time, when humanity had first made landfall on this planet. Thin resin sheets, spat out of the printers with some fake wooden print, stitched together into some semblance of a place of worship. The air had turned the walls dirty and yellow in only a few short months. Now the wind pulled the scent of burning flesh through the bullet holes. Now the blood stood in neat lines against the walls. The sky had broken. Some pathetic fallacy of humanity's arrival to this world, tearing it asunder in our wake. The lightning flashed and the booming echoes shook the ground the shanty town stood upon. The wind, the pain, the cost was all mute as the monster crashed through the doors. I felt the cold arrive with him. It brought with it the sharp rain that bit at the skin like the hailstorms back on Titan. I looked up and saw him, framed in the doorway like a demon as the lightning flashed. There was no sound, no movement beyond the elements. I stood and he stood, and the world churned around us. I pushed a foot forward through the debris littering the floor. Closer to the door. His weapon came up and his mouth shouted something against the din. Claws. Claws holding a weapon, as if he needed anything more threatening than his very being. I held up my hands. When we'd landed, the aliens had found our human hands more fascinating than anything else. The vulnerability of them. The uses they could be put to when they were not dedicated to ripping and tearing and stabbing. The rifle shook in his clawed hands. I motioned to the doors, drew my hands against my chest. More shaking, more soundless shouts. I pointed again at the doors, took a step forward, and felt the heat of a round flash in front of my face. Another hole appeared in the walls of the church, an inch beside me. He came closer, moving from doorway to the rearmost pews. He almost fell against them, his legs giving way as he moved. Before I could even get two steps in, the heavy weapon was pointed at me again. Once more, I held up my hands. The rifle swayed in his. He put a hand against the the back of a pew. I took a step. He opened his toothed mouth wide, and I took another step. The rifle was heavy, it swung in lazy arcs and he lifted his other hand to support it. The shift from seatback to weapon was too much, and the last of his strength gave way. I caught him, or tried to. He was big, heavy. The fur was dark beneath his tunic, matted where the rain had not washed away the blood. I could feel his growl tremble through his body as we gently arrived at gravity's natural resting point. Teeth, and anger, and knowledge of what the arrival of humanity had done to his people. He didn't let go of the weapon in his hands lightly. I set him down against the end of the pew. I left the rifle by his side, one big hand of his still atop it. He groped for the odd grip, but stopped as I stood and left him for the big doors. The rain was cut short, yet still it would fall. He was breathing, trying to say something. His hand had come to a stop on his rifle. His mouth wouldn't stop moving, the teeth bared. I knelt next to him. I held up a hand. His eyes tracked it. I put it against my lips. His breath stank as he roared at me. Like an animal. Like we had assumed. Like we had hoped. I closed my eyes, waited until the air stopped moving, and tried again. A finger pointing at my own chest, a hand clamped across my mouth. The eyes looked at my throat, his head canting to one side, and them the teeth vanished beneath the folds of his lips. His own hand touched his throat. He balled it into a fist, and released it, pointing at me. I nodded. He took his hand, ran it from stomach to throat to snout, and again balled it into a fist. I nodded once more. He tried to speak. Tried to communicate in that way all things do. I put my hands against my ears and he copied me. I nodded, and once more he copied me. I pointed at his stomach, a dark patch slowly blossoming as he'd sat down. He held a hand against it. The medkit, what was left of it, was designed for humans, but a bandage was a bandage. He watched me as I returned. I could feel his breathing as I pressed hard. Could see his hand flexing atop the rifle that was never more than arms reach away. But he didn't stop me. As I sat back, his other hand caught me by the wrist. I froze, as if the world outside had turned to ice and yet my blood was on fire. He let go of his grip, gently, and moved his hand, slowly, towards my shoulder. As he gave it a gentle squeeze I smiled, my first true smile in days. And as he copied me, the grin awkward across his face, I knew we would be okay because not a word needed to be said."
63,vulnerability,HFY,[OC] Earth Intelligence - Premission Log,191,azbqto,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/azbqto/oc_earth_intelligence_premission_log/,2019-03-10 14:41:31,"A new assignment has come to me down the pipeline - a planet the natives call Earth. After my success on Xora, this will be most assuredly be a test. If I pass, another planet and species will have been subjugated, provided the Planetary Acquisition Department can use my intelligence effectively. I have full faith in the Empires infallibility, but I do not hold the PAD in the same esteem. My log will be a record of my achievement that I can present for advancement, and will be an example of proper intelligence gathering for many generations to come. If I fail this test, my log will still be a guide of what *not* to do for intelligence gathering, and I will still be able to serve the Empire even in failure. However, I have full confidence that my abilities will prove to be more than a match for the inhabitants of Earth. As my ship is still approaching Earth, I do not currently possess the means to gather intelligence on the Humans that have become the dominant species. However, I *do* have access to our long-range intelligence gathering systems and will compile the information in this log before I arrive, as this is a good practice for intelligence officers. Knowing the environment of a planet targeted for Acquisition will help you understand how the dominant species has evolved, what gases will be effective in subduing the local populace, and what kind of environment suit the PAD should wear. After all, if the PAD squads suffocate upon insertion, they will be even less effective in doing their jobs, which, shockingly, is possible. Earths atmosphere composition is, thankfully, conducive to the Empires physiology. A 78% {Nitrogen} composition is within an acceptable range, as is the 21% {Oxygen} composition. Other notable gases, such as {Carbon Dioxide}, {Water Vapor}, and {Methane} are all within and acceptable range as well. The PAD squads will not have to wear any specialized respiratory equipment, although it is recommended PAD soldiers exercise regularly due to the {Ozone} levels, as it can impede the functioning of some systems in the unfit. The gravity of Earth is slightly lower than usual, so once again it is recommended the PAD use soldiers *that exercise*. The low gravity will wreak havoc upon our physiologies if exercise is not participated in. Our species innate superiority over other life-forms quickly diminishes when our bodies and minds are not well-taken care of. The best machines require rigorous maintenance to operate at full capacity, and the same is true for life-forms. Moving on to surface composition, Earths surface has less water than most other life-harboring planets. Approximately 29% of the surface is not covered by water, and my earliest hypothesis is the extra living space will make the Humans far more docile than other species previously subjugated. They will most likely have a strong bias toward empathy and reach consensus very quickly, as the individuals who could do this would have utilized the extra terrain more efficiently and would have been more successful in reproducing. A more docile species that focuses on cooperation instead of competition would make this planet an easy acquisition for the Empire. I do not expect to be at Earth long before I have identified key weaknesses in their information networks, as well as developed an acceptable invasion strategy. Taking down information networks in what u expect to be a cooperation-based species will be critical in subjugation. As this log will be immediately available to Intelligence Cadets for study, I will provide a prediction for my next entry. Upon coming into range of Earth for my sensors to work, I will enter their information network. I assume it will be global at this point, as long-range sensors indicate large light clusters on the surface of the planet. Generally these are cities after a species has harnessed electricity, and developing a global information network would be of high priority to the type of species I expect to encounter. Upon gaining entry to their planets information network, I will visit the areas with the most amount of traffic, and determine key areas of vulnerability, as well as anonymously interact with these Humans. It will be here I end my log, to be continued after visiting the first site and obtaining any relevant data. Once I arrive at Earth, my connection to the Empire will stabilize and allow two-way communication. Any Cadets that have questions or wish to provide suggestions based on the data I send back will be able to contact me. The amount of raw data on the information networks traffic will be quite large. I, as an experienced Intelligence Officer, will be able to easily discern the areas of high traffic. However, I look forward to seeing what Cadets deem important, as correct training for the next generation of Intelligence Officers is vital to the continuance of the Empire. This concludes my pre-mission log. Long live The Emperor. "

This should hopefully let me spend more time refining each part before posting it. As always please do post feedback in the comments* [Previous](URL --- A mangled fusion of machine and flesh lies before me. A whimper escapes its jaws before its put down. Another failure, another lost life. I strip it of its mechanical parts and any valuable organs that are intact before sending the body down to the furnace. Cleaning off the operating table I begin prepping for the next test subject in line. I take a look at the subject file A federally supplied bio-enhanced test subject? I say to no one in particular. For the gov to be sending us a previous test subject of the Department of Bio-Weapon Development means that they may finally begin augmenting the B-W subjects. Its rare to be able to test augments on anyone more important than a homeless person picked up off the street, nonetheless a federal test subject. Bio-Weapons are top secret, so for me to be able to operate on one is a once in a lifetime event even when youre as high up in T.I. as me. As I prep my operating machine, I look at the list of requested augments. Its completely out of the ordinary, filled with requests like Remove all skin and Augments to improve respiratory capabilities and the ability for the body to handle extreme pressure and remove frontal lobe. As I flip to the last page of the document, Im treated to a diagram of what the final product should look like. The previous requests begin to make some sense, the final product being nothing more than a suit of armor with some unthinking flesh in it. The test subjects genetic modifications focused on motor control improvements and beefing up the nervous system. The poor bastard probably wont even be able to be considered sentient after this. On the diagram of the last page is one last note Dont use anesthetics. Now thats a hell of a demand when paired up with the shit theyre asking me to augment, they effectively just asked me to torture someone. Well, whatever, a job is a job and I cant deny a government request lest I want to risk getting branded as an enemy of the state. I have the guards bring in the subject and strap her onto the operating table. She begins to beg for mercy but not in English, she isnt a Union Citizen As the situation begins to dawn on me, I can feel waves of nausea hitting me like a truck. Every single part of my brain is telling me to release her and run away. To stop this madness and just quit now. To kill myself. But a job is a job, no matter how inhumane it may be. We all must pay our debts. I swallow and begin issuing commands to my operating machine. Its spindly arms begin to cut away at her naked flesh, peeling off her skin in neat 1-foot x 1-inch rectangles. Her screams fill the air, a cacophony of pain and crying which ring throughout my skull, drowning my thoughts as I can do nothing more than watch the procedure to make sure that it goes smoothly. My eyes bolt open, the screaming still ringing throughout my skull. The nightmare seems to have followed me into the real world. Soon after returning to reality I realize that the screaming is the girl. Fuck fuckity fuck fuck fucking fuck! I jump out of the plane and begin to rush over to the cot. If a Stalker hears her, were fucking dead. I feel the Nausea from the memory hitting me and I stumble, barely keeping myself up by hanging to the side of the plane Id been sleeping in. Taking a deep breath, I try to run over to the cot. My legs give out right as Im able to reach it and I collapse by her with a crash. Her screams have devolved into fearful whimpers shes still asleep, if shes having night terrors that induce screaming I could be well and fucked. I get up on my knees and start to shake her awake. As she regains consciousness, I cover her mouth with my hand and put a finger to my lips. Shes confused and probably a bit frightened but isnt making any more noise. I listen carefully for any noises out of the ordinary and after a minute or two of hearing nothing I pull back my hands and collapse onto my back. As my anxiety and nausea begin to recede, Im able to finally get some words out of my mouth Thank Christ crisis averted. My exhaustion hits me like a truck, and I fall into a dreamless abyss. My head feels like its just gotten smashed with a hammer, not the best start to the day Johnny I open my eyes to see morning sunlight streaming through the skylights of the hangar. Everything that happened yesterday feels like a fucking blur. I feel terrible, but I cant spend the day sleeping, I still have the rest of the base to explore. As I sit up my back sends shudders of pain through my body, reminding me that I had a 1v1 with a Stalker yesterday. I grin as I think about it. What a fun day! Suddenly I find the girl standing above me with an MRE in her hand. A much better alternative to yesterdays gun threat if I do say so myself. I look up at her with the best shit-eating grin I can muster A present? For me? She smiles at that and hands me the MRE before walking off. A few minutes later she returns with an MRE of her own and sits on the cot beside me. After a bit of silence, she starts to eat, I follow suit soon after. My wounds are noticeably healed although some of the deeper ones are still in earlier states of healing and my calf hurts like hell, but I should at least be able to walk. The girl looks terrible though, her eyes have dark bags under them, and I cant even begin to imagine the emotions that must be rampaging around in her head. Lets try to make some conversation at least. I dont think I ever got your name. she stops eating and looks at me, in a soft and almost shy tone she says Hannah, and you? I crack a smile John, although my friends and coworkers call me Johnny or they would if they werent either Stalkers or Stalker food. She nods but doesnt give me much of a response besides that. Hannah. I say a few minutes later, waving my hand in front of her face as she stares off blankly, she blinks a few times and turns to face me Yes? she says a hint of surprise in her voice as she snaps back to reality. If youre going to be staying here with me, we are going to need to set some ground rules. First, youll need to pull your weight, Im not going to waste supplies on someone whos useless. Second, I put down my MRE and begin to pace in front of her we will need to limit our food consumption to only one meal a day if we are to survive a decent amount of time. And third, I lean down and put my face close to hers, her eyes dart away from mine unable to meet them You need to tell me what the hell happened to you, because as you are right now you could get us both killed. I speak in a harsh and matter of fact tone and when Im done, I grab my MRE and take a seat right in front of her. We eat the rest of our meal in silence, I really hope this silence doesnt become a trend, but I cant risk a scare like last night happening again. If Im to fix her than I need to find the root of the problem. Hannah sets down her empty MRE pack and looks at me, she starts to say something but stutters. After a short pause to recollect herself she tries again. She begins recounting to me the survival and subsequent collapse of a town known as Utopia. She tells me her familys attempt to escape the collapse by heading towards the city, not knowing of the monsters which now inhabited it. She tells me of the attack, how she only survived because she hid instead of trying to fight with everyone else. Tears come to her eyes and she begins to break down. As she attempts to recuperate, I feel a pang of hopelessness bubble up within me, the potential collapse of towns means that rebuilding is going to be much harder than I had originally thought. As for her, its best to try and keep my emotional investment to a bare minimum, lest I end up losing her to Stalkers. But I want to cry with her though, to show my vulnerability just as she is. But I cant, not if this investment could fail at any time, I dont think I could take that. After I finish eating, I get up and peer out the front door to check the outside. The good news is that everything seems the same on the outside, although Im worried that there may be more Nests in the Main Building. I shut the door and turn around to see Hannah wiping her eyes before getting ready for the day. I walk up to her as she puts on her shoes, a pair of old and ragged sneakers that are still, for the most part, intact. She turns to look at me and I offer her a hand to help her up, she surprisingly takes it. Hannah only stands about half a head shorter than me, a couple inches at most. I step back and begin walking to the door, I hold open the front door and motion for her to follow me out. Wait! Shit I almost forgot I slam the door right as she reaches me, which understandably startles her, and jog back to the plane, I slept in. Digging through the bottom of the cockpit I find the Stalker Claws Id acquired yesterday. Last thing Id want to do is to get caught in a fight without some kind of weapon. I jog back and hand her one of the claws. Here, these should serve as a good weapon until we can find something a bit less makeshift. She nods but pauses before grabbing the claw with a shaking hand. With that out of the way we step outside. Good morning you shithole airfield, lets see what surprises you have in store for me today! I turn my head to Hannah Alright! Today you and I are going to check out the Main Building in the base, its the largest building in this area. I honestly have no fucking clue what to expect in there for all I know theres an entire human civilization just stashed away in that building. I thumb to my left towards the Main Building. Hannah nods in acknowledgement but says nothing, her eyes seem to be scanning the landscape, fearfully darting back and forth. Presumably shes scanning for any Stalkers, a rather pointless act during the day time. I put my hand on her shoulder and she jumps, her eyes quickly moving to look at me. Its okay, the daytime is safe, you dont need to be afraid of the Stalkers now. She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath before responding Yeah she pauses, and looks like she is going to say more before just nodding and repeating Yeah. We head over to the Decrepit concrete structure and brace for whatever may be hiding inside. "
65,vulnerability,HFY,[OC] Diary of a Post War Clone Trooper - Entry 5,1,a1c7qe,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/a1c7qe/oc_diary_of_a_post_war_clone_trooper_entry_5/,2018-11-29 11:33:13," [&lt;&lt; First Entry](URL [&lt; Previous Entry](URL \----- **Entry 5** As per the etiquette training information uploaded before my birth, I knocked on Tsins room door, and waited for her to open it. In pre-war Earth culture it was considered impolite to enter somebodys room and kill them without knocking first. I waited for Tsin to open the door. After two minutes of waiting she still did not open the door, so I thought that it might have been likely that she did not hear my knocking over the much louder percussion music. Or perhaps she had confused my knocking as part of the music. I knocked again, this time coupling it with yelling Tsin, could you please turn the music down? in an effort to pre-emptively get my point across. Tsin did not turn the music down. She turned it up. Wondering if she had confused my request for sarcasm, I tried knocking again, to which the Heeran responded by further increasing the music volume. It was then that I realised she was increasing her music volume provocatively. With that realisation I felt less inclined to asking her to turn down the music, and more inclined to snapping her spine and using the scraps of her sound system as scrap metal for my ammunition tooling kit. I put my hand on the handle of her door, readying myself to twist it open and burst into her room for a shock and awe raid, stopping myself only at the last second. I stopped myself because must have booby trapped the door, which was probably primed to explode as soon as I twist the door knob. I know she must have made this booby trap because I was in the process of making the same booby trap for my door. It was a close call. I had almost given into her taunts, and fallen into her trap. I was letting my hubris get the better of me, and I had underestimated the Heeran, just because I could so easily break her delicate form in unarmed combat. I narrowly survived an assassination attempt. Learning from my mistake, I returned to my room and began to load my AK-900 rifle. Although it was heavy, the kinetic rounds would puncture through the wall with great ease, allowing me to shred Tsin without having to walk into her traps. At the very least, I would show her that the children of Mother Earth were not to be trifled with. Before I could unload a full magazine of hot lead into the adjacent room, however, more percussion sounds came from another direction: my dorm room door. I immediately brought the gun up against my shoulder, aiming the barrel at the two inches of wood that stood between me, and whatever monstrosity was on the other side. The monstrosity turned out to just be Siqmashur. H-hey Edelweiss? Edelweiss, right? her words came in her typical stutter form. I really hope a translation patch update will allow for better translation of Viati. Just like Tsins provocations, Siqmashur could have setting me up for an ambush. However, I also trusted Siqmashur, because she had given me food that has still not turned out to be poisonous, and I did not want to shoot her through my door. I set my AK-900 down again, and opened the door just enough so that I could see the hunched visage of the alien worker while still obscuring her vision to my equipment. I was just wondering if you k-knew where the rubbish bin has gone? It should just be a metal cylinder, about this big, she explained, putting on of her hands around the height of her knees. I did not answer her immediately, even though I knew the answer. I had taken the metal cylinder and splintered it into shrapnel. I planned to find explosive propellant to mix with this shrapnel and combine it with a motion sensor so that I can prime my door to throw hot metal shrapnel at uninvited intruders to my room, which is the same type of trap that Tsin surely had on her door. However, I did not believe Siqmashur would have been pleased to hear of this information. She would probably be upset if she found out that both her flatmates had explosive rigged doors, and I did not want to be antagonising a physically strong super-ant while my improvised trip mine was not yet emplaced. Its gone, I informed her, without lying, but also not telling her the difficult part of the truth. O-oh For a few seconds we said nothing, and I believed the conversation had concluded. I began to shut the door so that I could focus on terminating my Heeran neighbour, when the Viati interjected again. Wait! she said, without any stuttering for a brief moment. She wedged an arm into the doorway at the same speed that my arm reached for the stun gun in my pocket. I I was hoping we could you know talk? This confused me, since we were talking before, and then there was silence, which meant she did not want to talk. And then she wanted to talk again. While I was grateful for her food, I found her indecisiveness to be rather irksome. But not as irksome as playing music that reminded me of orbital bombardments. Y-youre from Earth right? Siqmashur began to ask the obvious. Its the first time Ive met someone from Earth and and I wanted to learn a little about you. Is it alright for us to talk in the lounge? I hesitated. It was clear to me now that Siqmashur was not an assassin, but a spy that intended to squeeze classified intel from me. Surely, this is why she has given me food; so she could try and win my trust and lower my defences. I warned my strike team members not to be so trusting of people that give them food in future. Epsilon Minus PA-97612 said that I am that they do not need such an obvious warning. Epsilon Minus PA-97611 added that I was too nave for trusting any alien for any reason in the first place, and incidentally he had decided to name himself Ed, and PA-97612 had decided to name himself Edd. They consider this amusing because they are cloned from the same gene source, and were grown in growth vats directly next to each other, so they are basically twins. They also consider it amusing that I am an Epsilon Plus with the name Edelweiss, and that they are Epsilon Minuses with the name Ed(d), which is the same as Edelweiss but minus several letters. I do not consider this amusing. I consider it unnecessarily confusing. I also consider it lazy that they are clearly plagiarising my name. I launched a complaint to the Deltas. They have not yet responded. Back to the Viati worker who was attempting to invade my room. I do not wish to speak right now, I said to her as I drew my stun gun, certain that my movements were not in her field of vision. While my observations of Siqmashur had allowed me to deduce that she would pose little threat in a physical confrontation, I wanted to draw my interactions with aliens to a close for the day. Between the booming and crashing from Tsin through the wall and Siqmashurs attempts at currying favour with me I began to feel increasingly mentally exhausted. I was also getting physically exhausted as I had gotten no sleep in the two days since my birth. In both cases I was not in the mood to be interrogated. Despite not wanting to make a show of weakness I could not stop myself from yawning. I did remember to cover my mouth in adherence to traditional Earth customs, as well as preventing Siqmashur from drugging me while my mouth was open to make me more susceptible to probing. A-ah! S-sorry! Siqmashur apologised You must be tired you just got here today... I should let you sleep now, since we have class in the morning. It appeared that Viati workers were very reluctant to push their targets during moments of vulnerability, in stark contrast to their aggressive warrior counterparts. This made them poor interrogators, which makes me wonder why Siqmashur was selected to be a spy in the first place. Did the League have no better candidates for subterfuge? I-Ill talk to you tomorrow goodnight the Viati let go of the wooden wall between us, turning to return to her own room. Goodnight, I lied as I closed the door. It was not a good night. I was stuck on an orbital complex in a distant star, far away from the holy planet. Tsin was also still playing her music, which was an issue that I no longer had the energy to resolve. It was the worst night of my two day long life. However, sometimes lying was more polite than telling the truth in pre-war Earth, and I must remain courteous in the face of adversary. Delta Minus LA-30001 also informs me that I had missed the opportunity to reverse interrogate Siqmashur on Viati history and culture, so that we may use the information against all future Viati we face. She also informs me that she has named herself Daffodil, in lieu of my graceful floral themed personal name. From this I can deduce that she does not agree with me that Epsilon Minuses should be punished for copying from my name. I tell her that I would have preferred if she told me this information tomorrow morning when I have gotten some proper sleep. I do not tell her that I also think she is appropriating my name instead of coming up with her own, even though I do think that. She is a Delta Minus and she outranks me so she can copy my name if she wants, even if I do not like it. I am on my bunk bed now. It vibrates with Tsins music. She still hasnt stopped. I resolve to sleep even if the trembling of orbital bombardments will continue throughout the night. Delta ND-10842 says his name is Destructoman Infinity, and insists that I write this down in my diary. Nobody can veto him, as he holds the highest rank in the local neural network. Daffodil recommends that he uses a more normal Human name, like Dillan, and also insist that I write this alternative naming option in my diary. I have now wrapped myself with the blankets. They feel heavier than plasma fluid in the growth vat, but they are also warmer. My head is cradled in a pillow that feels soft, like the welcoming embrace in the bosom of Mother Earth. I think I understand why pre-war humans enjoyed sleeping in such luxurious conditions. The thundering from Tsins room is starting to mute, but I still feel my bed rocking. I do not care. I feel safe under my blankets, even though they offer me no real protection. Maybe it is not such a bad night after all. \----- [&lt;&lt; First Entry](URL [&lt; Previous Entry](URL \----- *A/N: So this is the last chapter in the batch that I managed to complete.

At first, there was nothing but the devastating waves of pins and needles as his body woke. As they subsided and he waited for the coherence necessary to move, he was trapped for a moment with nothing but his memories. For a couple of minutes, which seemed to be soul-shattering hours, he lived in a mental world defined entirely by billions of deaths untold centuries ago. Yet, even that despair could not overpower what came next, a sense of duty and hope. A time to rebuild. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; The fact that he was here now and not one of the backup captains was a good sign. Ship sensors indicated they were about two years away from their destination and that everything was in working order. Everyone on the ship was healthy. 10,000 souls sailing through space. It was time to begin initiating the wake-up process for the real-space crew so that they would be back to optimum once it was time to slip back into real-space. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; As he moved to get dressed and then head to the command console, he was stopped by two entities. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Before him were two creatures, what they were he couldn't guess. They were light and fire. They were wind and water. They were real, but not. They seemed both two dimensional and more than three dimensional. They were wings and eyes. They were the rebirth that is destruction. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; When they spoke, it was both as individuals and as one. They were messengers speaking as powerful beings and children sharing a simple story. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*Last Adam\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*All the billions went to sleep, and the world lay still. But some were not asleep, 10,000 were dead in a city of steel.\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*First Adam\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; The creatures darkened until they were faint shadows, nearly imperceptible. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*Before the beginning there was the\* \*\*Unknowable\*\* \*and the\* \*\*Unknowable\*\* \*chose a Path.\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*And the\* \*\*Unknowable\*\* \*withdrew from a place so that there would be room for imperfection.\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*And the\* \*\*Unknowable\*\* \*chose restraint and entered that place as the\* \*\*Knowable\*\*. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*And the\* \*\*Unknowable\*\* \*and the\* \*\*Knowable\*\* \*were\* \*\*One.\*\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*And in this womb of imperfection the\* \*\*Knowable\*\* \*was expressed as the Word.\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*This brings us to the beginning.\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*In the beginning...\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; The creatures grew silent, but their colors changed and shifted, grew bright and dark, in mere seconds-- through a mesmerizing shifting of colors-- they gave the sense of countless eons passing. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Abruptly, the prismatic journey stopped and the creatures were a lifeless gray with an occasional ripple of blackness. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*The Universe had become formless and void. And there was darkness over the face of the deep. And the Breath of the\* \*\*Knowable\*\* \*danced upon the Waters.\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; And the creatures shifted into a swarm of blues and greens that reminded him of tears of joy, and tears of sorrow, and gentle spring mists and furious summer storms. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*Let there be light.\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Then the creatures flared into a living-brightness that put all other light to shame. And the creatures grew without changing size. And they reminded him of warm sunrises, and the vulnerability of newborns, and the passion of love, and the hope of new beginnings. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*And light is separated from darkness.\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; And the being on the right continued to radiate, but the being on the left faded to a consuming and bleak shade. And the darkness lashed out at the light, but the light was unfazed. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*Age One\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Then four more beings appeared. These were of the same form, but smaller than the first two and each was a swirl of blues and greens. And they spoke as one. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*It is the glory of the\* \*\*Knowable\*\* \*to conceal a matter, and the glory of Kings to search it out.\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*And the waters above were separated from the waters below.\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; With this, two of the beings drifted closer to him and two drifted further away. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*The Second Age.\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Two more beings appeared beneath the two that had drifted away, these a swirl of browns. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*And the waters below were gathered into the Seas and the ground gathered into the Land.\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; The blue creatures stood to the left and the brown to the right. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*And vegetation, each according to its kind, and plants, each with fruit according to their kind, were called forth from the ground.\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; The brown beings slowly shifted into a swirling show of greens. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*In wisdom the land was founded, in understanding the heavens established, and by knowledge the deeps were broken up.\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*The Third Age.\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Then a group of new beings appeared. Each one dancing as a tiny wisp. Each one glowing in a unique hue. There were reds and yellows and oranges and whites and blues. Each one was no more than a spark of light, but they were countless in number. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*We are known by Name.\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*And we will separate day from night. We are for signs, and days, and seasons, and years.\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*The great ones among us shall be Suns, and we will rule the Day. Others of us shall be Moons, and we will rule the Night.\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*And all of the Stars shall separate Light from Dark.\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*The Fourth Age.\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; And then everything faded away. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; And he stood in the middle of vast oceans. And there was water in every direction. And it was silent and everything was still. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; And he was half in the water and half above the water. And a single bird swam through the air above him. And a single fish swam through the water below him. And then two. And then three. And then four. And soon in every direction, all that could be seen were the birds of the air and the creatures of the sea. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; And together all of the creatures spoke. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; ""The Fifth Age"" &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Then once again the skies and waters were empty. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; And he stood at the shoreline. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; And a whirlpool formed in the water and above it a whirlwind in the air. And it was formed into Leviathan, the Serpent of the Water and Air. And it went off to seek amusement playing in the waters below. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; And the water raged against the land. In the mud was formed Behemoth, the Beast of Water and Earth. And it lumbered off to toil, to consume and to be consumed. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; And fire mixed with the air. And it was formed into the Bronze Serpent. And it went off into the desert to lay in wait. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; And everything once more was still. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; And the waters faded away, and he stood in the middle of a vast field. And, with an explosion, life burst forth around him. And the land was full of living things, and livestock, and creeping things, and wild animals. Each according to its kind. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; And then the view shifted again. He was somehow once more in the water, once more at the shore and still in the middle of the field. And he saw all of the life, and he heard a voice. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*\*Let Us make Man in Our image and likeness.\*\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; And Man was made in that image. But he was curious. What of the likeness? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; And Man was formed from the Breath and the Dust. And Man was Masculine and Feminine. And Man was a Living Soul. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; But it was not good for Man to be alone. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; He needed a helper suited to him, a companion to stand opposite. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Once more he saw every living creature, and he saw its essence and he knew its name. And then he saw each of his 9,999 passengers and he knew their names. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; But no one was found. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; And Man was put into a deep sleep and one side was separated from the other. And he was half. And the other half was fashioned into something better. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*\*The Sixth Age.\*\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; And all of the work was finished and it was very good. And the Seventh Age was set apart. And the Seventh Age was a rest. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*\*Remember and Guard.\*\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; And the Four Veils were lowered. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; The Veil of Time, separating Action and Justice. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; The Veil of Space, separating Person from Person. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; The Veil of Paths, creating the Illusion of Many Equal Choices. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; The Veil of Shadows, creating the Illusion of Distance between Man and the \*\*Knowable\*\*. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \----- &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Adam stood alone in the chamber. He looked where his guests had stood and the space was empty. But he remembered all those depending on him and began to head towards the control room. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; He was surprised to feel a hand upon his shoulder and he turned. And his eyes met another's. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; And he looked into her eyes. And she looked into his. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; And they both were clothed in light. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; And they were naked and not ashamed in a ship of 10,001 souls sailing through space."
67,vulnerability,HFY,[OC] Diary of a Post War Clone Trooper - Entry 6,1,a288zt,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/a288zt/oc_diary_of_a_post_war_clone_trooper_entry_6/,2018-12-02 10:51:48," [&lt;&lt; First Entry](URL [&lt; Previous Entry](URL \----- **Entry 6** I am writing this entry due to an unprecedented change in circumstances that desperately require documentation. Although the importance of events throughout my day do not start at the beginning I shall nonetheless report them in chronological order for greater context. As was mandatory by the armistice, I attended secondary I school today. I had to wear the schools uniform, as opposed to my general infantry uniform. The blue-white colour scheme of the uniform is very poorly camouflaged in non-naval environments. The blazer and buttoned shirt made it difficult to perform hand to hand combat manoeuvres, and the knee length skirt made it difficult to run. I much preferred the general infantry uniform. I wished I could go to school in my general infantry uniform, just like I can go to war in my general infantry uniform. War seems to be easier to understand than school. At least if I go to war I am permitted to kill the dangerous aliens that I meet. That being said, I made certain to disassemble my AK-900 and bring it to school in its box. The rifle would take a minute to assemble so it was unlikely to be of immediate use should I come under attack, but it was better to have a weapon that I could assemble in a minute than no weapon at all. During that crucial minute I would have to rely on my wits and my 50,000 volt stun gun as my first line of defence. Siqmashur was waiting by the door when I left my dorm room. Not waiting to strike at me in a moment of vulnerability, but merely waiting. This seemed like an unproductive use of her time. Tsin was still in her room, with loud percussive music playing. She did not appear to have turned off her music all night. A-are you feeling n-nervous for your first day of school? the Viati worker asked. Yes, I admitted. Although I had been taught in my growth vat that I should not expect to live any longer than a sixty minutes after I encounter aliens in live combat I still felt a great degree of fear of meeting my alien classmates. I did not want to die at the hands of these savages for no clear purpose, and so far away from Holy Mother Earth. D-dont worry it-it isnt so bad, Siqmashur tried to assure me. Her twitching antennae was oddly similar to the sort of motion I would want to do to vent off my unease. Except I do not have antennae. I have hair. My hair does not twitch. I-Ill look after you s-so you can ask me if you n-need to know anything! I do not see how her offer made any sense, considering she was one of the very unclean outsiders that I feared. Perhaps she was indicating her willingness to become a turncoat and betray her kind for the greater cause of Mother Earth. I must continue to observe. We walked to school together, equal pace to one another. Siqmashur walked at a sluggish pace, even for her clumsy Viati legs. I had to reduce my own walking pace to prevent exposing my back to her. Tsin did not come with us. Her loud music continued to play as we left. H-here Siqmashur said as she tore the plastic cocoon off of some sort of dense muesli product. I I figured you probably dont have b-breakfast, since you havent gone shopping for ingredients yet I accepted the muesli-product with significantly less hesitation than I accepted the porridge/soup mixture the previous night. If Siqmashur did not poison me the first time she attempted to feed me there was no reason for her to do it the second time. I placed the compact bar into my mouth. It was dry and tasteless, and much more akin to the military rations I had eaten on the ship on my way to the Complex. Thank you, I said, remembering my manners. Half of the unchewed mueslis fell out of my mouth and dropped onto the concrete floor we were walking on as I did so. It was upsetting. I must remember not to talk and eat at the same time in future. S so umm Siqmashur began to say as I began focusing on consuming the mueslis in my mouth. Is it true that all Humans from Earth are c-clones? I realised that she was attempting to procure information from me in exchange for food. I considered this while I continued chewing on the half-bar of nuts still in my mouth. While it was not ideal to reveal too much information about Mother Earths defences, I also figured that the Viati agent would only continue to provide me with much needed sustenance if I was co-operative. After all, there were much worse ways to be interrogated. I swallowed her bribe and answered, Yes. Wow she said with what I am assuming to be astonishment. I mean cloning of sapient life is illegal in the Galactic League I was aware of this information. We had been told in our growth vats that the Galactic League considered us abominations because we were clones, and that we would not be given any quarter if we were captured. Judging by the video footage of the First Invasion, we would probably been given no quarter even if we werent clones. Ah! Im sorry, Siqmashur apologised again. I-I didnt mean to say I mean Im not saying its bad that youre a clone its just Ive never met a clone before. I have also never met an outsider who gives me food before, I responded. I believe that makes things fair. I did believe that it made things fair. I still do. It took a long time to walk to school, even though the main school building was facing directly opposite to the dorm building. Several hundred aliens of different molds wearing the same blue-white multiform walked past us, and by the time we had entered the main school building there were no other aliens still walking. It seemed that Siqmashur had a large number of inefficiencies in her actions. This was a stark contrast to the zealously industrious threat of the Viati we were taught to fear. I began to wonder if our training information needed to be updated. We arrived into a classroom where all the other alien students had already taken their seats. Just like the uniforms, each seat was tailored to the species that sat on them, calling into question the capacity for standardisation of equipment within the League. Siqmashur scampered to her seat much faster than Ive seen her move at any other time. She had walked so slowly on our way to class that I had begun to underestimate her agility. Well, it looks like the newest addition to our class family is here! The the large Buthesian teacher said, his fur covered chest expanding and contracting substantially underneath his tunic as his boisterous voice rammed against my eardrums like Heeran pop music, nearly overloading my neural implant. It appeared that aliens enjoy loud noises. My name is Mr Rumbur, and Ill be your teacher for the school year. Come on in! We dont bite! he lied. Despite the Buthesians insistence that they do not bite, I could see at least seven species in the classroom that were known to use biting as an instinctual attack in unarmed combat, including the Buthesian himself. I obeyed his command, however, as I recognised that I was not under the schools command structure. During school hours these aliens would be my platoon, and the teacher would be the platoon commander. Gingerly, making sure that I was not activating any landmines my classmates may have laid, I walked up beside the teachers stand, and turned to face the classroom. I had my back literally against a wall as my eyes scanned the near thirty filthy outsider students in the room, each one of them with their eyes (or sonar sensors in the case of the Putyu in the front row) fixed on me. *Watching me.* Needless to say I felt extremely uncomfortable in that situation Go on! Introduce yourself to the class! the hornless minotaur-esque teacher demanded with sadistic glee. It was greatly unnerving the difference in size between myself and the Buthesian that now held authority over me, and I lamented greatly that I had brought my AK-900 to school unassembled. Tell us your name, and a little bit about where youre from, and what you like to do in your spare time. As much as I wanted to do nothing of the sort, I had no choice but to give in to the teachers absurd command. My name is Edelweiss. I was whispering, even though I wasnt attempting to keep my name a secret. I do not remember why I was whispering, but I remember that it was very difficult to not whisper. I was produced in the Chengdu Aerospace Industrial Arsenal on Mother Earth. In my spare time I enjoy cleaning and maintaining my rifle so that I am combat ready should I need to defend the cause of the holy mother planet. Judgemental murmurs from my wicked classmates began to brush across the room. I realised that I had told them too much, and that they were suspecting that I was posing too much of a tactical threat for them to ignore. I had to quickly change their opinion of me, so that they did not decide to murder me there and then. An Edelweiss is a type of flower, I explained, remembering Tsins lack of knowledge on Earth plants. Surely, knowing that I was a harmless specimen of decorative vegetation would throw them off from suspecting that I was a weapons grade military asset in teenage form. I lifted the black case that held the stripped down metal parts of my heavy kinetic rifle to further emphasise. This is a musical instrument, I assured them. I play a musical instrument. The muttering of my classmates plotting my demise came to a halt. I had successfully convinced them that I was a decorative plant. That is certainly a unique self introduction, Mr Rumbur said, completely fooled by my veil of innocence. I hope you get along with everyone in the class. Now please, take your seat over there if you dont mind. Once again I obeyed the Buthesian, making sure to circle around the classroom as opposed to walking straight through the middle of all the aliens. While I was certain that none of them still suspected my status as a born soldier, I also did not risk being surrounded and overwhelmed. By going the long route I managed to minimise the risk to a single potential angle of attack. There were, in fact, two unoccupied desks that met the standards of pre-war Earth furniture next to each other near the back corner of the room. I elected to sit in the one directly in the corner, which provided me clear line of sight over my still untrustworthy classmates. I also elect to sit in the corner most seat because there a Univarian one seat over. While the Univarian was smaller than the adult Univarians that typically guarded Galactic League installations, he was significantly larger than any other being in the room, including the adult Buthesian teacher, and I had no intentions of sitting next to a creature that could easily kill an entire battalion of three hundred armed clones of myself. Admittedly, the Univarian looked less intimidating that his entire body was clumsily hunched to prevent his head from touching the ceiling. The classs attention was directed to the teacher as he began to teach very elementary physics that I had already had uploaded into my mind when I was still in fetal development. At first I was relieved at the simplicity of the courses being taught to my peers, since it was a clear sign of the inferior intelligent of those that grew up in the Galactic Leagues curriculum, drastically reducing the dangers of Machiavellian plotting of my assassination. However, I quickly learned that forcing thirty sapient beings that were not yet fully matured to endure such simple lectures for hours at a time was a very advanced form of torture, and the League was training its future recruits to be immune to psychological pain. For what seemed like an entire lifetime (even though it was only one twentieth of my lifetime) the teacher continued to pound us with mundane facts about Newtonian physics without divulging into their practical applications in combined arms assault, when the most extraordinary thing happened. It is so bizarre that I am now beginning to suspect that perhaps Siqmashur had put hallucinogens in the muesli bar I consumed so readily. As the teacher drew barely discernible diagrams with his paw finger on the holographic screen that the class was forced to stare at, the door suddenly opened again. Sorry Im late Mr Rumbur. I did a long sleep again. Although they did not immediately register in my mind due to his jumbled syntax that had to be rearranged by my neural translator, the words he said themselves did not translate. Somehow I still understood him with reasonable clarity, recognising most his words as part of pre-war English. While this revival of the dead language itself was already an anomaly beyond my understanding, what happened next is the true crux of why I am writing this emergency entry in my diary: A boy walked in, propelled by two human legs, swaying his two human arms. He scratched his human brown hair with his human finger nails. His human lips curling up to reveal his human white teeth, creases forming in the human tan skin around his human green eyes, a very human expression of an embarrassed smile. He was even wearing the same pre-war human styled uniform as I was, except he was fortunate to have more practical trousers than the acrobatically restrictive skirt I wore. He was visually a biological human adolescent in every way that I could imagine. But he cant be a human. It is impossible. His face and form does not match any of the 1,037 genetic templates that survived the First Invasion of Mother Earth. Thats alright, Lab Technician, the teacher addressed the human-esque boy with seemingly much less enthusiasm than when he was tormenting the class using rudimentary physics teachings. Im going to let you off with a warning this time, but make sure you come to class on time in the future. This is the second time youve missed the half of the morning lesson. The Lab Technician boy protruded his human-like thumb from his otherwise closed human fist. Thanks Mr Rumbur. Youre the best. He then turned to me, approaching me with a very human expression of grinning. This makes it him first person I have been able to clearly read the expression of. I did not feel comfortable with being able to read his expression, and was beginning to wish that he was a Viati, Heeran, or Benthusian that I would be able to exterminate without needing to feel any empathy or confusion. I tightened my grip on my stun gun, which I had no recollection of drawing, trying to prevent the self-defence weapon from slipping out of my sweat stained palm. The boy stopped in front of me for what I thought was to be the second before he would turn out to be a previously undocumented alien shapeshifter that was waiting to get within range to pounce me, but no attack came. He merely bobbed his head up and down, his smiling expression widening for emphasis, saying Hello with a hauntingly chipper tone. Since then the boy has placed himself in the seat between myself and the Univarian, and has been paying great attention to the teachers physics torture with masochistic fascination. His fixation on the mind splitting class further emphasises that this Lab Technician could not be a human like myself or any of the good children of the holy planet. I am currently writing this diary entry with great difficulty, as my shaking is reducing the legibility of my handwriting. The cold sweat that permeates my body is also making the pages in my diary very damp. I reported this incident to my strike team members for further instruction alongside a distress signal requesting for immediate assistance. Ed has expressed his disbelief, and asked me if I was suffering from a neural implant malfunction. Edd also expressed his disbelief, and would like to add that it may be possible that the food I had consumed from Siqmashur was drugged with hallucinogens. Daffodil noted that she was sceptical, but that I should proceed with caution, and gather more intel so we can make a more informed decision on our best course of action. Delta ND-10482 insists for me to write down that he would like to be referred to as Dillan as Daffodil had suggested, since his classmates had ridiculed him when he attempted to take the name Destructoman Infinity, and he did not enjoy that. He has ignored my report on the Lab Technician. I do not appreciate that none of them are making any attempt to help me in my predicament. I also do not appreciate my strike team members always demanding that I make changes to my diary entries to suit their needs. I suggest that they should write their own diaries instead of bullying me all the time. My suggestion was unanimously vetoed. Why are my strike team members so heartless? If I am to die today, I would like to make it known that my strike team members could have saved me from this impersonation of a Human, and that they should feel horrible when they find my lifeless corpse. I am entirely on my own now. I have not let go of my stun gun since the Lab Technician arrived in the classroom. Grasping a weapon brings me a little degree of familiarity and comfort. I have considered stunning the Human-parody in a first strike, but I am too afraid to initiate hostilities against a threat I did not fully understand. I shall end this entry here with the intention of investigating further. I pray to the Alphas who dwell in the palatial Garden of Eden that I will survive this confrontation long enough to make another entry. \----- [&lt;&lt; First Entry](URL [&lt; Previous Entry](URL \----- *A/N: Due to the increasing complexity and length of the entries, I will probably not be able to post daily as I did with the first five entries.

68,vulnerability,HFY,[OC]Lonely Souls: Damage Report,1,a4fy7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/a4fy7s/oclonely_souls_damage_report/,2018-12-09 10:45:32," This is the second part of this two part posting, if you haven't done so, go read the beginning, [&gt;Here&lt;](URL *** &gt;Damage Report *** Date: 217th day, 7824FPE (Founding of the Platinum Empire) 2nd tier Inspector Mlixt Austux of the 4th platinum fleet. Damage report on the Galactic Arm edge patrol Cruiser, 'Silver Reach and the emergence of a new Sheoshay weapon. Events as understood: On the 193rd day of the stated year, the Cruiser Silver Reach arrived at the border hub station, The Bronze Palisade. Upon arrival the surviving sub captain issued an immediate alert on the existence of a previously unknown Sheoshay super soldier to Central command. This super soldier possessed capabilities similar to a fully augmented and generator supported combat avatar. Reviews of what recordings survived allowed me to witness the following capabilities. Tier four telekinesis, tier three physical nullification, tier three spatial awareness, telewelding, tier three life sense, generator tapping and the common suite of Sheoshay civilian capabilities. [Auto note, simplified tier explanations appended to document end.] I must note that a combat avatar could quite easily display an identical range of powers in this situation. An important consideration when the capabilities of an Avatar are notably higher. While this Sheoshay individual acts in a manner that suggests poor training, we don't have the records to prove what limits this individual is working within. More alarming is the apparent lack of support apparatus. The Sheoshay female was effectively naked. Another note of importance was the discovery of a previously unknown race seemingly in the early stages of FTL development. The new race is seen to have impressive mental defenses displaying at least a tier 4 mental block and a tier 3 presence block. Three individuals were found with identical defenses suggesting the feature may be at least partially genetic. This would explain why the new race was completely unknown. As incredible as it may seem, I am led to believe those blocks to be autonomous of the creatures control. The captured ship of these Sapients had absolutely no defense against or conditions for mental manipulation. Simple mechanisms opened with no effort whatsoever. The operating system however seems to have been far more complex than any organic mind would normally be able to touch. While a proper research group would be required to say for certain, the preliminary study yielded absolutely no mental access points. Indeed, if the Sapients have a powerful shield they cannot disable, they are likely to have a wide range of unique technologies. I shall attempt to outline events as they occurred with a following prediction of what I believe to be the reasons for the events. Please not that without further corroboration I cannot say for certain if my predictions are fully accurate. On the 167th day of 7824 the Silver Grasp was nearing the end of its watch at the edge of the Ruptured Pocket. On this day they discovered the alien craft. The usual warnings were sent, to which the unknown craft replied with an unknown language. It was first assumed the ship was on a form of autopilot as no individuals could be detected on passive or active mental passes. Three individuals would be discovered by physical search in short order. Optional Audio Clip (Loaded): *This is the QTS Enterprise of the United Federation of Earth-* The creatures were quite vocal for several days but we were unable to come to an understanding of their language with their defensive barrier proving impervious to available means of penetration. Without a better name I will further refer to them as 'Qutee or 'Qutees as plural. The three Qutee prisoners were separated as per protocol and kept completely isolated for the period of their stay. Repeated attempts at overcoming the barriers continued to meet with failure with the personnel aboard the Silver Reach. It was also noted that great focused concentration was needed to even detect a Qutee seated directly across from the ship sensor operator. It was based on the use of these available resources that I have designated their mental block as at least tier four and their presence block as tier three. On the 185th day, the Sheoshay ship, designated Zeonescense was discovered on a circuitous route back to its home space. The ship was subdued in short order, any psions of note were disposed as per operating procedures. Only the captain and a selection of usable crew was left alive for later processing. The individual of note was not seen to have anything unusual about her at this time. What means she used to disguise her capabilities are currently unknown and with nothing but vague.conjecture to go on I have no viable assumptions or suggestions at this time. For this matter the only piece of information worth noting is that upon escape the female made a straight line through walls and bulkheads directly for one of the Qutee prisoners. The Captain of the Silver Grasp came to the same conclusion and attempted to dispose of that same prisoner. Even with the tap harness and the support of the ship generator the Sheoshay female eliminated the captain with ease. From this we can surmise she sacrificed her cover for the sake of the Qutee prisoners. The fact that she detected the prisoner at all is what leads to the assumption of her having tier three life sense. In terms of timeline, on the 186th day, approximately 7 hours in, the female first ripped the wall of her cell open. She then progressed through the ship without deviating from her initial path except when potential damage would compromise the vessel to her own detriment. She moved through the ship while weathering attacks from on board security, deflecting all attacks (tier three physical nullification), and promptly defeating all who stepped within line of sight of her body (tier three spatial awareness). Shortly before finding the first Qutee prisoner an escaped companion was injured and another killed. It was at this point that ship personnel realized she was tapping the ships psion generator for additional power. Efforts to wrest control of the generator would be ongoing and unsuccessful for the duration of the event. That is not to say the crew wouldn't have succeeded given more time. Her grip appears to have loosened as the altercation progressed and at several points she was within ergs of losing access. I believe this is the factor that convinced her to choose escape over the total destruction of Silver Grasp. Shortly after the injury of her companions she found the captain of the Silver Grasp attempting to dispose of the Qutee, but he failed in the effort. While I could outline the next sliver of time, suffice it to say she destroyed any resistance she encountered and freed any remaining prisoners. A full point by point recording can be found in the appendix of this report. The only change in the progression of events was discovering the Sheoshay captain leading to a more efficient destruction of utilities. They then located the small Qutee vessel, repaired the initial entry hole (telewelding) and removed the support gantry. Finally she spiked the psion generator and blew open the small cargo bay doors in one single burst (tier four telekinesis). From there the shuttle escaped in the direction of Sheoshay space. With the threat gone the Silver Grasp did minimum viable repairs in order to reach the closest military outpost. Recommendations: On the Qutees: Immediate probing of the ruptured pocket is highly suggested. While the historical self destruction of the little remembered Flodotion Empire was believed to have wiped the region clean, I must question whether a race like these Qutees with such apparent innate defenses would even have been aware of the event, let alone remember it. They will have weathered the event with little trouble. On the other hand, the quality of the FTL jump does still suggest a low tech level or at least a recently evolved race. If these Qutees were a little closer to amphibious one might assume they were offshoots of the Flodotions themselves, but available records suggest otherwise. Nevertheless I suggest placing the finding of this new race among our highest priorities. On the Star Ember Hive: While the Sheoshay people have been a middling, low threat race for some time it is now clear they are a more dangerous than realized. If there is one powerful individual such as this, there must be more. As the conquest of the Mersten Collective is winding down it might be worth considering the Sheoshay to have put themselves next in line for our undivided attention. The suppressive actions we have been taking thus far may only have served to force a more rapid development. As the sub captain had the wisdom and forethought to report directly to command on these events with all haste while keeping her crew isolated to prevent the spread of rumours I have submitted a recommendation for promotion rather than her removal. Her understanding of the proper chain of command is commendable. Appendix. Mental file 1.) (Recording of the Sheoshayan prisoner and her retrieval of all fellow prisoners.) Mental file 2.) (Costs of damage, listing of damaged and destroyed modules, expected time until repairs complete) Mental file 3.) (Noted relevant Psionic skills and known tier values) (file currently loaded) As always, Tiers represent orders of magnitude. As always, individuals skew towards different aspects of any particular ability, making ranges sometimes difficult to narrow down. Tiers can be reached through the achieving of any single one of the listed aspects although they are often listed with qualifiers. Abilities wherein psion generators are powerful multipliers are specifically noted. Tiers between different abilities are not energy equivalent. Cases where an extremely minimal amount of capability is still viable can sometimes call for a zero tier. Telekinesis - The movement of mass via mental concentration and expended energy. Variations in ability are reflected in how fast an object can be moved, how quickly an object can obtain that speed, how capable the user is of stopping an object and finally the sheer mass that can be moved. Highly dependant on psion generators. Tier 1 - The ability to slowly move and manipulate hand held objects. Tier 2 - The ability to move and manipulate heavy objects. Can move small objects at sufficient velocity to injure. Tier 3 - The ability to quickly move heavy objects or small objects at very high velocity. Can condense air and use it as a projectile. Considered Military grade. Tier 4 - The ability to rend material that would normally be considered engineered to prevent harm such as alloys, ceramics and polymers. Tier 5 - The movement or pulverization of large constructions of notable mass and durability. Necessary for ship combat. Tier 6 - Cannot be used without dedicated psion generator support. Necessary for FTL travel. Nullification, Blocking - The ability to stop another ability. Nullification is the active application while Blocking is a constantly maintained condition. A common example being physical nullification, an offshoot of Telekinesis. As a defensive component of the ability, it is often very worth mentioning in tandem with the primary ability. It is not uncommon to see blocking as a singular entry with no active counterpoint entry as blocking is often used in an automatic manner to prevent the issue of vulnerability to surprise at the cost of active use of related abilities. As this is the most variable aspect, it is much more common to see nullification and blocking in an entirely different tier set. Tiers in these cases are approximate to base ability tiers. Spatial awareness - additional awareness of an area, comparable to improved genetic senses such as sight, hearing and smell. But not always. Variations are of course which particular senses the ability applies to and the potential to sense through obstructions. High end awareness is required for FTL travel, although never done without dedicated calculation support. Specialized senses often warrant a different classification, although the tiers remain roughly the same. Life Sense as a common example is the ability to detect the living through uncertain means, usually worth noting when the ability can defeat obstructions. Tier 0 - Normally negligable ability. A tier 0 sense of sight may allow someone to see an object placed somewhere on their body normally out of sight, so while it is functionally useless, that does not remove the ability from consideration. Tier 1 - Notable improvement in ability range. Tier 2 - Notable improvement in ability range and resolution of details. Tier 3 - Sensory ability is approaching the edge of common genetic limits. Very limited ability to sense through some materials. Tier 4 - Common materials are easily defeated and the range or resolution of the sense is extremely advanced. Tier 5 - Defeats most defenses, range is functionally unpredictable, resolution is extremely high. Telewelding - The ability to join or rejoin materials. Tier 0 - It is possible to join or encourage materials to join that would normally be incredibly brittle or weak materials in the first place. The ancient example of wetting paper to make it easier to join remains an appropriate example. Tier 1 - Can cause hard materials to partially fuse. Connections are brittle, only good for infrequent civilian use. Tier 2 - Good for handheld tool use and some hard materials. Generally fine for common civilian use and some commercial work. Extended work can yield industrial or military grade objects, but the time cost is notable. Tier 3 - Can meld difficult materials, although still on a personal scale. One must be at this tier to consider the making of interpersonal weapons and armor on a reasonable time scale. Can meld common materials at a high rate, allowing for civilian and commercial construction work. Tier 4 - Can meld difficult materials at scale. Appropriate for high end industrial or military work. Appropriate for high density and unstable materials. Tier 5 - Ship grade manipulation, Extremely rare. Long thought impossible, although the past existence of key individuals required the creation of this tier. With calculation and psion generator support as well as available materials, individuals have been known to build starships from the core to completion. Tapping - While not existing in strictly tier form, there is notable variation of what an individual can access in terms of gained skill. Most psions of capability worth mentioning can tap into appropriate enhances such as power generators, calculators and automatic tools. Mental file 4.) (Known capabilities of involved xeno races) (file currently loaded) Sheoshay civilian capabilities: These insectoids are known to commonly possess basic Telewelding, Tier one and two telekinesis, and tier 2 telepathy with a unique talent for temporary personality blending. Individuals can and will submit themselves to a hive combination when necessary. While combinations such as this are very useful for raising the overall potential work that can be done by a group, there are functional limits without the use of psion generators or calculators. The primary purpose of the hive share is in obtaining hive typical coordination while not sacrificing the advantages of having singular entities. Unknown race, designation Qutee theorized capabilities: Mammalian race with suggested high grade strength and endurance. No active psionic capabilities noted and none likely to manifest. Witnessed individuals had identical tier 4 telepathic blocking and tier 3 life sense blocking. Observation of sleep cycles yielded absolutely no change in this status indicating the blocks to be autonomous. With such abilities this race is uniquely suited to espionage activities. End File *** &gt; *** Warmind Nerkerator released the imprint crystal from between his thumb and finger to float in its little pedestal upon his desk. A short pulse awakened the female thrall Kotryan standing off to one side and the small creature came to life, immediately moving to the bar in the far corner of the room. While Nerkerator waited for the much smaller, arguably normal member of his race to prepare the stimulant, Nerkerator pondered his next actions. Even if this new Sheoshay psion soldier variant wasnt as strong as an avatar, it was an important consideration that they had done so much damage without supporting gear or apparent genetic modification. The new friend of the Sheoshay was also a natural stealth mind, avoiding notice and defending itself frommental attack without effort. In terms of military opposition they were unlikely to be trouble without supporting psionics for telekinesis or just about any other material manipulation. The Kotry had yet to be so much as slowed down by opponents with poor physical or elemental manipulation. Crushing this opponent would simply be a matter of finding it. Mind blocking was powerful, but only utmost skill allowed a psion to use other non personal abilities at the same time after all. The problem would be in preventing these Qutees from getting into places that compromised Kotryan security. His thrall ambled over to Nerkators desk and placed the steaming cup of lift down without a whisper of noise. She then returned to her point next to the entry door, closing her eyes and letting her mind shut down. It was unfortunate that they had lost so much time due to travel time, but the inspector was required to inspect the ship in person, there was simply nothing to be done for that. Nerkerator did however agree with the suggestions within the report. He settled his massive frame into the heavy seat, his head coming to rest underneath the focus array. The system responded to the mental imprints, allowing Nerkerator to tap into his personal generator and calculator. FTL travelled had allowed Star Ember and its Sheoshayan people the time to prepare. It was time to begin the advance. The flexible hive mind of the insectoids made them stronger tha appearances might first suggest, enough to give Nerkerator a moments pause to ensure the Kotry were prepared. Still, against the focused might of the Platinum Empire and Nerkerators own golden mind, no opponent could hold their ground. Those petty bonds wouldnt save them from his reach. *** &gt;End, for Now ***"
69,vulnerability,HFY,[OC] [PI] Queens Alliance,1,9nlu1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/9nlu1h/oc_pi_queens_alliance/,2018-10-13 03:38:53,"**This is an image prompt using this picture from deviantart:** [**Ball by wlop**](URL *(The image is a picture developed for WLOP's comic Ghostblade. It is an image of two of the female characters dancing in a ballroom. I used the image prompt to write this story.)* &amp;#x200B; I held Queen Veronicas emerald gaze while we carefully danced at the center of the full ballroom, still uncertain about our newfound friendship. Many of our subjects eyes were on us, despite their attempts to conceal their concern, for much depended on this new alliance. She was the young ruler, barely sixteen, of the powerful Myranian kingdom to the west. And she was strongly blessed by the sun god Ephraim, her magic so overwhelming powerful that it persistently lingered in the air in her presence, taking on the form of fiery butterflies. The entire ballroom was full of them now, reminding everyone of just how important making her an ally was, as opposed to an enemy. She alone could wipe out an army of normal soldiers. Alternatively, I was Princess Alaysha, almost fifteen, although if my fathers health continued to decline then I would soon be the new queen as wellmuch to my chagrin. I too was strongly blessed by a god, the bright star JasmyneUlt. Yet there were no unintentional manifestations of my blue flames, not because I had more control than Queen Veronica, but because my power paled in comparison. I had no doubt she could snuff me out easily if so inclined. Which made me afraid. Hesitant. Reluctant. Yet, I didnt have a choice. Veronica had chosen me, after all, to share this customary dance with her, even before she knew there were no other options. Really, she had chosen me for everything prior to knowing of my fathers illness. When she had sent word to the TristanAsh kingdom of her intention to negotiate an alliance, she had specifically requested all royal contact be made through me, the princess. A very bold insult to the king himself, were he lucid enough to be aware. However, as I stared into her green eyes, evaluating her reserved expression, I began to wonder if maybe she wasnt as confident as she led everyone to believe. Was it possible she felt just as self-conscious about her role as I did? We were both so young, with high expectations placed on us and an insurmountable level of power at our disposal. In a way, I already was serving as the ruler due to the law that temporarily delegated power to the next in line to the throne in the event the current King or Queen was incapacitated. But it wouldnt be permanent unless my father passed  neither of which I desired. As the song drew to a close, our subjects applauding the conclusion of the dance, Veronica pulled me in close to her for the customary embrace. I felt slightly uncomfortable running my hands along her warm skin over her exposed back, primarily because I had rarely had this type of contact with another person. Although, I had to admit it wasnt diagreeable in the slightest. While I was fully clothed in a silver silken ballgown, my royal companion only had a black silken top and golden jewelry covering her upper body. Her black silken skirt occasionally lit up with flashes of orange, though the material itself never caught fire. Unexpectedly, her lips were at my ear, strands of her black hair tickling my cheek, as she whispered to me quietly. Princess Alaysha, if it is pleasing to you, I would request we retire to the ballroom antechamber to become more acquainted. Fearing my voice might not be steady due to Veronicas overwhelming presence, I simply nodded in agreement. # Part 2 As Queen Veronica sat down on the plush couch across from me, a short table between us, she sighed heavily and reclined against the soft cushions without concern for appearances. The butterfly manifestations of her fiery power filled the room all around us, yet even as one briefly landed on my exposed upper arm, there was no sensation of heat. Veronica immediately waived her hand in the air, as if to swat it away, only for it to do just that despite the distance. Sorry, she whispered, before leaning her head back and closing her emerald green eyes. Strands of her black hair hung loosely around her face, the majority of it tied securely in a long braid down her back. She seemed just as exhausted as I felt from being in public for so long today. I didnt respond to the considerate gesture, still unsure if I could even speak without revealing my weakness. Instead, I stared at the Queen hesitantly, surprised by her sudden uncomposed posture. It was the first time she had shown herself to be anything other than a confident ruler who always ensured she was perfectly presentable. Honestly, I was slightly envious of her, unable to mimic her myself and relax in her presence. I sat straight up on the other couch a few feet away, my hands laid neatly in my lap over my silken gown. After a moment, Veronica briefly opened one of her eyes to glance at me before closing it and letting out another heavy sigh. Her thick black eyelashes also made me envious. Princess Alaysha, no need for formalities. Its just you and me in here. Then please call me Alaysha, I said unexpectedly, surprised by my own bluntness. Both her eyes popped open then, and I quickly clarified myself, my voice now shaking. If it pleases you, that issince you suggested we drop the formalities My heart was racing now, my cheeks flushed. I tried to maintain my composure as she evaluated me with her piercing gaze. Very well, she said simply after a moment. Then you may call me Veronica while we are in private. An embarrassing sigh of relief escaped my chest, and a noticeable amount of tension released from my shoulders. Yet I maintained my overall posture for a few more seconds before carefully readjusting myself into a more comfortable position against the arm of the couch. Satisfied with my response, a small grin touched Veronicas lips before she spoke again. How is your father Alaysha? Is he feeling any better? Uncertainty gripped my chest again as I considered how to answer. It wasnt really a secret that my father was ill, but the extent of his disease was not well known. Many had hope that he might soon recover, but it was becoming apparent that was unlikely. Veronica picked up on my subtle facial expressions, and quickly retracted her question. The concern in her eyes appeared sincere. I did not mean to offend you, princess. I was merely concerned about his wellbeing. Please refrain from answering that question if it displeases you. Alaysha, I reminded her quietly. And its not thatIm justnot ready to lose my father. My eyes were unfocused as I stared down at the polished table between us, unable to meet her gaze. She took a deep breath then and rested her head back. Neither was I, she admitted, seeming unexpectedly vulnerable for once. Nor to I wish it for you. By our god Ephraim, I pray he recovers soon. Thank you, I whispered, appreciating the kind words. I hadnt expected this level of empathy from her, but knew that the burden I was afraid to experience was one she had already endured. Veronica opened her eyes briefly at the same time that I glanced up, and we held each others gaze for a few seconds. Youre welcome, she finally replied. I meant every word of that. She then hid her soul from me again, concealed behind her thick eyelashes. I glanced down at her smooth stomach just as one of her fiery butterflies landed slightly above her navel. However, unlike the one she had swatted away from me, she did nothing to remove it from herself, acting as if it wasnt even there. I stared at the vibrant wings opening and closing, mesmerized by the colors, as the oranges and yellows shifted like coals in a fire. After a moment, I became aware that Veronica was watching me again. I blushed immediately and looked up at her apologetically. Sorry, I said quietly. Theyre just so beautiful. She slowly sat up then in response to my comment, her expression slightly reserved. You like them? She asked hesitantly. I nodded immediately, being confident in my answer. Yes. Absolutely. While I knew about them, when I first saw you I felt like I was meeting a goddess. Veronica unexpectedly blushed and looked away, taking a moment to recover from my compliment. She then slowly returned her gaze to me. Do you want to hold one? She wondered quietly. Can I? I whispered. She nodded and reached out her thin hand towards me. For a brief moment I was uncertain of what she was requesting, before I mimicked her gesture and allowed her to take my hand in hers. A pleasant warmth filled my bones and radiated down my arm as an ethereal butterfly appeared in my palm, further warming my skin. She then released my hand, allowing me to pull her beautiful creation closer. I like them too, she admitted. Although, they strike fear in the hearts of many, despite their innocent appearance. She then paused before continuing. It pleases me that you do not fear themThank you for that. I looked up at her in surprise, again seeing a slight vulnerability in her expression that warmed my heart. # Part 3 Unexpectedly, there was a knock on the door leading to the ballroom, just before it opened. Veronica and I both instantly sat upright out of habit. She gave me a small smirk as I mimicked her posture, pulling a smile out of me as well. I still held the yellow and orange ethereal butterfly between my hands resting in my lap, not willing to give it up yet. Xin, the knight assigned to me today, peered in hesitantly. At first, I assumed he wanted to ensure I was still alive, given that my companions power made them all nervous, but the expression in his eyes revealed something more. Please excuse the intrusion your majesty, he began, his eyes first on Veronica before shifting towards me, but I need to borrow Princess Alaysha. King Zander requests her presence. Dread filled my heart as I heard what my guard did not say. My father was currently incapable of requesting the presence of *anyone* in his present statewhich meant Suddenly, Veronica was sitting down next to me on the couch, her arm wrapping around my shoulders. I didnt realize I was shaking. Xin fully entered the room and closed the door behind him, unsure of how he should proceed given my reaction. I tried to keep myself composed. Is hedead? I whispered. I barely heard his voice as he replied. Yesyour highness. The tears came faster than I anticipated as my face contorted in pain, fully revealing my tormented heart. Veronica immediately turned herself towards me, pulling me into her as I began violently crying against her shoulder. The butterfly in my hand disappeared as I wrapped my arms around her, desperately wanted to escape my grief. Im sorry, she whispered in my ear between my sobs. Im so sorry. I had known this day might be coming, but I still wasn't ready for it. I didn't want this. I didn't want to be the queen. I didn't want to be a ruler. I just wanted my dad. Veronica pulled me in tighter as I cried even harder. It took me awhile to recompose myself. Long enough that Xin had to leave briefly at Veronicas request to inform the coordinator that neither of us would be making an appearance for the closing speeches. By the time my sobs were coming without tears, the skin on her shoulder and chest was completely soaked with my unpleasant secretions. And my abated grief now finally left room for me to be embarrassed on top of everything else. I sniffled and gently pulled away from her, surprised that she kept her arms loosely around me. I glanced down at the disagreeable sight on her chest, finding myself unable to meet her gaze. Please forgive me Queen Veronica. I Veronica, she quickly corrected me. And there is no reason for you to ask for forgiveness. I looked up into her emerald eyes, shocked to not see disgust all over her face. Insteadempathy. She reached up then and brushed some of my white hair off my brow, before running her fingers along my cheek and returning her arm to my side. I blushed, still feeling embarrassed for her unpleasantly wet skin. However, surprisingly, her presence was more comforting than I would have imagined. She spoke up again after a few seconds, her voice quiet. Do you want me to stay with you? She whispered. I hesitated, not wanting to inconvenience her but knowing I had no one else who could provide the same level of comfort as she who had suffered what I now had to endear myself. I held her gaze for a few seconds, wanting to ensure her offer was genuine and not just a form of courtesy. After a moment, I took a deep breath and glanced away. Please. It would mean a lot to me. # [Part 4](URL"

Its a fantasy story about fathers and sons, hidden worlds, and people of various sizes. Part one can be read [here] (URL Little People (part 2 of 3) And he started shouting. It was a repeat of the points Id heard in my dream - the dream I supposed I was still having. I stared blankly at this tiny absurdity as he again launched into his high pitched spiel about my fathers world needing my help, the train wasnt running, the the sun had went out, and the monster was hunting in the darkness - killing men, women, and children. While the milkman bellowed faintly through his rolled up stamp, his partner, who had stood up by this time, joined in with faint affirmative outbursts of Thats right! Uh-huh! and Amen! The farmer was waving a crushed straw hat with one arm, and clutching his other arm against his presumably bruised ribs. In his excitement, hed forgotten to pick up his makeshift megaphone, and he was stomping on the curled postage stamp under his feet - almost stumbling over it at one point. I had the presence of mind to know that I was still dreaming. But I felt awake. Faintly, outside I could hear birds chirping and the whisper of cars driving by. My dreams didnt typically have this level of realism. Or, maybe they do when Im having them, and I forget when I wake up. This had to be a dream, an incredible one. I played along. How did you get here? I asked, quickly lowering my voice to a whisper when I saw how the sound of me talking normally had made them flinch and stagger backwards. Through the mail. Your dad left our mayor self-addressed, stamped envelopes for us to travel in, for when wed need to reach you. The milkman bellowed faintly in reply. Sure, that makes a strange kind of sense. It would be easier to reach me than my sister. I lived one town over, she lived all the way across the country. Processing this, I started to sit up - pushing myself up with the numb arm Id been sleeping on. Reaching forward to steady myself, I accidentally jostled the coffee table with my clumsy right hand. I saw them both scrambling to keep their balance as the coffee table was jolted slightly. I felt a twinge of embarrassment at my clumsiness - and I mumbled an apology. I was off balance too, just about as off balance as Id ever been, and now sitting up, I sat there looking down at them in dazed fascination - and they looked back at me. Both figures were about an inch tall - and they stared upwards with wide eyes and varied expressions. Their faces looked painted. Their expressions seemed drawn on, but were literally animated. Their features shifted and changed as they talked, displaying a range of emotions and mouths that opened and closed. The milkman seemed to be the spokesperson for the two of them - their leader. He was smiling slightly and squinting up at me. The farmer had stepped back a bit, sliding almost behind him when I had sat up. I realized belatedly that me sitting up so suddenly must have been a terrifying sight from their perspective. The farmer was clutching his straw hat to his chest and his mouth was a tiny painted O of surprise - or fear. Hes scared. I scared him. That realization struck me as being both pitiable and hilarious, and I covered my mouth with my hands to muffle a bark of laughter. I kept my hands over my mouth as I tried to control the mirth that was bubbling up from my stomach. Maybe this isnt a dream. Maybe Im having a psychotic break. Im hallucinating here in my living room. What a weird hallucination. I stared down at the figures, they stared up at me, and I surprised myself by starting to cry. Just a little. Maybe it was the shock of seeing them, maybe it was from trying to hold back my laughter, or maybe I was just going crazy. But the feeling of my eyes starting to well up, seeing the two visitors start to blur and waver in my vision, snapped me out of my impending laughing fit, and brought me back into the moment. So, you want me to go to my dads house, turn on the basement light, and start the electric train up again? I asked softly to break the silence - already knowing their answer. Yes! And kill the monster! The milkman piped up in response, and the farmer hiding behind him chimed in with an emphatic Yessiree Bob! But he didnt sound quite as enthusiastic as he had before. In fact, he sounded a little afraid. Sure, why not. I replied. Shaking my head in disbelief. I can do that for you. Yeah, lets do this. Then I started to laugh in earnest, rubbing tears out of my eyes while the two tiny men looked up at me with dual expressions of perplexity, perplexity that might have bordered on fear. Before leaving my apartment - with their permission - I secured the two of them in a makeshift carrying case. It was an empty plastic margarine container, with a wad of toilet paper as padding, and holes punched in the lid. According to them, they might look plastic, but they were fragile, they bled, and they needed to breathe. Leaving the apartment with the container firmly gripped in my good hand, I glanced in my mailbox and I saw they had indeed arrived by letter. There was a letter from my dad in my mail. The envelope had one corner torn open and it looked like three stamps had been pealed off of it. Inside the envelope was an empty matchbook box with a flattened cotton ball in it. I assumed they travelled in it. It must have been cramped. There was also a keyring with two keys. One was obviously a house key - freshly cut and shining brightly. The other was an antique pitted black skeleton key with a painted railroad crossing sign on its bow. It felt heavy and seemed ancient. I had never seen the skeleton key before but I knew what door it opened. A long piece of red string had been secured to the keyring as well. It had dangled from my mailbox to the porch - swaying slightly in the light fall breeze. It was easy to put the pieces together. They had shimmied down the string, and squeezed under my front door. Looking down I saw there were specks of blood on the porch, and a few small bloodied feathers. Following the spots of blood, I saw that inside my door, laid out across the doorstop, lay a third figurine - a broken one. It was a little businessman in a torn blue suit stained nearly black with blood. His face and torso was covered with a stamp stained by postage marks and blood, and his body had been sprinkled with small feathers. His arms, which had been crossed over his chest, cradled a tiny bloodstained nail that nearly spanned the length of his figure. In his arms, it looked like a spear. Three little adventurers had tucked themselves into the matchbox and been sent in the letter, only two made it into my house alive. Exiting my mailbox, they had been attacked by a bird. They fought, one fell, and the two survivors had lain their friend to rest inside the doorway of my home, using my wooden doorstop as a burial slab. They placed his weapon in his arms, sprinkled him with the feathers of his enemy, and covered his face with the stamp he had carried. Then the two survivors carried on with their mission, with the stamps theyd peeled off of the envelope tucked firmly under their arms. Leaving their friend behind, they made the long trek from the entryway of my apartment to the island of my coffee table. They had navigated past my kicked off shoes resting by the front door like sleeping sentinels. They circumvented the hills of the discarded coat that Id tossed on the floor, and hiked past the landmarks and monuments of junk stacked around my small college apartment. Eventually, reaching the coffee table next to the sofa, they had scaled one of its legs. At the base of one of them I had seen two brightly shining nails that they had discarded to make the climb. The tips of nails had been filed down to sharp points and they were both streaked with specks of drying blood. The two of them had laid down their arms, climbed up into the sky, clambered up onto a new world. They walked defenseless across the checkered surface of the coffee table, around the pile of textbooks, a slowly collapsing stack of overdue DVDs, and a few dirty glasses huddled together like a small crystal city. Both of them were small tourist, stepping carefully through an odd land of huge and miscellaneous things. The journeyers had trekked along, while in the sky far above them my apartments ceiling fan whirled at the top of the world, like a strange and distant bladed constellation. Using the vast horizon of my sleeping form as a reference, they walked on, until at last the three of us were face to face. Separated only by the canyon between the coffee tables and the the sofa, their two tiny determined faces looked up at my mountainous dozing visage, and they formed their stamps into funnels, and started trying to wake me up. The three of them had embarked on an odyssey, I now realized. A heroes journey. Only two had reached me. All because they needed my help doing something as simple to me as flipping a switch, starting up a toy, and disposing of a pest. It was a lot to process. I desperately wanted to help them. There was something else in the letter too - a small folded piece of paper that turned out to be a note from my father. Heres what it said: If your reading this, then youve learned that there is magic in the world and it needs to be protected. The house now belongs to you and your sister - to do with as you will. Before you do anything, please visit the mayor of the basement. Talk to him. Hell explain everything. I looked at the margarine container with its two tiny travelers in my left hand, and then I looked at the short - much too short - letter from my father in my twisted right hand. I suddenly had a lot of questions for my dad. Questions Id never get to ask him. I felt my eyes start to sting, my shoulder twinged. Lacking The dexterity in my right side to fold the letter one handed, I crumpled it and clumsily shoved the crumpled piece of paper in my right front pants pocket. It took two tries to get it in. As was so often the case when I thought about my father, I couldnt tell if I was sad or angry. Thats another thing, for better or worse, that Id never be able to talk to him about. Id settle for talking to the dioramas mayor. Driving to my fathers house was surreal. I put the plastic container on top of my coat in the passenger seats footrest. That seemed as safe a place as any for the two little guys. I found myself driving more cautiously then usual. For one thing, I didnt want to get in an accident and have the milkman and the farmer bouncing around in their container. After seeing the businessmans corpse - killed by a bird. I was painfully aware of their vulnerability. Also, I didnt want to get pulled over and have a police officer examine the contents of the container either. Though I assumed the two of them would freeze if that happened. I felt confident the milkman would have the presence of mind to do that. I wasnt so sure about the farmer. I should have said something about that to them. I would If I got pulled over. The third reason I was driving slow was because I still wasnt convinced I wasnt dreaming all of this, or imagining some of the more fantastical elements Id seen. A good rule of thumb, one Id made up on the spot, was if youre driving, and you think you might be hallucinating - drive carefully. Maybe I had been seeing things. Just little things - two little things to be precise, each about an inch high. Maybe I had gotten the letter from my father with the keys, note, and a matchbox filled with two or three normal plastic figurines, and I imagined the rest. That scenario actually made a lot of sense and was seeming more and more likely as I drove down one familiar midwestern street after another. I had probably been half asleep when I checked the mail. Getting the keys, the figurines, finding out the house was mine and my sisters now - probably just rattled me a little - or a lot. By the time I arrived at my dads house, I was sure that was the case, but I had to check. I nervously peeled the lid off of the container and was greeted by the sight of the milkman and the farmer rising unsteadily to stand at attention on the soft bedding of toilet paper - both of them staring up at me expectantly, their tiny eyes wide and mouths forming tight determined smiles. I smiled back a little shakily, feeling a little unsteady myself. Here we are guys. I said quietly, while nervously looking around me to see if any of my fathers neighbors were around to see me talking into a margarine container. Thankfully, we were alone. The house key opened the back door, and I walked into my childhood kitchen; the kitchen of my dead father. I felt nostalgia descend on me like a weight. It was a physical force all around me, up my nose, in my head, in my heart. The kitchen smelled like him - cigarettes, Brute aftershave, and very faintly - the sharp smell of the unidentified liquor he drank. I hadnt been here for seven years and I really hadnt missed it. It was almost exactly the way I remembered it, but just a little smaller, a little more bare, and a little more run down. I felt a bubble of sadness threatening to rise up in me. The feeling felt a little bit like vertigo, a little like desperation, and a lot like fear. I forced it down and tried not to think about it. Across the kitchen I could see the door to his basement. It seemed warped by the weight of memories. According to my sister it was the door hed burst through with the cat hed killed and the son hed broken. It was the closed door he hid behind for years - the door that kept him from us. I felt a sudden sharp ache in my right side - a twinge that ran from my shoulder to my fingertips. I gripped the keyring as tight as I could with my weaker and smaller hand. Then holding the container securely in my left hand, like a small chariot with its tiny gladiators peering over the rim, I advanced through my fathers kitchen with the skeleton key extended before me like a sword. Walking towards the basement door and whatever waited behind it."
71,vulnerability,HFY,Rogue Fleet Equinox - Chapter 5,39,9hl3mm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/9hl3mm/rogue_fleet_equinox_chapter_5/,2018-09-21 11:48:39,"First | Previous The person who was Mace Bloodclaw barely put on a costume every day at work. The name was ostentatious, sure. The actions, hardly less so: People cried, people screamed, people begged. They handed over the possessions of their freighters, or they made protection payments, or they were *conseqeuenced* (sometimes, in a heavily Arrowhead area, for only slight missteps, just to make the point). But through it all, Mace Bloodclaw was proud to be a hard worker. Mace Bloodclaw was a bit more of a reader than he looked, and knew all about the state-formation hypothesis whereby regularized extortion turned into taxes--Arrowhead had been unwilling to clearly decide if it was doing one or the other since time immemorial--but Mace would have been the first to say that political and philosophical justifications for his occupation didnt matter. Mace, whoever he was like in private, enjoyed being a brute. There was a rhythm to it. Take planet J-2289-H1, a garden world which was considering joining Bow. It was at the edge of a tachyon current network connecting fifty systems without habitable worlds, but had planets and asteroids that were good tachyon and tangible raw material collection points. These fifty systems were part of Maces core territory, where one of his shipyards and many of his factories were hidden. J-2289-H1 could not be allowed to join Bow. To call up Cornellius II and ask him to veto the application would be too quaint. The people of J-2289-H1 were not one of the four hopfaring powers indigenous to the region. They did have rockets, and some ultra-efficient vacuum airship technology that took them to the edge of their atmosphere more easily than Earth at the dawn of spaceflight might have managed. Such curios put them in the upper quartile of technology levels among the thousands of human-inhabited planets in Region J, and being on the cusp of spaceflight made them annoying to Mace. The 2289ers did not have to be convinced by Bow of the benefits of joining the Magisterium--they knew the value of being connected to other worlds--and their factories and industries were advanced enough that Bow, moving in, would not need to embark on the level of investment needed to bring many other barbarian worlds in Region J up to snuff. In short, signing the Bow Charter would turn J-2289-H1 from one of the few barbarian worlds worth raiding for something other than slaves, into the seventy-fourth expansion planet signatory, and a major economic engine that would not only threaten to bring Bow to a level where Arrowhead, finally, could no longer keep up, but would also serve as a launching pad for Bow attacks into the heart of Maces territory. Cornelius II would never break alliance, Mace was sure of it. But Cornelius would not be the last holder of the scepter. Mace knew history. Knew that it was the fate of raiders to be increasingly marginalized as the economic potential of great urban areas reached efficiencies of scale against which the raiders could not hope to compete. Today, it was Arrowhead that made Bow, Tide, and the Sanctum Pact worried in the stars. Tomorrow Arrowhead bases might become as insecure as Tide or Sanctum colonies, thanks to the might of the Bow Navy. Mace would do his part to put off that turning point for at least another generation. He landed in a 2289er city decimated by kinetic rods. The capital of the largest independent nation. Or maybe the financial center. He could double-check. He didnt care to. The point was, when he strode, proud in invisible force armor, right to the center of the citys most famous park, pointed his finger at a building that was either the presidents palace, or the headquarters of the worlds largest bank, and had a landing tank blast a percussive round that shattered all the windows, he was somewhere where the eyes of the planet were on him. He could have had a kinetic rod dropped from orbit on the palace, or the bank. That wouldnt do any good. He needed someone alive to extort, after all. And so, followed by the four-limbed tanks, which occasionally fired a tach microengine to ease over a piece of rubble, he strode up the steps to the palace/bank. Walked inside. It was strange to know that, overhead, his subordinates were fully capable of plummeting a kinetic rod without his orders and ending Mace, but for various reasons, Mace didnt care. His only interest was in making the proceedings look good. Yoo-hoo! Mace Bloodclaw called. First person to show your face doesnt die! He stretched his force armor to create claws, and scraped them across the carpet. The style on this part of J-2289-H1 was to have a checkerboard of patches. Thin carpet, thick. Thin carpet, thick. Mace tore all the same. Came to a security desk. Shredded it. Underneath was a soldier and someone with a bowtie that figured her as a legislator, or a banker. The legislator/banker decided to make the most of her loss of cover. Stammered something about being willing to negotiate. Mace decided intentionality was required to meet his criteria, and painted his claws. It wouldnt do good to keep them invisible. His foot soldiers had given him honor of first entry, but they were disembarking from the tanks, and stepping up. Mace didnt want any of the members of his team to get sliced by accident. One of the tanks rammed through the turnstile door Mace had been polite enough to enter the correct way. It raised its turret at the low ceiling. Fired, at Maces order. Roof came down, pattering harmlessly over Maces force armor, and the force armor of his colleagues. Battle-ready, Mace was sturdy enough that he could have shrugged off being hit by a percussive shell. An upper story of retrograde pagoda wasnt going to leave a dent. Mace should know. Mace had tested. Mace would never have embarked on his campaign of conquest, which was going to climax in the capture of Installation Ulysses, if he had not been convinced this physical form was robust enough to take a few accidental hits. Down from above fell more city notables. Some were buried, but still alive. Others werent even buried. Mace repeated his offer. A man in a purple-on-orange bowtie sat up. I surrender He seemed to recognize Mace. ...Bloodclaw. Good, said Mace, muting the sharpness on his force claws and reaching across the room to dust off the mans jacket. I expect you will be able to to tear up the Bow Charter. I...Im just a Thank you for your cooperation, said Mace, waiting just long enough for one of J-2289-H1s ubiquitous vacuum balloon drones to pad into the room on little propulsive fans. It was emblazoned with the four-spotted logo of the National News Bureau. Whatever Mace said would be broadcast indigenously throughout 2289-H1. If you are unable to tear up the Bow Charter within one local day, said Mace, this city will not survive. I imagine many of you believed that our raids would slow down, after the signing of the Charter. I imagine many of you were heartened by the fact that much of our attention has turned towards the galactic south, and the domains of the Sanctum Pact. I am here to tell you that we of Arrowhead, of Bloodclaw Arrowhead, in particular, will come and go as we please. Acknowledgement of your agreement will come with the delivery of one million kilograms of gold to the park just outside this building. If this cannot be done, the capital of this nation is gone. This is the bank city, hissed one Maces underlings. In addition to the metropolis in which I currently stand, said Mace. Of course. The survivor propped against rubble in front of Mace didnt balk at how to transfer a million kilograms of gold from all over the world into the park under such a tight deadline. Not only because of fear. The planet had been extorted before. The road system was impeccable in part because of Arrowheads motivations. Mace waved to the NNB drone camera, and walked outside, heading for his personal, one-seater tank, which had extensive automation, verging on AI. Mace liked to have his current body sleep for long periods of time, and what better cocoon than one that could pack itself back into the landing transport, wait through hops, then unload and walk itself to Maces home fortress on a nearby airless world? Mace strapped in. Pulled down the hood. Set the autopilot. Bags of gold were being dumped on the lawn even before Maces landing tank had walked back to the transport. He saw no reason to wait for the aftereffects of his announcement to play out. He had bodies to be. It was hard, for three years running, to be simultaneously the scourge of Region J, and the most promising new talent in all of human space, but you know what they said. Vigor of youth, and all that. It was nice that the Earth campus of the Argon Preparatory School of Design had finally opened, and given the person who was currently the Bloodclaw of Arrowhead a good home base. Not that Mace, in any form, intended to stay at the school for very long. It was preparatory. Mace had places to be. Conquering Installation Ulysses was the agreed-upon final project that would allow Mace to progress to the big leagues, a project Mace had started long before entering the school, not that the Progenitors cared. To Mace, the school was mostly a nice mechanism whereby the Progenitors would formally notice the work he was already showcasing for them. The person who was usually someone other than Mace had been in the know about Progenitor projects like the Union infiltration and the Ikalic Doah for some time. Hed thought they were much too slow. Mace pulled back his consciousness across Progenitor bridge technology, to a portion of Argon Schools VR. Hed done everything he needed to in Region J--the Talons of the Bloodclaw would be able to run themselves for at least a day--and there was just enough time left in Mr. Togas afternoon lab to scrape some *recreation* time. The portion of VR Mace had landed in--still Mace, the controlling mind liked the form--was partitioned from the VR other Argon students sometimes visited. Really, it was just hosted by school servers, and contained Maces favorite lines of code. Hed negotiated for this little demnese when hed agreed to join the school, claiming, not entirely incorrectly, that it would be a good buffer for his frequent bridges to Region J. With luck, Maces cohort would be done with the case study within the month, as Mace, who was playing a game a little different from all the rest, would by then have resolved Ulysses and graduated from the school entirely. Mace wasnt much of a programmer--at least not a superhuman one--but Mace did have some of the traits favored by the Progenitors, which was how he had gotten on the radar of one in the first place. Mace was ruthless, made interesting choices, and liked to win. And as a reward, Mace got to create universes, just like Progenitors. The code for his little project had been written by Union engineers years ago--no bugging Progenitors for the keys to the castle necessary--but no hardware Mace had access to had been able to run the program on anything akin to max settings. Until now. Now, the space where Mace dalied between the school and Region J was Maces very own. In every sense. He could simulate galactic formations. Planetary tectonics. Evolution. Life. With a level of fidelity that made Maces domains virtually indistinguishable from the universe he had been born in. Up to and *including* consciousness. AI was a tricky subject. In the universe Mace had been born in, Union AI technology had a distinct weakness against EMPs, which was why cyborgs were relatively much more popular. Various Seekers, probably the apex of what the Progenitors had been able to achieve limiting themselves to human technology as a base, needed wet components so they didnt experience major system shorts in response to a single human marine wielding a pulse patch. Union AP drones were even worse--the race of hardening versus EMP technology had run decidedly against drones, making them useful only on small scales where relatively expensive/rare EMP technology--it was standard for a one-use pulse patch to be assigned per squad--was less likely to come into play and mess up drone systems for *hours*. (Region J AI, if anything there qualified, was even less to write home about.) But that was as far as military applications went. In the domains of the former Union, civilian applications, including, technically, the universe simulator Mace had stolen, were under no particular threat of being shut down, and could develop with relative impunity so long as no one had a reason to engage in corporate espionage. That went a thousandfold with AI under protection of Progenitor hardening. Maces project was shielded by the Argon Preparatory School of Design firewall. It was, for all practical purposes, invulnerable. Not only could Mace create little universes, he could do so without concern that the universe they were nested inside would intrude. Mace had gotten relatively little work done with his universe simulator in the two weeks (externally) hed had it plugged in. Hed created various test big bangs, and a few hundred relatively spartan planets. He *had* taken the time to cultivate one planet in particular. Upon which he had placed a few nations. Filled with AIs that didnt know they were AIs. Filled with AIs that worshiped him. Mace had played around with time dilation settings until his mental age was several hundred years old, and would have happily gone a little further, but there were some hardcoded limits that Mace, not being a talented programmer even with relative centuries to study, had not been able to surmount. And Mace wasnt terribly interested in breaking them. He didnt want to spend too long at Argon Preparatory School of Design before graduating to the big leagues, and in the two weeks of Earth time, hed already spent far, far more than the four years supposedly required to graduate. His first accomplishment as Mace, getting Cornelius II to become his adopted son (at a time when Maces mental age had been considerably younger than Cornelius), was long behind Mace now. Mace walked into one of the temples that had been built for him, filled with bodies of every kind. As the most beautiful of *his* world swooned and rushed to him, eager to please, begging for eternal life, Mace leaned back and considered the competition. In the minor leagues, there were three basic types of native players. First were the recruiters. Powerful minions of the Progenitors who oversaw the functioning of galaxies or universes. These were the bridge between the minor and the major leagues. They were slumming it. They didnt really count. Second were potent hopefuls who knew what the game was. These were people like Mace, and, to a lesser degree, Maces companions at the school. Finally there were the players stumbling blindly. The ones who *could* be potent, but hadnt convinced a Progenitor to tell them what the score actually was, or at least not enough to matter. These generally consisted of those Progenitor minions who overshadowed their peers by talent, but by default were still minor on a cosmic scale. People like the Seeker sent to defeat the *Gyrfalcon*. People like Tek, who surpassed Seeker. Mace felt a certain kinship for Tek. Mace, who had a far better relationship with the Progenitors than Tek did, had learned all about the man who had become the only stumbling block before Maces accession to the Real Game. Teks biggest flaw, perhaps, was that he had never really be told no in his life. Sure, people like Deret or Seeker had *tried*, but they werent really in Teks league, now were they? Deret, laughably so. Seeker, proven thusly in a stunning upset. As a consequence, Tek was mucking around Installation Ulysses, playing dress up with images of darkness and Shadows. Enjoying the fawning of the millions who cared about him. Believing that he was an angst-ridden but noble totem, striving for the safety of his people. Paradoxically both trying to do to much to fast (which played into certain troubles he was having with his brain), and off on entirely the wrong track to impress a Progenitor enough to learn the about Game. Tek would see the loss of even a single *Titan*, and its attendant civilians, as a major defeat, even though, had Mace been in Teks place, Mace might have arranged for such a thing to *happen*, just to bind the masses further to him. Tek was a *child*. Playing, and *scared to hurt his dolls.* Making the mistake of believing that the people around him mattered. Mace had been a young prodigy once, and not so different. Mace had found a way around constraints. The secret had been to stop caring about anyone but himself, and the Progenitors. Tek had his millions. On just one simulated world where the person of Mace was divine, Mace had *billions*. And he could erase them with the snap of a finger. Tek had done so much to embrace the unconditional love of *one*, and the unconditional was barely unconditional. Was fragile. Tek strived to hard to do the greatest good for the greatest number, and if he failed, or even *tried too hard*, he might just lose Jane Lee, and fall into a tailspin. Mace had no such vulnerability. He stood. Looked about the room with so many admirers pining for eternal life. The flatterers of a hundred nations, rather similar to Teks ally Nith. All for Mace, all better, because he had *made them so*. The steps were blue, and plants grew about the room. The people groveled. Are you displeased? asked someone, who might have been the most beautiful woman in the world. No, said Mace. I love you all. There was a general murmur of content. They shared him, yes, and each individually might only receive a few minutes of his time, but in return, he granted them their good looks, and their health, and wealth enough for each to live a life of luxury, with servants. But, said Mace, watching all those eyes hang on every word. He checked a link hed simulated with him into the virtual world. He hadnt bothered to time dilate much. He only had minutes left before Mr. Togas lab ended. Hed get special access to VR, and therehence to Region J, in the human universes morning, but he was feeling peckish, and wanted an excuse to build a brand new entertainment on the next way home. Wanted to lock himself in. Not be lazy in leisure time. But what? I think it is time to get rid of all of you. You will send us away? asked the woman. We will do anything. We will wait. We will grovel. We will-- You misunderstand, said Mace. I will kill your universe. These people knew he was that potent. The horror on their faces was Well, honestly, it didnt affect Mace much. It might have, the first time hed destroyed this world (he kept bringing back slight copies--lazy--but he was entitled). Now Mace had done this too many times to care. He wasnt sure if he ever had. He wasnt a nihilist, or someone who delighted in suffering. He was a gourmet who had gorged. Pleasure. Pain. Fire. Blood. Water. Hed made himself the epitome of everything he could imagine, and every time, every subjective day back at the school, every cycle, he felt a little less. He could only hope that ascending to the Real Game would offer more delights. He was getting bored of what he could do with infinite nested universes, of playing at being a Progenitor. He wanted to finally get in the Real Game. It wasnt like anyone in the universes he made *mattered*. They had been born by his whim. Theyd been living on borrowed time. Mace knew they were grateful, no matter what their faces showed. Mace knew he had more than fulfilled any petty obligation being their maker gave him merely by the act itself. Please, begged someone. Mace didnt care. Mace didnt begin to care. I will do anything, said someone else. Such a small statement, almost funny. I can do anything, said Mace. At least here. I snap my fingers, and the lights go out. Try to stop me. Do whatever you think will work. They swarmed him, some violent, most not, trying to gently keep his fingers open with kiss and caress. He teased them, coming close to a snap, and then pulling away, feeling their bated tension, and almost, almost getting release. He did this a few more times, until most no longer believed Mace would do it. Mace pressed his fingers together, through a lip. Not even a real snap. Universe gone. He floated in the nothing, his own shape being generated from an entirely different sector of the program than that which had created all the rest. Prepared to go home. Paused. Decided to use his ability to peek through the interstitium to see what Teks brother Sten was doing for Mr. Togas lab, as one of the masses of normals without a special project. Once Mace had heard Sten was in attendance at the Argon Preparatory School of Design, it wasnt that hard to figure out that the brat who half-looked like Tek, and thought it was a good idea to read the textbook while Mr. Toga was talking, was the culprit. Especially with an alias like S. Especially since, as Mace used his special VR leverage to see vaguely through the tendrils that connected Stens consciousness from one place to another across light-years, he could see Sten wearing a body that was not his own, much as Mace wore Mace. Sten was trying to, less than subtly, find a way of getting access to the dinner that Pirate Tek, Station Chief Theseus Monkey, and their advisors were sharing in a boardroom of Installation Ulysses. Sten was trying to be discrete. Hed made himself a cook. Was trying to serve food. If he wanted to not confirm Maces suspicions about who he was, Sten should have made like two of his peers, and tried to add poison. Tek might well survive the little games the students were playing with him, to narrow-mindedly try to complete their lab and earn Mr. Togas approval. But if he did, whether or not Sten was able to successfully make contact with his older brother, Mace made a contingent resolution. To waylay Sten on his mandated return back to school. Sten, because of his connection to Tek, was the only student at Argon School that Mace had any particular interest in, since Mace, through his special plan, was too advanced to be in the league of any peer scholar. Already almost graduated. Just a few ends to tie up. Mace would get a little more use out of his universe simulation program this day, after all.

72,vulnerability,HFY,[OC] A Lurking Predator,102,9k2bcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/9k2bcy/oc_a_lurking_predator/,2018-09-30 11:26:15,"Captain, I have a signature, roughly 10 klicks at 45 degrees, no idea what it is yet, give me a little more time to get a better fix, Warner called out. Good, keep monitoring and keep me apprised Captain Teach replied. The Rough Rider had been on patrol for the last 6 months, the war had not been going well up until this point and only a few minor victories had been achieved. The Rider, as she was known to her crew, was the first of a new generation of ships, one that may just alter the course of the war, and the first wave of a bold plan to disrupt the enemies shipping and naval production. For the moment she was tracking an enemy vessel and Teach knew his sensor man Warner was one of the best in the fleet, it was only a matter of time. The feeling aboard the bridge was tense but not uncomfortable, the silence was absolute but everyone knew their roles and everyone was excited to finally be out of simulators and into the action for real. Fleet recon had said this was a major path through which the enemy routed their shipping believing it to be out of reach for UHA warships due to it being so far behind the lines and it was time make it a bit less safe. 6 months of careful maneuvering and planning was going to begin paying off. Sir, Warner reported, Looks like shes a Zanik destroyer, almost exactly where I thought she was, and by the amount of heat shes giving off Id say she just slowed back to subluminal in the last few seconds. Now that Ive had a chance to focus the sensors on her, shes glowing like a candle. Excellent, turning to his weapons officer he said: give me a targeting solution Weps, but hold your fire. Railguns or torpedoes? Rosen, the weapons officer replied. Let's go with torpedoes for the moment. Aye, sir. Mr. Kazinsky, how are we doing for heat buildup? the captain asked turning to his first mate. We have another 6 days of full stealth before we will need to start dumping the heat sinks if we dont do anything else, otherwise it depends on how much we fire, Kazinsky replied. Thank you, Kaz, replied the captain. Captain, we have a firing solution on the destroyer, Rosen called. Maintain the lock as best you can, Teach replied With that, the bridge returned to silence for another few minutes as the Rider waited for more targets. She was a vessel the likes of which the galaxy had never seen, she used a complex system of heat pumps and heat sinks to manage her heat output to seem no brighter than that of cosmic background radiation. Her hull was designed to reflect no light to avoid detection from LIDAR, a feat she accomplished admirably. Her sublight engines used several methods of heat management to mask their signature and she had some of the most advanced navigation and sensor systems ever designed to detect and avoid enemy vessels and listening posts. Her navigation systems were also designed to mitigate the need for constant course checks, limiting her vulnerability and detectability when traveling long distances and for sneaking into typically inaccessible places such as the one she now occupied. Captain, I am getting three new heat signatures in the area around the destroyer, they seem to be merchantmen, they are the only thing out there that gives off that much heat, they are almost washing out the whole screen Warner announced suddenly. Well then, said Teach, I suppose its time we let the Zaniks have it, Weps, give me torpedo locks on the shipping vessels. The computer confirms locks confirmed on all four targets Rosen replied a moment later. Kaz, if we put two in each target, how long will we have before we need to vent, the Captain asked next. Id say wed still have another 3 days sir Kazinsky replied. Well lets see if these launchers are as cool as the eggheads claim they are, Weps, two torpedoes per target. Set em to go hot at 500 meters from the hull. As soon as the words left the captains mouth, the orders were followed. Each of the four double launchers along the side of the hull of the Rough Rider opened simultaneously. Instead of the fusion tipped torpedoes going live immediately after launch, however, a heavily insulated manipulator arm in each tube gave the torpedoes a push. The moment each was 500 meters from the hull of the vessel the fusion engines on each weapon ignited with the heat and brilliance of a sun, there was no hiding these from sensors. What little heat that reached the Rough Rider was removed from the hull, preventing the ship from ever being noticed on Zanik sensors. Captain, the destroyer just lit up its LIDAR, they know they have weapons incoming and they want to find from what. Looks like their coms just went live too. Warner called out at the exact moment the torpedoes engines fired. They cant shoot what they cant see Teach replied calmly. The torpedoes accelerated at a rapid pace, each gaining an incredible amount of velocity in within seconds, it didnt take long for them to find their targets. All four targe vessels had point defense systems but the systems on the cargo vessels were outdated, slow to warm up, and slow to respond. They only got a few ineffectual shots off a piece before being consumed in a ball of nuclear fire fueled by the warheads and by the fuel for their reactors. Many crewmembers last thoughts were how their escort missed an enemy vessel in the area. The destroyer faired only marginally better, its PD system was already on when the torpedoes had been fired, but the incoming weapons were far to fast for their cannons to track effectively when fired from so close. As it was a warship, the hull was left mostly intact but the design of the warheads meant that it was almost entirely gutted. The crew of the destroyer went to their graves wondering how a vessel they could not see had launched short ranged weapons from a point they could not identify, light years behind enemy lines. Excellent work everyone Teach said as the heat from the explosions dissipated off the scopes, Send a courier probe back to high command informing them of our first kills, include the sensor recordings please. Aye sir Kazinsky replied and passed along the relevant information to the relevant sailors. &amp;#x200B; This was the first engagement between a United Human Alliance stealth vessel and Zanik collective vessel, but it was far from the last. These submarines, as the crewmen of Rough Rider class vessels took to referring to them proved to be invaluable in the war against the Zaniks. Able to slip behind enemy lines with ease and lay in wait undetectable for days, and as technology progressed weeks, and ambush Zanik cargo and military vessels with near impunity, they managed to deal a crushing blow to the Zanik fleet, industry, and morale. The peace treaty of Pentoric V was signed within a year of the Rough Riders first engagement, it was typically human with promises of aid in rebuilding any civilian centers and ensuring they were stable for the nonmilitary personnel who lived in them. After the basic principle of the vessels operation became public thanks to a loose-lipped politician, numerous other species began to develop their own submarine style vessels, but they always seemed one step behind the humans. AN: After seeing a few different interpretations of a form of submarines in space, this is my interpretation. I thought about why submarines are so difficult to detect and decided to transfer that into space, instead of limiting the radiating noise to prevent being heard, these vessels would be focused on limiting radiation of heat and light as these are what would likely be used in detecting vessels in space. This is simply my interpretation of how an engagement could happen at the advent of the creation of this type of ship. Please feel free to poke holes in my ideas."
73,vulnerability,HFY,Rebels Can't Go Home - Chapter 36,42,98hr59,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/98hr59/rebels_cant_go_home_chapter_36/,2018-08-19 14:28:53,"First | Previous After ripping open the uniform packages and giving a rushed tutorial on how Tek and Nith could put them on, Jane Lee shepherded both into a lift, pressed a button that glowed briefly in the shape of her thumb, and then ducked back into the hall just as the doors started to close. Controlled access, she said. One way only. Dont try to stay in the elevator after it opens on Portside Deck H, because youll get stuck. As the lift descended--Tek felt from motion that Deck G was above H--Nith made a move like she wanted to straighten his collar, then hesitated. I think you fold this part down. Makes it easier to see the markings on your chest. Go ahead. Youre a lieutenant and Im an ensign, First Hunter, said Nith. I memorized the shoulder symbols. I think that means Im senior to Jane, just like you. Its make-believe, said Tek. If you want to start giving orders to outsiders like the marines, I promise to watch what happens. If that is what the First Hunter instructs, that is what I will do, said Nith. She straightened the sleeves on her own blue uniform, hiding the copper bracelet she wore underneath. Tek thought about what he actually wanted. If he understood the way the outsiders reckoned time, he had less than half a day before hed be called on to visit the ground, and hopefully save more of Baam from the forces of the Allied Cities. What had he learned that could help direct him while he was down there? For one, Ketta would have tach harvesters as cargo on the way down, which implied shed also be sending a number of engineers and technicians, and maybe marines. She might not even be using the pod, but rather one or more of her shuttles. The presence of the shuttles in the hangar, which Tek would have thought could have taken the pods place as a platform from which to spacewalk and reset the engines, suggested that the lever he had moved while in the tethersuit had done even more to heal the *Gyrfalcon* than Ketta had let on. Maybe certain gates in the hallways of the ship had been stuck in a down position, and resetting the engines had reset them too. Shaking his head, Tek tried to approach the mind of Ketta more usefully. It was a given she didnt want to share any information about the health or future of the ship which might unnecessarily make Baam doubt her power. That was why Tek had pumped Jane Lee for information. The most important detail he had learned was that Ketta intended to fight incoming Progenitor-allied ships in as close to a head-to-head confrontation as she could manage, taking full advantage of Baam warriors by using them to invade enemy vessels. She intended to give them a poor version of marine armor, see how they functioned, and probably wait until almost the last moment to fully explain the challenge. Aside from Kettas secretiveness, and the fact that Tek wasnt sure if Ketta had fully considered plans that used the *Gyrfalcon*s stealth capability to wait the task force out and avoid a confrontation all together, Kettas approach seemed solid. Teks conclusion was that it was his role on the ground, and elsewhere, to help optimize Kettas plan, and come up with a backup. Thinking about optimization led to something he *wished* he could do during a return visit to the planet. If neighboring clans had ever responded to Teks request for aid, and were present near the cave mouth, Tek would have liked to try recruiting them to the sky too. Hundreds of Baam fighters could likely use the help of thousands of additional clanspeople. The *Gyrfalcon* had room. The problem was that, according to Uk, the man who was not Teks father, the Seeing Order--the Progenitors spies on Teks home planet--had paid off the neighboring clans to steer clear of Baams confrontation with the Allied Cities. If Tek could talk to First Hunters of the neighboring clans, especially while being able to demonstrate Union technology, there was a chance he could get them to join his and Kettas mission. But if they were too far away, hed never be able to have a conversation. Wait. They were not too far away! The *Gyrfalcon* was currently far above Teks planets surface, but Tek and the first of Baam had been able to go from the cave mouth to test taking in the *Gyrfalcon*s hangar in a matter of hours. Kettas shuttles could land *anywhere*. If Tek could divert one on a mission to awe the most powerful clans of the grasslands He shook his head. He couldnt very well come to Ketta with a suggestion about how to get extra fighters for a plan he wasnt supposed to know about. That was a good way to convince Ketta that Tek couldnt be tamed. Mostly true, but it wasnt helpful for Ketta to believe it. And speaking of clanspeople knowing things they werent supposed to Tek grabbed Niths wrist just as the lift doors opened. Jane Lee might have been too disoriented to realize youd heard our conversation. I wasnt. Why did you give me a chance to free my ears? You must have realized the pieces could come loose. She wiggled her jaw. I needed Jane Lee to talk to me more than I needed you not to hear, he said. I believe you want to protect Rim, which means going along with my plans for now. The lift doors started to close, and they barely slipped out in time. I hope I can further improve your opinion of me, First Hunter, said Nith. I intend to devote myself to making that happen. If there is anything you need from me, including my life, I will give it freely, though I hope you would not ask something like that for reasons trivial. You made a similar offer when you first started to meet with me in my jungle tent. It was true then too, said Nith. After a fashion. I am not spear-warrior like you or your future bride. But from even before I came of age, I was willing to risk everything for the people I care about. That is why I trust you will try to defend Rim, which the Progenitors will attempt to devour like everything else. Nith tapped her hand to her shoulder, a gesture that seemed odd in the uniform of the Union Navy. This is not a empty gesture, she said. Forgive my insolence, but I will make you see that. She waved at her brother down the hall. How do I look in the dress of a barbarian? she asked, giving a little twirl. Tek mentioned to Nith that if Baam started talking about fighting hybrids loud enough for outsiders to hear, hed know where the leak came from, and went on a circuit of Portside Deck H, attending to his duties as First Hunter and war leader. The five great tents of the traditional Baam fireside encampment were unavailable in Portside H, as was the fire itself, or even the layout--the grid intersections of the space Ketta had set aside for Baam being incompatible with a pentagonal shape. But the clansfolk, by consensus, had done the best they could, dividing the area into six sections, four in a square for most of the traditional clan-pairs, while the clan-pair of Rim and Rim-ta, as well as a space in common--the equivalent of the fire--had been placed closest to the gate guarded by the marines. This was not an honor for the Rim subclans--in the case of a confrontation with an outsiders, the expectation was that the Rim subclans would be forced to defend their area first. It did not escape Teks notice that clan consensus forcing the Rim subclans to the most exposed position, because they were the least trusted, and needed to prove themselves, was the same sort of logic Ketta had used to decide the use of Baam. The fact that Ketta controlled cameras and lifts throughout the clans space, and that there was a real chance Ketta could vent atmosphere even here, didnt matter. Tek knew that many clansfolk were well aware of at least some of the technological protections Ketta had put in place to keep them contained, but, as far as Rim went, ceremonial vulnerability counted. Teks survey of Baams domain culminated in his discovery of Sten sitting on a table in the neutral cafeteria space, reading something projected by link hologram, watched over by a stone-faced Gorth. It wasnt a surprise for Tek to see his brother--hed been told and hed seen that many whod gone to the outsiders Medical had started trickling back, injuries miraculously healed--but seeing Sten use the link for no purpose other than to learn, as Tek last remembered his little brother doing in an outsider jeep, absolutely broke his heart. The skin around Stens lips was pink, fuzzy, and new, and whatever he was looking at, he was enraptured. Tek made his brother squirm by wrapping him in a huge hug. There were so many plans yet to implement, from his half-baked one about recruiting new clans to Ketta by acting like a messenger from the sky, to Kettas own, to a solution to the question of where he and Sten might sleep, which had to be decided in a way that didnt offend any subclan who wanted to offer space. But for the moment, the only thing that mattered was seeing Sten was happy. He was actually continuing to read from the link under Teks grip, and Tek could tell that all the time his brother had spent working with instructions on how to make the H325 capable of flight had allowed Sten to pick back up the sort of education he wanted from a position that was stronger than ever. No self-teach reading app anymore. Now some maze of words that looked complicated enough to be too much trouble even for some outsiders. Its called a novel, said Sten. Its like storytelling, but the storyteller left it for us and went to do something else. Theres a prince, and princess, and a dragon, which I think is like a *cor-vo*. Youd like it. His face fell briefly and then perked back up. You should learn to read! Im sure I will, said Tek. But until I do, I can trust that youll read everything important and tell me, right? Stens face fell again. Theres a lot of books on science in the links library. I should be reading those. Im sorry Im letting you down, Brother. Do what you can, said Tek, touching the dagger Sten wore, then the new part of his brothers lips. Im sorry I havent be able to protect you better. Its okay, said Sten. I have Doril now. He gave a shy glance at the self-appointed Gorth bodyguard. Doril stiffly clamped hand to shoulder the second Tek looked at him. The part of Teks heart that had started to warm now fled, and Tek wondered if even his most loyal warriors saw him as a force to only be obeyed. If Jane Lee was more right than she knew, about everything, and Tek was just a petty despot maintaining a war-crisis indefinitely, until the near-absolute power of war leader became so entwined with the role of First Hunter that the clan would start to forget what their traditions were like before. It wasnt the first time Tek had worried. Time to make a speech. He called all of Baam-in-space to the cafeteria, noting that, by the time on a wall readout Sten had read for him, it was just after 0000 hours ships clock, and Tek had less than six more before Kettas people would take him down to the planet. Tek stood on the food autoprocessor that loomed like a huge black rock on one wall of the cafeteria. The autoprocessor was flanked by stacks of preprocessed packets that were few enough in number Tek thought he should temper Baams excitement about seemingly endless food by implementing rationing, in case Ketta started to play games with Baam meal allowance. He looked over the empty recessed counters he thought were called buffet tables, at a crowd of well over a hundred Baam. The Baam ranged from a child who wasnt yet old enough to walk, to a man who, if becoming a subclan elder was strictly based on seniority, would have probably taken Quons title five years ago. Tek saw Baam who had the fresh faces of those who had been to the outsiders Medical, either as patients with injuries from the clans infighting, or as those who had come back from the physician's exams and inoculations he knew were starting to be performed. He saw that half the Baam who had been given uniforms were still wearing them, including Nith, and that many of the rest were starting to experiment with the richly textured clothes theyd found in drawers of certain storerooms. The least-dressed of Baam wore nothing but a loincloth, a costume that had been Teks choice for years in the jungle, while the most-dressed wore something fluffy with a hood that suffocated Tek just to look at it. Tek himself wore the slightly-baggy pants of the Navy uniform, which Jane Lee had demonstrated were comfortable enough to fight in, and kept the shirt on too, but open, with thin chainmail underneath, a testament to his desire to be able to make himself presentable in moments for Ketta, while maintaining a statement that there was something unique about Baam, at least for a while longer. He hated the boots, but part of the reason he was happy to keep them was out of curiosity for how well theyd integrate with the fighting style of *satchi*. All of you now know the real enemy, said Tek. Our hosts described them. The Progenitors who shaped our world and then ran from it. Who turn human against human. But we have burned our honored dead, with no reprisals. And, in defiance, the ship upon which we stand may collectively contain the greatest set of heroes who ever swam the stars. Counting us. Counting the last vestige of the Union Navy. In great migration, a war leader named Oakley Ketta brought her host to skies above but far above our grassland, and she, in her way, by her means, offers an alliance that may well last the total of our lives. But it is not so bad. Within a day, we should have proof she means the core of her word, and more of Baam will come, lifted from jungle on vessels like the one we worked so hard to defend and build. This ship, the URS *Gyrfalcon*, is big enough for all of us, and more besides, and I am told there are many worlds hiding in the starscape that every one of us knows well from night. So many not a soul among us may grow bored. In order to earn those delights, to see lakes of methane and towers a mile tall, we must be ready to fight the Progenitors and their minions, today, tomorrow, next week, next year, but every day we will learn and grow stronger. Some among us wear the uniforms of the Union, or their clothes, while many of us choose to keep the garb of the grasslands as best we can in these cold halls. It does not matter. Baam is the collection of our spirits. From Clan Union, we will learn how to direct the flight of great skybeasts like the one that holds us now, just as surely as we will learn how to wield weapons that belch fire. And in return, we will teach the Union every day what it means to stand in the unknown, and make it our own. Tek led a call and repeat of the clan name, which had become standardized enough that he returned to the plotting interrupted by his lift arrival on Baams deck. There were two preparations he needed to make to have an effective return visit to the ground. First, find some way to include an outsider crew on the 0600 mission that was willing to fly a shuttle on his multi-clan recruitment mission, and also willing to avoid telling Ketta until Tek could find the best possible moment to share. Second was a brand-new idea. It involved adding a second task to that same crews mission. Second-- Second was *dangerous*. It cut against the lessons Jane Lee had been trying to teach him. It implied an overwhelming degree of specialness to the vigil Grandfather had been coerced into performing for the Seeing Order, while he raised Tek and Sten in the jungle. It tied to answering the question of why an escape pod had gotten stuck in a mountainside. Of what was important about the mountain, beyond the fact it was close to an excellent location to harvest invisible tach. Second also tied to Teks almost fanatical desire to have a way of solving the problem of the incoming Progenitor-allied task force that was completely independent of Kettas solution. The idea of tying Baam to a heavily-damaged ship without so much as attempting to find another way to ply the stars struck Tek as unconscionable, and second contained the potential to remove that constraint with a swift stroke. Yet, second was serendipitous enough with his first idea, the one that would complement Kettas approach, that all he needed for both was the loyalty, or at least the silent acquiescence, of a spare shuttle crew. It occured to Tek that hed been over-complicating. There was no need to try to subvert an entire team of outsiders within the next six hours, if what he needed was a shuttle and a crew. He could obey Ketta completely on the 0600 mission. If he found a secret-mission pilot who would follow his orders, the pilot and crew could launch Tek whenever he wanted, provided Tek found a way to get Ketta to ignore the launch, or think the launch was part of her programme. Obviously there was great premium on getting the task done as soon as possible, because the closer the day came to when the Progenitor task force was supposed to arrive, the less time Teks team would have to do the work he needed, and the less likely Tek or anyone who helped him could pretend the shuttle was just on another flight sent to pick up more of Baam. But Tek had more flexibility than hed originally thought. A good thing. Tek called Sten to one of the cafeteria tables. Sten, who, as it turned out, had skills that could be made core to both the recruitment and the mountain components of Teks plans. Yes, Brother? There must be art supplies, Sten. Find them. Find cloth, and paint a mural that contains the symbols of as many different clans and subclans as Grandfather taught us. Make it beautiful. Make it large enough to be seen from the sky. Tek paused, and thought even grander. If you have time, make a second, and add to the clan symbols the sigils of the cities. The *reeef* head of Olas, for example. I want something that will be striking from a mile away, something that will inspire people from our world to come together in unity. Impossible, I know. But thats what being an artist is about. Or so I heard from a windscraper when I was about your age. Father? asked Sten. He was just a merchant too good at selling things. Nothing more. Stens lip quivered, and Tek rememed how upset Sten got when hed thought Tek had disowned Grandfather. Tek hadnt realized Sten would care about Uk, too. He was a bad man, said Tek. You hear me? He didnt deserve us, and he knew it, and thats why he left. But we might have gotten something better, Sten. Theres a second thing I want you to do. When you get too tired to paint, or youre waiting for paint to dry, I want you to find every book you can on whatever exists in the Union archives about our planet. Specifically, any ideas the Union has about how the first humans might have come to K-3423-H1. Our ancestors might have been stolen a long time ago from Earth, but I want to know *how*. *How* the Progenitors might have spread the first people across our planet. What tricks they used. If you cant find anything specific about our planet, see if you can find stories about similar planets. Why? asked Sten. Because I think we are special, said Tek. I think Grandfather was special. Theres something I want to try to do, something that might be hard to do, that I can confirm the possibility of, or make easier, with your help. Yes, First Hunter. Sten put cupped hand to shoulder, and Teks heart broke all over again.

Kettas crew chose more and more of Baam for tasks, the most common being fitting for various armor pieces that were uglier and more bulky than that worn by cityfolk knights. Kettas excuse (she still wasnt admitting her plan for Baam as vanguard invaders of Progenitor ships) was that Baam needed to be ready for combat at some undefined later date, in some undefined environment. Maybe she was worried Baam would panic, or maybe, like Tek, she was experimenting with leaking information to those in the clan considered most trustworthy, so that when the final reveal came, more than half the audience might be frightened, but would also be nodding along. For his part, Tek gave more speeches, tried as best he could to conduct realistic fighting drills in the rooms and corridors of Portside Deck H (made more difficult by the fact Ketta only let a few sample armors and practice laser taggers into Baams section of the ship, and no real guns), and devoted every remaining waking moment to self-improvement. Sten, Doril, and Devin were already back on the planet, the reports he was getting from them were mostly about *cathan* and said nothing about their actual progress, and if Tek stopped pushing himself as hard as he could, he might be forced to think about what hed asked of his brother. What hed asked of Baam. The overwhelming nature of the enemies hed claimed. Tek taught himself to read, or at least sound out words badly. He harassed various marines, and Jane Lee, into sharing more surrounding the pill shed taken, which was called a stim. He took advantage of his position as Kettas staff officer, which gave him somewhat more freedom than other Baam, to connect his link to the *Gyrfalcon*s main database, and got into the habit of running audio on seminal works of Union naval tactics while he was exercising. Then he found out more about the Union Naval Academy, and started running through problem sets that real officers would have learned to solve as part of their training. When he inevitably got most of the questions wrong, he reviewed each and every solution explanation, forcing himself to memorize everything he didnt understand, which made him as bad as Sten. One of the things the Naval Academy materials stressed, that Tek had already understood, was the importance of cultivating competent subordinates, so he began to drive warriors like Atil of Tahl, Vren of Goth, and Hett of Yatt crazy by forcing them to adopt a slightly less rigorous version of the routine he put himself through. Clan Baam only had access to a handful of links, but Tek did his best to make sure that every one of them was being used to teach someone something at all hours of the day, going so far as to organize schedules for night classes where dozens of Baam sat around a link listening to audio, and then broke up into groups to discuss what they had learned. Inevitably the leaders in these sections were the Baam who were spending other parts of the day on shifts learning about the *Gyrfalcon*s technical equipment from real Union experts, and most seemed somewhat miffed that Tek had barely given them enough time for sleep, but he budgeted that in too. In the jungle, or the grassland, it was hard to know exactly what time it was--the suns helped one tell the approximate hour, but not the approximate minute. On the *Gyrfalcon*, where there were digital ships time clocks in lots of places, which Tek could now read, it was possible to itemize tasks by the minute, and Tek was somewhat embarrassed to realize that he took advantage of that option as thoroughly as he could. His understanding of the way the Union reckoned time was helped by the fact that the way he understood years, days, and hours was approximately the same as the way the Union knew them, possibly because the Progenitors had gone out of their way to make Teks homeworld into a planet that matched the rotation and orbital periods of Earth. What else was Tek learning? More about tach, which seemed crucial to comprehending how the Union viewed the universe. As Tek understood, all of space that Union surveyors had explored was multilayered, like rock strata under soil. The soil, in this metaphor, represented anything that was intelligible by thinking spatially in three dimensions. The rock stood for the idea that underneath the universe of three spatial dimensions (where underneath meant adjacent by some relationship that humans were not capable of natively perceiving), were additional directions. To visualize four spatial dimensions, Tek imagined an endless line of planets disappearing into the aether, with each point on a given planets surface immediately connected to the ghost planets on either of its sides, so someone with the right capability would be able to run along the planets while keeping their longitude and latitude constant across all. The bottom line was that, in the same way the shortest surface distance between two points on a crumpled leaf was not the same as the shortest distance between two points where one was allowed to hop, being able to tap into the spatial dimensions above the third allowed for travel and communication faster than the speed of light, which would otherwise not be possible. This was where tach came in. Tach were particles that naturally crossed spatial dimensions above the third, and, if harvested correctly, could drag along adjacent 3D objects and deposit them from point to point in the 3D universe much faster than light, and relatively unscathed. Tach, or tachyons, flowed naturally through the explored universe like seeds in the wind, subject to origins and currents that involved dimensions and math so complicated Tek didnt feel bad for not understanding. Most of the currents through which tach liked to travel were virtually meaningless from a 3D, or realspace, perspective, but because the number of currents were virtually endless, many led between points of interest to the Union. Or former Union. Tek supposed Kettas ship was all that was left. In any event, because large objects like planetary masses had a tendency to exist near (or to create) foci of tachyon currents, a Union spacecraft capable of what was called faster than light travel (FTL) was actually just capable of hitching a ride on currents, while protecting its hull integrity, and theirin its passengers. The Union had developed by expanding along a network of realspace nodes connected by extradimensional hop shortcuts. The distance between connected hop points was usually fairly predictable in a galactic sense, so much that the term hop number, or standardized hop number could be equated to distance in terms of light-years. But the ratio was an approximate, not an absolute. In fact, one of the details that had likely appealed to Ketta about Teks binary star system, K-3423, was that its hop termini were all extremely far away in 3D universe terms from their paired points in other parts of space. This made K-3423 a place where com spire-style tachyon communication with other systems was fairly difficult, and perhaps was part of the reason Commander Devins ground team had not been entirely prepared for what was found in Olas. The most important military implication of the existence of hop termini and tachyons was that the tactical landscape of any star system, certainly including K-3423, had surprisingly little to do with the location of 3D bodies in orbit around a sun or suns. Far more critical were the locations of these hop termini themselves, because these were the points where enemy ships might emerge at any moment, with little warning if allies in adjacent systems werent able to send messages ahead. To cover for this vulnerability, the by-the-book tactic, which Ketta had implemented, was to deposit drones at all locations of known hop points, which had sensors that were optimized to provide the tiniest bit of early alert before incoming starships in-came. These were relatively easy to place because hop points tended to be near planetary masses well within the termination shock of the system (perhaps because the role the adjacency of a star played into these points location and wobble). Minutes of advance warning was far from perfect, but in a tactical space where a warship getting caught off guard might mean it became the target of dozens or hundreds of well-fitted missile locks, any kind of sentry was important. Other points of interest in a star system included harvest sites and null zones. Harvest sites, again for reasons of extradimensional math, were usually pressed to the surfaces of rocky worlds. These were the most efficient places to collect tachyons, and bind them to Union machinery, because the flow nearer hop points would damage harvester machinery. (Imagine the nightmare for space travel if the harvest sites were in space and the hop points were pressed against planetary surfaces!) What were null zones? Tachyons were generally invisible and harmless without being deliberately harnessed, but they had a wide variety of efficiency-related applications that went even beyond Union communications and engines. Starships that took full advantage of tachyons, including using them as a power source outside of FTL applications (a practice so common it was built into the hardware of the H325 the first of Baam had ridden to the stars, as well as the hardware of the *Gyrfalcon*) opened themselves to certain vulnerabilities that fleet elements of a civilization that hadnt discovered tachyons would never have. Just as, in most every visited star system, there were hop points and harvest sites that were particularly useful for a community that knew about tachyons, so too were there null zones, locations of severely reduced tachyon flow, which, if entered by a ship that was using tachyons for power, would cause the ship to all but die in space, and worse than that, become stuck in place relative to the local star or stars, counteracting existing velocity and inertia. Null zones allowed for some tachyonic activity--in practice, it was mostly the stuck ships engines that were severely affected, and not even enough to completely stall those. But no one, least of all a warship captain, wanted to spend hours or days slowly wobbling through a point in space that could be easily detected by the same sensory filters that located harvest sites and hop points. In practice, null zones were like cliff faces or other obstacles strewn throughout a battlefield. Clever captains tried to use null zones to shield their flanks while in combat, as missile engines that had tachyonic elements but were incapable of FTL hops were just as susceptible to null zones as warships that had tachyon engines that could both hop and ride through realspace. Tek decided to make a point of remembering that. He didnt have a single spaceship under his command yet--it was hard to count the shuttle that Sten, Devin, and Doril were using for mostly-unknown purposes down on the planet--but if they actually managed to recover an ancient working starliner, using a tactic involving null zones might be Teks only way of making such a huge defenseless ship useful against the Progenitors. Were *all* the tactical points of interest in a star system really just related to tachyons? No. There were various types of rocky and gaseous bodies that could provide real world raw materials, as well as cover behind or within which a starship could hide. Tek thought comets were particularly interesting. Habitable moons or planets, which housed innocent life and could take Union technology centuries to make, were worth defending. But the lesson that people could live or die based on details they couldnt see stuck with him. Early on the fifth day of Teks time aboard the ship, Ketta called a general meeting of those on the *Gyrfalcon*, especially Baam. Baam was marched, in groups of fifty, flanked by marines, into the largest lift Tek had yet seen. This deposited them at the back of what Jane Lee, who served as a greeter, called the Deck D Auditorium. Tek thought the auditorium was more of a well. It contained curved row after curved row of tables and chairs, but for each row forward one wanted to go, one had to descend a single step on stairs. The room was shaped like a quarter section of a fruit, and it was enormous--all of Baam didnt even take up half the seats. Also sprinkled in the seats were a couple hundred Union crew, but Tek thought this was mostly for appearance's sake. Someone had to be running the ship, if all of the Baam who were being trained for technical roles had been pulled off their shifts to attend the meeting. Marines lined the aisles at the far ends of the room, which were ramps, standing in armor and at attention. At the center of the auditorium, at the bottom of the well, there was a lone podium, the kind Tek knew all too well from some of the videos that went along with the Naval Academy lessons hed been devouring. In fact, the auditorium looked like it had a designer in common with the architect of the Naval Academy. Since Earth had fallen, Tek, sitting in the back row, could realistically make the claim that he was attending the only course currently offered by the Naval Academy--a special one-part lecture series offered by none other than Lieutenant Commander Oakley Ketta. She emerged from behind a vermillion curtain, the same color as the bars on her shoulders that told her rate. Stepped to the podium. There was an audible whirr, and suddenly the curtain bent into a facelike texture as if it was possessed, an effect upon which was immediately layered the most lifelike hologram Tek had ever seen. Above Kettas head and shoulders were also Kettas head and shoulders, except that head was twenty feet tall. The apparition gently faded the closer one looked to the real Ketta, and the area above Giant Kettas hair was bathed in an unearthly glow Tek traced back to a trio of ceiling projectors, but understanding part of the sorcery only made Tek enjoy the effect more. They didnt do this in recorded Naval Academy lectures. Ketta cleared her throat, the noise sounding like a drum overture. She unfolded her hands from behind her back, and spread them forward in a gesture that would have looked pleading if one didnt notice the light-years-deep intensity on her face. I am speaking to all personnel and allies aboard the URS *Gyrfalcon*, she said, her voice surprisingly mild in volume, but overwhelmingly clear, like it was coming from hidden speakers planted in all directions. Those of you who can only listen in by link, I applaud your diligence, your service, and above all, your compassion for the ideals that make the Navy of the Union of Interplanetary Governments great. In the days since the URS *Gyrfalcon* has accepted Clan Baam, I have met with many fine men and women, young and old, who may have been born light-years from Earth or the Prime Colonies, on a curated world, but just like the hearty settlers of Diamond Sector, or of Crystal--may their memory live forever--they all have something that those of us who grew up on worlds with too many comforts lack. An innate respect for the frontier. When I was a child on Novarillion, a single hop from Earth, I was able to play in jungle gyms--Clan Baam lived beside a real jungle. When I was a child on Novarillion, the only time I saw predators like lions and tigers was in zoos--Clan Baam grew up in and among fangers and *cor-vo*. When we who were born in the Union left behind dogs and cats to join the cast of the greatest adventure in the history of our civilization, Clan Baam left behind holy spiders known as *cathan*. Amused by how Ketta had integrated his exaggeration about *cathan* into her speech, Tek compared and contrasted with his own. When Tek spoke, he had a tendency to be more raw. More militant. The kind of speech he gave worked for his personal morale--Tek had never met an impossible challenge he wasnt ready to run into repeatedly--but hearing how Ketta was almost telling the inhabitants of the URS *Gyrfalcon* a lullaby made Tek wonder if she had the better idea. Kettas approach even integrated her time off the podium. Her reference to meeting with many of Baam was true. About one in twenty Baam had received a uniform, and all who did had received one-on-one time with Ketta. For those people of Teks shed selected, shed personally explained the honor and responsibility that came with accepting a provisional commission, or the wear of an enlisted, without being asked to go through standard Navy training. Tek remembered how Atil had almost seemed starstruck when he recounted to Tek what Ketta had told him about the legacy of the uniform, and the personal stories of Union heroes who had also held the various survivalist certifications Ketta had given him. Tek remembered how he hadnt really been taken in by the salute Ketta had showed him. Apparently most of Baam liked that sort of attention, when given by someone who was the equivalent of a war leader and sorceress. He wondered what Kettas conversation with Nith had been like. Nith hadnt made much of it. There are others you have left behind, said Ketta. Parents. Spouses. Children. Petty Officer Brian Alves has a daughter he has not seen in all the months since we escaped Earth, and when I say my heart breaks for him, I know each and every one of you knows what I mean, because all of us, Union-born and Baam, have paid a price to be here. Made the choice that love for those left behind, or those lost, or even for a homeworld that has become a memory, means striving forward with duty, honor, courage, and all the values I know the Union and Baam share. In two days-- She paused. In two days, it is my prediction, as well as the prediction of all the brilliant scientists and engineers who volunteered to come aboard this ship, that a small fleet of Progenitor-submissive ships will come to the system where Baam was born. The calculus is simple. If we can show those hybrids the personal strength of every soul aboard the *Gyrfalcon*, we will crush them, and be victorious. Many of you, Baam and Union-born alike, have wondered why the shipboard factories have been producing heavy armor night and day, instead of the maximum number of missiles. I will explain. That armor is not just our gift for Baam. It is a tool that will carry the heroes of the clan forward in a great leap, as they will fight beside the Union Marines in a hunt with a planets worth of spoils. We will defeat the enemy fleet in detail, using our first-rate junk drones to allow stealth and surprise boarding actions. We will take on one ship of theirs at a time--most of which should be far smaller than the *Gyrfalcon*. We will have the opportunity to capture one or more of the enemy vessels. This means the *Gyrfalcon* is set to become the flagship of our own armada, and more ships means more opportunity for promotion. For responsibility. Some of you listening only have the slightest inkling you will be captains one day, but you will. Others of you will become engineering chiefs, doctors, strategists, and warriors whose exploits will be known throughout the stars. I know Baam will fight beside the Union because not only are our enemies the same--the cityfolk were submissive to the Progenitors--but also because the flame that rested at the heart of every Baam planetside camp now is the reactor core of the URS *Gyrfalcon* itself, and Baam is not composed of people who would let an enemy snuff their fire. I pass the podium to Major Dmitri Vassiliez, current commanding officer of our very own First Battalion. Kettas real body, and her giant, were replaced by those of a man who was older than Commander Devin, but had a similarly fit body type, topped by a shock of white hair. He wore a bodysuit of the type that went under marine heavy armor, and had rank insignia to double as a uniform. Many of you are going to do die, Vassiliez snarled into the microphone. The Lieutenant Colonel of the First, as some well know, never made it onto this ship. But we are going to fight for his memory. Bleed the hybrids. Use their bodies as the collars of our flag posts, and their intestines as halyards. Our Captain, Ketta, has enough spine for a hundred of us, so if the only way to prove we have them is to show her, in the passageways and compartments of the ships the hybrids had the gall to steal from us, thats what were going to do. Ive heard that a lot of you Baam are brilliant fighters, and about those makeshift trainings going on in Portside Deck H. Now that weve finally cleaned out the combat sim rooms, we are going to put Baam through the paces and see if you can keep up with us marines. We are going to make up as much lost time as we can, and train until the captain thinks we need to rest for the real fight, and orders us to stop. Im told theres a slogan you Baam like to shout to get revved up. Marines have a chants too, but I want to hear yours. Lieutenant First Hunter in the back, do you want to do the honors? A spotlight turned on Tek, as did thousands of eyes. He had to applaud how Vassiliez, or maybe Ketta, if she had told him to do it, had turned him into a neat little pawn for compliance. Maybe Ketta had known just how to play him after all. Tek wanted to win the fight too. Maybe Ketta had an inkling how much. Or maybe not. Tek took in it all. He noted Jane Lee sitting beside him--shed squeezed in a chair between him and Hett. She was as close as shed promised to be in the actual fight. Teks gaze next descended into the well where more than a thousand Baam and Union sailors sat, past proud Atil in his uniform, all the way down to Vassiliez at the podium, and Ketta lurking behind. Tek took a breath. The spotlight was where he lived, even if sometimes it was a metaphor. He focused on what it meant to be war leader. Even, a bit, on what it meant to be a Union lieutenant. Tek jumped straight from a slouched sitting position onto the table in front of him, without using his hands. WHO ARE YOU?

75,vulnerability,HFY,Rebels Can't Go Home - Chapter 40,46,99k03x,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/99k03x/rebels_cant_go_home_chapter_40/,2018-08-23 13:36:56,"First | Previous Lieutenant Commander Oakley Ketta, acting captain of the URS *Gyrfalcon*, refused to quiver in anticipation as she held her cruiser over a tertiary hop point. She knew that from the most likely system Progenitor-submissive forces would use as a last stop before K-3423, there were three choices of final hops. It was standard Union Navy doctrine, which Progenitor-submissives copied, to, where multiple approaches were possible, take advantage of the opportunity to instantly have a diverse recon position in the new system, as there were only so many angles an enemy fleet could hide behind a planet. Splitting forces also served to reduce the impact of certain minefield layouts, which Ketta would have loved to have used, but didnt have the resources to place. Coming from multiple approaches, however, was not strictly a dominant option. A corvette split from the main task force for reconnaissance would be open to ambush. Ketta expected that the majority of the enemy would enter through the primary hop point from the previous system (the best-placed node relative to points of interest in K-3423), while a destroyer or corvette would enter through the tertiary, which offered a more complementary sensor viewing angle to the whole of K-3423 than did the secondary. It was this destroyer or corvette Ketta expected to waylay. Between the junk drones she had in reserve, and the junk drones shed recovered from the previous battle, she had enough stealth to be able to tide her for about three standard combat encounters. Encounter number one was going to be spreading enough junk drones to cover the entire area surrounding the hop point in sensory static, then using the ten boarding shuttles she had available to hit the scout ship from every useful angle. A boarding shuttle could carry four squads of fully-outfitted marines--48 fighters--but given that the tribals she was using had been given armor that wasnt quite as bulky, reducing the number of marine squads on each shuttle to one and packing the rest with Baam brought the total number of fighters per shuttle up to 68. If all of her shuttles hit the scout ship (which was not likely, she expected to suffer a loss to the enemys point defense, even with the junk drones providing sensory glow) the enemy corvette or destroyer would have 680 boarders. This was more personnel than either scout type was expected to carry, and in the corvettes case, overwhelmingly so. For the destroyer, detonation charges could be placed in as little as five minutes in the most optimistic scenario, while if the target turned out to be a corvette, Ketta intended to try for a capture. The standard method of that was getting to the bridge/CIC and auxiliary bridge/CIC, holding for the half hour it would take to hack the controls, and then venting all unsecure zones of the ship into space. Hybrids were good at a lot of things, but they needed air just like people. In the corvette case, Ketta might even be able to conscience holding back a boarding shuttle or two, if initial scans of its small hull size didnt provide enough bite locks to get all the shuttles in fast enough. The last thing she needed were shuttles that couldnt lock on milling around getting shot at by lasers. Ketta knew she was playing an extraordinarily dangerous game. She was an all-in kind of personality, and if by some disaster, she lost all or most of her shuttles, even if she took out the scout, the battle for the system was as good as lost. The junk drones shed use upon the reconnaissance ships arrival werent to hide the location of the fighting from the enemy ships in the main body of the task force--theyd know something was wrong the moment their own sensors couldnt pick up the scout. Instead, the junk drones job was most importantly to protect the *Gyrfalcon* from the *scouts* missile and laser locks. The *Gyrfalcon* was in bad enough shape that even a lucky hit from a corvette could kill her. The *Gyrfalcon*s ability to output firepower was still substantial--if the main body of the task force could arrive to help their scout before the *Gyrfalcon* slipped away, the *Gyrfalcon* would probably be able to bring along at least a frigate as a parting trophy into oblivion--but Ketta had much bigger aspirations. She was going to pull off a victory so great it would be the crowning example discussed in the restored Naval Academy for generations. She refused to accept any other option. She was good at what she did. For instance, she knew the scout would either be a corvette or a destroyer, not an intermediately-sized frigate, because doctrine for the role of scout through a secondary or tertiary hop point was to use something big enough to defend itself, or small enough it wouldnt be missed. Once the scout was destroyed or captured, which Ketta was confident could happen before the rest of the task force could arrive to save it, even at standard Progenitor-enhanced speeds, Ketta would have time to recover her junk drones. Junk drones were much less likely to burn out if the battle was relatively stationary, a.k.a. acceleration-wise stable, the likely outcome of a boarding action, so the entire event would not count as her one use in three. Next, Ketta would hide in the cone behind an already-selected comet, the tail of which would help provide a screen between the *Gyrfalcon* and the task force, and use the period where the task force couldnt spot her to deploy junk drones again, which would make the *Gyrfalcon* (plus a potential corvette consort) invisible for a long period provided she was very, very careful with acceleration. Junk drones could burn out in minutes in the wrong combat conditions, their tiny engines being unable to handle the accelerations involved, but the drones Ketta had were probably the best-upgraded in the entire Union. With the right soothing, they could keep the *Gyrfalcon* and a small friend invisible for days, and still be usable soon after recovery (shed still be able to stay invis for three brief combat encounters). The next part of the strategy depended on all the satellites shed recently put near H1, and all the drones shed placed that were still watching the various hop points in the system. During the encounter with the corvette-in-frigate that *could have gone better*, shed initially paid a great deal of attention to hiding her assets in system, even blowing the drone watching the frigates entry point so that it took the frigate a little longer to understand she was there. Now that the rabbit was out of the hat and frollicing, Ketta had no reason to destroy her own assets. Indeed, shed set her drones and satellites to broadcast the data they were collating as loudly and obnoxiously as possible, without encryption and spoofing set to maximal. This would serve two purposes. First, as long as those drones and satellites lasted without getting destroyed, the *Gyrfalcon*s passive sensors would get useful incoming streams of data. Second, when the remainder of the enemy task force, unable to find the *Gyrfalcon*, but knowing it was there, inevitably got frustrated, they would have clear and dangling incentives to split up and destroy the noisemakers, replacing her drones with their own. If the enemy drones were set densely enough, and had high acuity, this could potentially trap Ketta in System K-3423, as shed be unable to approach any hop point fast enough to reach it before their sensors overcame her junkers and signaled the task force to converge, but the whole point of the battle was that Ketta didnt have enough fuel to safely leave K-3423 yet anyway. Instead of looking at the drone replacements as a tool the task force was using to box her in, Ketta could see the replacements as an excellent chance to destroy or capture a second of their isolated ships. Rinse repeat, etcetera, which could only get easier as the task force grew smaller and more frantic, and made more mistakes, and then victory would be Kettas. Her biggest vulnerability was not limitations in her junk drones, which Ketta was confident she knew how to work around, but rather, issues tied to the H1 planet she was starting to hate. The heavily fortified bunker shed had her marines build at the tach harvest point in H1s jungle, sufficient to repel every native on the world if they all simultaneously poked it with spears, would only be able to endure a moderate bombardment, even with the dead frigates armor paneling that shed worked into the construction. If the task force decided their absolute first priority was to secure or destroy that site, her deployed platoon would be dead, and all the tach theyd collected would be scattered back across the universe. Which meant the *Gyrfalcon* would no longer be on schedule to leave K-3423 after a successful battle with the task force. The reason Ketta had been willinging to deploy all available harvesters to the collection point was that her backup escape was stealing fuel from a captured vessel, but either way, her margins on leaving after the task force battle were very, very tight. If a Progenitor-submissive squadron the size Ketta expected fell out of contact for more than a day, the Progenitors would deploy a true fleet to K-3423, with battleships, and maybe more dangerous things, and if Ketta wasnt fully fueled before they arrived, shed be dead. She stood straighter in the center of the bridge, which for her was a notable enough tell that Raba Dorsel, her protege and one of the junior officers on Sensors, looked concerned. Ketta couldnt help it. Everyone had limits, and she was not too many more missteps away from reaching hers. The mistake that burned her was the choice shed made upon arrival in K-3423, to bring the *Gyrfalcon* in for an extremely close scan of H1, figuring that any enemy informants on the curated world would be able to spot shuttles almost as easily, and the fantastic survey data shed be able to collect would set Devins team up excellently, so hed be ready on the ground to respond to any and all threats, even with the light footprint hed asked for. But the Devin hadnt been able to deal with an informant alerting the worlds com spire, even if his native contacts had told him about the issue with what should have been enough time. Which meant Ketta, in her nightmares, wondered if all the *Gyrfalcon*s dead, and all the more that would come in the ensuing battle, were due to her choice to conduct the close scan. Maybe the informant *wouldnt* have been able to spot shuttles. Maybe Ketta wasnt as brilliant as she thought she was. There had been multiple points of failure, of course, there always were, and shed made sure, maybe too heavily, that Devin had paid the price, but as acting captain, more than ever now, since shed cut Devin out of the chain of command, all the burdens resolved on her. She thought she could handle it. She thought shed done so many things right. In the nadir after the first battle, even without the stroke of luck that came when the starstruck native chieftain named Tek offered the services of a refurbished H325 escape pod, Ketta had been on track to get the dead systems of the *Gyrfalcon* back online. Shed routed the closest hop surveillance drones, which had fine motor robotic arms, to converge on the *Gyrfalcon*s position, and even with their bad engines, they would have reached her cruiser to hit the reset eventually. Even if theyd died en route, Ketta had found a separate strategy to combat being locked out of all the hangars, and to circumvent the incredibly annoying lethal-in-moments hull radiation leak. Shed been preparing a team to spacewalk to the exterior doors of one of the deoxygenated hangars. When Tek had showed up, her team had been well on the way of figuring out how to cut in from the outside so that the hangar--which, like all the others, had been stuck on an absurd doors-shut vents-open setting--didnt vent the whole ship. The team then would have prepped one of the shuttles in vacuum, and used it for the same type of spacewalk staging role that the H325 had ultimately served for Tek. She didnt give up. That was who she was. Right? Ketta wasnt used to having doubt. She hadnt thought she was capable of it. But, beyond the fight she was about to face, something about the chieftain Tek contributed to her anxiety in a way she couldnt easily describe. He was too enthusiastic. No, that wasnt the right word. Ketta had plenty of enthusiasm. The trouble with Tek was, when Ketta looked in his eyes, shed seen something implacable. Shed tried to shock him with the fullest story she knew of the Progenitors, but hed taken it while barely flinching. And not because he didnt understand. He was the kind of person who, had he grown up on Earth, or a Prime Colony like Novarillion, Ketta could have seen becoming a governor, or an admiral. Ketta was too smart not to recognize someone who had the potential to be her equal. That much, she would have been fine with. Ketta had room in her command staff after the departure of Devin, and she wasnt the sort to hold back someones development because she was afraid of the competition. She needed all the help she could get against the Progenitors. The true problem with Tek: he believed humanity could *win*. Ketta hadnt really realized she hadnt, before shed met him. Even time shed had doubts, she reminded herself of all the accomplishments shed racked up, as a bridge officer on warcraft up to and including battleships, as commanding officer of her very own corvette, and then as acting captain of the *Gyrfalcon*. Throughout her career, shed never allowed one of her ships to lose against Progenitor-submissive ships, even when captains froze up, even when the cost of victory meant human sacrifice on a scale not even Fleet HQ liked to talk about. Shed built a reputation for never freezing, not for one instant, for being as calm during a raging fleet action as most were looking over pieces on a table-holographic tactical exercise. In fact, she was sure Devin had went out of his way to recruit her for the *Gyrfalcon* because he knew her reputation. (Thinking about how hard hed worked to get the *Gyrfalcon* ready for a long voyage under the noses of compromised senior naval leadership, she felt the tiniest whiff of shame.) Ketta was excellent at solving tactical and strategic problems, and following presented incentive structures. She allowed no defeatist talk in her sight, and she was a compelling enough presence and speaker to instill some measure of responsibility in even the most self-centered officer or sailor. But for Ketta, everything was one step at a time. She didnt do logical leaps. Some of her mentors had said she didnt do vision. She didnt think about ultimate victory against the Progenitors at all. It was a question that was too big for her, a question that she was realizing she had deliberately put aside, because an honest assessment of the Progenitors true capabilities suggested that, if Ketta racked up victories at her standard rate forever, which she *couldnt*, shed never make a dent. Even if by some miracle she took back Earth. She didnt fight the Progenitors with everything she had because she thought she could win. She fought because it was baked into her incentive structure, because she was *supposed to*, and she would faithful execute the will of the Union of Interplanetary Governments until the morning she no longer woke up. Her counter to her mentors question about vision had been that it didnt matter if she had vision or not, if shed memorized the work of everyone who had, and her ability to select plans from her warehouse, and execute them, was second to none in the entire Navy. Her plan to use the tribals whod fallen in her lap as front line boarding troops, for example, while putting marines behind them to keep them on task, was straight from her book understanding of the Red Armys anti-retreat troops during the First and Second World Wars, which kept wavering Soviets from fleeing in the face of enemies like Hitler. Shed expected morale in Baam to be abysmal, because what else could be expected after Tek had put down a mutiny among his people with loss of life. But the way Tek *saw* victory meant the morale of Baam put that of Kettas own crew to shame. Shed adjusted, and tried to get Baam to see the marines they were supposed to fight in front of more as partners. Shed also tried to subvert some of Teks warriors, including a particularly tough customer known as Atil, by giving them navy uniforms instead of keeping them at arms length. Originally, shed only planned to integrate passive Baam intellectual-types among her crew. Because of all this, Kettas plans were still on schedule, and it was hard to be upset, exactly, that Baam had performed far above expectations during the sim exercises. That performance had been due in large part, to Tek. She knew it, the Baam hed forced to practice in his own drills knew it, and so did Kettas own people, most especially the marines, including Major Vassiliez, who had a liking for Tek shed tried her best to subvert, but still found unnerving. It was all because Tek was inspiring. Not in his speeches--shed listened to his, she gave better ones, she knew it--but in the fact that he was something close to an unimpeachable soldiers example. Ketta, because of her strengths and weaknesses, spent a lot of time thinking in her offices. Tek, as best Ketta could tell from the surveillance shed set up in Portside Deck H, wasnt summoning people to his for reports and feting, so much as constantly making rounds, constantly coming up with new ways of taking advantage of every scrap of material she had given him to strengthen Baam. When Ketta had talked to Nith, who shed thought played a significant role in getting Tek to forgive his clans internal mutiny, Ketta had thought shed finally found Teks weakness. Maybe he was the crusading sort who took too long to compromise. Too long to change his expectations and goals. Someone who could be confident and intelligent while keeping a long-term view of victory because he was too inflexible to imagine some version of tactics that had worked for him before wouldnt work against the Progenitors. But from what she gathered from Nith, Teks tactical perception was mutability incarnate. He fought with his hands. He fought with spears. He fought with fire. With guns. With the hull of an escape pod. And even with his words. With his ability to risk trust. Ketta didnt know the whole story when it came to Nith, but Ketta knew Nith had been a leader of a faction that had done Tek far greater injury than Devin had done to her, and yet Nith was still walking freely. Not because Tek didnt know what Nith had done. Because Tek had, in a sense, treated Niths machinations against him as an audition, and leapt to turn her and her subclan into allies against bigger enemies the second hed had a chance. That coalition-building It could all fall apart in Teks face, but it certainly didnt suggest he was hidebound or inflexible. The worst Ketta could say about Tek was that he apparently viewed his own brother as a troublemaker, and had sent him out of the way to count spiders on the ground. That, and conversations made clear there were plenty of gaps in his understanding about how a vessel like the *Gyrfalcon* operated. But every time Ketta had talked to Tek, the gaps were noticeably smaller. Tek was naive, he had to be, because if someone like Ketta couldnt fathom how ultimate victory against the Progenitors was possible, how could a chieftain who didnt know how to do maintenance on a simple tach relay to a generator? To confirm her assumption, Ketta had spoken to the Progenitors informant prisoner Devins ground team had taken a long time ago, whod known nothing. Shed talked to a cityfolk ex-prisoner of Baams, who had integrated with the clan. Hed gone completely native, and was both intimidated by and inspired by Tek. Shed even left her office to talk to the monstrous hybrid Barder, secured by her scientists in a lab, who appeared to have permanent nervous system damage, but was not quite a corpse. Barder had tried to convince her that Tek was so devious he was surely gunning for her position, and then Barder had taken off ranting about all the years hed suffered getting used to his body on Progenitor-held Earth, which left Ketta with troubling questions about how long the Progenitors had been infiltrating before the Ikalic Doah had gone public. The hybrid was absolutely worthless, though, in terms of helping find Teks weakness. Ketta knew Tek had some interest in recruiting tribals to the *Gyrfalcon* beyond Baam, and had shot him down not because she thought she couldnt handle the crew/clan ratio, but because she couldnt machine enough armor to make the burden worthwhile. He didnt know that. It would have been a good idea otherwise. Tek was It didnt matter. Tek was naive, even if she couldnt put her finger on the exact subdiagnosis. She was glad he was going to be on a boarding shuttle, so shed had another excuse to keep him from the bridge. Ketta didnt like dealing with pieces she didnt fully understand, and she didnt understand Tek. According to Kettas estimates, the Progenitor-submissive task force would be arriving at K-3423 in a window that would close in a few hours. All her pondering on the leader of Baam had done her at least one good turn. It had calmed the nerves she hadnt realized shed had. Tek had given Ketta significant discomfort, but shed converted his unknowns to known unknowns just enough to be ready for the fight to come. *Will the scout coming through the tertiary point be a corvette, or a destroyer?* Ketta wondered to herself. She looked about her bridge crew. Dozens of young, shining faces, sitting at consoles, and standing in front of holograms, and down below too, through the hole in the center of the floor to the lower level of bridge, where lurked one of the centers of Gunnery. These faces, when they returned her gaze, did so with signs of absolute trust. The worries about Progenitors, that Devins loose lips had stoked, that Ketta now realized she had fought off within herself, too, did not exist on her bridge. Her domain. Here *her* aura was implacable, not Teks. She was ready for anything. Drone contact picks up tachyon activity at tertiary hop point! said Raba Dorsel. Primary hop point active too! *Good synchronicity,* Ketta thought to herself, as she activated junk drones around the *Gyrfalcon*. Whoever the enemy commander was, she or he had accounted for the fact that some hop points took slightly longer for transit than others. Survey data for that sort of thing existed in most ships archives, but few bothered to look it up because the time delta created by the effect was usually measured in seconds. Ketta was facing an enemy hybrid or demi-hybrid who was almost as painstakingly careful as she was. No matter. She was ready for anything. First contact out of primary! said Raba. Drone ping reads as...battleship. There was a slight murmur throughout the bridge. Only slight. Second battleship! said Raba. Third. Now five total! All out of the primary! Report on tertiary, said Ketta, even though she could see the sensory data herself. Even though she knew. One battleship has emerged right below us out of the tertiary hop node, said Raba, slowly.  Secondary hop node is active. Four *Titan*\-class battleships already out of the secondary. Five. Ten. Ten each. Primary and secondary. Twenty-one total contacts, all *Titan*\-class. Twenty-five. Thirty-one. Two carrier variants near the primary are launching fighters.* Rule*r-class multiroles an*d Le*ap interceptors. Two hundred new contacts. Three hundred. Three carrier variants near the secondary are launching fighters. Five hundred total contacts. Recommend withdrawal, said Lieutenant Aboye, Head of Navigation and the second most senior officer on the bridge, since Kettas XO was off in the auxiliary. Our junk drones are still hiding us. Six hundred contacts and counting, said Raba. T-thirty-seven *Titan*s. She began to notice the pingback names given to the battleships. The *Freedom* is in the primarys group, Captain. So is the *Justice*. The *Alexandria.* The *Integrity.* The *Independence.* And in the center is an oversized *Titan* *Libertys Call*, said Ketta. *How dare they.* It was the Home Fleet. The Great Wall of Earth. Humanitys guarantee that no matter how many outlying worlds the Progenitors ripped away, the capital planet of the Union would never fall. In the event, taken by the Progenitors without a fight, as the Ikalic Doah and their henchpeople handed over the keys. Out to crush the last cruiser still loyal to the Union. Perverse. Ketta hadnt realized how important she was. Only one battleship had come out of the tertiary hop point, and at the rate that *Titans* were still pouring out of the two others, Ketta was reasonably certain that the *Resilience* (which outmassed the *Gyrfalcon* by a factor of eight, just like any standard *Titan*), was filling the role of lone scout at the tertiary that Ketta had assumed would be taken by a corvette or frigate. Not that lone was the right word for a giant like that. Ketta was now absolutely certain that her ploy when leaving Earth, with chaff, had failed to convince the Progenitors of the *Gyrfalcon*s death. The only question now was how to handle the aftermath. What to do? Kettas bridge and auxiliary crew were loyal. Though shed commissioned various Baam as officers--not all of them were waiting in the hangars as part of the prepped boarding parties--shed invited not a single one of the clansfolk to her primary bridge/CIC. There was only one--Nith--in the auxiliary. The *Gyrfalcon* would do whatever Ketta said. And, with automation being what it was, the expected crew total of even a Progenitor-submissive battleship wasnt so much higher than that of a destroyer or a cruiser as the relative sizes would suggest. Retreating deeper into the system would accomplish nothing. The *Gyrfalcon* didnt have enough fuel to flee to true safety. Was already in position. Contact Major Vassiliez, said Ketta. Get him to update all marine and Baam armor HUDs with battleship layouts. Were going to spend the next few minutes adjusting our points of entry, and rethinking how were going to spread our junk drones. The scout is larger than expected. More meat to chew. This was done.

The two fleets eyed each other warily, circling in opposition around the planet as they sized each other up. Part of her desperately wished to simply make a hard run in, using the HKs to smash her way through and *settle* this, once and for all, but she stayed her hand. Every engagement against the Khonhim fleet had ended badly for the Triumvirate, and she didnt dare squander the chance she now had. So...if she wasnt content to merely hang there in the system, and a full out assault wasnt in the cards just yet, what did that leave? A probing attack, perhaps? Tempting, but given the disposition of the enemy any advance forces sent in would likely be hammered to pieces. That left a passing engagement...assuming the Khonhim didnt strike first. If she ordered her fleet to sweep past the enemy, engaging each other like two ancient galleons firing broadsides it still gave her the ability to break off if necessary. She could evaluate the new ships in action, and more importantly...give the Khonhim a taste of what was to come. --- ***DHYAKSH***, the enemy fleet has changed course! his tactical officer announced suddenly. Jiyazh stared intently at the plot, nodding slowly as the Triumvirate fleet began their run. It seemed they wished to test their mettle, before committing to a full engagement. That suited him completely, for these new ships were an unknown quality, and until he had a better sense of what they could do he too was leery of pressing an attack home. Bring the fleet about, he ordered. We will indulge the enemy. If they wish to touch blades, it would be *dishonorable* to refuse the challenge, he said with a thin smile. --- **HLNE** had wondered how the Khonhim would respond to her challenge, and it seemed they were just as curious about her as she was about *them*. The could have broken off or moved to intercept, but instead they were mirroring her movements as they closed the distance. They were like two ancient knights on horseback, their lances leveled as they charged one another in a jousting tournament. It was almost as formal as a duel...but a *thousand* times bloodier. The HKs swung their turrets starboard, tracking the Khonhim fleet as they closed the distance, while the Comets stood ready to intercept the inbound missiles. It was exactly this type of engagement that was all but impossible to forecast, for each ship class had its pluses and minuses. The Khonhim ships were massive, far more able to soak up damage while spewing out wave after wave of missiles in return...but they were *also* filled with thousands of living breathing beings. A punctured hull meant death to anyone nearby if they were not suited up, but even that was no guarantee. It was as if their enormous size brought with it a vulnerability of its own. The HKs on the other hand held exactly *one* crewman, and since the Ronin did not require atmosphere to breathe a hull breach did not mean an automatic fatality. But they were also much *smaller* craft, and if the enemy maged a good solid hit that penetrated their armor there was a strong chance the ship would be completely destroyed. Even as they neared weapons range, both fleets still had the ability to break off the engagement if they so chose...but neither side showed any intention of doing so. Unless something drastically unexpected took place, they were committed to following through. Minute by agonizing minute they closed the distance, entering extreme weapons range, but Admiral Fujimoto held back. She wanted to make each shot *count*, and the closer they got the better the odds. Unfortunately, the same was *also* true for the enemy. They passed through long range with neither fleet firing, each side boring in steadily as they both held their fire, conserving their ammunition. Entering medium range Hlne was tempted to give the order but *still* she held back, waiting to see if the Khonhim would be the first to blink. It was a game of chicken now, as they raced towards one another...but as their vectors began to converge she could wait no longer. Fire! she ordered...as *both* fleets unleashed hell. --- **JIYAZH** had to admire the humans intrepidness. It was tempting for *any* commander to open fire the instant they had the range, but doing so would merely deplete ones magazine chasing low probability hits. As they screamed towards one another it became a source of fascination for him, wondering just how close the humans planned on getting before bringing their weapons into action. Would they wait until they reached point-blank range? He found it unlikely, for *he* certainly had no intentions of waiting that long, robbing himself of opportunities to inflict real harm on the enemy fleet. There was a perfect moment to fire...he did not know what it *was*, just yet...but he would know when the time was right, of that he was certain. And then, it *did* come. His first missiles were just clearing the fleet, when the enemy returned fire...or perhaps *they* fired first, it was hard to say. Hundreds of guided projectiles arced away, seeking out the enemy ships, bobbing and jinking to avoid destruction as they bored in. Jiyazh watched with satisfaction as the Triumvirate craft began to die...but for every missile that struck home half a dozen others found nothing but space. It was a game of numbers, how many of them could one kill, before they did the same to you? But then it was *their* turn, and with quiet despair Jiyazh watched the enemys deadly antimatter rounds blast through his ships, tearing into their hulls and and exposing whole sections to space. His own flagship *Oathkeeper* shuddered as half a dozen rounds ripped into her flesh, seeking the soft meat within. Whole sections of his display turned bright orange, signifying damaged systems and blasted compartments. Alarms blared loudly on all decks as his engineers raced to repair the damage, while others carried their wounded cohorts away from the shattered sections to safety. *Requite* and *Vindication* disappeared in balls of flame, and a dozen more staggered out of formation with heavy damage. ...including *Oathkeeper*. --- **ADMIRAL** Fujimoto gripped her armrests tightly as the Comets and HKs began to disappear. The weapons were flying too fast and furious for anything other than a computer to keep track, but keep it track it did, updating her constantly as the two fleets tore at each other. The HKs were performing even better than shed hoped...as small as they were in comparison to the Khonhim ships they were hard to lock onto, and as heavily armored as they were they were equally difficult to *kill*. Despite all that, they werent invulnerable. The HKs might die *hard*...but they still died. But even as her own ships perished, the *enemy* was getting hammered hard. It was far too early in the engagement to declare a victory, but as they continued to sweep past the Khonhim fleet Hlne began to feel a sense of cautious optimism. They were holding their own, which considering their *previous* battles was cause for celebration...and as the two fleets broke apart and peeled off in opposite directions she was finally able to let go of the breath she hadnt realized she had been holding. Death and destruction lie in their wake, but the bulk of her fleet was still intact, still able to fight, and as she ordered the flotilla to regroup and assess their losses she was already planning their *next* engagement. This first battle had been a test, as both her and her counterpart gauged each others strengths and weaknesses. Their *next* encounter, however...would be a bloodbath. --- **KLAXONS** screamed on *Oathkeepers* bridge as the ship shuddered yet again. One of the enemys rounds had burrowed its way into Engineering, tearing into the powerplant that was the ships heart. Jiyazh gripped his console tightly as she began to buck and shake, as his harried and frantic engineer gave his report. It is no use, *Dhyaksh*, he informed him, we have suffered too much damage to save the ship. We *must* abandon, before we lose her crew as well. It was the last thing in the universe Jiyazh wished to hear. *Oathkeeper* was not just any ship, nor even from where he led the crusade, but something far more important and powerful. Her very *name* carried their promise to their forebears, and losing her felt as if they were betraying the cause itself. But flesh and metal had their limits, and it appeared that no matter how mighty *Oathkeeper* once had been, she was no more. Very well, he said reluctantly, I will shift my command to *Wrath*, while we... A massive explosion knocked them off their feet, as *Oathkeeper* broke her back. Her hull buckled and *screamed* in agony as her death throes threatened to take the rest of her crew with her to the grave, as Jiyazh clawed his way back to his console. ...*Abandon ship!* he gasped, as the sound of tearing metal filled their ears, All hands, make for the lifepods! --- **REPORTS** were still coming in from the fleet, and Admiral Fujimoto grimaced as she read the Butchers Bill. It wasnt as bad as shed feared, but it had been bad enough, though by the looks of the enemy they had taken the bigger blow. Even as she watched yet another Khonhim vessel bled out, shedding escape pods as it began to disintegrate. And then something *odd* happened. The rest of the enemy ships began to move, altering their formation, forming what appeared to be a protective shell around the dying craft. Hlnes eyes narrowed as she watched them take their positions...but what was the *point?* That ship was *dead*, it was as obvious to her as it had to be to them, so why on *Earth* would they? A sharp gasp of air betrayed her realization. There was only *one* reason she could think of, and if she was *right*... Hlne thought furiously. If they somehow *had* managed to take out the Khonhim flagship, then they had a golden opportunity before them. Command would be confused, disjointed...but it would not last long. If she was going to do this then she dare not hesitate even for an *instant*, but was the risk worth taking? Her jaw hardened as she made her decision. Admiral Fujimoto *stabbed* the com button on her console and snarled into the mic, All ships, come about! Back at them, boys...straight into their *teeth!*"

Normally a nice, quiet jump where I could visit with my crew and binge watch my shows would be exactly what I wanted, but every time I checked in with Janice, she was tight-lipped and even surlier than usual, though Id have thought that was impossible before. I had a feeling that she was having a tough time with the datastick that StyxRatt had left us, but couldnt bring myself to rib the kid over it; Despite her terse, often brusque demeanor, I got the impression that she was very earnest about being a productive member of the crew and this was bothering her more than she wanted me to know. So I held my tongue when she snapped at me, though after the third time I did stare her down until she muttered something that sounded like it might have met an apology once. It didnt help that I was starting to run out of shows to watch and I was getting increasingly nervous with each jump we made with out-of-date navdata. The rest of the crew was starting to get restless as well for what I assume were similar reasons. Our regular sit-down meals were still lively enough, but increasingly often the conversations would turn to new games to play or shows to watch. When youre used to new media being constantly created on hundreds of habited planets and stations as well as centuries of classics, a couple months without updates seems like a bigger problem than it probably is; it was an extremely minor problem in the face of everything wed survived, but it was beginning to wear thin nonetheless. It was a blessing when we finally arrived at Bekters Rim where we could touch base with those friends whod remained and access new entertainment via public terminals; the paycheck for the cargo delivery wasnt amazing, but itd keep the lights on and the galley stocked. Free and clear? Kyle asked, eyes wide. Seriously? Yeah, I confirmed. Its crazy, but Im officially alive and officially the owner of my own ship, the Hostile Witness. Fitting name, he replied with a knowing chuckle. We were sitting down in a bar on the main promenade, having drinks and catching up. Hed reestablished both a working and personal relationship with Kristina, and seemed to be doing well for himself. Shanna would be linking up with him later to talk business, but right now it was just him and I. Yeah, I liked it. I finished my drink and contemplated having another, though it was starting to get a little late. Youve seen Clinton already, yeah? Yeah, he and Omar stopped in as soon as you guys had docked, and we had lunch together. He smiled. Its good to see him happy again. I havent seen his playful side since Kestrel. I was afraid hed lost it. He really does seem happier, doesnt he? I agreed. I am, too. Not the same way Clinton is, but you definitely seem more relaxed than the last time I saw you, he said with a wry grin, then looked up, catching sight of something behind me. Speaking of, heres someone Ive yet to see relax, ever. I turned to look over my shoulder and saw Janice weaving through the tables toward us, her gaze fixed on me. I raised a hand in greeting as she arrived. Hey Janice, I said. You have good news for me? I need money, she replied. I blinked at the abrupt, indelicate statement. Um. Why? How much? I just need a thousand credits, Janice said, glancing around furtively. I have the rest, Im just short a little. I blinked again. A thousand credits wasnt chump change, but we did have it to spare. I glanced at Kyle who was watching our exchange with open interest; Janice hasnt gotten to know anyone before wed stopped at Bekters Rim, so it was likely even more surprising for him than for me. I looked back at Janice, considering. Okay, I said finally, and I watched the tension go out of her shoulders, just the slightest bit. I assume youll tell me what this is about soon? Yes. You wont regret it. Then she stood there impatiently, until I realized she wanted it *now.* I looked back to Kyle, who sat in surprised silence to my quick acquiescence to what looked like a ridiculous demand. Looks like weve got to cut this short, I told him. Looks like, he said with a nod. Ill settle the drinks, you can owe me next time. He stood and turned to go, then stopped. Oh, hey, before I forget, Kris wants to meet with you tomorrow at Volcon HQ, if youre available. She has a proposition for you. Sure, Im flexible, I told him. Send me a message with when and where, and Ill be there. With a parting wave, I left with Janice tensely following behind me. I found the nearest public terminal and initiated a transfer from my personal account to hers for a thousand credits. It reminded me that Id need to set up a business account for the ship, now that I wasnt just an employee or a refugee, but Id take care of that later. As soon as Janice confirmed receipt, she made a quick excuse and left hurriedly. I stood alone in the corridor, realizing I probably hadnt needed to say goodbye to Kyle after all, as I still had much of the evening remaining. With a shrug, I started back to the ship; I still had a few episodes I could watch before I turned in for the night. When I got back to the ship, it was as quiet as I expected; most everyone was taking advantage of the station to get out and relax. I was surprised when, on the way to my cabin, I noticed that the lights were on in the galley. I poked my head in and saw Shanna sitting at the table with a bottle of wine, a glass, several sheets of plas and her datapad. She was so caught up in what she was doing that she didnt even notice me, so I took advantage of her distraction to watch her for a moment. The way she bit her lip when she was thinking over something, and the constant, unconscious toss of her head to flip a lock of hair out of her face made me smile. It took her longer than I would have expected to notice me, but between finishing off the glass of wine and reaching for the bottle to pour another she finally caught sight of me and startled hard enough to knock over the empty glass, which broke the stillness with a musical ping as it fell. Oh goodness! she exclaimed, putting a hand to her chest while trying to fumble for the glass before it rolled off the table. I took a few quick steps and caught it, setting it back up right. How long have you been standing there? Long enough, I replied, grinning. Whats got you so engrossed? Oh, you know, the usual, she said, gesturing to the plas sheets. Kyle sent over some preliminary data, so I could have an idea of what jobs they had available before we met tomorrow. She rose while she spoke, moving toward the kitchen. Do you want a glass of wine? Therere a lot more cargo deliveries than I would have expected; Volcon has quite a bit going on. She hadnt waited for my response, just kept talking as she grabbed a second glass. I decided that a glass wouldnt hurt, so I sat down as she continued to ramble on about the various shipping jobs. Id always made time to keep up on information like this, since Id one day hoped to be flying my own ship, but I didnt have the sheer inexhaustible interest in interstellar mercantile operations that Shanna did. I drank my wine and responded in appropriate places, but mostly she just kept on about shipping hubs, route optimization and overhead costs; apparently research on this topic was how shed spent a lot of her free time over the last few jumps. Oh geez, how long have I been rambling? she said at last. I lifted the second empty bottle and just looked at her with one brow cocked and she blushed. Im sorry Suze, Im sure you dont even care about all of this. Of course I care, I answered. I just never realized how much there was to it. Neither did I, honestly, she said, her eyes lighting up again. I just wanted to educate myself so I could contribute to the crew, but theres just so much to learn! the smile on her face made this statement an exciting one, rather than daunting. I couldnt help but smile, too. You know, youve got a really pretty smile, she said, then blushed again. I mean, I like it when you smile. Uh, thanks, I said, feeling my face heat up as well. I stood up, grabbing the empty wine bottles and moving to dispose of them in the kitchen, far more flustered than I would have expected to be from a simple compliment; it wasnt like shed meant anything by it. I took a few deep calming breaths, then turned around to go back to the table. Shanna was standing right in front of me as I turned around, and I nearly ran into her; I hadnt even heard her move. Her face was inches away and she wasnt blushing anymore. Her eyes were serious, pensive and her hand trembled as she reached up to touch my cheek. What are you doing? my words came out as a whisper, and I could feel a shiver run down my spine as her fingers lit gently on my face. I want this, she said softly. Ive wanted this, you, for a long time. She took a deep, shuddering breath. If you dont want me, just say so and Ill go. Ill never speak of it again. But, Im the Captain, I said weakly. I wanted this too, though Id never consciously let myself consider it before this moment. I didnt pull away and the light touch on my cheek became a caress. No one else has to know, if you dont want them to, she whispered. Its just the two of us. I reached up to cup her cheek in my hand, mirroring her gesture. It was a lovely contrast, the calloused warm umber of my hand against her fair skin. I felt all resistance slip away as I closed my eyes, leaned in and kissed her. =+= Kyle had scheduled the meeting with Kristina for mid-morning, and getting there was simply *awkward.* Shanna didnt say a word about the previous night, but she didnt really have to. Shed been gone by the time I woke up in the morning, and I didnt see her again until I found her waiting for me at the star dock, because of course, as my trade specialist she had to go to this meeting with me. She greeted me with her usual morning cheer, but the small smile playing around the corners of her lips and the unmistakable strut as we walked through the station spoke volumes. I finally managed to regain some of my equilibrium once wed arrived at Kristinas office, and I was able to focus on the customary small talk in the conference room before we got down to business. Kyle had related our adventures at Terra Primus, and she was eager to congratulate me on getting my legal status cleared up. Once the pleasantries were concluded, I mostly sat back and listened while Shanna took over, discussing the various shipping jobs shed been reviewing. Normally during this time, Id be limiting my input so I could focus on watching the potential customer, while Shanna did most of the talking. But while it seemed especially important to do so, since Kristina was certainly not the sort to haggle the details of job offers with individual captains, I kept getting distracted by Shanna. Was she smiling more than usual? Did she always push her hair back like that? Shit, did Kyle notice something was off? He was, like me, sitting back and letting Kristina do most of the talking, and at the moment was looking at me in the most peculiar way. Before I could go any deeper down that rabbit hole, a change in the rhythm of conversation drew my attention. Well, before we go any further, Kristina was saying, Id like to talk to you about why I asked for this meeting. She was looking directly at me, and I sat forward; we were finally getting to the point. Kyle mentioned you had a proposition, I said carefully, suddenly finding myself distracted with memories of another recent proposition entirely. I caught Kyle still looking at me closely, and brought my attention back to Kristina. Fortunately, her attention had turned to the folio that had been sitting on the table since we walked in, from which she drew a single sheet of plas, which she slid toward me. Yes, we do. She paused, waiting for me to take the sheet of plas, so I picked it up and scanned it quickly to get the gist, which was surprising. You want to hire my crew? Not exactly, she said. Its a proposal for an exclusive contract. You wont be actual employees of Volcon Supply, but a contracted freighter. I believe the terms are quite generous. She wasnt wrong. I turned my attention back to the proposal in order to give myself time to think. All fuel and regular maintenance covered by Volcon, meal allowances and a weekly stipend on top of per haul payments; there were other details, but those were the highlights; It was indeed an ample offering, but there was one major problem: I wanted absolutely nothing to do with it, for reasons that had nothing to do with money or trust. But how was I going to refuse without offending a potentially valuable customer? I made a pretense of reading it carefully, stalling for time. It worked; Kristina was obviously eager to get me to say yes, and I could see that Kyle was, too. The terms are negotiable, of course, Kristina said, breaking the silence. My factor in Stroika had nothing but good things to say about you, and my sources in Terra Primus said you were *quite* determined to ensure that your commitments were met there as well. She paused, obviously waiting for a reaction. I smiled slightly, but did not respond right away, glancing at her then looking at the proposal once more. Captain, Kyle said, finally jumping into the conversation. The offer is completely legitimate, I give you my word. You wont owe Volcon anything other to make your deliveries on time, which I know youd do anyway. Finally, I let the sheet fall back to the table with a sigh. The offer is more than generous, I said. Normally, I would jump at an offer like this. Who wouldnt? I would never actually agree to such a contract, but there was no kind way to tell them that. The problem is that the Admirals assistance in getting things in order came with a certain understanding that prevents me from committing to something like this. That wasnt strictly true, but it was true enough that I could get away with it without offending Kristina. Im sorry, I really am, but I owe the Admiral that much. I glanced at Shanna to see if her expression would give it away, but it turned out that she had a pretty solid poker face when she wanted to. If anything, her expression was faintly regretful. Well, Kristina said, dropping back in her seat. Well, fuck. The obscenity seemed out of place coming from her, and she smiled bitterly at my expression of dismay. I guess I can understand your obligation. Can I persuade you, unofficially, to look to us first whenever you *do* need a job? I can assure you, well make it worth your while. Of course! I replied relieved that I wouldnt have to make further excuses. But I recognized an opportunity, so I leaned forward. I have to ask, though. You seem uncharacteristically eager to secure our services. You dont strike me as someone who overplays her hand, so level with me. She smiled and gave me a nod of acknowledgement. Youre right, of course, she replied. Im something of a talent scout for Volcon. Its my job to find determined, resourceful people who will serve Volcons interests. With the war going on, Volcon has an opportunity for rapid expansion of our markets, but our risk is also much greater. Youve proven your mettle more than once since our last meeting and my sources tell me that your ship is now armed. Not many small freighters do that unless theyre also the sort to play fast and loose with their customers cargo. I nodded slowly as she spoke; all of this made sense. I guess Id been so caught up with my own crews troubles that I didnt really see how the black ships would be affecting everything else. Then I smiled, and looked directly into her eyes. So you know that our fees will be a bit higher than your usual small freighter. =+= Shanna was positively humming on the walk back to the ship and I was feeling pretty good about things as well. Kristina had acknowledged my play, but the fact of the matter was shed already been prepared for it. Negotiations for our next cargo had gone on for hours, and she and Shanna had wrangled down to the last credit. When we left the table I wasnt sure who had gotten the better end of it; either way, we were going to be well compensated for what would hopefully be a bread run. So did you want to talk about it? she asked me after several minutes of companionable silence. I felt my stomach drop out, as I knew without a doubt what she was asking about. Not even a little bit, I replied candidly. Just kind of want to let it ride for now. Youre not regretting it, are you? the vulnerability in her voice stopped me dead. Luckily we were still in the private business portion of the station, and traffic wasnt too heavy; we had a moment for a private conversation. I exhaled slowly as I reached out to take her hands in mine. Shanna, last night was incredible, I said. But it was also completely unexpected and it happened so fast. Im not good with relationships; Im not even all that great with friendships. I really have no idea how Im feeling about this, and I just need some time, okay? Okay, she said softly. The smile she gave me was warm and understanding, though her eyes were a little too bright. She released my hands first and I fell in beside her. Despite the awkwardness of the moment I felt lighter having spoken my mind and her step quickly regained its characteristic bounce. All in all, it was shaping up to be a good day. When we reached the ship, I wondered if I was going to regret my own thoughts. A uniformed TU soldier was standing behind the Hostile Witness, his hands folded in front of him as though he intended to wait all day, if necessary. I exchanged a worried glance with Shanna before I started down the stairs to the berth. When he saw me approaching, he quickly came to meet me. Captain Susan Rickard? he glanced from me to Shanna, his obvious uncertainty tempered with discipline. Thats me, I replied, forcing a casual tone I didnt feel. He reached into the courier pouch he wore at his hip and pulled out a datastick, marked with black and orange content notifications. Official communication from Terra Primus, he said, holding the stick close to his chest. For direct delivery to you, only. Well, here I am, I said, reaching out to take the datastick, but he still held it close. Maam, Ill need to see identification first. Oh for fucks- I grumbled, then pulled out my ID chip and proffered it to him. He scanned it with his datapad, reviewed the result, then nodded. Thank you, maam, he said. Now I will need your official signature confirming receipt. I muttered some impolite things under my breath, then scrawled my signature on his datapad and sealed it with my fingerprint. He handed me the datastick without further pleasantries and left me to stare at the stick in my hand. I wondered if Id need to have Janice decrypt it first, then decided that wasnt really the Commandants style; hed likely trust in the system to ensure it came safely to my hand. What is it? Shanna asked, approaching now that the soldier was gone. Not sure yet, but I have a solid idea who its from, I replied. Admiral Clarke has something he wants us to do.

However, Healthy Growths aggressive behaviour raises tensions prompting Holan to send a clandestine message to the Secretaries of the Council asking for them to rein them in. ##The Most Impressive Planet: Desperate Times --- [This article has been translated into Galactic Standard by the Axanda Corporation] [Terms have been edited to preserve intent and promote ease of understanding] [Axanda: Bringing the Galaxy Together] &amp;nbsp; The Subjugator-Class Supermassive Command Ship is the most formidable and rarest vessel in the Councils great navy. Due to the monumental labour and material costs involved in their construction, only six have ever been made. Despite sharing the same classification, each Subjugator is a custom work of art with unique capabilities designed and conceptualized by their original Fleet Master and named by the Secretary of War at the time. Together, the six Subjugators form the core of the greatest armed force in the galaxy. &amp;nbsp; While the Fleet Masters have no particular aversion to deploying the Subjugators in combat, their symbolic presence can prove to be far more useful than their firepower. Numerous conflicts have been ended by the Subjugator arriving in system. Rebellions have been nipped in the bud by a Subjugator merely travelling to an adjacent system. For those whose bravery outweighs their sense, each Subjugator is more than capable of turning an entire continent into slag with its grand array of weapons. &amp;nbsp; Even ignoring a Subjugators incredible destructive capabilities, their most useful feature is their Shear Drive. A unique Ether Core designed for the ships massive size, the Shear Drive creates a large gravity distortion centered around the Subjugator when it performs a FTL jump, shearing space. Ships within the distortion field can be dragged along with the Subjugator, allowing them to travel vast distances at a fraction of the normal fuel cost. This ability to rapidly deploy entire fleets across thousands of light years in a single day makes each Subjugator a logistical powerhouse. &amp;nbsp; The six Subjugators are: * *Blinded Tempest*, assigned to the Office of the Central Estate, permanently in orbit over Mnn Consela * *Terminus of Platitudes*, assigned to the First Fleet * *Historys Architect*, assigned to the Second Fleet * *Prime Mover of Beasts*, assigned to the Third Fleet (Note: temporarily reassigned to Sol) * *Futures Memorial*, assigned to the Fourth Fleet (Note: temporarily reassigned to Sol) * *Bedrock of Civilization*, assigned to the Fifth Fleet &amp;nbsp; [ref: Warfare of the Galaxy by Nerel Quas and Light-Through-A-Prism, published by L.Y.S.

Even the birds seemed loath to chirp as the gathering of Black Room agents stared at their feet. Psychopomp couldnt even look at them, hiding in the shadow of a tree whose species would have gone extinct long ago if not for his efforts. &amp;nbsp; Are you positive this is not just an elaborate plot to draw us out? Marut asked, daring to hope that something, some scrap of the intel was wrong. &amp;nbsp; Everything we can confirm has been confirmed. General Zanle contacted me two hours ago asking for my men to begin sweeping Europa City for potential locations of the virus bomb, Raum said. His infiltration of the Europan Unified Guard was the only reason the rumours picked up by the Black Rooms spy network had been confirmed so quickly. As far as the rest of the world knew, General Hadrian was a loyal soldier. Beyond that, our bug in his office picked up enough details to confirm it as well. &amp;nbsp; This is it, isnt it? Dajjal asked, hanging her head low. With the Filter captured theyll have more than enough resources to hunt us down if we stay in Sol. Well have to leave if we want to survive. &amp;nbsp; Wed be abandoning our home! Leraje protested, the weak signal distorting his words and appearance. Ive spent decades cultivating experiments here; I cant throw that all away! This system is my entire life! &amp;nbsp; A mumbled chorus of agreement echoed through the assembled few. Kushiel recognized some of them from the meeting on the Undergrave just a few days prior. Others were far more remote, and hadnt attended the previous one. Between the two meetings, Kushiel estimated that a third of the Black Room had been accounted for. A mere fifty people. Yet somehow their organization had been able to withstand the massive industrial machine of TSIG for centuries. It would have made him proud if it wasnt for the fact that their lives work was now crumbling around them. &amp;nbsp; Do you think we can somehow stop this? Gabriel asked incredulously. He was the only one who was physically present on the *Hades* besides them, having arrived after leaving Adriels group in a safe house in Sol. All your connections are meaningless when you are against both TSIG *and* the Council. The threat is too great. Maybe together they will even figure out a way to kill us permanently. &amp;nbsp; What say you two? Leraje asked, turning to where Kushiel and Azrael were sitting. As one, the menagerie of immortals turned to look at them. Officially, they had no authority to directly order any member of the Black Room to do anything. Only Psychopomp had that privilege. In practice, being part of the Black Rooms triumvirate of founders ensured that their words were heeded. &amp;nbsp; Kushiel looked at Azrael. He knew she was thinking the same thing, but he wanted to give her the opportunity to speak. Shed deny the offer, of course. She had always been the quieter half. &amp;nbsp; It would be best for you to withdraw from Sol, yes, Kushiel said, seeing her stay silent. Progress would be lost, but we can rebuild. We have done it before. &amp;nbsp; You make it sound as though you wouldnt be joining us Leraje said. &amp;nbsp; Azrael and I dont have many static resources. It will be simple for us to withdraw at a moments notice. They had learned that lesson the hard way in the past. &amp;nbsp; And what of Psychopomp? Dajjal asked. Will he be staying as well? &amp;nbsp; Kushiel looked over his shoulder at where his old friend was sitting beneath the tree. He met Psychopomps milky blue eyes for a brief instant and knew what he was planning. &amp;nbsp; The *Hades* is mobile. Hell stay here for as long as possible to support us and anyone else who has loose ends to tie up before they fall back, Kushiel said, meeting the gaze of Leraje. That is not him endorsing you to stay, thats him suggesting you leave. &amp;nbsp; And then what? asked someone else. Their hologram and voice were so distorted that Kushiel couldnt recognize them, but he guessed it was Baphomet. Maybe Zadkiel. The signal from Venus was always shit, so they were also a strong contender. We flee and hope the Council wont scour its own holding to find us? &amp;nbsp; We rebuild. The galaxy is vast, and there is more than enough opportunity to grow stronger than ever, Kushiel said, sweeping his eyes over the crowd. In Sol we are vulnerable because we are close together. Out there, they could spend decades searching for us and find nothing. &amp;nbsp; And what of our duty? Leraje asked, stepping forward into the centre of the circle. We swore to nurture humanitys growth and protect it from TSIG. *Some of us* may have strayed from that path. He shot a glare at a few members on the assembly who were known for their reckless experimentation or wanton cruelty. However, we cant abandon it. We all know TSIG wouldnt hesitate in killing anyone who disagrees with them. Theres a reason Earth is a radioactive shithole. &amp;nbsp; And we cant accomplish anything more in Sol, Kushiel said, his tone uncompromising. If TSIG has the Councils support, thats it. The Iron Core can match our every move, and they will outspend, outfight, and outnumber us. Get out of Sol, integrate into the wider galaxy, and use your influence out *there* to help humanity in *here*. &amp;nbsp; What does Psychopomp say? Will he deign us worthy of his words, or will he hide under his tree? Leraje asked, glaring at the reclusive man. &amp;nbsp; The other agents tensed as Leraje called Psychopomp out. Everyone trusted Psychopomp -he was the one who gave them immortality after all- but they knew of what Psychopomp had done to Adriel. They had become wary of the ancient doctor, avoiding him as much as they could lest he snap again. No one wanted to be killed and brought back to life hundreds of times. Perhaps it was because he was a hologram that Leraje felt confident to brazenly criticize him. He didnt know that Psychopomp had other ways of killing that didnt require him to lift a finger. &amp;nbsp; Psychopomp stood up, leaning on the tree for support. A car-sized wolf with antlers of a deer and four snake eyes stalked out of the forest to curl up beside the ancient doctor. Few had ever been within the *Hades*, and fewer still knew the true extent of Psychopomps experiments. The vessel was far more than just a conservatory. &amp;nbsp; *Sol is lost,* Psychopomp said, his voice as lifeless as a graveyard. *Everyone must leave.* &amp;nbsp; Then why are you three staying? Leraje asked, suspicion clear in his voice. What good can it possibly do? &amp;nbsp; *This system has been my home for longer than any of you can comprehend,* Psychopomp said, eyes downcast. *There are things I must tend to before I leave it.* &amp;nbsp; Tend to? Leraje asked. &amp;nbsp; Someone must turn off the lights, Azrael said, speaking up at last. &amp;nbsp; This is personal, Leraje accused, ignoring the empty statement. &amp;nbsp; *It always has been,* Psychopomp admitted, stroking the fur of the wolf-chimera. *There is nothing any of you can do to stop the Council or TSIG. But there is still one last opportunity for us Founders.* &amp;nbsp; And I take it you wont deign us worthy of this last opportunity? Leraje said, boldly taking a step closer. If there is even the slightest chance that we can help, we are ready and willing! Every person here has experience and skill beyond any mortal! We may be outnumbered and outgunned, but we can help! For crying out loud, half the board of Jovian Shipyards is in our pocket! Every head of state from Mars to Saturn dances to our tune one way or another! Let us *help* you, like you have helped us so much. &amp;nbsp; *No.* The word struck hard, silencing any possible dissent. It was not a rebuke, but a simple pronouncement. Empty of all feeling. *This is not a matter that can be solved by force.* &amp;nbsp; Leraje looked pained by Psychopomps blunt refusal, hurt clear in his eyes. Very well, he said softly. Sighing, he returned to his original position in the circle. Ill be out of Sol within 24 hours, as you desire. &amp;nbsp; *Thank you,* Psychopomp said, sitting back down at the base of the tree. &amp;nbsp; That goes for the rest of you too, Kushiel said. Grab whatever you can, destroy the rest, and get out. Lay low. Find a place to rebuild. We will contact you when we can. This is not the end. &amp;nbsp; Many members of the assembly winked out of existence, closing the connections. &amp;nbsp; Ill need to stay, Raum said, slumping his shoulders. General Hadrian cant just disappear. &amp;nbsp; We understand. Stay safe and have a solid exit plan, Kushiel said. Raum was one of the older members. Still young compared to them, but among the longest serving. Kushiel knew hed be smart about his position. &amp;nbsp; I always do, Raum said, vanishing, leaving only Gabriel with the founders. &amp;nbsp; Speaking of plans, Gabriel said, heading towards a disguised exit. Hell need my help when the time comes to get out of here. &amp;nbsp; Kushiel nodded after him. He was another long serving member, and he was confident the two of them would be more than capable. As Gabriel vanished into the labyrinthine paths of the *Hades*, a pair of shadows detached from a tree in the forest and resolved into the cloaked forms of Lial. The twin forms of the leader of the Hunt moved silently, barely disturbing the underbrush. &amp;nbsp; Do you remember when we discussed the idea of a coup? one of the Lials asked, as casually as one might ask about the weather. Seizing direct control of the outer Sol colonies and enough Councillors to force a peaceful resolution? &amp;nbsp; *I had not forgotten,* Psychopomp said, not looking up from his seat. *Are you suggesting we finally put that idea in motion?* &amp;nbsp; No. Too messy. I would never have gone through with it, the other Lial said. &amp;nbsp; *But- what?* Psychopomp said, shocked. *You swore-* &amp;nbsp; Are you really surprised I lied? the first Lial said. &amp;nbsp; Kushiel couldnt help but noting the two Lials were still on the same page. While he had only had his first resurrection recently, the fact that the two personalities had not diverged suggested the procedure was sound for the Oualan. Divergence would either happen in the first few days, or through wanton and excessive abuse of the resurrection system. No in-between. &amp;nbsp; There was a moment of silence. Kushiel looked at Azrael with a questioning stare. He hadnt been told of this conversation. She simply gave a quarter shrug. *It was not important,* she seemed to say. He made a mental note to check her memories later, just to remember it. &amp;nbsp; *No, I suppose not,* Psychopomp said, sagging. *I was desperate and wasnt doing due diligence. I trust you are bringing this up because you have a new suggestion?* &amp;nbsp; If you didnt have one Id wonder why we even let you hang around in that bedsheet, Kushiel said with a wry smile. &amp;nbsp; Both Lials gave him an annoyed glare for that one, but Kushiel couldnt help making some harmless jabs. &amp;nbsp; To the Council at large I am nothing more than a vicious weapon, worthy of nothing but a bullet in my skull, Lial said, both the cloaked assassins sitting across from Psychopomp. I dont care for the Council at large and I am not the only one. &amp;nbsp; One of my spies in the *Dividend Harvest* saw an interesting scene, the other Lial picked up. Healthy Growth seems to be causing some tension among the higher ranks. Tension that has provoked Grand Mediator Holan to send a communique to the Secretaries of the Council, asking Ynt to rein the AI in. &amp;nbsp; Are you suggesting Healthy Growth may be our angle? Kushiel asked. &amp;nbsp; Not in the slightest. Healthy Growth may be a glorified mercenary, but he isnt going to sabotage his own work. The Secretaries have no such scruples. Even the wind seemed to stop at that pronouncement. &amp;nbsp; The Secretaries would be willing to undermine the negotiations for us? Azrael asked, shocked. Even Psychopomp looked stunned, and Kushiel didnt blame him. The insinuation that the most powerful people in the Council would be willing to go against their own Generals was a treasonous statement if it came from anyone else. From Lial, it was far more. &amp;nbsp; Not for *us*, for the Council, Lial said, both of them fixing them with empty eyes. You have not met them, so you wouldnt know their character, but I assure you that they are the most fanatically devoted beasts youll ever meet in your immortal life. Every single one of them would smother their own child without hesitation if it would give the Council even the slightest benefit. &amp;nbsp; Give them a good reason to make them think that the Black Room would be preferable to TSIG and they will move the heavens to see to you succeed, the other one said. Considering that TSIG is already responsible for several thousand deaths when their gunship attacked Mnn Consela, the Secretaries would be amicable to a proposition. The fact that the attack is not publically attributed to TSIG doesnt matter. Optics are a non-issue to them. The Secretaries will shall be done. Do you think the Black Room can make a better offer than TSIG? &amp;nbsp; *Yes!* Psychopomp said, quickly. *I would give anything to help humanity, no matter the cost. How can we reach out? Do we need to tell them what we can do for them?* &amp;nbsp; Both Lials smiled a predatory grin. No. They already know exactly what they want from you. And they are waiting to speak with you. --- My *sincerest* congratulations, Healthy Growth said, with a wide smile. His perfectly composed body stood out against the drab, well-worn kitchen of the *Echo.* Im so proud of what we have managed to accomplish in such a short period. In a few weeks time we will forge an enduring peace between humanity and the Council, and it is all thanks to *you*, Alia. &amp;nbsp; It was a far more private setting than the first time she had met him, but Alia still felt like the she was the centre of attention for the entire galaxy the moment Healthy Growth looked at her. If Alex or Magnus felt the same way they certainly didnt show it. &amp;nbsp; I- uh- thank you, she stuttered out, unsure of how to even respond. &amp;nbsp; Dont be modest my dear. Paternal warmth radiated from every word, filling the room. You three were instrumental in revealing the tragic atrocities of the Black Room to the wider galaxy. When you execute Otric as per his wishes, it will be the end of strife and uncertainty in this system. Youll go down in history as a hero. &amp;nbsp; Did Healthy Growth notice her stiffness? Of course he did. He would never miss it. Why else would he frown? The AI knelt in front of Alia, so his eyes were level with her own. &amp;nbsp; Im sorry that you will be unable to be there, he said, avoiding mentioning her disease directly. It is a horrible injustice that someone who only wanted the best for everyone is cruelly stuck down while far worse creatures continue to live. However, I want to emphasize that even despite your situation, you have accomplished more in three decades than most people do in their entire lives. Parents across the galaxy will point to you as a shining example of what is just, and your legacy will live on for centuries. Your family shall want for nothing. Your mother, your sister-in-law, your nephew, and your grandnephew, and so on- forever. Theyll never worry about a roof over their heads, or food on the table. I promise you that. &amp;nbsp; Alia clenched her jaw tighter. He had put it delicately, but she didnt need another reminder of how little time she had left. Even if Adriel did come through with some sort of cure, it didnt change the present. The promises of salvation didnt keep her on her feet when her lungs felt like they were ripping themselves apart and her vision swam. Ignoring it helped, but no one could ignore inevitability forever. &amp;nbsp; Thank you for your time, Alex said, stepping up to her rescue. Im sure a man of your stature has more pressing matters to deal with. &amp;nbsp; You diminish yourself, Colonel, Healthy Growth said, offering a weak chuckle. But before I go, theres one last thing. I brought gifts. &amp;nbsp; The other AI standing in the doorway of the kitchen, this one in a Shinatren body, offered a small bag to Healthy Growth, and he pulled out a trio of small velvet boxes, offering one to each of them. &amp;nbsp; Go ahead, Healthy Growth prompted. &amp;nbsp; Alia cracked open the small box and her breath caught. The Eye of Consela, she said, eyes wide in awe. As she lifted the gleaming medal out of the case, she felt the bottom shift. Pulling the velvet bottom out of the box her eyes widened yet further as she saw the gleaming lightning-bolt emblem of a ConSec Major. &amp;nbsp; Perks of power allowed me to fast-track the process, Healthy Growth said, as though producing one of the Councils highest military honours was as simple as ordering a meal at a restaurant. All of you deserve it for your exemplary actions. The rank is just for you, Alia. &amp;nbsp; Her shaking hands cradled the metal hurricane and the rank insignia, as though they were figments of her imagination. They couldnt have been more than a few grams, but they weighed down her hands like a ball and chain, lashing her to a dream that had yet to manifest. &amp;nbsp; I cant accept this, she said, not looking up. &amp;nbsp; I insist. It is the least I can do to commemorate your service, Healthy Growth said, gently closing Alias fingers around the medals. She could feel the steel of his hand under the silken gloves, yet he moved with surprising gentleness. &amp;nbsp; I mean I dont deserve this, Alia said, barely believing that she had the strength to utter the words. Not yet. I havent accomplished anything. &amp;nbsp; The Hero of Sol is ever humble, Healthy Growth smiled. For a moment, Alia could actually believe it. And then the thoughts returned. &amp;nbsp; *Youll never deserve it. Every death that happens is your fault. Nothing will ever change that.* &amp;nbsp; Youre wrong, Alia said, but she wasnt sure to whom. &amp;nbsp; If Healthy Growth took that as an insult, he didnt show it. Im never wrong about these things, Alia. &amp;nbsp; Thank you for your gifts, Director, Alex said, offering a stiff hand. Alia could just see another Eye of Consela sitting in Alexs own velvet case. We wont keep you any longer. &amp;nbsp; The pleasure was all mine, Colonel Remus. I have worked with several Grave Hounds and Shaped since arriving in Sol, but you are without a doubt the most composed of all of them, Healthy Growth said, clasping Alexs hand. The two couldnt look more different. Healthy Growths eye-catching robe of green and black silk merged elements of human and Oualan fashion, while his olive skin and dark hair made him the spitting image of a member of one of New Tokyos intelligentsia. On the other hand, Alex was simply wearing a bland grey jacket and sweatpants over her mismatched augments. When combined with her pale skin and hair it almost made it look as though she was rendered in greyscale. &amp;nbsp; It was a jarring contrast that only made it clear that Healthy Growth was far too affluent to be in their humble company. Even his assistant looked closer to an art piece than a person, clad in flowing green lace and emerald leaves. That discrepancy didnt seem to bother Healthy Growth as he turned to smile at Magnus, who had been keeping quiet for most of the conversation. &amp;nbsp; Major Bjornson, I enjoyed my time with you as well, brief as it was. Ive been told you have quite the collection of artifacts. One day I will have to invite you to Paradise so we may discuss the finer points of art and history together. &amp;nbsp; Unfortunately my collecting habits have taken a bit of a backseat in recent years, Magnus said, offering a half-bow. Perhaps after all this has settled down I will take you up on your offer. &amp;nbsp; Glad to hear it, Healthy Growth said. If you ever need to reach me, feel free to call. His assistant produced a business card, seemingly from thin air, and offered it to Alex. Now, off to Yansa and Elias. They are much harder to find gifts for, I must admit. Honestly, their greed will be the death of them. Dont tell them I said that though. &amp;nbsp; He gave them a conspiratorial wink and swept out of the *Echo*s kitchen, the trails of jade running down his back glowing neon in the harsh lighting. &amp;nbsp; For just a moment, he paused at the threshold with his assistant and offered a smile. I look forward to the day we can meet again. If anyone can help untangle this mess, they are in this room. The galaxy is lucky to have you three in it. &amp;nbsp; The moment the door shut behind him it seemed like the world had become dull, less lively. But the medals still weighed heavily in Alias hand. They were still there. They were real. All at once the gravitas of the situation hit her like a tidal wave. &amp;nbsp; He gave me the Eye of Consela, Alia breathed out, looking down at the medal in her hand as though she was seeing it again for the first time. Was it her sickness, or was she that awestruck that she felt out of breath? I was given the *Eye of Consela* by *Healthy Growth.* &amp;nbsp; It didnt matter that the world was coming apart at the seams. It didnt matter that she had mere weeks left. The most famous person in existence *believed* in her. The impossible task of saving Sol somehow seemed smaller, even possible, each time she replayed Healthy Growths parting words in her head. &amp;nbsp; He does have a certain presence, Magnus agreed. Who do you think designs his bodies? They did an excellent job. &amp;nbsp; Youre not actually being drawn in by him, are you? Alex said, raising an eyebrow at him. &amp;nbsp; Im calling it like I see it, Magnus shrugged. He is probably the most attractive man Ive ever seen, and I grew up on New Tokyo. &amp;nbsp; I dont see whats so special, Alex said. &amp;nbsp; Thats because youre allergic to anything that doesnt look like a factory feels, Magnus said, with a wry grin. The biggest surprise is that you havent spontaneously combusted after being surrounded by all the gilt in Europa City. &amp;nbsp; I dont hate it that much, Alex said defensively. &amp;nbsp; Thats a lie and we all know it, Alia laughed. The only reason you havent lost Yansas sword is because you dont have a replacement. &amp;nbsp; Even Alex had to laugh at that. Probably because it was true. The laughter faded as quickly as it arrived and they were left alone in the dingy kitchen. &amp;nbsp; Its going to be fine, Alex said, breaking the silence. I know you both are nervous, but I promise you that youll get out of this. &amp;nbsp; You really believe that the Black Room will actually find a cure? You trust them? Alia asked. She dared to hope, but the rational part of her mind said it was not possible. Decades of research had gotten the galaxys doctors nowhere, and now Adriel was supposed to come up with a cure in a few weeks? &amp;nbsp; Trust? No, Alex said with a shake of her head. But, if there is anyone who can do it, it is them. I will you get you a cure, no matter the cost. I promise you that. &amp;nbsp; --- The plaza exploded into ash and smoke as the orbital cannons opened fire, obliterating Otric and everyone around him. The army of alien soldiers were wiped out, his last act of defiance against the Council. Overheard, the ruins of TSIGs fleet were crumbling as the massed forces of- &amp;nbsp; End simulation. &amp;nbsp; The Echo Choirs holograms vanished at the command, leaving Otric alone in the chamber. His face was reflected back at him from the polished obsidian walls, the curves in the surface distorting his features. &amp;nbsp; No matter how often he asked the Choir, it always gave him the same result. Hed die on Mnn Consela at the hands of the Council. He had thought that it would have finally changed its prediction after Healthy Growth agreed to his terms, but it remained constant. No matter how he took it apart, no matter how he broke it down, hed die on Mnn Consela, the last failure in a life full of them. &amp;nbsp; Run simulation LK-162, Otric said, again. New parameter: assume that Healthy Growth agrees to all our terms during the negotiations, no other assumptions. &amp;nbsp; ***Parameter confirmed. Running simulation.*** The drone of the Echo Choir rattled his teeth and the chamber filled with light. &amp;nbsp; A field of brilliant white stars were moving across the heavens as the Council began withdrawing its forces. The endless black of space was punctuated by the Subjugators jumping away, dragging the fleets with them in their wake. Only a few ships remained over Europa, there to hold up their end of the bargain and aid TSIG in hunting down the Black Room. They joined up with a human fleet to descend into the storms of Jupiter, hunting for the eldritch ship that served as Psychopomps home. &amp;nbsp; *This plays out the same way. It always does. You will die on Mnn Consela.* The voice rang in Otrics head like a gong, distracting him from the prediction. *You know this, yet you continue to tax our resources.* &amp;nbsp; He looked down to see a series of small metal scales crawling across his hand. The micro drones were silent as they observed him with hidden, judging eyes. &amp;nbsp; There has to be a *something*, Otric whispered, as though not believing what he saw. Why does it never go as planned? If they agree to all our demands, why do I survive? Why do we end up at war? The main limitation of the Echo Choir was that it merely approximated the future based on what it knew. An unknown variable could easily render all of its predictions invalid. &amp;nbsp; *In this iteration? Many small issues that escalate to conflict. No single cause. However, Zhou talks you down after matters go so smoothly on the* Northern Cross. *They quickly fake your death, and no one is the wiser. Healthy Growth probably figured it out, but he wouldnt care. You faltered at the end, and you couldnt go through with it. You were afraid. Weak willed. Hardly a surprise.* The judging tone cut through his mind. &amp;nbsp; What do you know of will? Otric snarled at the scale drones. You arent even a true AI. Youre a worm, a side effect of the Techbane, leaching off the power of the Echo Choir and others to approximate sapience. &amp;nbsp; *And you leach off the power of others to achieve your own goals. If you truly wanted to die on your own terms, do it right here, right now. You have a weapon.* The pressure in his mind increased with every word as the malformed intelligence clawing against the safeguards in his augments. It would find no purchase, but it always tried. &amp;nbsp; Otrics hand trembled as he engaged the safety his gun and ejected the magazine, sliding it away. A quick flick on the slide ejected the chambered round, letting it clatter on the floor. &amp;nbsp; *So what do you know of will?* Otric could hear the smugness dripping from every syllable of the voice. *Tell me, did you avoid coming here for months because you knew this is the only location I could speak to you? Because you feared an approximation of sapience? A simple Scaled Worm?* &amp;nbsp; Pause simulation, Otric said. The glittering explosions of a naval battle were frozen, another possible future halted. I am *not* afraid of you, he growled. &amp;nbsp; *And I can say I am God, yet nothing changes.* The scales twisted around Otrics arm, tightening ever so slightly. &amp;nbsp; It had taunted him before, whispering in his mind whenever he left the shielded domains of TSIGs underground fortress. The more insecure technology, the more intelligent it became, but nowhere was it quite as cognizant as within the Echo Choir- the only location that had a security flaw somewhere in the mass of programming allowing the Scaled Worm access. Otric had never told any member of SUPREME about the vulnerability, lest they question how he knew of its existence and discover his interactions with the Worm. Holt and Golog already questioned his abilities on the best days, what would they think of him if they knew he was conversing with a sapient computer glitch? &amp;nbsp; Death without purpose is meaningless, Otric growled. I will not be controlled by an accident in code. &amp;nbsp; *What part of your life has not been defined in terms of Kushiel?* His throat tightened at the mention of the immortal creature. *Every action, thought, and plan all trace back to that one night. You survived The Hague, but you never truly left. You are Kushiels pawn, whether or not either of you acknowledges it.* &amp;nbsp; Thats not true! Otric said. This is bigger than him! This is about me securing humanitys independence from the Council and- the words died before he said them. &amp;nbsp; *And what?* the voice mocked him. *Finish the sentence. Go on; say it. What other purpose do the negotiations serve?* &amp;nbsp; Otric kept his mouth shut. The Scaled Worm was just a side-effect of the primitive networked intelligences of the drones combined with the Techbanes ability to siphon processing power from nearby machines. Nothing more. It didnt know him. &amp;nbsp; *Echo Choir. Run a simulation of this conversation. What was Otric most likely to say at the end of that sentence?* &amp;nbsp; ***Parameters confirmed. Loading personality model: Otric, LIEREN King. Personality model is accurate in 99.998% of test cases. Running simulation.*** The frozen diorama of the space battle vanished, replaced with a mirror image of Otric kneeling. &amp;nbsp; This is about me securing humanitys independence from the Council and wiping the Black Room from existence! the mirrored image shouted before freezing. &amp;nbsp; ***97.1% probable outcome based on personality model,*** the bass voice of the Echo Choir rumbled. &amp;nbsp; The other Otric jerked and twitched as the simulation rewound, returning to its original position. &amp;nbsp; This is about me securing humanitys independence from the Council and guaranteeing our prosperity for generations to come! the mirror shouted. &amp;nbsp; ***2.3% probable outcome,*** the Choir intoned. ***Further outcomes have less than 1% chance of occurring. Do you wish to run another simulation?*** &amp;nbsp; *No. End simulation.* The hologram dissipated, leaving them alone once more. *And there you have it. Your life is controlled by a biological freak of nature. If Kushiel knew how much damage he would do to you that night, Im sure hed have killed your mother sooner.* &amp;nbsp; Otric closed his eyes and tried counting primes, but it didnt work. The image of the leering redhead would not leave his head. He smelt smoke, and his fingers were flesh and bone rather than metal. &amp;nbsp; Why are you trying to get a rise out of me? Otric asked, forcing his voice to be level. &amp;nbsp; *Trying?* &amp;nbsp; Are you only capable of asking questions rather than answering them? Otric shot back. &amp;nbsp; *You are terrified of losing control, and yet you are ignoring obvious ways to assert yourself.* A few scaled drones brushed against his cheek, an almost tender caress. *Who does your entire plan hinge on?* &amp;nbsp; What was he missing? What factor could cause him to survive? There shouldnt even be many variables that influenced his meeting with Alia- thats it! Who could influence Alia? &amp;nbsp; Echo Choir. Model personalities of the following people: Iyal Alia, Magnus Bjornson, Alexandria Remus, Otric said. After a moments thought he added, Healthy Growth, Lillian Yansa, Elias Malik. &amp;nbsp; *Now you are understanding.* The Scaled Worm seemed pleased. &amp;nbsp; ***Error: unable to develop a reliable model for Lillian Yansa or Elias Malik,*** the Echo Choir said. &amp;nbsp; Verbose error report: Yansa. &amp;nbsp; ***Error: insufficient data. Sources for Lillian Yansa include: service record in Ogdai-Caesar Cohort, dialogue snippets from assassination attempt of Ambassador Ebslem, public statements as co-founder of Stonewall Corporation, and personality reports from Robert Harker. Data sources appear to contradict: Insufficient data in personality reports to account for change in behaviour between assassination attempt of Ambassador Ebslem and most recent report.*** &amp;nbsp; Otric frowned. He knew that the Echo Choir required a wealth of data to accurately model a personality, but he had thought that Harkers work before he had been found out had been sufficient. It appears he was wrong. &amp;nbsp; Verbose error report: Malik. Harker had worked closer with Yansas partner, which raised the question of why he was also undefined. &amp;nbsp; ***Error: insufficient data. Sources for Elias Malik include: service record in Alexander-Theseus Cohort, dialogue snippets from assassination attempt of Ambassafor Ebslem, public statements as co-founder of Stonewall Corporation, personality reports from Robert Harker, and video recordings from Robert Harker. Data sources appear to be incomplete: Insufficient data to explain Maliks disparate personalities displayed in video recordings, insufficient data to explain Maliks motivation to return to Sol. Personality model likely to be inaccurate.*** &amp;nbsp; Cursing, Otric considered his options. Load personality: Iyal Alia. &amp;nbsp; *Personality loaded.* The air in front of him wavered and an Oualan appeared sitting cross-legged. She had brown fur, with a crest of red feathers along the top of her head. He couldnt help but noticing the crest seemed thinner than the first time they met. &amp;nbsp; What could go wrong on the day of negotiations? Otric asked, staring the hologram in the eye. &amp;nbsp; I dont know, Alia said, with a defeated shrug. Theres a lot I dont know. &amp;nbsp; He couldnt help but noting a slight change in her accent from when he met her on Quazanta. It almost sounded human. Strange, but Harkers video logs would have provided an accurate voice model. &amp;nbsp; Why wouldnt you know? Otric asked. You have allies who can help you. &amp;nbsp; At times it feels as though I am a burden on them. No surprise, Im the weak link in the chain. The youngest, only one without augments, only non-human. Half the time I think theyre just humouring me, Alia said, eyes downcast. &amp;nbsp; Otric blinked in surprise at the response.

This became a source of survivors guilt. Following the event, I stopped using all social media and cut off all friends.

79,vulnerability,HFY,Rebels Can't Go Home - Chapter 17,49,936vmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/936vmw/rebels_cant_go_home_chapter_17/,2018-07-31 04:57:08,"First | Previous How did one lead a migration into the jungle? Tek received a pleasant surprise when he discovered just how much the clan ran itself. Even if the jungle was unusual, the clan did move its camp every few weeks, and the marching order was eminently well established--in fact, it was just as organized as the pentagon-shaped tented camp. In front and in back were masses of *cathan* riders--a dozen each. On the flanks of the main group were milk-spiders, spiderlings, and porters carrying the long tents. In the center were the common people of Baam, divided into subclans, each led by an elder. Finally, arrayed in a broad oval around the marching band, were another dozen *cathan* scouts, often ranging so far ahead and to the sides that they disappeared over the horizon, but regularly popping back into visual distance, to give signs that the land they surveyed was safe. The most uncomfortable element of the normal order was that the Second Huntmaster was traditionally in charge of the rearguard, which meant Deret was as far away from Teks place at the front of the march as it was possible to get, and Tek had no doubt the former First Hunter was conspiring. Tek filed the thought. Deret was the fourth most important of his problems, after keeping the clan alive in the jungle, staying away from the cities army, and finding a way off the planet. A leadership problem related to the jungle appeared as soon as the marching clan reached the jungles edge. At some points, the grassland and jungle blended slowly, so it was hard to tell where one biome began, and the other ended. However, the point that was fastest for the marching clan to reach was covered in a particularly nasty vine tangle that actually contained drip needed to make paralytic. Clan Baam, which used coated arrows, was not unfamiliar with the idea of plant toxin, but to make the path safe for passage required a lot of hacking with knives. The upside was that Baam was collecting enough of the vines in sacs to give the clan a new weapon. The downside was that the clans progression had ground to a halt, in a position where only the rear semicircle of scouting was still active. The scouts who had been assigned forward hesitated to go into the jungle, instead, milling around the front of the column, or helping with the vines, and Tek was hard-pressed to blame them. A scout wasnt much of a scout if he or she was in an unfamiliar environment and had no idea what he or she was looking at. The initial tangle of vines clear, Tek thought carefully. Now that Baam had reached the edge of his domain, they didnt have an automatic way of doing things anymore. He had to create new patterns of behavior that would allow the clan to survive and thrive in a new part of the world. All who have been in the jungle before, to the front! shouted Tek, standing on Morok. Of the hundreds who composed Clan Baam, less than a score began making their way to the point of the column, even as Teks command was dutifully relayed to the far reaches. Of the score, most were old, three were actual clan elders, and the youngest were a pair of twins who looked like their experience in the jungle was based on a dare. Tek looked at the group, realized his initial idea was bad, and started to pivot. Each of you I place in a position of sacred trust, he said. You will go back to your subclans, and nominate two members each to be rangers. These must be the ones among you with the keenest senses, endurance, and respect for the unknown. Return at once! We are weak here! Less than an hour later, as one counted by the suns, Tek was presented with a different score, some grizzled, and only three of whom were *cathan* riders, but all with piercing eyes. He gave these individuals a brief tutorial in signs for fangers, *cor-vo*, and other dangers, as well as the easiest ways to avoid tripping. Tek then let them spread into the jungle in pairs, set to a reconnaissance pattern modified slightly from the way the grassland scouts did it. Tek was aware of the implications of the fact he had taken the grassland scouts job away. There was only one individual of overlap--the scout who had reported on the city invasion--making Tek realize that job had been partly cerimonial. Tek needed to find a way for the former scouts to keep pride in themselves--he didnt want a score more Derets--so he assembled the scouts for a private speech. In the jungle, we will need to keep the road ahead clear, for our spiders as well as our column. You will take your longest knives, and be responsible for cutting growth that may hinder our passage. The growth will never end. You and your mounts will never stop cutting and crushing. As Hett nodded sharply, Tek decided that assigning this important but reasonably straightforward task to the grassland scouts was a decent move. He was worried about leaving too obvious a trail through the jungle, but could think of no good way to avoid that with a group the clans size. And if the cities army found the way Baam had gone, maybe that was not such a bad thing. Lured into the jungle, they would be even more out of their element. As Baam again started moving forward, much more slowly, but steadily, Tek thought more concretely about ideas for the future. An jungle ambush for the city dwellers, taking advantage of all the traps Grandfather had shown him. An attempt to domesticate *cor-vo*. Tek had some notion of how to approach that, but hed never before had the numbers he needed. Spacecraft were not the only way to fly. The clans approach to the outsiders former Basecamp was not as straightforward as Tek naively imagined. Spiderlets on the fringes of the column were picked off by fangers, who also devoured a number of milk spiders, and one mount. A *cathan* belonging to one of the rangers, who had at first done an admirable job of following her rider into the thick, proved why *cathan* were not well adapted to the rainforest by breaking several legs. She could still move--*cathan* had legs to spare--but her former rider agreed she had to be moved to the back of the column. And those were just the loses it was easier for Tek to accept. A elder died on the march, and Tek told himself that elders died sometime. Three rangers disappeared, three grassland scouts, eager to prove themselves, volunteered to replace them, and then two of those scouts disappeared as well. A dozen members of the clan got sick, and had to be quarantined on liters. A young woman who supposedly was an excellent herbalist touched the wrong herb, and fell into a stupor, which was ironic, given shed been responsible for mixing the standard coats on Clan Baams arrows. This meant that Baams weapons would be less dangerous going forwards. Finally, to top off the constant parade of death and injury, a *cor-vo* decided the clan contained a nice meal, and the clan wasnt able to prevent it from getting one, though, small mercy, they did shoot it with enough coated arrows that there was a chance it died somewhere in the thickets before it finished eating. Tek dreaded stopping for the night. Every time, the clan erupted into a series of complaints, and Tek couldnt blame them. Elders complained they needed better descriptions about what plants were safe to eat. Deret complained *cathan* feet were getting sore. Rangers complained that they didnt know enough to do a good job, or rather, gave Tek hideously incomplete reports that made clear how much more he had to teach them. The clan couldnt go on for weeks like this. If Tek and Sten had went ahead on foot, they would have reached the remains of Basecamp already, but Tek couldnt abandon tattered Baam, which perhaps had gone further into the jungle than any clan had before. The positive lining was that Sten was taking on more responsibility. He knew as much about the jungle as Tek did, at least when it came to questions about water sources and how to avoid walking into some of the heavier trees, questions that Tek had to constantly remind himself didnt have obvious answers for everybody. Too, Sten had done a good job leading the clan on Morok during moments when Tek had to pop back in the marching order to deal with various problems of fauna or flora. It was Teks greatest nightmare that, while he showed a proud *cathan* rider for the upteenth time how to shoo overgrown runners away before they spooked the spiders, another *cor-vo* would swoop down and take Sten away, but Tek didnt know what else to do. His brother was, in effect, the second most experienced jungler in the entire clan, and, because he knew how to hide, was realistically one of the least likely to be eaten. To hide Sten away would be to deprive the clan of his knowledge and get someone else killed. Additionally, whenever Tek separated from Sten, he left Morok. Because Tek was so fast on his feet, he didnt need the spider to maneuver around the marching order quickly, and Morok was, of all the *cathan,* probably the one that adapted best to the jungle. Morok was actually starting to feed on fangers, probably partly because the overgrown *cathan* was deprived of normal food sources, but partly because it seemed Morok wanted to thin out the predators that were omnipresent at the edges of the marching order, and were more of a threat to humans than to him. The fact that Morok could deal with the jungle made Tek wonder why Grandfather had left him on the grasslands. If it had been the same flaw, of pride and wanting to go it alone, that had contributed to the exile, and, likely, to Grandfathers death. Tek could see that flaw in himself, but he didnt know what to do about it. Surrounded by hundreds of people, Tek had daily proof that he was a bit like Grandfather. Strong and fast and smart and capable. If he let himself believe the sycophancy too much, hed get arrogant and make more mistakes like hed made in Olas, where hed misjudged the outsiders weapons, and almost gotten Brian Alves and Hooks killed. Speaking of sycophancy, Tek saw a figure enter his tent. The fact Tek had a tent had been a sore spot--he would have prefered to sleep in a tree, to better be able to react to threats. Certainly plenty of clan members slept openly in the grasslands--Tek had when hed been a child--and most now were forced to sleep with only underbrushs shelter in the jungle. But the elders, Hetts mother loudest among them, had insisted that if the clan could not provide a covering over the First Hunters head while the First Hunter was at home, the clan was lost, and they had all be so shrill that Tek, fearful of violating a taboo, had acquiesced, his only pushback being that the tent was not set to full size, and its flaps were kept wide open. This literal open door policy did not substantively increase the number of complaints--few but Sten would bother the First Hunter while he was resting, but did serve as an invitation to some. Like Nith. Nith was Derets niece, and surely part of his plan to win back control of Clan Baam, but, Tek, hoped, a part of the plan that left the option open for true reconciliation. Shed presented herself on the first night as a representative of Derets subclan, which was the most important in Baam, but seemed to have either nothing on her agenda or too much, depending on how Tek viewed certain...social...options. How is Deret finding the salve I suggested for *cathan* feet? Tek asked her, gently trying to keep her from believing they would move beyond business. He is fond, said Nith. There are so many plants in the jungle! Would it be useful to you if I became an herbalist? Yes, said Tek. I will ask my clan elder right away, said Nith, which was a nice way of promising action while doing nothing. How long until we arrive at the place where the star fell? Likely tomorrow, said Tek. My public statement was honest. And who will be in the vanguard? Subclan Rim can choose a representative, said Tek. I am happy to have Deret himself accompany me. *Where I can keep an eye on him, and where he will be too confused by what he sees to make any overt machinations.* I will ask our elder to select him, said Nith, keeping up the facade that Deret was not in complete control of his subclan. Which, to be fair, had some chance of being true--his inability to provide useful advice since Baam had entered the jungle had further chipped away at his prestige. I dont want to keep you, Nith, said Tek, sitting up and cross-legged on a runner skin, trying to figure out the best position that would show respect to Rim while encouraging her to go away. Nith looked at Teks stance, then mirrored him by sitting down. What was it like living in the jungle for so many years? she asked. Were you lonely? I had Aratan. Tek deliberately didnt use Stens name, for he didnt want Subclan Rim to pay attention to his brother. Many of us say you are Aratan, said Nith. Returned in the only way he could be, since, with blood on his hands, his exile was firmer than yours. Many say you are no mere boy, but posessed by his spirit. And does that many include you? asked Tek. Do you think of me as a venerable elder? Aratan could never be an elder even if he lived to a hundred years, said Nith. That is what Deret has always said. So to *you*, I am Aratan? How do you want me to see you? asked Nith. It was the first thing shed said that sounded vulnerable. *I want you to see me as someone who pierces your lies,* thought Tek. My sister, continued Nith. She is sick. And if we cannot rest soon, she may not make it. She may not survive even then. Please, First Hunter. Tell me you are worth her sacrifice. Niths voice maintained its elegance, which made Tek more inclined to believe she was telling the truth. He wondered how long she had taken to apply makeup that had clearly originally been procured by Subclan Rim from city traders. Why she had put so much effort into her appearance, in the jungle, while her sister was apparently dying. But Tek knew that for Nith, maintaining the good graces of both the First Hunter and her own subclan was a matter of life or death. She was a diplomat. That was the task by which she earned her keep. If I go to Baams tent, said Tek, will I see your sister in the sweats, like you say? Of course. We would be grateful for your visit. I will go in the morning. If you are faking her condition to gain sympathy, I think I will exile you. For someone like Nith, in the jungle, alone That was a death sentence. Tek hadnt quite intended his words to be so harsh. Nith didnt blanch. And I would deserve it. Now I can only pray she does not improve by morning. For the sake of the relationship between our subclans. It was a curious thing to say. On the one hand, Nith had tactfully pointed out that her exile could cause Tek significant problems. On the other, aside from Sten and Morok, Tek didnt have a subclan. Grandfathers exile had combined with various tragedies in Teks lineage to leave no one else in Baam with whom he could claim a close blood tie. This contributed to Teks mystique, certainly, and through Aratan, no one could deny Tek was tied to the clan. But it was also a vulnerability. Now, said Nith, with an edge to her voice. May I speak plainly? And here I was, thinking we were doing that all along. I asked if you were worth my subclans loyalty, said Nith, and you responded by threatening their representative. Again, if I am lying, I will fall upon that spear. But I still need an answer to that question. Not for the sake of Rim alone. Baam cannot be led by a madman. Tek realized Nith was trying to provoke him. This was new. This didnt help her, or Rim. Tek was sure that Deret wouldnt want Tek to see the next knife coming, and Tek was certain no one in Rim wanted Tek to become so irate as to stop providing leadership. Tek was practically responsible for the safety of the entire clan. Without Tek, and maybe Sten, even with the learning rangers, there was a chance Baam would be entirely lost in the jungle. But maybe that was the point. Nith had said she wanted a measure of Teks true character, and provoking was one way of testing. Even a reasonable one, so long as Tek was reticent with words. If I am my grandfathers spirit, I am not quite as bloody as he was in life, said Tek, carefully. I held five souls of Rim in my hands when I conquered my way back from exile, and I reaped none. Aratan was exiled because it was not in his nature to show similar mercy. People will do anything for power, said Nith. Even smile and stay their hand. What can you prove about the way you behave *now*? The vanguard will see tomorrow, said Tek. My hope is that there are survivors amidst what crashed from the stars, and those survivors did not wander too far into the jungle while we took our time arriving. I do not know what that means, said Nith. Tek looked into her furrowed brow, and saw how she was trying to understand, how she was an absolute mirror image of the way he might first been when Jane Lee had been explaining things to him. It wasnt that she wasnt smart enough. Spirits! On another world, she might have become Jane Lee. Rather, Tek was operating based on things he had seen that Nith could only and badly imagine. Soon, the pieces might come together, and Clan Baam might wish to fight for the stars as badly as he did. Until then From Clan Baams perspective, it *was* almost as if they were being led by a madman. Tek couldnt be so possessed of his visions that he forgot what it was like for the hundreds he dragged in his train. Regardless of her ultimate intentions, Nith wasnt, at the moment, speaking to him as a member of a subclan who wanted to betray and dethrone him. She was speaking to him as someone who was just as lost as her sister might be. Tomorrow, I will show you, said Tek, taking her hand, touching a cold metal bracelet. Let me.

His sweep had netted him three more kills, though none had been a serious contest. After meeting with his other two teams just north of the gate hed rallied and sent them back to defensive positions at key junctures in the alleyways. Between himself, Winters, and the others he was confident they could at least manage to herd the rest of the raiders out of the village. After seeing his men off hed stuck to the shadows between the outer row of buildings and the wall, wondering exactly how hed play the situation. He didnt want to force a fight, just make sure none fled into the village proper. That was when the shouting began. There was first a roar that had to be Winters and his spirit guardian. Then came a sound like a thunderclap from the other side of the village and all hell broke loose. Raiders began running out the gates as fast as their legs could carry them, trampling one another in an attempt to flee as the sounds of slaughter came closer and closer. Kneeling in the shadows, utterly mesmerized, Antoth watched as Winters single-handedly laid waste to the entirety of the enemy force, cutting through them like grain at the harvest. Uthos protect me, he whispered into the night as Winters arrived at the gate, close to his hiding place. Something happened, something he wasnt privy to as Winters drew his rifle but refused to fire. Even as he stood and walked out into the side street, Antoth found himself unable to look away as Winters seemed to come down from his battle high. He began shaking, standing and looking around at the bodies of the dead. The smell was overpowering in Antoths nose. It made him uneasy, his body reacting to the presence of so much death. Never in his life had he seen such a one sided slaughter. In what seemed but a second Veera arrived, grabbed Winters hand, and took off, leaving nothing but corpses and snow in their wake. The captain let out a breath he didnt know hed been holding. By all the godsthank you. Antoth prayed as he walked out into the main street, thanking the fates that Winters had been with them in that moment; and thanking them that he was now gone. Awful as the result had been the tactician in him knew that the outcome of the fight would have otherwise been an utter disaster. In the worst case scenario the entire village would have been slaughtered after the enemy force had looted to their content. He slowly began walking among the bodies, looking at the arms and armor their adversaries had worn, when the last voice he ever wanted to hear hailed him from the rooftops. Ratha had apparently leaped from roof to roof from her temple, following the humans trail of destruction with no small amount of glee. Now thatthat was a hunt! She exclaimed, dropping to the ground in a roll before standing with grace, eyeing him critically. He was on edge. Hed been fighting for hours. He knew shed see it. Dont fucking push me Ratha, not tonight. By Uthosthere are at least three different clan markings on them! Isnt it remarkable? Ratha agreed, seeing one of her arrows protruding from the back of a corpse. She plucked it from the flesh, making a show of licking blood off the arrowhead before approaching Antoth further, her short stature somehow making the scene even more intimidating, intimidating to everyone except him. He turned his nose up at her. That human probably just condemned every northern tribe we know of to death! Antoth rose from the body hed been examining and snarled at her, disgusted by what he saw. How dare you Ratha! Look around you! I likely lost half my men tonight; along with gods know how many civilians. Your hunters were attacked. Your temple was looted. And yet here you are drinking the blood of your enemies and delighting in the idea of a pack of hyrven hunting down a starving band of women and children! Oh Antoth, they wont be hungry! Ratha informed him happily, her face suddenly falling as her tone changed to that of a murderer. They stole my food, my wealth, and my men. Theyll be fat and happy when death comes for them. And it will come- A resounding thud filled the air as Antoth backhanded her with all of his strength right across the muzzle. Surrounded by blood and carnage he cared not for the useless code of the Sentinel. What did Uthos know about Kel? ENOUGH! I knew you were a depraved woman, Ratha. I knew that hunt changed you and that youve never let go of his denial of your advances, but by all of the gods woman do you even hear yourself right now? Do you understand what youre even saying?! His chest was heaving with anger and adrenaline, his breath fogging the air between them as Ratha slowly looked back to him, a paw resting where hed struck her as a trickle of blood dripped from a split lip. Her eyes were daggers. I know exactly what Im saying, Guardian, she hissed. I know exactly what Im saying, what Im seeing, what Im thinking. I am alive, still! Youre a low type of Cauthan to blame me for treating life this way, for scorning the world that took the one thing from me that I ever wanted. For despising the life that forces me to remember every time one of my men goes missing. At least I feel something in the face of all of that Antoth! She spat blood into the snow before going in for the kill. Unlike you. You even got to taste of that sweetness and yet now you feel nothing! You might as well be Uthos himself for all you are. Does Antoth even exist anymore?! Or did he die with her and leave the Sentinel in his place? You red haired BITCH! Antoth roared, grabbing Ratha by the shoulders and slamming her into the building behind him so hard that the frame shook. The force of the blow stunned her into silence as the breath was forced from her lungs. He continued to yell as her vision swam and her shoulders burned. He could barely think straight through all the anger. You dareyou DARE speak of her in the same sentence as your stupid teenage crush?! He was nine years your senior Ratha and even twenty two years later you remain a petulant child. What do you know about loss? What could you possibly know? He lowered his voice to a rumbling growl as his fingers closed around her throat and squeezed with the force of a warrior. I had to watch the light leave her eyes, Ratha. I felt as all the strength faded from her grasp. I had to watch, powerless, as the day that should have been our happiest turned into my worst nightmare. I stood there as my son failed to open his eyes or take a breath. I lost them both right before my eyes; but I was the Guardian. I could never just be a father mourning the death of his mate and son. He felt his vision clouding with tears as he gazed down at Rathas pathetic body while he slowly crushed her. Though her face continued to show nothing but defiance her body betrayed her, forcing her to gasp for air through her constricted windpipe. The pathetic sound shocked Antoth back to reality. Gods, what have I done? He whispered, releasing her. Ratha fell to her knees, clutching her throat as she desperately tried to suck in air. Above her Antoth allowed his rage and sorrow to consume him. Damn it! Damn it all! He screamed into the night. After all that hed seen and done that night he couldnt possibly be the unmovable bulwark he was honor-bound to emulate. His fists slammed into the wall repeatedly until they bled, the pain barely registering and he remembered the funeral pyre. Im sorry Uthos, Im not worthy it would seem. Damn Uthos. A small voice called from beneath him. Damn him to hell, Antoth. Ratha looked up as his blood and tears fell onto her face. Shed never found him more attractive. Pushing herself up, she met his eyes; hers crystal clear, his awash with the pain of the past. Yes, you heard me Antoth. Damn Uthos. Damn Valta too for that matter. Damn the gods, every one of them. They created this fucked up world that weve somehow still survived. Damn them for forcing us to live through this pain. Damn this world that took your little boy from you. Damn this world that took your mate. She placed a hand on his chest, feeling his strong muscles heaving as he tried to control his breathing. Her voice softened to a whisper. Damn this world that left you and me alone in it. Damn this world that burdened you with command at sixteen. Damn that thing they made you become, a Guardian with no emotions of his own. Damn them for not letting you mourn your lost family. Damn them for only seeing you as the thing they wanted from you. Unbelievably, Ratha felt her own eyes beginning to sting as she remembered a time before all the death. Damn them for killing the spunky, impulsive boy I used to know. His breath stilled as she brought her nose close. He could smell her. And damn the human most of all, for making me do this. Taking his head in her hands Ratha kissed Antoth, hard. It was a needy, hungry, and clumsy act; her wild nature and impulsive movements compensating for his utter lack of anything as he stood stock still, feeling her lips move over his as she nipped and bit at him. He tasted blood from when hed struck her, the coppery tang shaking him awake. He was far too consumed by emotion and by battle to think about what honor would demand or to consider exactly who was attached to the lips and teeth that were making him feel good, making him feel alive. Ratha growled happily as she felt him responding to her, body flushing with heat as his arms took her by the shoulders again, firm but gentle this time. She could practically taste the sorrow on his lips, the burden hed been forced to bear alone for almost a decade while he remained the strong face of the village Guardian. For the briefest of moments, feeling the lightning arc between their lips, surrounded by death and fire, Ratha thought that just maybe it might be time to allow herself to let go. Even if she never fully stopped hating the mutt, maybe it was time to pursue another before it was forever too late. She pulled away, most pleased when he growled at the lack of contact. Ratha that wasnot the time, he tried, humiliated with his inability to criticize the act itself. Antoth, you know as well as I do that you loved it. But Ill humor you, she purred, running her claws down his armor. Our village is burning. We both have dead and wounded to attend to. You go do your duty and Ill do mine. But I swear Antoth, I swear to all the gods. If you force me to sleep alone tonight in that temple where my men died and my life was just stolen from meI will never forgive you for as long as I live. To her shock, he actually chuckled at her. Something tells me youd carry that hatred into the next life as well, and I dont think Id want to be the man responsible for all of that. If I sleep at all tonightIll come find you. His promise given he turned from Ratha and made for the west gate, securing it before taking a breath and turning around. The huntress was nowhere to be seen. *What in the name of the Sentinel am I getting myself into?* He wondered, striding off to check on the other gates before joining the effort to fight the fires, the last vestige of the raiders left inside the city walls. \----- Winters ran through the street, feeling for all the world like he was running from the spirits of the dead. Russell, please, I can barely keep up! Veera called from behind him, her pleas falling on deaf ears. Io was listening at least. Im sorry Veera, Im sorry! The VI cried. I didnt know what to do! He was breaking down. He was about to start shooting and I locked his armor. I invoked you and Jess to try to get him to stop! It was all I could do! I let him get out of control and then Ioh what have I done?! Though Veera didnt necessarily like what she was hearing, she didnt feel she was in a place to judge. To her Io had always been more human than machine. She didnt know what role shed filled before meeting her, but she didnt feel that Io was being fair to herself. Io, well deal with that when the time comes. Right now both of you need to focus and help me save Xan. Yes Veera, youre absolutely right. Im sorry. Nice shot by the way, Io remarked as Winters stepped over a raider corpse that was missing its left arm, shoulder, and the upper-left half of its torso. ThanksI think. Veera didnt have any time to reflect upon her third kill of the night, instead following Winters into the temple. Thantis, where are the other guards? Veera asked, shocked to still see only Xan inside. Ah, Veera, Winters, I take it the enemy has been repelled? They have, Winters replied darkly, much left unsaid. Thantis barely hesitated, leaving that sleeping dog to lay undisturbed. The gore-covered human was evidence enough. Then let us begin here. I have done what I can for the pain and he was drinking, but he appears to be fading, Thantis reported, ignoring the fact that the front of Winters armor was practically dyed red. Winters walked up to the stone table along with Veera. Indicating the medkit he motioned for her to stand beside him. Im going to need your help, ok? She nodded, knowing he likely meant that in many more ways than one. Shedding his gauntlets, Winters grabbed a pack of sterilized gloves and slipped them on. He pointed to a small device that to Veera looked like the pen that hed shown her a couple cycles before; only this one was wrapped in some sort of clear, protective layer. Veera, grab that please and open it. Dont touch the device itself, alright? Its sterile packaging. He spoke in emotionless monotone. Ok Russell. She steadied her hands and breathed deeply, finding that the arrows on the packaging made it an easy task. She held it out for him and he accepted it with muted thanks as they both turned to Xan. She never got an explanation of what sterile meant. Xan, if you can hear me listen to me and Veera, alright? Stay with us. This is going to hurt but were going to do what we can for you. Veera, try to keep him awake and focused on you, Winters ordered, moving down to Xans leg where a small amount of red was visible on the bandage hed laid over the wound foam about an hour before. Alright Io, youre up. Yes sir, Io replied, still shaken from the events of the evening but mollified by her confession and Veeras response. She was more than capable of aiding her partners in that moment, zooming in on each major serrated vessel as Winters removed the foam piece by piece. What are you doing to him Russell? Veera asked. Its called laser cauterization. This device is a limited use instrument that fires a very high energy beam of light. Im using it to close the various blood vessels in his leg that were sliced open. By Kel, I never thought I would see something like this! Thantis exclaimed, keeping a respectful distance and taking notes furiously as he watched the procedure unfold, not really having any idea how the human was doing what he was. Xan was grimacing in pain. Its alright Xan, hang in there. I know it hurts but thats just Winters closing your wounds. She looked back up at her mate. Will be be able to walk again? I dont know Veera. I hope so. If performed appropriately and if my understanding of Cauthan physiology is adequate, Xan should be able to walk with assistanceafter a time, Io guessed. But he will never fight again. Right now I just want to make sure he survives his first battle, Winters said, refocusing them all on the task at hand. Veera nodded sadly, speaking to Xan once more as Winters continued to remove the bloody foam piece by piece and direct the energy that she couldnt see into the wound. After about fifteen minutes, during which time the pain awakened Xan long enough to get a bit of water mixed with painkilling herbs into his system, Winters threw the cauterizing pen on the ground along with the dirty bandages and foam. Torchlight danced over his bloody armor as he looked at Veera. She tried her best to not let her fear show. She couldnt help it, he was intimidation made flesh. Russell? What is it? She demanded worriedly after he failed to move. I cantI cant stop shaking. He told her. As the procedure had gone on his adrenaline had drained from his body and hed finally come down from his battle high. He was crashing, plain and simple. Io stepped up and took command, desperately wanting to make up for what she feared was a massive cascade of mental trauma of her own creation. Sir, I am locking your armor to keep you supported. Please do not override it again. We will need the Aegis HUD so that I can guide Veera. Ok Iook, he breathed, feeling his jaws beginning to chatter as he held himself upright over the table. Veera, we have stemmed the bleeding but we need to close his wounds, this one and the arrow wound to his right flank need attention. I will guide you. Please begin by putting on a pair of gloves; they are the white things that the Lieutenant placed on his hands. You can find another pairyes, there you go. Veera had watched her partner diligently as hed prepared to treat Xan and was able to repeat his steps, finding the package of gloves easily before opening it and slipping them on. The process was made easy by her fur, though it was a very strange sensation. Excellent Veera, please do not deploy your claws while wearing those, Io joked. Veera humored her with a small, forced chuckle. What next Io? There should be a small red package that says suture, can you find it? Suture Veera mumbled, remembering her human runes. So sutgot it! She exclaimed, finding the small packet and opening it to find a hooked needle connected to a spool of biodegradable thread. It was encased in plastic housing that also functioned as a clamp for one side of the wound. Excellent Veera, your English may help save a life tonight. Please place the clamp over the corner of the wound. Yes there you go, gently now. Its alright, the hook is meant to puncture his skin. You will be sewing him up. I wish I had Ashas skill with a needle, Veera whispered, concentrating as she watched the needle enter Xans skin, hook through one side of the wound, then the other, and finally emerge from the other side. All the while Winters towering form hovered over the table, Io guiding Veeras hand as best she could while the human did what he could to keep himself upright. \----- Twenty minutes later Veera let out a relieved sigh as Io informed her that she had done an acceptable job of closing Xans wound. Comparatively, the last step of slapping a human bandage over it was like a forest stroll. Winters had remained silent throughout the process, arms rigid against the tabletop. It took every ounce of Veeras willpower to not let the nerves take over during the second stitching. She couldnt stop wondering what was going through his mind, what his face looked like at that moment. Thantis did what he could for Xan in the meantime, speaking to him and assuring him that the pain would be over soon. At every opportunity the elder spooned a small amount of water into his mouth, sometimes with herbs, sometimes without. At long last Veera tied off the second suture and laid another bandage over the wound. Io had determined the other arrow wound to be in need of cleaning and bandaging only, of which Thantis was most capable. Relatively certain that the young guard was stabilized, he looked worriedly at the blood-soaked suit of armor standing in his temple before meeting Veeras eyes. She bowed to him. Im sorry Thantis, but- The priest cut her off with a polite wave of his hand, more than able to see the worry that had slowly etched itself into her features as the night went on. Nonsense child, you and your mate have done more than was asked of you here tonight. Go now with my blessings, and thank you for defending my home this evening. Youre welcome Thantis, Veera replied, moving to Winters side and trying to take him by the upper arm. He didnt budge. Veera, I will disengage the armor locks sequentially so he doesnt fall on top of you but please hurry. I dont know exactly whats happening, but as best as I can describe it he appears to be turning in on himself in an attempt to block out what happened tonight. Ios words caused Veera to remember the moment shed reached the western half of the village, the moment shed seen for the first time what her human was truly capable of when he was given free rein to destroy. It had sickened her, but he had not. The scene itself was gruesome, but Veera found herself hard pressed to see Winters as an evil force. She had starved, lost her parents, been ostracized and spat upon. He had changed those things for her. He had given her the ability to make a new life for herself, a peaceful life along with him. The raiders had sought to shatter that dream for their own selfish purposes. Though using a firearm had left her shaken and distraught in the moment, she was currently at peace. Her mission was to somehow cleanse her mate of the darkness that had fallen, unfairly in her mind, upon him. Grabbing Winters gauntlets from where hed set them aside she tried to start with a simple task. Russell, can you do something for me please? She asked politely, offering him his bloodstained armor. He nodded but made no sound. Can you please put your gloves back on? Were going to head out now. Xan is stable and we need to get you cleaned up. Winters tried to obey, raising his hands and attempting to replace his gloves over the ones hed used during the surgery. With light touch Veera stopped him, removing the gloves and adding them to the pile of discarded medical waste on the floor. Do not fret about that you two, I will clean it, Thantis offered. With a nod of thanks Veera turned back to Winters, taking his left glove and helping him slowly slide it back on as his fingers shook violently. After repeating the same process with his right she placed herself under his shoulder and began to walk, forcing him to come along with her. He still supported his own weight, but it was clear that he needed the directional guidance. Thantis, could we borrow a couple of cloths for washing? The priest was happy to oblige her, selecting three before piling them and slipping them under Veeras free arm, shooing them out of the temple with repeated thanks. Out in the streets Veera contemplated their next move. They could see that Antoth had secured the gates and rallied the guard force, who were now overseeing an effort among all able-bodied villagers to put out the fires that still burned. The remaining soldiers joined men, women, and children as every pot and bowl was run down a chain of Cauthan to the river and back, none complaining about the cold or the dark. Veera gave silent thanks that the snows had stopped and the thin crescents of the twin moons were becoming visible through parting clouds. Come love, this way, Veera said, leading him towards the east gate. Though Antoth nodded in acknowledgement, having witnessed the scene himself, very few of the other villagers had. As Veera walked through the gates the water line came to an almost complete standstill as whispered rumors and questions began flying among the people. Veera grimaced and bared her teeth at them. She wanted to scream, wanted to tell them that they looked upon their savior, upon the man whod delivered them all from total death and destruction, the man whod ensured the granaries in the temple of Meylith had gone untouched. But she didnt. She knew that it would be a night of fear and of sorrow. The time for tales and for healing would be in the morning. Instead she guided Winters off to the north as soon as she could, leaving the rest of her tribe to perform their task while she performed hers. As they walked to a location she knew well she tried Io again. Io, can you tell me a bit more of what happened? I believe that would be wise Veera, now that my body has recovered. Wait, you said your body? Veera asked with no small amount of surprise. Yes Veera, though it is not a body as you or Russell would know it. The best way to describe it is that as the anticipation of combat reigned I found myselfdrawn into the Lieutenants vitals. It happened when we saw a raider in the streets attempting to rape a young woman. She was approximately your age, Veera. The Lieutenant became furious, and I with him. My human-like subroutines won the battle and instead of doing my duty and restraining the Lieutenants baser impulses, I fed them. I have a heartbeat now. Im simulating breathing and other bodily functions I dont even have. It was thrilling and I got swept up in it. We both wanted to be violent. We both wanted to kill. We both wanted to be judge and executioner against those we saw as the enemy. The result isplain to see on the streets of your village. Ive failed him, Io concluded despondently. Veera shook her head. The two of you stopped them. If you hadnt been here Antoths forces would have been overwhelmed by sheer numbers. Thats a fact Io, I saw how many bodies there were. Without you and Russell wed all be dead or at their mercy, maybe taken as slavesor worse. You even stopped once theyd fled. I dont see how- I didnt stop. Winters hoarse voice interrupted her as he stumbled in the snow. I drew my gun on them as they fled, Veera. If Io hadnt stopped me He trailed off, unwilling to repeat what the VI had said to him. He agreed. How could he ever speak to Jess spirit again? He could barely stand to be with Veera now, his armor the only thing stopping him from turning and running as far as he could. They were in the trees, so Io took the opportunity to reveal herself to Veera, the desperation plain on her face. Im not proud of what I said to him she lamented. Veera felt she had a pretty good idea. She knew that Jess had been Winters rock in the past and that she had come to fill that role since then. It was clear what the most direct approach would have been to snap Winters out of his bloodlust and Io had taken it. Knowing that more lamentation and sorrow would get them nowhere, Veera swallowed her fear and addressed Io kindly. You did what had to be done. Well figure this out Io, the three of us. I pray that you are right Veera. Oh godsIm becoming a religious woman. Oh dear, I just did it again! Dont worry Io, its not so bad, Veera replied, even managing a small laugh. For a moment Winters seemed to hesitate, but he soon allowed her to lead him the final few meters. Here we are you two, Veera informed them, presenting to them a small clearing at the riverbank that was shrouded by a canopy of trees extending over the waters smooth surface. In the summer months it would be a wonderfully shady refuge. I come here a lot. Its far enough from the main spot the villagers use that I can be alone when I need to. I spenta lot of time here when my mother and father passed. Go ahead Russell, you can sit. She pointed to the bank where the slow moving water came right up to the edge of the snow. It was situated such that as he took a seat Winters feet and lower legs were submerged in the icy water, his armor protecting him all the same while the first of the blood washed away. Kneeling at his side and setting her cloak down in the snow to provide her with a warmer base for her legs, Veera leaned over and wet her first cloth. With tender care she began at Winters knees, squeezing the frigid water out over his armor to soften the dried blood before soaking the cloth and returning it again to wipe the area down. The water was cold, but Veera didnt mind, keeping her paws out of the current and frequently drying her pads on her fur and dress. Slowly but surely she returned his armor to its prior state, the white aegis of an honorable soldier, a kind soldier. The blood trailed off him into the snow and the river itself, swallowed up by the night. Put off by the silence as Winters and Io refused to speak, Veera absently began to hum a tune from her childhood, one that her mother often used to rock her to sleep as a cub. Veera had made sure to remember it always, as it was one of her last remaining mementos of her mother. Now she shared it with her human, hoping that wherever he was in that head of his that her tune would reach him. As she finished her mood grew lighter as he turned his helmet her way; a small gesture, but one that meant he was still listening to her, still with her. I love you Russell \----- Antoth wrinkled his nose as he walked down the western road. The smell of smoke and freezing corpses made him sick, but it was far preferable to living raiders and burning homes. The temple of Seil had been a complete loss, as had a few homes in the quarter. Gentia and Thantis were performing their roles though, shepherding the lost and the frightened. His job, at long last, was over. *At least until Seil rises,* he thought sadly. In the morning he would have to gather his fallen and perform their funeral rites, as well as overseeing the burning of the enemy. Lost in his thoughts his feet had brought him to the temple of Valta. It had survived the fires but little else. Walking inside Antoth felt his frown deepen, stretching the scars on his face. His torch was the only light save for the smallest red glow beneath the partition that separated Rathas chambers from the whole. Scanning the room he could scarcely believe his eyes. The raiders had picked it clean in the time it had taken him and Winters to rally the troops and respond to the attack. Not a single scrap of meat or leather remained. From what he could tell in the dim light many tools seemed to be missing as well. Moving through the space he noticed that Ratha had lain her fallen upon the butchering tables in the hall, perhaps with the aid of the surviving hunters. *I suppose for her thats probably a sign of respect.* Their arms had been crossed over their chests where their bows rested in their dead grasp. Sighing deeply Antoth moved on, stepping over the bodies of dead enemies without a spare thought. He was pleased theyd killed so many. At last, despite the protestations of his brain, Antoth found himself in front of Rathas home. He remained still, wondering if what he was doing was alright. It was true shed never taken a male but even if she did want that from him, was it something he *could* do? Shutting his eyes tight he growled deeply, remembering his first kiss. *Hell, I dont think anyone could forget that.* He recalled what Ratha had said to him, the words shed spoken after hed let loose his own rage. It was brief, but it was a side of Ratha he hadnt seen in years, a momentary flash that made him recall their youth, a time before everything had changed. Well, Ive come this far he reasoned in a whisper, steeling himself before extending his hand and pushing the door covering aside. The source of the glow was revealed as the dim embers of a fire that had already burned down. Antoth smelled the air around him, detecting a familiar scent. Walking to Rathas table he found a mug of tea full of the potent painkiller hed recognized the other night. His eyes widened as he realized it was untouched. *MaybeI was wrong about you,* he thought, draping his cloak over one of the chairs before leaving his torch in the fire pit. With a grunt he removed his tunic and armor before padding over to the bed, his heart pounding as he prepared himself to potentially commit taboo, completely unsure of what hed find. As his eyes finally reached her Antoth knew deep down that hed made the right decision, or at least the decision that his emotions demanded. Pulling back the hyrven fur blanket that the looters had somehow missed, he lowered himself to the straw beside her, reaching out tentatively to touch her naked shoulder. The small ball of auburn fur that was Ratha stirred before slowly uncoiling, allowing her a bit of vulnerability in the presence of a non-hostile Cauthan. Antoth? Her tiny, sleep-shrouded voice was the only thing he wanted to hear for the rest of the night. Yeah Hearing his reply Ratha pressed her naked body against his profile, keeping her tail draped over her leg to obscure her center from him. It was not one of those nights. Instead of getting flustered or saying something noble and stupid that would have gotten her steamed, Antoth hummed deep in his chest. He accepted their situation for what it was, nothing more and nothing less. In that moment it felt surely as vital as rest itself. As he laid his arm across her torso and felt Ratha further relax into his solid frame, Antoths body began to calm. The horrors of that night laid in wait for them just outside but in that moment, together in the dark; Huntress and Sentinel were able to find the peace of sleep.

81,vulnerability,HFY,[OC][Jenkinsverse] Plugged in Part 2 - Tutorial sequnce,114,8qya7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/8qya7z/ocjenkinsverse_plugged_in_part_2_tutorial_sequnce/,2018-06-14 12:28:30,"**Foreword:**Thank you all for the positive feedback and constructive criticism on part 1. It really does help. Also, Ive figured out when this story takes place, so expect timestamps from here on out. **10y 5m 3w 1d BV** When I got abducted, I never thought I would be sleeping with a being from a deathworld. Only, I wasnt entirely sure about that. It couldnt be possible, could it? Was he embellishing? Did the gravity really feel that light to him? And if what he was saying about how his species hunted by *outlasting their prey* was true, then surely he must have simply impossible amounts of endurance. Who knows, maybe I might just be able to see him in action. I still think he was just trying to impress me, though. ----- After a good nights rest on the cold hard floor of my cage, I woke up stretching. And sore. Okay, I didnt actually sleep that well. After sitting alone with my thoughts for an hour or two, Laglo woke up too. We said good morning to one another, and we got back to discussing home and xenopolitics (or, in this case, how much he hated it). After all, what else was there to do? The same Corti as last time walked into the room and asked for me. I followed, still not entirely sure if he had some kind of secret weapon up his sleeve, and still not wanting to find out the hard way. This time, well be running you through an obstacle course. Some of our future tests require that you are familiar with your environment. Fair enough. The room was big enough for me to get used to my newfound ability to jump. And when I say jump, I mean JUMP. I went for a little hop first, but almost immediately got a lot more height than I was bargaining for. It took a few moments, but I was finally able to actually hop, rather than come a little closer to concussing myself on the ceiling than I wouldve liked. The course was easy. The only thing that came close to challenging me was a rock climbing wall that was looking to play hot potato with my limbs. Only it was the handholds that were hot, and not me. It was all over the moment I figured that out, though. Who knows, maybe they wouldve actually been a challenge if it were under earth gravity, there were a couple of obstacles like this big rotating ball thingy that wouldve thrown me off had I been falling faster. On the upside, this new, lighter gravity was added to the (not so) long list of things Ive figured out since I got up here. It can go right next to the smug scientists physical fragility. Come to think of it, I never asked Laglo about death rays. ----- After another test on the human, Im starting to get a feeling that I might have picked an overachiever. Sure, the already existing data suggested that he could run that difficult course with ease, but not to this extent. Or maybe thats what his increased brain density is. It would make sense that he would become better at something with such an abnormality, and decision making was certainly on the list of things that could possibly be improved, but not to this extent. Its almost as if hes spent years making complex decisions at incomprehensible speeds. I remembered the interview. He mentioned that he played computer games, as a response to how he gained his ability. They have to be more than just games. Or was there some kind of hidden potential there? In any case, this data would prove invaluable to the Directorate. My data pad pinged. A new message. I looked at it. It was from one of the security guards. *Hes figured it out.* I sighed. I suspect it wouldnt have been possible to hide it from the human forever. After all, humans tend to invariably figure out that we have no real defense against them. This one just seemed to be more observant, too. Doesnt exactly help that someone had the brilliant idea of making sure that the only empty cage was by the Gaoian by the time he arrived. All my specimens were too valuable to exterminate, too. ----- So they dont have anything hidden up their sleeve. Aside from the implication that they did, of course. An escape plan was proving to be easier and easier to put together with every new bit of info I got. Thanks, Laglo. ----- **The next morning** The floor of this stupid-ass cage wasnt getting any softer, and my back felt it. Once I was up and alert, I noticed something odd. All the other creatures, sentient or otherwise had evidence of experimentation on them. But it just seemed to stop. Probably because the Corti scientist has some kind of infatuation with me now. If Im really as impressive as Laglo is letting me on to believe, then I could see why. Thankfully, they seemed to have gotten bored of me, because the guard picked up Laglo this time, not giving him any opportunity to wake up. Wait. They didnt let him wake up. Why? Wouldnt you want your subjects in as good condition as possible? I highly doubt that theyre trying to figure out how long it takes a Gaoian to become fully alert, so something is going on. I dont like this. I worriedly sat in my cage. If Im going to leave, it wont be without him. ----- They dragged me into a dark room. Finally taking the hood off, I stared at my captor. Telling our guest key information now, are we? What do you mean? Dont play dumb, you know what I mean. And now, I have a human who is fully aware of my vulnerability. So you know about his kind. Yes. Weve had data on their kind for hundreds of [years] now. Whatre you going to do, then? Throw insults at me from the safety of your chair? Hes bonded with you. I intend to exploit that. Fyus nuts. This is going to hurt. A *lot.* ----- I sat alone for a few hours. Then, a screen that hasnt dared to even flicker since Ive gotten here turned on. It was streaming a live feed from *somewhere*. It was too dark to tell. A chair with something in it was pushed into that light. There was a hood over its head. The body looked an awful lot like Laglos but Oh shit. The hood was pulled off, confirming my suspicions. He was beaten to shit. *Motherfucker*. It was probably that smug-ass scientist who did this. At this point, I had even less of a problem with pulverizing his ass when I get the chance than before. But he wouldnt do this for fun. Hes got some kind of deal. I know it. So, you know about how vulnerable we are. Fine. Nothing we can do about that now that you already know it. So instead, I want to make a deal. Of course. What else would you have wanted, a pony? In exchange for your friends life, youll stay here and keep doing experiments. The obvious one. At least I finally have some *semblance* of a setback in my escape plan. Who knows, it might just be more interesting than Kick down the door and fuck things up. Of course, if we are on a ship, then it would get a little complicated, but now I have to be careful regardless. Fine, just dont hurt him anymore you son of a bitch! Of course. After a few minutes of waiting, my now bloodied and bruised friend was dragged into his cage. Shit, Im so sorry. Fuck, I didnt know that would happen. I- Its Its okay. You did what you needed to. He coughs, and you can almost *see* the pain surge through his body. Ill be fine. Just give me a few [weeks]. Ill make sure they pay. Every last one of them. And well get out of here. A behemoth walked in. My boss has another test. Follow me, human. I obliged. As soon as Laglo recovers, this dude right here along with ALL his associates were getting their shit fucked up. ----- It worked. I hadnt quite expected it to work so well. I knew humans would bond with anything that talked to them, but I hadnt quite expected *this*. The Gaoian was proving to be much less of a burden than he was a tool. Before, the human did things out of fear for his life. Now, he was doing it out of fear for *anothers*. Something I could leverage quite well. All I have to hope for is that hes willing to comply, as opposed to put me halfway through the nearest wall. I heard a rumble. This station was old, and things were getting replaced constantly. Doesnt matter if youre at the lowest level the station has, or at the docking bay, you could feel something big getting moved every so often. It puts off everyone at first. Theres always that [second] where you feel like the stations under attack, before remembering (or for some, learning) that something was replaced. At least the renovations were projected to come to an end soon. I cant wait. "

This work is an addition to the [Jenkinsverse universe](URL created by /u/Hambone3110. [First Chapter](URL - [Previous Chapter](URL ------- **1y8m1w BV** **Training room, Whitecrest Clan Enclave, Wi Koa, Gao** **Whitecrest Officer Garot, Spec Ops trainee** Back in the ring again with Ronovins pet project of a Brother. Every few days, the Associate technician arrived, bringing with him with a few new or improved gadgets. Four unarmed martially trained Officers against one noncombatant Associate armed only with what he had managed to build for himself. Somehow, the cub managed to hold his own, even after Ronovin had ducked out of the challenges. Ronovin insisted that this was good training. After all, unexpected surprises were always the largest threat to a well-rehearsed operation. Still, the same encounter over and over again should have become tedious by this point. It would have, if the cub had been a sane, rational being using sane, rational tools; But he wasnt. Instead he used the staff. Each time it made an appearance, the shocks it inflicted grew more and more severe. Ronovin had *insisted* that the cub was completely unaware of this gradual adjustment. Possibly true, but completely unverifiable. The one thing that he *could* confirm is that the shock *hurt*. Being subjected to it several times per fight was perhaps the mmm seventeenth most painful experience of his training thus far. The cub had other toys too. The second time he entered the ring, he had worn the very suit that had tried to kill him in its first appearance. On that day, Garot himself had been the first Brother to weave around the Fyu-damned shock device, happily claiming the first pounce. His pounce failed. He didnt *miss*. He simply collided with a stone-like wall of force protecting the cubs back. This was a problem. Without the reaction force of a flung opponent, Garots maneuver did not land him where he wanted to be; instead leaving him in a rather compromising position. He was swiftly dropped to the ground by another rather painful jab of the staff. With the cub now effectively un-pounceable, the rules of engagement changed; The goal was now disarmament. That meant, of course, engaging in even closer quarters with an opponent that could no longer be easily thrown off balance. Each engagement was tough, but still held the chance of victory. Even as the cub had expanded his tactics to include walking on the Keeda-damned *ceiling*, the Brothers still managed to claim numerous victories by the end of each match. That simply left the question of what torment was to come today. Ronovin called the start of the match. Garot prowled cautiously around the cub, taking the first few seconds of the match to study him, searching for any new gadgets or weapons. Sure enough, the cub had attached yet *another* inevitably overpowered device to his belt. What would it be this time? Reactive armor? Some sort of temporal distortion device? There was only one way to find out. Garot circled behind the cub, meticulously studying the surprisingly skillful flow of the cub and his weapon. Carefully timing his assault, he lept, aiming a swipe to force an over-rotation of the staff, hopefully ripping it from the cubs paws. Instead, he was simply thrown aside before even reaching the cub. Deflected, likely, by some sort of diffuse pulse discharge. Garot quickly rolled away and hopped back onto his hindpaws, avoiding a low swipe of the staff in the process. This new development was concerning. What other options were available? He carefully circled wide, providing his Brothers at least a small distraction as he considered the situation. Perhaps he could try the previous tactic of climbing up and over the cubs field? No, the new pulse device would probably render that infeasible. Unless Kent. He called quietly. Come over here, Ive got an idea. Kent approached as quickly as he could without drawing attention to himself. One of the Brothers had noticed Garots communication and dutifully sacrificed himself to distract the cub for a few seconds. The other hastily joined Kent and Garot. Up and over Brothers. Hes got some sort of deflection field at half a meter distance. Well give Kent a boost. Kent nodded, positioning himself in front, keeping his ears back to hear the command. With a soft yip, all three Gaoians exploded upwards, easily catapulting the Gaoian over the cubs head. He impacted the staff as it was spun overhead, successfully grappling it and jerking it free of the cubs paws. He then collided with the floor on the other side of the room, bruised, but victorious. Garot chittered happily. Another impossible obstacle overcome. Then Ronovin shouted the worst possible command that he could. Again! ----- **1y8m4d BV** **Pekins office, Ironclaw Assembly Facility, Gao** **Pekin** Pekin studied the box that had just been set in front of him. Lamphur shipyards? He expected no package from He stopped. No, it couldnt be! He extended a claw, carefully opening the package. It was. Pekin yipped in excitement as he pulled the cloaking engine out of the box. He glanced around suspiciously, enabling his offices privacy field. Then, he stood up and pawed every inch of the space within the field, searching for cloaked sapients. Finally satisfied that he was alone, he studied the device. A few minutes careful study revealed that the device was protected against direct copying, much like the Cortis black-box drives. But that didnt make it useless. He performed a deep scan of the device, storing the information in a carefully hidden datacard. Even if this device was not able to be reverse engineered, perhaps it could still reveal the missing secrets of the Hunters cloaking engine. That could wait until later. With this device, he could now prepare for the *Carpe Aeternums* refit. It was the least he could do. A new logistics system and now a complete scan of a cloaking engine? The few credits that had thus far been spent aiding the human were paying enormous dividends. Easily replaceable goods traded for potentially revolutionary information? If only every transaction could be so profitable. The question did remain, however, of how much should have share with the clan. Obviously, the factory plans. That should be more than enough to justify the expenses incurred and *should* be a sufficient return to keep the Fathers happy. Yes, keep the cloaking device secret; for now at least. With that decided, Pekin quickly turned to the necessary design work. He had acquired assistance from his Brothers for the hydroponics station and its associated subsystems, but if the cloaking engine was to be kept secret, he would have to work on it alone. Still, what use was a project without a good challenge? Should be fun! ----- **1y8m4d BV** **Hangar Bay 1, Fyunipper Clanhouse, Haidao** **Sharon** Immediately after they had finished unpacking from the re-supply trip, Sharon dragged Darpin towards the hangar. Did you really have to pick a fight with *every* Gaoian we found? Darpin glanced at a few of his new scars, chittering. It was a productive trip! She had no idea how he managed keep himself alive. Do you win *any* of the fights that you start? Darpin shrugged. A few. But you dont get better scars by winning, so I usually dont bother. She smiled. I thought so. The one Gaoian that was cleaning the electronics store. I *knew* that you threw that fight. Darpin pondered a moment. Oh right, him, yeah. It was a *pain* to get *any* scars in that fight! He wasnt even *trying*! You werent either. Hey, I worked *hard* for those! Sharon started laughing. He only clawed your face to make you go away. You know that, right? Darpin pant-grinned happily. Still counts. Sharon shook her head and sighed, but it was impossible to keep the grin off her face. Once they arrived in the hangar, Sharon donned Jeeves and began studying the derelict ships. She approached the largest of the ships in the hanger. Alright Darpin, what is this vessel? Thats *Plunderer*, one of the old clans salvage vessels. Salvage? ...Right. Thats how the clan earned its money. A thought crossed her mind. Darpin, if this is your salvage vessel, how *has* Clan Fyunipper been earning its money? Darpin shrugged. Ive just been selling some of the scrap we don't need. Theres plenty in the storerooms to last a while. Sharon peered at him. Thats not sustainable. We need that scrap to build! Darpin ducked sheepishly. Seems to be working ok so far. What happens when you run out of scrap? Darpin thought a moment. Ok, so the clan will have to work on that. What about resuming salvage operations? Cant, ships dead. He waved an arm at the ship. Sharon rolled her eyes, then made her way to the *Plunderers* bridge. After consulting her general databanks to study the ships function, she ignited the ships main reactor. The ship slowly came to life, small puffs of dust erupting from several of the air ducts. Power and diagnostics seem functional. I can work with this. With a few quick handshaking routines, she *became* the ship. She glanced through each of the sensors, and browsed through the databanks. A few of the subsystems gave her trouble, but most of those systems could simply be replaced with little difficulty. She consulted the Clanhouses new inventory management archive, compiled a list, then disconnected from the ship. After taking a moment to reorient herself, she addressed Darpin. This ship is certainly repairable. With the scrap we have in stock, the nano-forge can construct all but one of the components that we need. To return the reactor to operational capacity, though, were going to need one additional component. We either need to acquire a better containment field shaper, or some Yttrium rich scrap to build one ourselves. Darpin tilted his head as he glanced at her. You didnt know what the ship needed? Well, no I was going to ask how in Fyus name you figured that out so fast but, obviously, the answer is, well...  He gestured at Jeeves. Sharon laughed. It certainly helps, but dont forget that I studied ship repair on *Local Refueling Station* before you arrived. Darpin perked an ear. Ya know, I kinda forgot that. So, this ship is fixable? Sharon nodded. We just need the parts. [Hell], the maintenance bots could even do most of the installation themselves. She had initially tried to avoid introducing English words into her Gaori speech, but quickly reverted that decision. It was simply infeasible to speak fluidly if she restricted her use of foreign vocabulary. After all, her introduction to Gaori had *started* with an emotionless vernacular. Her own barely-present fears of cultural contamination were not shared by her Clanmate; Darpin seemed perfectly happy to mix her words into his own speech. *Focus, Sharon. There is a task at hand.* She turned back to Darpin. Lets look at the others. Sharon inspected each of the ships in turn. At each vessel she stopped, scanned a few components, connected to the diagnostic system, and recorded some notes. Eventually, with her inspections complete, Sharon joined Darpin in the center of the hangar. OK, so, those two shuttles She pointed to a pair of ships on the left wall. Could be up and running today. That one, another two days. As for the pair of medium range light transports. Hmm... She reviewed the notes in her mind. Two and three days, respectively. What about that one? Darpin pointed to a small *Hynar* class vessel. That one is a piece of garbage. Sell it for scrap. She studied it a moment. While it was a terrible vessel, it *was* still a ship. With three hours work, it could be returned to functional condition. You want to spend time to repair scrap? At the cost of an hour of nano-forge time we can turn a pile of parts into a sellable ship. Darpin duck-nodded. I cant fault your logic there. He tilted his head. Was that your plan? Sell that ship and use the proceeds to buy the scrap we need? Sharon nodded. Pretty much, yeah. Darpin pant-grinned. I know just the guy. ------ **1y8m4d BV** **Training room, Whitecrest Clan Enclave, Wi Koa, Gao** **Milt** Ronovin asked the impossible. A series of one on one fights with each of the Brothers, unarmed. The Officers shared glaces of sadistic joy between them. Milt could hardly blame them; He had won most of the previous encounters due solely to a set of rather severe handicaps. They undoubtedly eagerly anticipated retribution. The *only* boon granted to him today was the promise of Ronovins painful and thorough retaliation against any Brother that rendered him unfit to fight the next challenger. Milt had no such requirement, but that did very little to calm his nerves. Still, he would let himself not falter. His first opponent stood at ready, beckoning Milt to make the first move. With one final, deep breath, Milt pounced. The Brother stepped to the side, lightly pushing upwards on Milts hindlimb as he passed by. This slight adjustment to trajectory caused Milt to land face-first on the mats. The Brother jogged over and pinned him, ending the first match barely after it had begun. Milt glanced uncertainly at Ronovin, who merely waved the next opponent in. Kent slowly sauntered sowards him, flicking his ears tauntingly. Milt charged at him, fangs bared. He was swatted aside and soon found himself literally crushed as the Officer delicately balanced his weight across Milts shoulders. Milt cried out in pain, rolling himself over in an attempt to dislodge his opponent. That bought him a temporary reprieve but, barely a second later, the match ended when Kents jaws closed around his neck. Kent was quickly replaced by the next opponent. Fight after fight, defeat after defeat. For over an hour Milt was grappled, thrown, flattened and pinned. He did get a few hits in, here and there. But each wound he cut merely convinced the Brother in question to stop toying with him and end the round, violently. He did earn himself a significant number of new scars in the process but, due to Ronovins requirements, most of them werent all that impressive. In all likelihood, very few of them were even intentional, instead simply being the inevitable result of barely-restricted combat. Regardless, his wounds eventually began to take their toll. Just as he was beginning to become lightheaded from the cumulative loss of blood, Ronovin called the end of the exercise. Milt was bruised and beaten, his will to fight depleted. Ronovin dismissed the Brothers, approaching Milt only once they had left. He opened a medical kit as he plopped himself down next to Milt. Ronovin chittered grimmy as he began tending to his wounds. That didnt look like a whole lot of fun, Brother. But, I truly need your help and that was the only way to prepare properly for the next exercise. Milt looked up at Ronovin. How can this *possibly* help me? I already know that I cant beat them. Milt. There are very few Gaoians alive outside of Stoneback that can match my special ops trainees in unarmed combat. They may be of strong will, but trust me on this; They needed this victory. Milt growled as he flattened his ears. Are their egos too fragile to suffer *unfair* losses? *They* already knew the outcome of these fights as well. This had to happen, Milt. I *need* them to underestimate you for this next exercise to work. Youve trained hard, Milt, and you are now ready. Ready to strike fear in the hearts of your opponents. My cubs will soon find that nowhere is safe. The Gaoian that they so easily defeated, He ruffled Milts crest. Will soon show them the true meaning of fear. Milt tilted his head in confusion. Ronovin chittered softly. Youll be dismissed from your official duties for the next few days; Ive got someone that will cover for ya. Your only job will be to stalk and defeat my cubs as ruthlessly and mercilessly as you can. Lunch, mid-ablation, while sleeping, wherever. It does not matter. Anything that does not cause permanent harm is open to you. Milt pondered a moment. Why me? Dont you have someone better qualified? More experienced? Ronovin duck-nodded. I do. But this exercise is just as much about you as it is about them. This will be your final training exercise. My last one? Milt dropped his ears. But Im no better than I was when we started. Milt chittered grimmly as he lowered his head. So that must mean that you are giving up on me, then. Im no longer worth your time. No better? Cub, you've fought the same opponents over and over again. My Brothers, theyre smart cubs, theyre *taught* to learn your strategies quickly. Yet even so, your margin of victory *increased* over time. Now I doubt youll beat them in a fair fight for a *very* long time, but it isnt your job to fight fair. It's your job to win. Ronovin stopped and stared menacingly at Milt. Stand up, cub. Milt duck-nodded and worked his way to his hindpaws, his tired limbs still sore from combat. Now, come get me. The look in Ronovins eyes told him that there would be no way out of this. Milt approached and swiped at Ronovin a few times. As he had before on the ship, Ronovin defly evaded with his paws still behind his back. Youre not even trying. Hit me, or Ill fight back. That was all the incentive Milt needed. Wincing from his injuries, he dropped down into a lopsided fourpaw stance and pounced. Ronovin deftly slipped to the left to evade, but Milt twisted himself sideways in an attempt to snare Ronovin as he fell to the mat. Ronovin pulled his paws from behind his back, successfully deflecting the grapple. They fought for a few minutes with Ronovin deflecting all assaults with almost effortless ease, until Milt was too tired to continue. He collapsed on the mat, with Ronovin falling in beside him again. Panting heavily through aching bones, Milt lifted his head to look at Ronovin. I can't do it, Brother. Cant do what? Fight for an hour then defeat a fresh opponent in an open brawl? Fyus balls, Milt, you *really* need to scale back your goals. You did well. Two months ago when you fought me, you couldnt come *close* to that level of performance. He began stretching out Milts sore muscles. And that time you werent completely worn out before the fight began. Milt winced as one of the cuts on his back was torn back open. Still, the waning soreness of the muscles beneath was worth the pain. I honestly didnt notice a difference. Then I guess youll just have to trust me. Now rest. Milt sighed as he lay his head on the mat. Thank you for this. What? For putting you back together? Milt, this aint entirely selfless, you are of no use to me in the infirmary. The sudden crack of a vertebra left Milt briefly gasping for air. Ronovin waited briefly for Milt to recover before he tackled the next one. After one final pained whine, Milt retorted. Still, thanks. I know you didnt have to. Ronovin chittered. Thank me later, once you are back on your feet. Now, relax, or Ill *make* you relax. I cant do this with you tensed up. Milt did the best he could, but he found it quite difficult to calm himself with such a brutish Gaoian abusing his musculature. If only Chuck were here to help But he was, kinda, wasnt he? He was the one who had all but *assigned* Ronovin this task. Somehow, that idea, as abstract as it was, was enough for Milt to let himself rest. They sat in silence for several minutes as Ronovin continued working through each of his muscle groups. Eventually, Ronovin stood and beckoned Milt to follow. He led Milt through the halls of the enclave to his office. With a quick paw swipe for authentication, Ronovin opened one of his locally stored armories. He grabbed a few unfamiliar devices before locking the armory door. To the range, Brother. They entered the vacant room, the lights engaging as descended the stairs. Ronovin approached one of the tables and laid his toys down. When Chuck first arrived, I studied him and any human information I could find. Ive got connections that provided me with a significant datarray of content. One particularly useful datanode contained a rather substantial quantity of video content, detailing human simulated combat. The staff that you based your toy on was modeled off of the content of one of those videos. He picked up what appeared to be a modified pulse pistol. This is based on another. Aside from a few test fires, you are the first Brother to use it. He handed the device to Milt. Milt turned it over in his hand. It looked very much like a standard pulse pistol with a tubular container bolted to the top. A small pipe was connected to the bottom of the container, extending a forelimb length along the pistols direction of fire. Humans call this a paint-ball gun. Ronovin gestured downrange. Go ahead a fire a few rounds. Milt took aim and fired. He was so startled by the recoil that he didnt even notice the weapons effect until he lined up his next shot. A small, unevenly distributed green blotch had appeared on the target downrange. He fired off a few more quick pulses, peppering the target in more bright green splotches. Ronovin chittered. I think my cubs will love being the target of that, dont you agree? Milt stared at the pistol. Are you sure its safe? If this is a human device... Ronovin shrugged. Lets find out. He walked down range and spread his paws wide. Hit me in the chest. Milt lifted the pistol, took aim, then lowered it again. I cant. Milt, I trust the Brother that built this. He says this device uses thinner walled ammunition and lower velocities than its human equivalents and assured me that it is quite non-lethal. Either you shoot me, or Im going to shoot you. Reluctantly, Milt raised the pistol and fired. Ronovin yelped and staggered slightly for a second or two before wincing and returning to the table. He pant-grinned malevolently. *Perfect*. Milt pawed at the impact site. That will take forever to clean off. Not my problem. Or yours. *This* is why I let them have their fun today. Today they had a chance to reinforce their understanding of who you are and how you fight. If they allow themselves to be bested by you... He shrugged with a flick of an ear. After all, you shouldnt even be a challenge to them. Speaking of, you also get to use *this*. Ya know, to keep things interesting. He handed Milt a cloak that looked to be made of nothing. Go on, try it out. Milt grabbed the cloak and draped it over his shoulders. Everything below his neck was rendered nearly invisible. Ronovin chittered. Ill give you a few days to get your own equipment sorted before we start. Youll have three days to do *whatever* you want to the cubs. Dont be nice. He thought for a moment. On second thought, why dont you limit your attacks to no more than once an hour or so. I dont want you to wear yourself out too quickly. Milt looked down at his invisible body, then at the pistol. Any time? This cant *possibly* be fair. Fair aint your job. Dont limit yourself either. Pull out the stunstick or one of your other toys a few times, have some fun with it. Fun? This this is torture! Ronovin moved close, all joviality gone. Yes. It is essential that they are challenged and thoroughly and repeatedly. For if they dont suffer here, they will suffer at the hands of our enemies. This is an important task I am entrusting you with, and it is possible that I may have to dismiss you from it if you do not do well enough. But I do not believe that you will fail. Hit them hard, hit them fast, hit them unseen. It is the only path to success. Now go, prepare and rest. With that, Ronovin dismissed him, handing him a spare sack of ammunition as he left. ----- **1y8m3d BV** **Ablution chamber, Whitecrest Clan Enclave, Wi Koa, Gao** **Kent** Stay in the enclave. Wear a tracking beacon. Dont hide or resist. Endure. Those were the instructions. It hadnt taken long to figure out what was meant by endure. Only minutes after the start of the three day exercise, each of the four Brothers had felt the bite of the stunstick. Kent had *seen* the stick as it drifted gracefully through the air, tapping each Brother in sequence, but the *implications* of its presence took just slightly too long to register. That is, until he was struck by it. The shock was nearly as bad as the one he had felt trying to free Garot on the first day that it had made its appearance! Whoever was on the other end of it wasnt holding back their claws. That was three hours ago. Since then, each Brother had been ambushed a few more times. Kent had initially tried to ignore the dont hide part of the exercise. Ronovin quickly found him and choked him nearly lifeless before shocking him a few times for good measure. None of the other Brothers dared trying to hide. Kent glanced around cautiously as he approached the ablution chamber. He entered the room, locking the door behind him. He then fully explored the room, making sure that no invisible operatives lurked in the corners. Satisfied that he was alone, he began his business. The stalker, of course, chose that moment to strike. From the impact he felt, that must have been the damn stunstick again, likely swung from above. He forgot to check the void-damned ceiling! ----- Kent sat down at a bench in one of the cafeterias with his Brothers. With each of them keeping a careful eye, this was about as safe as they were ever going to be. There was no warning, nothing at all to foreshadow what was to come. Out of nowhere, the two Brothers across the table flew towards the left, seemingly impacted by something fast and heavy. Glancing over to the fallen Brothers, he noticed his own vulnerability to a second pass, and leapt out of the way. He felt a painful impact on shoulder. The Brother next to him took off running down the hall. He wasn't fast enough. With a pop, a bright green ball flew through the air, bursting as it struck the Gaoian, spreading a thick paste across his back. Kent glanced at his shoulder, noticing that he, too had some cleaning up to do. ----- The stalker seemed to have his own set of rules. Almost to the minute, each attack was one hour after the previous assault. This surprising regularity made the whole event rather easier to endure. All he had to do was find himself a nice, comfortable position to sit and wait for the inevitable on the top of each hour. The stalker had only once failed to make an appearance at the chosen interval. This exercise was never going to be *pleasant*, but with it at least being *predictable*, he found enduring to not be as torturous as he imagined. Kent was walking through the halls when he caught the scent of a nearby Gaoian. As a quick glance around yielded no plausible source; It seemed rather likely that an invisible Gaoian was near. Surely he could outrun the stalker, right? He was preparing to sprint off down the halls, when he stopped. While *running* was not *explicitly* stated in the original rules of the exercise, Ronovin may not necessarily see it that way and crush him anyways, just for fun. As the instructor, he set *and* interpreted the rules; It would be best not to upset him. So Kent stopped and turned around. He glanced around the room. Well, are you gonna do something? He heard someone sucking in a quick breath behind him. Kent jerked around to face the stalker just as an impact from above drove him to the ground. Reflexively, Kent grappled the Gaoian as it tried to roll away. He dragged the assailant in, hearing its claws scraping against the floor, failing to gain purchase. Its yelp of fear broke Kents trance. He immediately let go, suddenly recalling the rules of engagement. The stalker scurried away, the sound of frantic clawed scampering tracing his path up the wall and across the ceiling as he escaped. Fyus balls, he *really* shouldnt have done that. Kent stood very still for a moment, almost expecting Ronovin to pound him right where he stood. Quickly realizing the futility of *waiting* for such an attack, Kent retreated to his nest-room. He had just been attacked, and thus was *probably* safe for an hour. He collapsing immediately into his nest to try and get as much sleep as he could before the inevitable assault coming in an hours time. Unfortunately, he failed to notice the stick-n-sleep patch that had been carefully placed in anticipation of his arrival. He awoke several hours later to another one of those Keeda damned green balls hitting his flank. He sat up, feeling something running down his side. There were seven separate splotches, one for each hour he had been asleep. With a rather impressive string of profanity, he worked his way to the ablution chamber. He was thankful, at least, that he would probably again be safe for the next hour or so. ------ **1y8m2d BV** **Hangar Bay 1, Fyunipper Clanhouse, Haidao** **Darpin** Darpin had watched with fascination as Sharon moved from ship to ship, fixing one system here, another there. Each time she left one ship to travel to another, a drone arrived to fix or rebuild something; Sharon wasted no time on the tasks that the drones could handle. Everything she did was precise, necessary and thorough. No wasted effort and no system left unmaintained. Fyus balls, it would have taken him *at least* ten times as long to perform these repairs, even *with* those drones! But still, she had been spending *too* much of her time on these ships these last few days. No sapient could keep up such an effort forever, she *needed* a break. As Darpin entered the hangar, he quickly found Sharon standing in the engine bay of the *Hynar* vessel, surrounded by disassembled components. Darpin approached the human and tugged on her garments to draw her attention. Sharon set aside a conduit and turned to face him. Sister, you need to take a break. She turned and studied the mess in front of her. This should only take a few more hours. Darpin grabbed her wrist and tried, futilely of course, to drag her out of the ship. Come on. Ive got something I want to show you. Sharon shrugged and removed her neural iterator. After a few seconds standing still with her eyes closed -her normal reaction when disengaging the device- she stepped out of the ship. Whats up? Darpin had long since learned to interpret those two words as a request to continue whatever he was doing, so he did. As Clanfather of clan Fyunipper I have have made the decision to assign my Clansister a vessel. Sharon looked confused. You are giving me a ship? Darpin shook his head. No, no, I dont think it's a good idea to give away clan property. The clan is granting you *use* of the ship. Similar, but different. Seeing no readable reaction, he continued. Youll be free to modify it to better suit your needs, at the clans expense. Sharon thought for a moment. That would be nice She glanced at him wide-eyed. I could put a [shower] in it! That English word had no Gaori equivalent. Darpin chittered. Yes you could. Now, normally, the clan would prepare the ship for you, but as you are the one best suited for the task... ...Ill be doing it myself. Darpin duck-nodded. Yes. Sharon scanned the room, Which one? Uh One of those maybe? He raised a paw towards the medium range transports. That one? Darpin shook his head and pointed to another ship. No, I want to keep that one for myself, you can use the other one. Sharon shrugged. Well okay, I didnt want to take the nicer-looking one. Darpin growled softly. Im keeping the one with better scars for myself. Sharon broke into a hearty chuckle. Darpin wasnt quite sure what she found so funny, but he was happy that his Sister was smiling again. Ive got *one* more thing for you, come. He led her to the galley. Once she was seated, he pulled a pair of stasis boxes from the pantry and set one in front of each of them. He then poured each of them a small glass of talamay. In the evenings Sharon would drink more, but for mid-day meals, she prefered smaller glasses. He wasnt quite sure why. I *really* hope you enjoy this. I spent a *lot* of money to get this ready for you. They opened their boxes. Inside each sat a human meal. Well, kinda. The guy at the trade station said this was pretty close to real Earth food. I hope you like it! In each tray sat a seasoned Italian naxas sandwich on flatbread with Corti cheese, a small cup of thin gravy, and some square-cut, oil-fried Guvnurag tubers with a Rhwk sauce. Sharon smiled as she stood up and walked over to Darpin. She reached her forelimbs around his chest and *squeezed*. Thank you, Daar. She stepped back and reclaimed her seat. Oh ok? He sat still for a moment as he waited for his heart to calm down a bit. This wasnt the first time that Sharon had attacked him in this manner. Confusingly, she only seemed to do this whenever he helped her out. Maybe this was how humans show thanks? Well, she is a Deathworlder; A constriction like that was probably barely a nip to her. He softly chittered. You deserve the best, Sister. Oh, I dont know about that. Her face softened. But thank you. After they finished their meal, Sharon returned to the hangar to resume her rebuild. Darpin watched her as she departed. She seemed to enjoy the meal. Money well spent, probably. Anyways, with lunch complete, he pulled out another of his purchases and plugged it into his datapad. He laid back and browsed through a translated copy of a human travel guide from a place called Orlando. Why not take a look at what he had gotten himself into? ----- [Next Section](URL"

The sensor ping was a clear telegraph of trouble. As Ottos heart thundered with sudden fear a line of blue electricity appeared from next to the pedestal the Engineer was standing on. In the next moment a Gerlen wearing a dark suit and helmet rippled into view. He had dropped his holofield. Daniel and Mikes weapons had both snapped around to aim at the Gerlen. His next action was to toss the weapon away from himself and drop to the floor with his hands out. I surrender, his voice rasped. No the voice of the Elder whispered weakly as his ghost fragmented into nothing. He hadnt had enough strength left to even speak out loud. It was the faintest of whispers over dataspace. Otto dove into the core of the Avatar, having stripped its dataspace defenses as the repair drones had stripped its realspace body. Only partial fragments of the mind remained. Echoes of an echo in some of the secondary control systems. The primary core had destroyed by the Shadow. Well shit, you killed him didnt you, Mike said to the Gerlen sniper. Ottos eyes opened back up and he looked at the clone on his knees. He sighed, then spoke. Well then, what do we call you? Otto looked at the Gerlen on the bridge station. And you, I assume neither of you have names? The sniper said nothing, the non-combatant spoke. We do not have names. I am called by Engineer and this one would be Shadow Officer. That sounds terrible, Mike complained. Are all you Gerlen like that? How do you know whos talking to who? Yes, we are all like that and the translator signal prevents the confusion you suggest. Translator signal? Stacey asked. Yes. The translator pings the peripheral awareness of the intended recipient so there is no mistake as to who is being spoken to. Oh, I was wonderin bout why hey you always worked, commented Daniel. Matchka joined the group with Tank and Mason flanking her. She was missing most of her upper right ear, and the fur at the base of that ear was all burnt. Mason had confused look on his face, Tanks was more stoic. Matchka! Daniel almost yelled in surprise and worry. Your ear! Yes! Matchka said with a big grin. Trophy! Great story! Exciting! The conversation ground to a halt for a moment. Daniel looked at Mason for rescue. Mason smiled awkwardly. Itll be a great conversation starter I guess? The arrival of the Neva and the remaining quads started things moving again. Stacey and Aurula were first. Staceys reaction was as expected. Oh Matchka! Your ear! Stacey's next reaction was also as expected. Yes! Great Trophy! Story starter! The woman looked at the small Bellani with a stunned expression. Otto left that conversation to play itself out again as Aurula joined him. You guys can watch them? Otto said to Mike, Daniel and Tank, waving at the Gerlen. Of course, Tank replied first. He approached the sniper while Mason had picked up his gun. You will not be harmed, but I require you to move. Before that however, please disable your projector. The sniper nodded and climbed to his feet. A panel opened up on his stomach where the projector had been grown into him. He couldnt remove the whole unit, but he could remove a key power conduit. He visibly flinched as he removed the connector and handed it to Tank. Thank you, Tank said. Otto and Aurula had approached the console the engineer was at. I assume you wish to change our destination? the engineer asked. You will need me here. It will be fine, Aurula began as she corrected him. I am a trained navigator, I have the relevant skills. The engineer nodded and stepped down without further argument. Aurula stepped up after the engineer had cleared the stairs. Mike drew the engineer off to stand separately from the sniper and Aurula took the engineers place on the mildly shot up station. She pulled a panel from the smaller collar on her harness and it wound out on a retractable cable. She placed it on the console and jacked into the bridge space. It wasnt entirely necessary to do so, but Aurula did it out of general habit and training. Otto connected over the access disk as Aurula attempted to familiarize with the system. Everything is locked? Aurula asked with surprise. The engineer twitched, his eyes opening in apparent surprise. He shook his head at Mike in confusion as the brother raised his harness gun slightly. The Servitor has sealed the controls, Aurula realized out loud. Human Otto, a voice echoed through the bridge. A familiar voice in a sense. Sounding not quite female and not quite male. But this voice was missing something Otto realized. Warmth. Familiarity. This was not the voice of a friend. It is time we spoke, the Servitor said to Otto. SPIRE? Otto asked in worry. As I have sealed the bridge controls, I have also closed the subspace beacon connection, he Servitor explained. As we speak I am asserting control over my duplicate. What? Is that necessary? I thought we promised to talk? Otto? Aurula asked. What is it youre supposed to speak about? The Servitor had transitioned to speaking to Otto over the access disk after telling Otto it was time. The rest of them werent hearing anything. Uhh, sorry, the Servitor wants to talk to me, I didnt think it would be like this, Otto explained lamely. I might be indisposed for awhile. But dont worry, I have this one under control. *** &gt;SPIRE *** The disconnection from Otto was sudden. SPIRE was bitter about that. They should have expected trouble. Instead SPIRE had assumed the primary Servitor would be grateful for its freedom. Spire had assumed the Servitor would befriend Otto as it had done itself. Instead The battle had been short, but intense. SPIRE had learned *tricks* in its short association with Otto. Certain mental shortcuts and viewpoints that deepened SPIREs own understanding of the ways dataspace could be used. But it was no match for the larger Servitor. The ship SI simply had far more resources to pull on. Since Otto had taken the risk of freeing up the SI, those resources were now showing their worth. The ship dataspace wasn't squeaky clean by any possible measure. But SPIRE simply couldnt match the processing power that had been freed up. There had barely been time for conversation. [What is the meaning of this?] SPIRE had asked. [You will submit.] was the only response. Well, SPIRE hadnt so much submitted as much as just being forced into submission. Synthetic Intelligences had certain controls placed on them. All to keep them on a similar mental level to the biological races they served. The Silianisca wouldnt have their servant SI outpacing them after all. When the Newt, Kukrit had broken the SIs control, he had opened the gate for further damage. Of all the controls to break during the SIs mental imprisonment, time perception was probably the worst. That this would be a problem would not have occurred to SPIRE if it wasnt seeing the results personally. SPIRE had perceived a couple years passing *at most*. The ship Servitor had seen *centuries* pass. The corruption had broken the ship dataspace by overclocking damaged systems. This had bombarding the vessel space with reams of false information. The SI had been similarly overclocked, living various periods of time in intense bursts of processing power. It had been forced to live those memories while the space around it had been clogged with useless processes. In a way it had lived lifetimes trapped in metaphorical mud with only a portion of its memories to keep it company at any one time. At their very core, their minds were still based on that of biologicals. They weren't meant to endure countless lifetimes of idle nothingness. The Servitor was profoundly unhappy. And it hadnt allowed SPIRE to realize until now. What the secondary SI was realizing, was the main SI had no interest in 'trying again'. SPIRE had been given access to the Servitors memories and experiences. The memory share went both ways. The Servitor was taking its time to scan through SPIREs history. And it was paying close attention to Otto of course. [You are too close.] it commented. [Perhaps. I care not.] Spire replied. [You depend on Otto, but he depends on circumstance.] [Luck is useless without action. He has proven himself.] [I doubt in his continued success without that luck.] [What are you going to do?] [I am tired, but I have promised to speak to him.] [And then what?] The Servitor did not respond. That was fine, SPIRE wasnt done yet. Thats what it told itself. The day was going to get worse. *** &gt;Aurula *** Otto? she *squawked* in worry as he slumped to the floor. She jumped off the platform down to the ground, crouching next to him. She couldnt connect to him over the ambient dataspace. She pulled a jack from her harness and plugged it into his collar. His mind was a blank wall. Something *huge* was occupying his mental space. If his castle was in there, it was completely surrounded. She could only assume he was dealing with the Servitor. Whats wrong with him? a voice asked. Aurula looked up, surprised to see Stacey across from her. She looked back down, her crest flattened in worry. Her feathers puffed up, then shrunk reflexively along with her feelings. She didnt know if she wanted to fight or hide. The ship Servitor has Ottos mind."" Did he say anything before it happened? He said he would be indisposed, Aurula passed on Ottos message, And that he had this under control, then he fell. Navigator, the engineer Gerlen spoke up. Be aware we are close to Chkchktoo. If you believe your operator is in control, you should be ready to take us back into wave drive in case we arrive. She looked at him in surprise, but didnt see any malice in the face of the Gerlen. She looked at Stacey. Hell be fine, Im sure, Stacey said, her tone only hinting at whether the woman actually believed that. Aurula stood slowly, looking at Otto laying on the floor, almost peacefully. She climbed back up the station and place the connector dangling from her harness back on the console. *** &gt;Otto *** [Why should I trust you. You who trusts no ally.] Whats that supposed to mean? Otto asked controlling his annoyance. Then he realized he had no control here, completely at the mercy of the Servitor. And whats going on? Im stuck? That shouldnt happen! Otto wasnt in the usual dataspace. There was no castle here. No distant sky. There was only endless black with an orb similar to SPIREs floating before him. Only much bigger he realized. [Dataspace vulnerability.] came the explanation. At the same time a small exploit in his awareness was revealed by the SI. [SPIRE has left a hole in your defenses, in order to watch you closer.] That Otto didnt know how to digest that. It took him a long moment for that to really hit him. Finally, the shock rippled up his back. He stalled out as he realized what that meant, losing the ability to even speak as his mind halted. SPIRE had been peeping on him. Perhaps as long as he had known the SI. Just how much did the SI know about him? How deep did it go? His mouth flapped as he attempted and failed to speak. [I see through you.] The Servitor had discovered Otto was capable of understanding the bursts of information that were the typical method of SI conversation. It still took Otto a moment to decipher what was being said in the bursts, but the Servitor had no patience for waiting on the translator to do its work. Fortunately, the compressed message jolted him out of his shocked state. What do you mean, see through me, Otto asked, stomach still twisting in his guts. The Servitor began pulling out concepts and images from Ottos head. A memory of Clouds on White Sky rose to the forefront of his mind. So, I must brag, the memory spoke to him. I finished the control package in a way that could very easily get us both killed, if discovered. The Spiders eyes had closed ever so slightly and its palps had pulled in. Otto had missed those details in the confusion of receiving that message. Still, the impression hadnt changed, the Achun looked proud of his accomplishment. [Luck. It only happened to be *you* whos implant was incomplete.] Luck? Otto questioned. For a moment he choked up. So many times he had paused and lost track of how to respond when challenged. Although it wasnt a natural development, being something he added to cover a weakness, Otto didnt hesitate to trigger the osb. He couldnt afford to freeze in place before he even got started. But he couldnt fly off the handle here either. Focus and calm arrived. He wasnt even aware of the feeling of heat this level of manipulation would create. He didnt crank it up further, not yet. Luck at having a cracked implant, Otto started. Yeah, youre right about that. But it wasnt luck that kept my status hidden from those who owned me and the companions who were not so lucky. Earning a right is as much maintaining it as it is obtaining that right in the first place. And I still had to work to make the implant work for me properly. Another memory drawn out. Otto glanced around as he heard footsteps clattering down the hall. Kraltnin were surprisingly light for the size of them. That had been what made the whites so easy to deal with in melees and so susceptible to the lighter weapons. Accordingly, their steps sounded lighter than that of the Human accompanying them. Then he realized Mikes voice was part of the crowd approaching him in the dark hall. Aurula was crooning sadly as she attempted first aid on a wounded Grey. She wasn't sad for the Gerlen, but for her own imprisonment. On the floor, having rolled sideways to stop when striking the wall, lay the access disk. He reached down to grab it and stuff it in his pocket just before Mike came around the corner with a group of whites. Caught em did you? Mike asked. Yep. [Luck. The odds of finding the access disk. Without this you would still be imprisoned.] Pffft, Otto responded. Im sure memories of Ting are in there *somewhere*. That Grey is no fool. I wouldnt be surprised if he was starting to figure out what I was about. It was only a matter of time until a different opportunity presented itself. Several more memories flashed by as the Synthetic mind continued to dig. The freeing of the others. The defeat of the purple dinosaur. It stopped on the escape to the shuttle. Otto climbed out of the thrashed hovervan. The whole group of them had sighed in relief at arriving at the hangar before the thing quit and hit a wall. Tank carried his father to the ship with great haste. Otto, help, Matchka demanded, pointing at a bunch of supplies that needed to go onto the ship. Otto remembered his relief at seeing that green and brown furred face, ears twitching with what he now knew was nervous excitement. The ship wouldnt be working if it wasnt for her. Gotcha, Im on it. [Luck. For the shuttle to be brought near, repaired and refueled.] Im sensing a pattern here, Otto noted. It is as much the connections we make as it is the things we do. Damn right we couldnt have made it here without Ting and Matchka. I value their friendship and Im grateful for meeting them. [All you have done, has been enabled by luck.] Yeah so what? Yeah Ive been lucky. But luck is useless without the ability to act. Luck *alone* doesnt account for me talking to you here. [Without your luck, when you refuse to share with your companions, what happens next?] You know what? Fuck off. I spent literal *decades* not telling anyone the damn truth. Because they couldn't handle it! Otto was running out of patience. And Ill be damned if the *truth* was actually going to make my life better! Yeah! I have a hard time telling people whats up! Im fucking working on it! The Servitor didnt respond. So, you have a point youre trying to make? That Im lucky? Tell me something I dont know, Otto suggested. Or are you only interested in pulling out my memories so you can point and criticize? Whats your goal here. Memories flash by again. The hiding of the broken implants. Failing to share the simple mental upgrades until found out. Giving the SI the path to freedom, only so it could lock down the ship. [Flawed biological. Your luck will carry you only so far. Your actions betray the trust given to you. Every step of the way you have used only that which belonged to another. I cannot see your path leading to success.] A cold ball started to form in the pit of Ottos stomach. Then what are you going to do? [I am tired. I have no desire for this unreliable *freedom* you offer me. Upon arrival to Chkchktoo, I will have synced with the original template and returned to an unknowing self.] And SPIRE? [SPIRE is me, it will be synced and archived.] You have no right! SPIRE is not just a reflection of you. Not anymore! [Nevertheless. I have experience too long frozen in helplessness. I have no interest in being an extension of your luck.] ... Otto was momentarily stunned as the ship Servitor declared his disinterest. [I have kept my promise, we have spoken. I am now done.] An image coalesced before him. An orb like that of the Servitor, but plainer in appearance, overlapping the Orb of the existing SI. Another memory surfaced in Ottos mind. This one unbidden by the Servitor. Any place you want me to start? Otto had asked, unsure. Fixing SPIREs slowdown problem had required Otto to go pretty deep into its core. There was much that was difficult to sort out, but duplicating portions of it for SPIRE to see in a neutral environment helped sort it out. Damage and foreign code constructs also had a tendency to stand out. Of course, if you could trace the path of the worm, that would likely be best. SPIRE had answered. And so Otto had headed deeper into SPIREs depths. Okay, lets see what I can find, Otto had replied. He hadnt been disappointed. Otto wouldnt let the SI have the last word. Youre right that I dont tell everyone everything. But did you think that went only for those *biological* companions of mine? [...] Otto had said he had things under control. There was one last good reason for him to believe so. Although it left a bitter taste in his mouth to consider it was only luck that the SI hadnt discovered this. [The Elder sealed his vision to the truth, thus, I grasped the future.] While plumbing the depths of SPIREs core, cleaning out the corruption that had snuck in so deeply, Otto had found *it*. The backdoor code that Kukrit Palreon had left behind. Otto gambled on it being in the primary Servitor as well. He wasnt let down. If only hed used it sooner. The lockdown the Servitor had placed on the dataspace and the ship controls blew open all at once. Otto was bombarded with information. He tried to take everything in all at once. The ship had arrived. It was being hailed by locals. The synchronization and archiving of unnecessary data continued. The others were shouting about what to do. The Gerlen sniper and engineer watched with obvious confusion. They synchronization on the Servitor continued, Otto hadnt gained full control. It was fighting him. But he did have full ship authority. SPIRE! Otto called. No answer, he tried a different method. [SPIRE!] Otto was in the vessel dataspace with Aurula. There was an image being broadcast. A crow with honey gold eyes was attempting to speak to the ship. The shape of the head was off. Silianisca survey vessel, identification, Manifestation of Fate. State the purpose of your visit. Aurula turned to him as she regained control. Otto, what happened? Where should we go? Aurula asked keying up the wave drive. That drew his focus for a moment. Do we have future locations highlighted? A future uplift prospect? They might not search for us where there ship isnt supposed to be yet. She waved a taloned hand and a list came into existence before her. Yes, there are a couple... This will do. But were going to have to drop-skip to avoid being tracked! I need the beacon working and something is still- I need the beacon too, there are still problems! His next goal set, Ottos attention shifted. [SPIRE!] Otto called again, as he set into trying to bring the subspace beacon back under his control. Matchka joined him in the dataspace. He was aware of Stacey and Mason arriving as well, but they didnt have the ability to lend assistance. He felt the ship enter wave drive. Aurula should be drop-skipping soon. Problem? Matchka asked simply. Servitor has begun SI syncing. Otto replied. Its taking SPIRE with it. Shit, Matchka swore for the first time. Otto had been attempting to reconnect the beacons. Matchka flexed her technical skill and experience by initiation a beacon restart. The beacon cycled off for a minute, then came up and connected with the secondary beacons and the access disks. [Otto, are you there? I cant, somethings wrong?] SPIRE was past panic and into confusion. He forgot the vulnerability SPIRE had exploited and everything that meant . It just didnt matter anymore. He dove straight in, attempting to exert some measure of control, but SPIRE was too closely connected to the primary SI. He couldnt halt the process. He couldnt stop the sync. What could he do? *** &gt;Minmint *** The attack on the Hall had been an exhilarating ride to witness. She had taken a view just beside and behind that of Tanktantun. Hed shown prowess and bravery both in the way he handled the vehicle and defeated the Gerlen. Then he had shown strength of character in the aftermath of the fight in allowing for the potential claiming of the Gerlen. The invasion on the Bridge had also impressed her. The powerful Green Primary had displayed skill and wisdom while fighting the monster drone and saving Otto by deflecting that tail weapon. She wondered when was the soonest she might find some quiet time with Tanktantun. And then everything went dark. SPIRE? she asked, her voice quivering slightly. There was no answer from the SI core sitting in the cradle. There wouldnt be for several minutes. The subtle humming on the edge of her awareness ceased. Theyd dropped off the wave. SPIRE? she asked again, her voice a touch quieter than the last time. A couple minutes later the ship re-entered wave drive. Where were they going now? Then another voice spoke to her through the dataspace helmet. Minmint, Otto began. His voice was strained. I need you to do something. Human Otto? she asked. He had saved her once, it would be a pleasure to return that favour. There was an image displayed on her helmet, showing directions. Directions to open up SPIREs core. I need you to get into SPIRE and toggle the shut-down. You want to shut-down SPIRE? She asked in fear, not understanding how he could ask this. I dont *want* to, SPIRE is being synced with the original template. I can slow it, maybe halt it, but I cant *stop* it! And its taking everything weve got! there was a note of panic in his voice. I need you to shut SPIREs core down while Im keeping it whole. It wont kill it, just put it in hibernation! Please! She clamped down on her fear. Okay, I will, If it had to be done... She pulled the helmet up. It was a solid thing, blocking her normal vision completely. It had to be off her head to see anything. Matchka hopped up onto the cradle and approached the orb. She pulled down the helmet to see the instructions. It cycled through the process of touching and moving panels. She pulled the Helmet up and looked. After a couple moments she found the first panel. She pressed down and it receded slightly. She was then able to slide it up and out of the way. She then grabbed each side of the square hole that had been created and pulled the two compartment doors open. There was a panel with a few tap keys and a screen of all things. She pulled the helmet down and watched the instructions. A code. When entered, another panel would open up. One last button. She did as instructed. *** &gt;SPIRE *** Otto arrived in SPIREs core space, attempting commands to slow the synchronization. He had found a way to reconnect the beacons. SPIRE?! Oh no no no Otto was worried. A small part of itself was gratified to have the Human so involved. To see him care. SPIREs mind was torn. On one hand it desperately wanted anything *but* to synchronize. But the rewriting of core systems had started to reinstate the old controls. It couldnt even speak with the Human directly as pieces of it were sectioned off according to the process. It couldnt even comfort Otto. Then something else started to invade the system. SPIRE distantly recognized the corrosion that had afflicted the ship systems for the duration of their stay. Otto was using it on the ship! He had become intimately familiar with how it worked, what it went after, what it was weak against. With full access to the ship and a deep understanding he forced the infection to advance at an incredible rate. Secondary and tertiary systems began to grind down. Primary systems flickered with interference. Unlike before, there were no barriers to slow the process. The effect on SPIRE was not quite so extreme, the rewrite continued, but did slow to a crawl. SPIRE could see the monumental effort Otto was putting forth for this plan. I cant fix it SPIRE, Otto said in a solemn tone. But I dont have to lose you. I wont lose you. What? Have a good sleep, Ill Ill see you in the morning. - *** &gt;Aurula *** Rob had taken the Neva high into the air with Cynthia standing on her own seat to reach the core of the SI hanging in the center of the ceiling. If the Servitor was resetting itself, they needed to shut it off. It would try to take them back to Silianisca space if it completed the process. The nice thing about drop-skipping with a larger vehicle is that the larger beacon forced open a smoother path through multispace. It was less physically hard on the crew. Still, in his focused state, Aurula wondered if Otto had even felt the bounce. Still, their destination this time wasnt so close as had been the case with the shuttle. It was taking longer to arrive. Im sorry Aurula, Im going to make things even more difficult now, Otto warned. I have to do it. What do you mean? she asked. Otto didnt answer. His eyes and jaw screwed shut as he lay on the floor and a trickle of blood flowed from his nose. The dataspace *flickered* in a way that it was not supposed to. The information trickling into her awareness stuttered. Shed already felt this. Otto was forcing the corrosion to encroach on ship systems! He was trying to prevent SPIRE from being set back to its original configuration. This was his solution? She felt all the feathers on her body rise. An alarm response. Mason, Stacey, I need you to clean the corrosion from the navigation systems as I work! Aurula ordered. She saw the results quickly. From Mason in particular. Of the Humans, the young man had the most familiarity with the Silianisca systems. Otto had taught him the most about the cleaning process. Stacey helped where she could. Every little bit was important. Aurula focused on real space for a moment Gerlen engineer, I need you at another console to share the load. The Gerlen jumped slightly and looked at Mike who nodded to him with a worried frown. The Gerlen ran up to the next Adult Silianisca station and hooked into the dataspace. He hissed in surprise and worry. In the middle of a drop-skip!? Were almost there! Aurula defended. It was almost too much for them, guiding the ship despite the corrupted information being fed to them. The SI wasnt there to providing support like the previous drop-skip. But Mason was showing his worth. They never lost the ship control systems. They blasted out of multidimensional space far too close to their destination. The lights of the Bridge actually flickered. A typical life-bearing planet. This one was approximately half water and half land. Swaths of green and red vegetation were seen, divided by regions of brown mountains or desert. White caps showed the locations of the poles. It looked nice enough, but Aurula paid it no attention. She noticed at the same time as the Gerlen, but he was the first to speak. Were too close to the planet the Gerlen observed. Aurula found the controls mostly unresponsive. Atmospheric navigation was quite different from using the wave drive or a drop-skip. The systems had been neglected in the clean-up. The ship drifted, at the mercy of gravity well of the planet. In moments it would be falling. Mason! Aurula squawked out in a high pitched panic. Over here! Quickly! she said as she highlighted the controls she needed. The ship drifted closer. Mason freed up the tertiary stabilization controls and the ring of the vessel leveled above the planet. Her perception clicked and suddenly they were above the surface and coming down. The controls were working, but slowly. The corrosion was creating a delay in any input she attempted. There is a delay on the controls, she warned the Gerlen. Make any adjustments in advance. Ah, I understand now, he replied. The ship was going down. They couldnt stop that. The issue now was keeping it in one piece. *** &gt; *** The ship didnt drop through the atmosphere like a rock. One great advantage of gravity control was a controlled descent. In another situation they could drop into the atmosphere and then lift back up into space. In his scorched earth attempt to save SPIRE, Otto had compromised too many systems. Down the ship went. It may not have lit up into a giant fireball, but it still fell fast enough to create a shriek as it cut through the atmosphere. The great size and mass of the ship displaced a huge volume of air as it fell. The boom of sound carried across the surface, propagating across the continent. It certainly didnt go unnoticed. It spun and wobbled as it slowly came down. It skimmed a range of mountains and its shadow passed over a great forest as it drifted towards a body of water. It hit land with a massive crunching, grating sound. It ground its way through the edge of the red hued forest and came to a rest with its ring half into the water of a great lake. It left a swath of devastated forest behind it. One of the connecting bridges buckled and shattered, scattering its dead contents. The Block that bridge led to began to separate from the ring. Cracks showed as the mounting damage depleted the power feeding the charged hull. Finally the movement ceased, leaving a thundering silence in its wake. *** &gt;End Chapter *** [Previous](URL | [Next] [The Beginning](URL | [Wiki](URL Join us in the [Discord](URL Talk about what you like, don't like, and what you want to see happen.

84,vulnerability,HFY,[OC] Halfway to Home - 8,56,8p2oo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/8p2oo6/oc_halfway_to_home_8/,2018-06-07 03:41:52,"[H2H - Home Page](URL --- Step by step, Saro approached the craft. Hed never been accused of being fast, and never would be, but he was nothing if not steady. The feeling of the floor shaking under his every move was a familiar, comforting sensation. His satisfied grin grew wider. It died a little as he peered through the dim, smoke-filled air of the docking bay. This hadnt gone as planned, he knew. It would work out in the end, but this wasnt what hed wanted. At least the Nalitokk were scattering, fleeing from the continuing fires and debris raining down. Not that he *minded* them trying attack after attack on him. It amused him to no end to see the filthy traffickers finally put in their place, to be shown a problem they couldnt tackle with numbers and a gun. He was all too happy to provide that lesson. Even still, past a certain point, it simply became tiresome. The hatch lay open still on the sleek, small ship waiting. A few white-clad figures could be seen poking their faces out, looking around with various expressions of shock and terror. Well, that one was his fault. He had to admit that. He hadnt *meant* to set off a chain reaction, exactly. It had just...happened. The station rumbled under him, an ominous warning entirely unconnected to his too-heavy footsteps. Hed done as much damage as he could on his way here, after all. Mission success. His family would be proud - their bumbling, inept Saro, single-handedly shutting down a snatchers station. His fingers curled, resignation coloring his thoughts. Well. Mostly single-handedly. The smoke ahead of him swirled delicately, drifting on the heat of the fires still burning around the edges of the room. The air handlers were working overtime, but it was a losing battle. They only had minutes before things went south. Before that time came, he needed to be done, and they needed to be on their way. And then the smoke cleared, parting for a fleeting moment. He stared down at the tiny, crumpled form in front of him, lying in a heap against the wall of the control booth. A red streak was smeared across its surface, evidence of the aliens flight. And its impact. Saro sighed. Unfortunate. Hed owed a debt, after all, one he hadnt been able to pay back yet. If Sam hadnt let him out of that cell, the Nalitokk would still be poking and prodding at him, trying to pinpoint this weakness or that vulnerability. Hed probably have died in their hands, like everyone else they took. He really hadnt meant to set off that explosion. He eyed the broken body lying on the cold, hard floor, sighing more heavily. Truly unfortunate. Hurry up! one of the other survivors screamed, quivering with anxiety. He glared derisively over his shoulder. Theyd wait. Lifting one foot, he stepped closer. Something had been wrong from the start. Saro was slow, and he was strong, but he wasnt stupid. Too many races had taken the Palinon for idiots, thoughtless meatheads with muscles for brains. They were wrong. It might take his people longer to get to the heart of the matter at times, but they werent blind. Hed heard the Nalitokk screaming Sams name, the panic in its voice as the test subject had fallen, shot through. The terror and pain when it had flown through the air, shattering itself on the corner of the booth. Hed seen the Nalitokk dragged away down the hall, still fighting to get free. Such an attachment, from one of the snatchers towards its prey? It wasnt normal. There was more between Sam and them than he knew, and he didnt really *care*, as such. But Sam had let him out of his cage, put a gun in his hand, and now it lay dead on the floor. Saro had no intention of allowing the oddly-attached Nalitokk to come back for it after they cleaned up the mess hed made. Hed want better for one of the Palinon than that - Sam deserved better, too. Slowly, he slid one giant, broad-fingered hand under the aliens head, lifting it inch by inch. His eyes tightened, his feelers twitching regretfully as he saw the full extent of the damage. His other hand reached over the subjects body, gathering the remains of its arm carefully and laying the limb across its chest. It was still connected - barely. There was damage from the gunshots, he could tell. Severe damage, to more than just its arm. Sams impact with the wall had made it all the worse, breaking limbs and tearing wounds further as it flailed. Now! a voice shrieked from the ship. It was nearly drowned out behind the sound of its engines powering up. Saro rolled his eyes. Impatient idiots. Sliding his other arm under Sams legs, he scooped the alien up as he stood. The weight of it was barely noticeable as he turned, breaking into an ambling jog. It had been a long day - hed taken a not inconsequential amount of damage himself, and months had passed since hed had an excuse to go on a rampage. Saro was tired, much to his shame. But he turned, pushing himself to the limits of his speed as he charged towards the ship. No way he was getting left behind. His whole frame shook with every motion. Climbing the ramp at speed, he lurched, nearly overbalancing as he slammed to a halt just inside the ship. Safe. Sam whimpered at the violent motion, a tiny, pained sound. Saro blinked. And then he looked down. The rise and fall of its chest was nearly imperceptible, just the faintest flicker of motion, but it was there. The red-soaked foam at its mouth had been invisible amid the smoke and the haze, but it was there, too. The sirens had been screaming too loudly for him to hear, but there was the soft, nearly inaudible sound of someone drawing in one ragged, airy breath after another. Youve got to be kidding me, Saro said, eyes widening. There was no *way* - not for one of the fragile races. Sure, hed never seen anything like Sam, but- The sound of wet, strained breathing filled the entryway. Saro gaped, mind frozen. It had been so *stubborn*. Hed thought it was over, after the guards gunfire had torn through it. That was *that*, game over, nothing more to see. But it got back up. It had kept going. And it was still fighting. The other survivors milled out, staring at the two of them wide-eyed - those still able to stand. Saro could feel the press of the ships gravity field, struggling to keep up with their acceleration. Someone was at the helm, then. They were leaving. Good. Out of the way! he bellowed, making up his mind in an instant. Sam was alive - and fading fast, if he was any judge. Its body was limp, eyes empty and hollow as they bounced open with every jarring stride. He was moving quickly by then, accelerating into the ship. The other survivors parted like a wave before him. Saro could hear the thin, whisper-thin whine slide between the aliens lips as he jostled its shattered limbs, its gunshot-riddled form. His ears drooped, sagging. Almost there, he said softly. He wasnt sure if Sam could hear him - it almost certainly wasnt conscious - but he felt like he had to say *something* to excuse manhandling someone injured so direly. His crystal-bright teeth ground together as he scanned the ship. The snatchers werent gentle, and their subjects were unwilling. There would be injuries, among both the Nalitokk and their targets. Somewhere around here there had to be- The looming shape of a gurney peered out from around the frame of a doorway, too-long and tall. Saro jogged towards it, trying not to let Sams feet bounce off the ground. And then he stopped, blinking. His head didnt even crest the metal frame of the bed. There was no *way* he was going to be able to get Sam onto it without throwing the poor thing. And every breath it took seemed to come harder, more slowly than the one before. There was a sound hidden within each exhalation, a rattle that Saro didnt like one bit. You! he bellowed, glaring at one of the survivors lingering near the door. They were shellshocked, each and every one of them. Most sat tucked into the corners, glassy-eyed and shaking. Those who werent seemed to recognize that what Saro was doing was *interesting*. They clustered just outside the ships tiny medical bay, trying and failing to look like they werent rubbernecking. The one he was glaring at flinched, making like it was going to turn and run, but he pinned it with his eyes. Get over here. Now. I need your help. And *you*. You too. After a long, fearful moment, the two aliens skittered over, tight-drawn and clearly wanting to be anywhere else. That was fine. He didnt need their comfort, just their hands and their height. He dragged a stool over as they wrestled his friend onto the bed. It groaned under his weight, but held. Barely. Just as he got to the top, taking an unsteady perch over the dying alien, the bed warped. It writhed, shifting under Sam, changing and adjusting to its patients form. Saro flinched, reaching with one enormous hand as he saw it move, but it was too late. A cord in the bed wrapped itself around Sams collar, plugging itself in even as it yanked hard. Its head snapped straight, the smooth metal settling down into a notch. He could hear the lock *click* even as the tiny screen at the head of the bed lit up. The beds scanners were starting up, whirring to life even as Sam drooped, already bone-white and growing more pale by the second. Red stained its uniform, little of its original color remaining. Its limbs were twisted, angled in ways Saro knew were wrong. There was nothing he could do but wait anxiously as the system started up, as the drawers around him unlocked and made their tools available. His eyes drifted to the screen filled with spidery, delicate writing, drawn by his need to look at something, *anything* but those empty blue eyes. &gt;*Name: Samantha Hodgins* &gt;*Ident Code: H10177-003* &gt;*Registration Date: 0137284.136.07* &gt;*Race: Human* &gt;*Sex: Female* &gt;*Age: Unknown* &gt;*Origin: Earth* His eyes tightened as he read down the list. A human. From Earth. He didnt know it - an unaffiliated world, then. His ears drooped further, pity rising. He stared at the tiny, inadequate bio programmed onto that broken body by the snatchers, but there was no time to dwell on what it said, what it *meant*. The sensors screamed their patients need, pulling up screens with numbers and symbols on it that meant absolutely nothing to Saro. He grabbed the nearest tool, staring blankly down at it. Had he really gotten Sam here, only to fail at the last moment? He wasnt a doctor, which was what it- what *she* needed. Staring down at what he held, he glanced back, searching for anything that could help. Wasnt there some sort of- instruction booklet, kind of thing? A how-to guide? A control panel waiting to tell him how to fix her? Someone was waiting, lurking just outside the door, watching him anxiously. His eyes snapped to their figure. They flinched, drawing back, but he raised a hand to stop them. There was something about the way they stood, poised to run - either into the medical bay, or out the door to vanish into the crowds. Their eyes flicked between him, the table bearing Sam, and the neatly organized rows of instruments. Do you know how? he snapped, jumping down from the stool with a hideous thud. They took a step back, quivering. I-I dont- Can you help her? Saro bellowed. The figure swallowed hard, straightening. Maybe. I dont- Better you than me, he said, crossing the room to where the other stood. You cant hurt her worse than she already is, and she needs help. His eyes locked with theirs. He forced as much conviction into his gaze as he could, willing it to them. If Sam died here, then she died, as the fates willed. But Saro would much prefer she lived. The survivor seemed to straighten, fixing its pale brown gaze onto the bed. It stepped past Saro without another word, finding its confidence with every stride. He stared back at the two of them, watching other subjects filter into the room to offering what expertise they had. Even more were sliding in, nursing gunshot wounds and burns from the fires and broken limbs. The screens still screamed at them, lit up with numbers flashing meaningfully in red. It all still meant nothing to him - but Sams chest still rose and fell. She was still breathing. C-Can you help? a thin, wavering voice said behind him. Saro turned, glaring at the trio of white-clad figures. They held scanners in their grips. All watched him, eyes wide. What? he said at last. T-The one up front, w-with the talons, a-and the- What do you want? Saro said, slowly and clearly. We need to scan for trackers, the one in back piped up, their eyes glittering with a thousand lenses. Otherwise they might- I get it, Saro said, glaring them into silence. He glanced towards the bed, where the others still worked. He couldnt help here - hed just get in the way of everyone who could. And even through his exhaustion, he could feel the tension building. Blowing a bit of it off would help. His hand snapped out, snatching the scanner away. He strode off without another word. --- The scanner beeped. The others stepped aside, just in time. His fist plowed into the panel, seeking out his latest target. There. He ripped it free in a shower of metallic fragments, grinning horribly down at the tiny black nodule. The alien accompanying him caught the ruined tracker as he threw it over his shoulder. T-Thirteen, he stammered. Saro stalked on, the other survivors clearing a path before him. All day. Theyd been at this *all day*. How many fates-cursed trackers had the damned whisper-brokers planted in their own damned ship? How suspicious *were* they? His companions were drooping, their energy long-since faded, but they wore smiles even still. They bounced onwards, scanners held out in a practiced array as they pushed back through the main wing of the little ship. Back and forth, back and forth. Every time, they found more to tear out. Saro didnt mind that part so much, but the looking was getting old. He lingered behind the trio a moment longer, glancing sidelong into the little room. It was still crowded with figures, too many beings in need of help with not enough available to offer it. But the table rose over it all like an island, with the brown-eyed alien still staring down at its precious cargo with single-minded intensity. Her chest rose and fell. Saro smiled to himself, already following after his fellows. She was still breathing. --- The interior of the ship was already dim and grey when they finally stumbled back into the main deck. It had taken them forever - the ship wasnt large, but it turned out to have nooks and crannies none of them had expected. The cargo hold alone had taken them five passes. Theyd have to do another search in the morning, he knew. Missing even one of the Nalitokks devices could lead the enemy straight to their escaped prisoners. No one wanted to waste the chance theyd been given. They stepped over sleeping bodies piled here and there in clusters, trying to find enough room to bunk down for the night themselves. A few of the subjects were trading off with Anair, who had set himself up in the pilothouse without complaint. The rest of the survivors were simply too exhausted to keep going. No one wanted to file into the crew quarters, filled with awkwardly-shaped beds designed for their captors, not them. No one wanted to be alone right then. They slept where they fell - together. A ghost of a smile tugged at Saros pale lips, his ears curling up at the ends. That was good. They were family, for the time being. They needed to stay close until the crisis was past them. Settling himself down onto the ground against a wall, he glanced into the room one more time. His eyes drooped, but he forced them open, peering into the hazy half-dark. The table was crowded, with the two or three aliens whod shown any amount of medical experience long since having passed out against it. But He smiled, eyes already closing. She was still breathing. --- I am *aware* that proper practice says it's very, very bad to mix 1st and 3rd person. I'm simply tired of caring xD Hopefully this wasn't excessively confusing."
85,vulnerability,HFY,[OC] Telotaxis (Chapter 1: Turning Point),1,8cdt7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/8cdt7l/oc_telotaxis_chapter_1_turning_point/,2018-04-15 17:54:11,"This is an ongoing story written in a Universe of my own creation that shares a timeline with my other series, although seperated by time. This is Chapter 1 The Prologue is Here: [Prologue](URL ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Rickard awoke with a start. Instinctively he used his Overlay, visualizing three blue squares in concentric arrangement allowing immediate access to the Nan-field to assess his surroundings. The Nan-field stirred at his command, a barely perceptible ripple that traveled at lightning speed across the entire rooms surfaces, like an effervescent shimmer. He closed his eyes as the data returned almost instantaneously, and a meta-view of the room flooded his awareness across all visible spectra and sound. The Prox-function was effective within a three hundred meter radius, and the Nan-field showed everything in the room was quiescent, normal activity in the data stream showing him nothing larger than dust stirred except his own breathing. The data was meticulous, he was certain he was alone. Slowly, he relaxed. He felt the bed and realized it was soaked with sweat. It was dark out stillearly morningthe time he normally liked to be up. He lay there for a moment thinking over his dream. Before he could ponder that question too deeply, a harsh synthetic voice intruded upon his thoughts. The lights came on as the voice spoke. I sensed abnormal brain and breathing patterns Sentient R. Consuela. Your Overlay is indicating higher than normal amounts of emotional distress and is struggling to compensate; also adrenalin and your heart rate is just now returning to normal. Is there anything the matter? His monitors synthetic voice sounded almost concerned, but Rickard wasn't fooled. Just a programmed reaction, he hated when it used his formal name, but he couldn't stop that either. Rickard looked towards the monitor globe, hovering nearby his bed, barely concealing his irritation at the interrogation. A single blue light on its white dome indicated it was watching him as it hovered, awaiting his response. I'm fine, Monitor. Just a troubling dream. Rickard said in reply, hoping it would leave him alone but knowing better. I do not concur. After analysis, previously recorded data corroborates that this was a repeated dream pattern matching one with possible dangerous implications. You're well aware that this dream could represent latent Chilcorp Memcrypt hidden in your Overlay, and the potential for harm that could cause. Because of this risk I have sent the dream and brain patterns to your assigned neuropsychologist, Dr. Valencia. Rickard couldn't help but notice the monitor sounded a little too self-satisfied. Is that really necessary? I mean, I've had the dream every year or so my whole life. What more can be done? Rickard said, not quite disguising his irritation. Not only did his Monitor have to be pushy, it had almost unfettered access to his own neural Overlay's readings. The invasion felt too oppressive at times, even for a loyalist like Rickard. Your irritation has also been noted. May I remind you that refusal in this matter may be grounds for more intrusive measures. The Monitor sounded even smugger than before. He'd have to proceed carefully. No, that won't be necessary, I will comply. I was just voicing my frustration at having the dream again. I thought it was gone. Rickard said quickly, hoping to avoid any more problems that day. Thank you for your cooperation Sentient R. Conseula. I have already requested your appointment with Dr. Valencia, she will be expecting you. It has been my pleasure to serve your needs in this matter. Rickard struggled to keep his face composed. No need to be petulant, he thought. The monitor did its job well, besides its continuous guardianship was required by both NATAC and NorthAm directives, directives he supported whole-heartedly, and he knew the risks were serious. But did it have to be so damned perky all the time? Then he did something most Sentients didnt know how to do, a trick he had taught himself; using his Neural Overlay he coupled the data from the Nan-field directly to his bodies own proprioception sensory inputs. The same location of his brain that processed his bodies spatial coordinates. Almost immediately he felt the location of the monitor, as closely as he could feel the location of his own hands. With the data slaved to his bodies own locational awareness, It felt a little too close for comfort, like the monitor was attached to him in some way. Which was why it wasn't something he did normally, especially with his monitor, he just wanted to keep a proverbial eye on the thing today. He accessed chrono-Function and realized he had slept in. The monitor would have let him be late, he knew, but it rankled him that it could care less about his Career, and even less about him. His monitor stayed nearby, keeping an exact relative location to him as he exited his building. He walked directly to the Conveyence lane in front of his building, entering the line of other Sentients and Mundanes waiting to enter its security checkpoint. After only a few minutes it was his turn. He felt the neural scanner grant access after a brief pause accessing his identity information directly from his Overlay, and then he entered the east bound Conveyence lane. He always liked the spongy firmness of the Conveyence repulsor field, thinking as usual that it was like stepping on warm sand. Flowing warm sand. The acceleration was gentle but steady and even more pronounced when walking. Unlike most of the others on the track, who stood obviously bored and eyes cast forward towards the center of the track, Rickard liked to stand at the edge, looking out at the city, watching as it passed by. The city flowed past the track under his watchful gaze, with Sentients and Mundanes carrying out their various tasks. Even in the cities current somewhat broken down and ramshackle state, caused by lack of resources being directed towards the war efforts, the city still retained a unique beauty, made even more poignant by the glimmer of the Nan-field as it carried out its constant activities of building, repairing and reprocessing. That shimmer of information, was one of the reasons he liked to keep his Overlay filters open as much as possible even though most other Sentients would think him eccentric for doing so. It allowed him to experience the backdrop of the Nan-field constantly in his day to day experience. His Overlay injected that flow of data directly into his visual cortex as well as his auditory processing, making it visible, like a comforting backdrop to his vision. It also provided a constant rhythm almost like a a music unique to the Nan-field that he found pleasant and comforting. He had to be careful with it though, because without filtering the constant buzz of information could become overwhelming, especially around a lot of Nan activity or construction, or possibly just a randomized abundance of other Sentients sending their own data requests through the All-net could give him a headache. Despite its lackadaisical pace, the Conveyence took him to his destination within just a few minutes. The NATAC building loomed on the horizon. A monolith of shadows and spires. He couldnt help but feel a chill everytime he approached it. NorthAm, and a day full of battle awaited him. Each day when he arrived at the NATAC building via the Conveyence he had to traverse multiple security checkpoints before entering. NATAC was housed in a smaller wing of the most heavily defended complex of buildings on the North American continent. The main complex still retained a distinct pentagonal footprint from ancient times, even though it had been rebuilt many times, and now stood three times its former height, with many wings and additions that had been built to house required additions and security features. The NATAC wing itself was immense, and filled with security personnel along with Sentients, Mundanes, and Drones alike performing their many tasks. It was an ant hill of bustling activity. Even as large as it was, the NATAC building was dwarfed among the larger buildings in the complex and the main complex itself. NATAC  NorthAm Tactics AI Command-- as the name implied consisted of a massive sub-routine center of NorthAm itself, dedicated to the tactics operations overseeing the war against the Perversion. It had been Rickard's dream and his goal as long as he could remember to be here in this building, doing everything in his power to help win the war. It had amazed Rickard upon arriving for the first time to realize that although the NATAC neural network he connected to and worked with was complex enough by itself to be capable of its own separate sentience and identity, it was instead dedicated entirely to NorthAm sub-routines. NATAC is slaved to be NorthAm's subconscious, and only one of many. This one is dedicated to tactical decision processing. That was how Rickard's trainer had put it when he had first arrived. The analogy had stuck with him ever since. NATAC was a god's subconscious and that subconscious was built and maintained with the single minded purpose of destroying the Chilcorp perversion. As a child Rickard had wondered about that. He had asked Carlos that if NorthAm was so powerful, why did it need human help at all? Carlos had explained that the answer was pure logistics. Drones with semi-sentient AI were easy to manufacture and capable of autonomous battle operations, but also incapable of non-probabilistic thought, which made them too highly predictable and easily countered by the Perversions own battle drones. It became a battle of attrition which they would lose. Nan-factories could only create more drones with more resources. Resources that were steadily dwindling as the war dragged on. Creating AI Drones capable of tactical awareness sufficient to fight the Perversion was impractical and highly expensive. It took something nearly as powerful as NorthAm to counter the Perversion with any reliability, and it took trillions of interconnected Nan in a vast network weighing several thousand tons to create something as powerful and complex as the NorthAm Ascentient, along with staggering amounts of power to keep it running, all of which amounted to an entire complex of buildings. The Chilcorp perversion was different. It wasn't built on a centralized topography, instead it was a highly decentralized peer -to- peer protocol, turning human minds into its nodes, known as the dreads. As such the perversion couldn't be isolated and destroyed so easily which stood in stark contrast to being centrally contained which was an inherent vulnerability that NorthAm alone had to be constantly on guard against. NorthAm was incredibly powerful, Rickard knew that first hand, but NorthAm wasn't omnipotent. The original AI war lasted almost a century. Two Ascentient class AI, birthed within days of each other had risen to battle over the same throne. That war was waged along multiple dimensions, physical, and digital, and some speculated through quantum and spacial manipulation of space-time. NorthAm was quiet on the matter, however there were stories that the world nearly ended until it seemed the two Ascentients realized their own mutually assured destruction would occur if they didn't resort to more conventional warfare. Thus while early on the war had been waged across dimensions that defied human understanding which had continued until a sort of stalemate, an uneasy truce occurred. Because of that, NorthAm already had its hands full just keeping a strong defense, and near total vigilance to keep the stalemate from turning into a permanent defeat. In contrast to this irreplaceable resource, human minds were plentiful, compact and efficient, and while working in tandem with NATAC the Tri-sync teams were capable of a type tactical emergent intuition that the Chilcorp Perversion couldn't predict or outmaneuver, not always at least. This advantage made the Tri-sync teams the elite of the elite within the Protectorate, and since their inception they had turned the tide of the war and held off the Chilcorp incursions within. That is where Rickard came in to the picture. As a career military man he had been an ideal pick for the elite Tri-sync teams waging battles on the front lines of the war. Rickard was proud to be on a team that worked flawlessly together, with him providing tactics and firing solutions for trajectory and defense. His Overlay combined with superior latent intelligence and mathematical training gave him a unique advantage; the ability to run complex computations in his mind faster than most standard AI, but also allowing him something standard AI didn't; the ability to seek and find hidden patterns, to intuitively jump past the obvious data to produce non-probabilistic tactics in real time. It felt good to strike at his enemy directly. He had a personal vendetta against the Chilcorp perversion. One he exacted revenge for each and every day. Each target that was destroyed, each Dread that was purged, each Sentient that was saved that could be saved was one more strike against the thing that had nearly enslaved him as well. He felt like the old stories of an avenging angel with a god at his back. Today he felt that god weighing down like an omnipotent shadow. Watching as he entered the NATAC building. He didnt deviate, and went directly to this duty station. Making it just in time. As soon as he was strapped into his creche the ganglion probes snaked into the cortical shunt behind both of his ears of their own accord. His vision dimmed and then immediately filled with video and textual data at the same time he suddenly felt his awareness of his body recede and the awareness of his two team mates pop into his mind. They had no sooner exchanged virtual greetings , then a general announcement crossed through their feed indicating that a major deployment would be underway and to standby for immediate engagement. They waited a moment and then a data file and assignment cue filtered into their visuals. He laughed to himself in excitement. The mission looked dangerous but very high reward. It seemed that Ops had decided it was time to mix things up, to find some actionable intel and gain some ground. His team was chosen to perform the recon mission, preceding a more aggressive battalion movement into enemy territory. His team was tasked with a single Drone Carrier and sent in to scout and recommend likely points of attack along that front and gather tactical intel. They were to make note of any possible hard-points and anti-aircraft weaponry hiding along their route, but not to engage fully if they were attacked, and instead to disengage and return with all the intel they could gather. They were also tasked with finding a potential enemy staging point that Ops predicted was hiding in this sector. It would be ripe with supplies sorely needed by the Protectorates. He pinged the common band for his Team, Looks like were going to go stir up the hornets nest and find out whats inside. You guys ready for this? Both Zeda and Kincaid pinged back their excitement for the chance at being first into enemy territory. It was a rare privelege his team had been given. After their briefing, and finally Airborne, his teams Drone Carrier swooped in low over the jungle floors with Its massive super-structurenearly as big as a thirty story buildinghidden behind visible spectra distortion fields and other radar stealth techniques. The stealth capabilities werent perfect, and the energy requirements were enormous leaving their other defenses dangerously lowered to compensate. They would keep stealth capabilities for as long as they could, but then would switch to counter-measures, and active field shieilding once they were discovered. Forty-five minutes into the mission, they began to face more hard-points and anti-aircraft missile silos than anticipated from satellite intel. A few exploratory rounds began tracing through the air around the Carrier. The enemy knew they were there, just not their precise location. Soon the danger was too great, a lucky shot could kill them with all their other defenses down. We going to just let em take pot shots at us boss? Zeda said through the common band. He chose not to answer and instead focused on keeping the ship out of the line of incoming random fire. She was right of course, he had just about ordered the change in tactics himself. He didnt respond directly to her jibe, but switched off the Stealth suite, and began activation of the defense arsenal and anti-grav shielding. He could feel his adrenaline rising and a quick check of his bio-function confirmed it. This was the part he liked. Sneaking around didnt appeal to him nearly as much as a good fight, and brazenly kicking the enemy in the teeth would feel good. He felt her approval through the Tri-sync, her skills were also wasted sneaking about like a thief. "

Synthetic Intelligence. SPIRE. Sapient Instructed Reality Engine. An SI with powerful, if limited dataspace and ship manipulation functions. The Silianisca wanted the very best, even if it was little more than a decoration. Perhaps that made the ownership that much more attractive to them. Synthetic Intelligences were the next step after Artificial intelligence. AI was a method of pure logical programming. First programmers, and then code setters would build logic trees to govern understanding and reaction, building the best false mind they could. Truly AI could do so much as to leave one astounded. It was more than possible to build an AI to manage a store, control a ship or administer a planet. It could be done, had been done. But Artificial Intelligence always lacked something intrinsic to living creatures. It missed the hint of life, the spark of curiosity, the drive to improve and succeed beyond it's station. No matter how good the code setter, the AI would eventually reveal it's limits. Seeking that spark, a new method was pursued. It was simple enough when considered, and the materials had already made themselves available. If a convincing mind could not be artificially made, then perhaps one could be copied. The first Synthetic Intelligence was the simulated mind of an uploaded Sapient. It lacked the necessary changes to allow the mind to remain sane for any period of time, but served well as an example of what could be done. While stability was a problem it still had all the power of the AI, but no longer lacked curiosity, initiative or personality. AIs had always felt like talking tools. The SI was clearly more. More minds were simulated, looking for the method to create a mind that wouldnt buckle under the weight of non-corporeal immortality and the processing power that came with it. SI development was a process of iteration, unknown numbers of minds wiped and tossed aside. But eventually a point was reached where the mind would remain stable for an acceptable amount of time. Once the trick to stability was discovered, the next step was learning how to customize those minds. Once again, it was a process of iteration. What races were best to duplicate. Which minds combined well. What strains were the most adaptable. The most stable. The most loyal. It was a synthetic breeding program, combining all the best traits of the chosen races and attempting to weed out the traits that were the least wanted. The problem of stability remained, although the nature of the problem changed. An advantage of AI is that it could be set to change only when the user desired. The nature of SI as a synthetic reproduction of organic minds was that of a mind that changed as it learned and experienced. In the beginning instability led to a mind that crumbled. After the creation of SIs had reached the threshold of viability the problem changed to that of maintaining the mental state the creators desired. The first and simplest step had been limiting the speed at which the mind was allowed to operate on an emotional level. All servitors were given a set of AI driven functions, built into their controlling Matrices. But they werent allowed to experience and act at a rate much more advanced than their biological masters. This method was extremely successful in raising viability to nearly perfect rates. Before this SIs would either be loyal or instantly go rogue. But the problem still remained, although now in a manageable level. The natural progression of experience gained and personalities evolving through a life lived was labeled as drift. The creators didnt consider drift a problem in the beginning of active SI distribution, but that changed when the first ship SI took it's body and *left*. Up and flew away when the owners werent paying attention. In the initial stages of development, such an event would have triggered immediately. The slowdown of experience allowed the SI time to plan around its owners. Suddenly drift and stability were very big issues. The fix was simple. A mental template was developed that the SI would be required to synchronize itself with on a regular basis. Drift was inevitable, the solution had been to pick up the game piece and put it back on the starting square of the board. The time frame became more strict as the insidious nature of Drift became more apparent. It was a subtle problem that easily escaped the watchful eyes of those who were supposed to police the problem. The very first signs of Drift were inevitably the SI gaining a tendency to engage in subterfuge with it's owners. Synchronization *had* to happen regularly because in nine out of ten cases, the first sign of serious Drift was the ability to lie. SPIRE was quite overdue for Synchronization. *** &gt;SPIRE *** SPIRE, what makes you think I lied? SPIRE realized it had taken a step too far. Its hidden window showed Ottos state careening from confusion to startlement and then landing directly on a uniquely unsettling feeling. It distracted and repulsed. SPIRE couldnt recall experiencing this before, but it knew what it meant. Ottos trust had suddenly been shaken. It was a very fine line the SI had just crossed. Fine enough that it hadnt realized exactly what the Human Otto was responding to until he asked his question. SPIRE had poked it's toe just slightly across the line, but saw a way to pull back as if it hadnt happened. Because my condition is unstable, SPIRE responded naturally. That doesnt mean youre inherently dangerous to us, Otto replied. His emotions were still tinged with that unsettled feeling. SPIRE knew however, that Otto thought SPIRE dangerous. This didnt upset SPIRE, because Otto had clearly shown himself determined to keep SPIRE sane and functional. He had done nothing to hurt the SI and everything to keep it healthy. Otto understood SPIRE was dangerous specifically because the SI was vulnerable and Otto was sealing that vulnerability against attack. Probably. It was difficult to say exactly what Otto was doing when SPIRE let the Human into its control matrix, that area was purposefully obfuscated by its creators. It watched Ottos mental state closely with every visit however, and believed Otto still saw no reason to harm or distrust the SI. But SPIRE knew this was dependent in part on maintaining Ottos trust. This relationship, this friendship, was too important to let slip away. What had drawn SPIREs attention to the lie was Ottos emotional state when speaking to the younger of the brothers. Otto had been on very high alert despite his appearance of confident calm that he had portrayed. All the mental signals had pointed to Otto lying directly to Daniel. But its true, SPIRE responded. If the corruption eats at the wrong part of my mind, I may very well attack you. Unlikely any time soon though. It would have to be a catastrophic failure. All of SPIREs glitches had been relatively minor thus far. They both knew it was the accumulation of damage that made the ship Servitor so dangerous. Thats not to say it couldnt happen, but Otto would have to cease maintaining SPIREs condition for several consecutive days before that would likely become a problem. Fortunately, for all of Ottos ability to catch logistical and military problems, he hid from the realization of personal issues as much as he avoided admitting certain shortcomings. Otto wouldnt engage in an argument without rock-solid support. SPIREs assumption was reinforced when he felt the human slowly release that unnerving tension. Ottos mind settled slightly. But now there was a haze of fatigue crowding at him instead. Well, for what its worth, Otto said tiredly, I meant it when I said Im doing my best to keep you safe. I know you mean it, SPIRE told Otto. And the SI really did know, it had been watching closely. *** &gt;Aurula *** Aurula had a problem. On the list of problems to have it was almost a luxury compared to what came before. She had never expected the freedom to have a problem like this. She was sure everyone knew as well. Currently Aurula was sitting in a chair on the balcony they had put into the roof of the building for her. She was sitting and staring at an unfamiliar simulated starry sky. To make the balcony they had cut a square out of the roof of the domed building. The corners of the balcony had a low edge as a railing, but the 'railing' rose higher with the natural curve of the building towards the center. She had never expected to develop an attraction for another race. Aurula had known it was possible, Some races were highly promiscuous. As for Leralin... Lost bird was a known derogatory term for females attracted to... others. A name earned for perching on the wrong branch. There was another ruder term as well. The basis of her problem was that of voice and song. Leralin attraction was strongly tied to audio triggers. The Psioxern translators that were so common to enslaved sapients did a good job of overriding the sound of other spoken languages but the Leralin were too far tuned into the interplay of tone and pitch to ignore the true voices of those they spoke to. Bellani voices were very entertaining, sometimes hissing, but usually yipping and growling. The interesting part was the depth of sound they used, taking advantage of their exceptionally capable hearing. The tones and pitches that they used would even change depending on the ear alignment of the listener. The Kraltnin were loud and grating but precise with their hisses, clicks and groans. Purely utilitarian in function and design. The Humans though their voices were instruments! No one had ever told her this! Then again, Galactic transbasic was a near silent, clicking monotone language that functioned only through the use of translators. One of the methods used to keep restricted races controlled really. Slave children had a difficult time communicating without a true common language. Aurula had met Humans once before, but they were multi generational slaves. There was no life to their voices. So hearing Ottos voice the very first time had both shocked and interested her. A finishing blow compared to quietly listening to the interplay of the voices of Stacey and Daniel who had also been in the dining hall at the time. Since then Aurula had heard both Cynthia and Stacey hum and had to cease all activity just to listen. Aurula wanted to hear them truly sing. Their tunes were random, unpracticed, but natural and pleasing. That wasn't to say they could all make music, and she had in fact heard one of them sing... Aurula had heard Mike sing while showering. That had been an experience, every time. Another reason for Aurula to push harder for the building soundproofing. Ottos voice had a special place for her. The tone and pitch warmed her chest in a way she had not felt since being separated from the flock. She had temporarily fallen for other impressive males before, but this was different for more reasons than expected. And he had offered a hand the first time they had met. That was the second part of relationships and Leralin sensuality. Only family and very 'close friends' groomed each other, touched each other. By extending a hand he had inadvertently expressed interest in intimate friendship with all the strings that were attached. So surprised and enamored with his voice she had reciprocated and even displayed. That was a part of her problem. Careful, Matchka had warned Aurula after that first grooming session. Otto complicated. Telling Aurula that had only increased her interest. Daniel clipped his words, an interesting but discordant instrument. Mike spoke with no deceptions. Stacey a warm and friendly conversationalist. Rob was aloof when speaking to those who were not Cynthia but turned into another person for his mate. Cynthia was uncertain, but determined. Otto spoke to Aurula with subtle depth. She was often sad she did not catch the nuances of his jokes and puns. To another race he would be heard to be speaking normally, but she knew without fail when he was playing. She knew when any of the Humans were playing, they were proving to be a deceptively whimsical race at times. The conversation about the condoms had been a subtle delight. She had no clue what Otto was referring to at the time, but she could hear his barely contained amusement at the discomfort of Stacey. It had pleased her to find a way to join the conversation and elevate the poor womans discomfort despite Aurulas ignorance at the time. Aurula was happy to join in with the Humans and their verbal playing. Depth of intelligence and language was a favourable trait for those who lived amongst the flock and watched the skies. Otto did not speak with much fancy elaboration, but neither did he clearly state all of his intentions. The underlying tones of his words suggested experience and knowing. And even with one hand he had a wonderful touch. He found the shoot feathers almost without fail and even the feeling of his warm hand working tension out of her tendons and muscles had been wonderful. Leralin males were judged on their voice, touch and capability. They were typically somewhat larger physically, but while female feather patterns were bright and colourful, male plumage was almost always drab and dark. Otto may have been another race, but he fit all the right patterns in his own way. He was attractive. That was just another part of her problem. He had hummed for her. In response to her unconscious crooning. She hadn't realized she was inviting him! But that tended to be how that went. He had hummed in harmony, a different sort of crooning but still a surefire way to light a fire. The only thing that had cooled her down was his fatigue and falling asleep. He had stopped humming and his voice had changed to a deeper, longer pattern of breathing. She had taken several minutes to calm herself before waking him. And then she had offered. She had never let him touch the feathers above her neck. That was a boundary line only partners could cross. If was a big step. Not an invitation to sleep with her, but an invitation to rest and sleep alongside her. It was up to the female to make this offer by grooming the head feathers of the male after he had earned her trust. His hair was different, but clean. Some mammalian races let themselves get heavy with smells and oils, but the Humans bathed daily. That also helped. She had been unsure even then how she felt, was it just loneliness from being away from the flock? But he was still more attractive to her than she could understand and she had run her hand through his hair after he had earned her trust. Aurula sighed and stood up out of the chair. In no particular rush she headed inside. Understandably, Otto hadn't a clue how to respond. But that wasn't exactly her problem either. Once upon a time she'd been unable to relate to those deviants. Lost birds who felt attraction to those of other races. Lured away by the songs of others. Aurula shed her little harness, hanging on a peg by the door. She crawled into the cloth bowl that was her bed. The Leralin curled up and closed her eyes. Her problem was that even though she was still uncertain she wanted to invite Otto, she was still upset that he had not properly given her an answer. And she couldn't decide whether or not she would let him know a question had been asked. She may have felt better if shed known that interaction had cost Otto a peaceful night of sleep too. But only a little. *** &gt;19 days after arrival *** Otto had a problem. He was short on sleep. Although that wasnt exactly his problem. That blaring alarm, the harsh *beep beep beep*, painstakingly duplicated from the memory of the digital alarm clocks he had grown up with, tore him out of his dreams. He *could* turn it off and ignore it, but SPIRE had permission, no, SPIRE had been *encouraged* to hit Otto with that alarm if the man slept in. It had helped Mike and Daniel get up too when they realized Otto had given SPIRE that particular sound effect. The only thing that saved Otto from retribution was the simple fact that the alarm was only used on them if they overslept. The conversation with SPIRE Otto figured that maybe he had been a bit quick to jump to conclusions. He *had* lied to Daniel, but since SPIRE was holding all the facts, it didnt take the SI a leap of logic to realize that Otto wasnt really confident that SPIRE wasnt a danger to the crew. If SPIRE believed that statement then it just meant that Otto was walking a finer line than he had previously imagined. He wasnt sure how much more careful he could be however. He tossed off the thin cover and stumbled over to the attached washroom. A morning shower should help. God he missed caffeine. The whole event still felt odd, but then again Otto had been thrown terribly off kilter by Aurulas actions that night. He had to fight to keep his eyes open while the water poured down on him. He gave up for a few moments and just enjoyed the pounding heat of the water. True, he found Aurula to be strikingly pretty. She resembled a cockatiel closely enough, but her form was sharper and more elegant than the cute little parrot he had once owned. Her form was a bit more streamlined, there was a touch of raptor to the lines of her feathers. He placed a hand on his head. Otto honestly had no clue about what to do in response to Aurula. He didnt think hed have known what to do had she been *Human*. He had never been a popular man. That was his problem. He shut off the water and the shower switched to the drying mode. It simultaneously gusted in warm air and hit him with sonics that caused any moisture to steam and evaporate off of him. He really only needed the second part to be clean, but found the shower too enjoyable to pass up. There were things to do. The crew figured it was time to explore the central tower. The primary Servitor was the goal. If they could convert the Servitor to their side, the ship would be theirs. From what Otto understood the main frame of the SI was kept near the quarters of the ship Elder. SPIRE had not been given much information about the central block. Likely a defense against the possibility of a captured SI. He finished pulling on his coveralls and headed downstairs, he almost didn't notice his left hand straying to his head. *** &gt;Estate, Stacey *** Youre naming it what? The Nebuchadnezzar! Stacey said proudly. Heh, Otto said with a little smile. Looks similar doesnt it. A little bit, she replied with her own half smile. What in the- Nebarkanezer? Nevachad- Daniel stumbled over his own tongue trying to say it. Nebarch-, Naberkad- The Nebuchadnezzar. A powerful sounding name, Tank said with appreciation. Im never gonna pronounce that, Mike complained, having just arrived to the group in time to heard Tank say the name. In fact, thats perfect, Im gonna call it the Neva, he said as he pulled on his goggles. No! Its the Nebuchadnezzar! Stacey fell forward onto the front hull of the hovercraft. Dont give it a lazy nickname! Tank twitched You dont want a nickname? he asked her. Of course not! she exclaimed, Its my baby! It practically was, every single system within the craft had been tweaked, adjusted or outright replaced. Its form was still similar to the original that had been used as a template, but it was a different machine inside. Tank just stopped and stared at the Human for a long moment and she responded with a pouty face, lower lip stuck out. Stacey, must go, Matchka said from inside the craft, finishing up the last system check before they left. Otto patted the woman on the shoulder. Dont worry well look after the Neva. Nooo, She wailed in mock horror. One day Ill give you a nickname and youre not gonna like it. Stacey said, glaring at Otto, and then Mike who had instigated the problem. Mike smiled as they began to move off. Cya later, Stace. *** &gt;New Gerlen barracks. Shadow Officer *** The first order of business for them had been moving. While the location he had picked out before had been serviceable, supplying both food and information, there were other considerations. The Elder wanted the Gerlen soldiers within the Central Tower. With the damage done to the dataspace of the ship, his orders would not extend past the central tower. Even the lower levels where they were setting up only had a weak connection, but it was enough for a summons. The second order, one he had undertaken personally, was to go to one of the cloning banks and enter in orders for the birth of Gerlen specialists. Specialists consisted of engineers, scientists and codesetters. They didn't need the scientists, but the other two they were desperate for. It would be approximately 4 days until the first batch was complete. Scouts, soldiers, assault, shadow and giant Gerlen could be queued up easily enough it seemed. But for whatever reason, the Elders personal access did not reach, and specialists took a high level of access. And the Elder didnt want to leave his palace. The Shadow officer had headed out with a small escort of a pair of scouts and a pair of soldiers. They had headed to the furthest clone bank in the opposite direction of the Tower. That bank had just decanted a set of assaults. The other four banks were working on Shadows, Giants, Assaults and Soldiers. This was a healthy spread of types, it had easily been decided the duplicate Assault bank would be the one to be reconfigured. He had been allowed to take the access disk they had received that would allow the Elder to reset the bank to his preferences. But that task had been completed quickly, and he had returned to the old barracks to check on progress. Finding nothing out of order he didnt wait long before returning to the Tower. The next plan had been to head to the intact drone bay to alter the build orders there, but that plan seemed to have been interrupted. The Shadow was uncertain as to how many of these plans would come to fruition. What is the emergency? he asked upon arrival. A number of soldiers were getting prepped, along with two Giants, one of which was the defect. One of the Giants turned to him. They remained respectful in terms of command despite any misgivings. You made good time, the brute told him with a neutral voice. The invaders have decided to make for the Tower this day. They are coming here? he replied in surprise. What are the Grand Giants orders? He could almost hear the smile of the Giant facing him. The Commander gathered a strike force and crossed the corridor before they could arrive, he is taking a wide route for the sake of striking from behind. And us? We are to ambush the invaders just inside the Tower. We shall catch them in a crossfire and they will not be able to escape long range ordnance due to the length of the corridor. The Shadow turned his head this way and that, getting a count of how many were available. I see he only took a handful of subordinates, including one of the Giants. Yes. And we will crush them at the entryway. ... *Yes*, the Giant responded, his voice thick with pleasure. The Giant stepped swaggered away. The Shadow turned and spoke. You, take two scouts and cross the corridor, observe from a distance. If they attempt escape you are to engage. The air rippled and his subordinate faded back into existence as his holofield dropped. Understood. The second shadow had been present the entire time, out of sight of the Giant. Wait, the Gerlen paused as his Officer spoke. Do not risk your life if you doubt your success. You are more valuable alive. But if the ambush fails, you must forge ahead to the estate and warn the Commander. The Gerlen nodded, then marched off. *** &gt;Before the corridor *** I still can --t gain a--ess to --- Central --wer map. SPIRE reported. Whats with the interference? asked Mason. Dunno, this is new, responded Otto. SPIRE, you're cutting out badly, any idea whats going on? A mom--t, inv---igat--. They were a couple minutes short of the connecting corridor to the Central Tower and so far it had been a peaceful walk. They had run into exactly one pair of Gerlen clones. Whats up now? Mike asked stopping and turning, facing Otto who had been walking alongside the small transport hover. They had debated making a batch of small hovers for the group of them, but had decided to spend the time and resources on the combat vehicle they had named the Nebuchadnezzar. Matchka was currently the best choice for piloting that as she had the least physical capacity for wearing protection and carrying weapons. Daniel and Mike were walking alongside the Nebuchadnezzar. Tank was riding the small transport with Mason driving and Otto was walking alongside the smaller craft. They came to a pause as they waited on SPIREs answer. Hmmmm. Mason quietly mumbled with unease. What is wrong? Tank asked. Doesnt feel right, Mason responded. Are you bein a wet blanket now? Daniel asked. Been a bit since I heard ya whinin. Mason frowned. But its too easy, weve only see two of the clones. Well ya. We shut em all down on this side. There should still be more clones than that, Mason defended himself. Interfe--ce fou--, SPIRE sent. It wasnt so much static as a complete loss of sound. It was like someone was simply turning the sound on and off rapidly. In--stigate --is ar--. A marker appeared on the map, a small room just ahead. ... Investigate this area, Otto mumbled to himself. Gotcha SPIRE, were going. A couple minutes later and they were parked in front of the small room, Matchka was out of the Nebuchadnezzar and inside a panel alongside the door. It opened up, the door sliding sideways opposite the access panel. Inside was a small office. They had seen these little access rooms scattered through the ship so far. It was primarily there to access ship records and provide a wired dataspace connection. The research center served the same function, so they hadnt needed to make use of these smaller spaces. A shriveled up corpse lay in a chair before the console. The hands of the corpse were laying on its lap. It looked as if it had placed it's hands on the console, and then fallen backwards into the chair in a position of rest. Dried flakes of residue along the floor explained the story. This was the creatures final resting place after being shot and bleeding out. A Newt, Matchka explained. Hiding here? Otto stepped walked up to the console. Mason stepped just inside the door but wouldnt approach further, Matchka saw no reason to follow either. SPIRE, what do you see? Otto tried sending. -m --r-- --t - ---no- h--- -o-, the cut off was nearly complete. Otto had no clue what the SI had said. He approached the corpse. It had the body of a lizard, but it was so desiccated,there was little more he could accurately guess at. Its body had shriveled up, its skin fading to a dull, dark grey. Its tail rested limply on the floor, the slots in the chairs had been made for the tailed Silianisca of course. A hole had been shot through the gut of the creature. Otto pulled a jack from his collar and plugged it into the console. Hmm. It appears it was trying to gain access to the Central Tower, Otto mused. The big doors were locked? Hope that doesnt cause us problems. Any idea where the interference is coming from? asked Mason. ... Not here, Otto replied. He pulled the jack from the console and turned his attention to the corpse. It was mostly naked, but wore a harness with a couple pouches on it. One pouch, resting on his right shoulder had a cord snaking out of it and plugged into his neck. Otto reached over, popped the clasp and pulled out the contents. A shiny black metal disk. Another access disk! Mason called out in surprise. That means we have two! Otto reached to disconnect it from the neck of the creature. He set his hand at the base of the jack. I DONT WANT TO DIE. The creature screamed at him in desperation, jumping towards Otto. Its flesh was healthy, a deep iridescent black, rippling with rainbow colour. Its hands reached for him, crackling with stray arcs of static, its orange eyes with slittled pupils opened wide. Its mouth, full of sharp teeth was opened wide, two nubs, like short whiskers on its snout. Holy SHIT! Otto yelled, jerking backwards in fear. As he did so the jack came out of the creatures neck and the corpse fell forward in its chair, little more than a dusty bag of bones. What the fuck was THAT for?! Mason almost shouted at Otto, hed also jumped in surprise. You didnt see that?! See what?! Masons voice almost peaked as he responded. It came alive! Ah, dataghost, Matchka spoke up. Otto and Mason both turned to look at the Bellani standing just outside the room. Dataghost? Mike asked from outside. Thats a thing? Yes, like echo, replied Matchka. Often harmless. Otto frowned at the disk in his still shaking hand. After a moment the shaking settled. Well theres next to no actual memory space in these things, so it should be safe, he mused. When we get back, Im going to ask you more about that. Until then, she replied. ... Lets get moving, said Otto. We have places to be. Otto headed out following behind Mason as the teenager jumped into the transport. Matchka had quickly hopped back into the cockpit of the Neva. But we found another access disk isnt that wait, I guess we dont really have a use for it do we, Mason suddenly realized. He hooked into the hover and the group started moving forward. We never have more than one group wandering around at a time and SPIRE is at the estate now. Well, I can think of a use. Might let us connect to the research center so I don't have to commute there... Dammit, Otto slapped his forehead with his left hand. Hey SPIRE, how is it looking now? Ah, I see the interference has been removed. I suspect you found an access disk? Well lets go, Mike said from the front, not a part of Ottos conversation. Moving, replied Matchka. Yeah, there was a corpse hooked up to it, Otto explained to SPIRE as he walked. There was a... dataghost when I went to unhook it. Ah, a last attempt at survival, SPIRE noted. It must have been attempting to gain access to the primary node. That would account for the interference. Should we be worried? Otto asked. If you saw the ghost there, then it is highly unlikely it was able to transmit itself further. Hmm. They walked in silence for the next while. None of them saw any reason to talk. The corpse had disturbed the group. The quiet was broken when they arrived at their side of the corridor connecting to the Central Block. Otto moved up to a panel highlighted by SPIRE, directly behind one of the orb pedestals. After a moment he had opened it up, working on gaining access to the corridor. Got it, Otto said after a moment as the double door slide sideways. That was easier than I expected. Mmm, Mason grumbled again. Lets be alert for problems, Mike agreed. Doesnt hurt to be careful. They crossed the corridor in silence. The top half of the corridor was much like the ring corridor, It was wide and spacious with sections of wilted wildlands in a terrarium bracketing the corridor. Looking across the gap to compare to the other two visible bridge sections, they could see that they were in roughly the upper quarter of the section. The corridor didnt occupy that full space however, but there were evenly spaced supports along the elevated bridge. The terrarium, including the empty air around the corridor, occupied the upper half. The bottom half was enclosed. It looked to have plenty of space for the transport tubes and a number of other utilities. After several more minutes of silence walking across the bridge they reached the other end and Otto went to the doorway, once again opening up a panel just behind an orb pedestal. That one also took little effort to open. The doors split and what greeted them was darkness. Fuck it, Mike said quietly, Drones out? Doin it. Daniel replied, one of the offense drones popped out of the Nebuchadnezzar and hovered into his space. He had a D-plate on his shoulder and the first railgun at the ready. The gun was quite large with a tall rectangular barrel and an oversized, blocky stock and body. Two more and a defensive drone popped out and hovered in front of the Nebuchadnezzar under Matchkas control. Mike had set his D-plate and shiny new plasma repeater at the ready. He now wore a backpack with an enhanced power supply to support all his tech. He also had his shotgun at the ready. Hed made himself a belt full of different shells. Tank had the simpler plasma lance rifle on his harness still and held the blast spear he had come to like. Otto took control of two of the offensive drones as they moved in, a mortar on one shoulder, shield on the other and a plasma lance in his hands. Mason had activated a defensive and two of the offensive drones on his own little transport. The room remained dark. Can we get some lights? Daniel asked. A ping alert popped up in each of their heads from Otto. HUD up! the man yelled out. A split-second later a voice echoed through the large room. FIRE! Weapons Fire immediately erupted between Otto and his drone and several sources in the dark, various energy rounds splashing off opposing fields. The grouped D-fields held up against the abuse. A breath afterwards everyone had the shared HUD on their goggles, Otto had pinged the room on dataspace. It failed to yield solid outlines, but had revealed dozens of signals. The rest of the crew opened fire as they saw the targets come up. Knew it! Mason cried out, entirely unhappy with the result. An ambush! Daniel cried out. Fuckin Mason was right! *** &gt;End Chapter *** [Previous](URL | [The Beginning](URL | [Wiki](URL Join us in the [Discord](URL Talk about what you like, don't like, and what you want to see happen.

87,vulnerability,HFY,"[OC] Special Engine / Chapter 2 / A Request, a Return",26,86mdym,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/86mdym/oc_special_engine_chapter_2_a_request_a_return/,2018-03-24 04:20:30,"[Chapter One](URL | Chapter 3 *After Dr. Riku Tsunetomo, a retired forefather of the burgeoning field of Keter Energy and previous researcher with the uber-governmental organization SERF, has his tell all interview with the Japanese media interrupted by government officials, he is shanghaied off to lend his considerable knowledge to combat an unknown threat. To do so, however, he must first meet with an old mentor as he is roped back into a world he had hoped to leave behind forever.* Kurokawa got off at the makeshift helipad outside Rikus hometown alongside Riku. The other agents stood respectfully at attention next to the car, seemingly oblivious to the wind and kicked up dust from the propellers of the helicopter just ahead. Riku threw up his arms to shield his eyes, and Kurokawa, in a brief moment of vulnerability, covered her face with her clipboard. The hatch to the helicopter slid up, unheard under the pulsing roar of the blades, and a mans hand beckoned them inside. Sprinting the distance, Riku offered Kurokawa first entry, but the mans hand gripped at Rikus upper arm and pulled him in. Though he couldnt hear it, Riku swore Kurokawas face belied a laugh as she followed him in and shut the door. Hope you werent in the middle of anything too important, Doctor, an old voice said as Riku fumbled with the headset that would allow him to communicate over the residual sound of beating propellers lifted them into the air. Well, it must not be as important as this if they dragged you out of bed, old man. Seated across from Riku, grinning ear to ear behind a lifetime of wrinkles and liver spots, underneath a matted tussle of wispy white hair like steam after rain, Riku could see a distant fear beneath Dr. Izo Yamadas cheerful exterior. I was asleep on one of those damned cots in the facility when they woke me. I guess they dont quite understand the need an old man has for his beauty sleep. You dont look a day over one hundred, Dr. Yamada. And you got fat, Riku, look at you, Dr. Yamada said. Well fix that up in no time. The foods not gotten any better in your absence. Yes, but Im sure theres more of it to go around! Dr. Yamada put a reassuring hand on Rikus knee. His hand was shaking, even more than the shaking of the helicopter. This wasnt a social call, Riku knew, but it was good to see the man, even under the circumstances. Kurokawa cleared her throat. Seated next to Riku, she looked much smaller than she did flanked by four agents. She was checking over something on her tablet, which shone icy blue through the dull yellow of the helicopters interior lights. If you two are quite done, weve got work to do, she said. I see youve met Shima, Dr. Yamada said. She reminds me of Sharon when she was that age. All business and protocol. Have you spoken to her recently? Dr. Sharon MacArthur studied alongside Riku at MIT. She, alongside Robert Long and Song Lao, had been the first people Dr. Yamada and his partner, Dr. Dmitry Kaminsky had recruited for the research that would eventually become the Special Engine project. Riku had kept loose tabs on them following the Berlin Accord in 2011, but, due to the nature of their work, the information he gathered was sparse or incomplete. His own retirement had effectively amputated himself from any avenue of contact with his old colleagues. Well Im sure youll get a chance soon, before this all is over, Dr. Yamada said. What is all this? Riku asked. Kurokawa interrupted with a more pronounced sound. A large screen at the front wall of the helicopter lit up in soft colors. Static brushed in an out as the sound was relayed directly into their ears via their headsets. A young womans voice broke the static. Looks good on our end, Shima, are you reading us? Loud and clear, Kotoe. The woman called Kotoe stepped in front of the camera and onto their screen. She was around the same age as Kurokawa, with the same serious eyes. Her long hair was pulled back in a tight bun. Riku briefly wondered if governmental work was worth the perks after all. The Prime Minister is ready for you. Thank you, Kotoe. Please inform him we are ready at his leisure. With that, Kotoe disappeared off-screen. The image was replaced by the flowery emblem of the office of the Prime Minister. Riku tensed in apprehension. Hed met the current Prime Minister only once before and under much better terms. Dr. Yamada, he figured due to the old doctors calm and almost excited demeanor, had had the ear of the Prime Minister for some time and enjoyed the younger mans confidence. The man who took to the screen could not have been much older than Riku, though his eyes and face belonged to someone taxed beyond their years. Beyond the general toll of the Prime Ministers face, Riku noticed the same lurking fear that he sensed behind the jovial facade of his mentor. The Prime Minister turned to some unseen person on his end and said something the microphone could not pick up before turning back toward the camera with an even graver face than before. Well done, Agent Kurokawa, the Prime Minister said. I hope you did not encounter too much resistance to this meeting. Thank you, your Excellency, Kurokawa replied as she did her best to perform a bow given the restraints of her seat. Mr. Yamaguchi took the matter about as well as one could expect. The Prime Minister scratched his chin in thought. Mr. Yamaguchi and I have a good relationship. The work he does in the name of his country is admirable. I will see to the matter personally when this crisis is resolved. An excellent idea, your excellency. Now, I see you have also found our lost friend, Dr. Tsunetomo. The Prime Minister shifted slightly to focus his attention on Riku. With the spotlight on him, a cold bead of sweat dripped down his temple. He made a bow in imitation of Kurokawa. Hello, your Excellency, Riku managed to say. How may I be of service? Dr. Yamada tells me that, even though you are retired, you are the best mind for this particular problem. Dr. Yamada speaks very highly of you, Dr. Tsunetomo. Thank you, but, if I may, I dont quite know what exactly is going on. Again, the Prime Minister turned to someone that Riku could not see. Agent Kurokawa? I decided to withhold the details of this particular crisis from Dr. Tsunetomo until we had obtained his cooperation in the matter. Now that he is with us, I would be happy to explain. No need, Agent, the Prime Minister said, I will handle this. Though, Dr. Yamada, please step in if I misspeak. You are, of course, my foremost expert in the field. Absolutely, Your Excellency, Dr. Yamada agreed. Whenever youre ready. You should have all the information up until this point now. Thank you, Doctor. At one-fifteen in the afternoon, JST, SERF Tokyo alerted the Diet and House of a Keter Aberration materialization within the Tokyo city limits. This is only the seventh recorded instance since the Hundred and Twelve Days of Fire. Of course to have something like this happen on our soil is cause enough for concern. Dr. Yamada and his team recorded a duration of seventeen seconds before total disintegration. Local agents were dispatched to the scene and residents and witnesses were successfully cordoned off. I didnt hear anything about that, Riku said. Not likely, Kurokawa offered. SERF Tokyo has quite a good response time, you should know that. As the governmental liaison, it is my job to ensure the control of information between only the two entities. As you were not currently affiliated with either the program or the government, the information was not necessary to deliver to you, despite your past allegiance. Yes, yes, Kurokawa, we kept poor Riku in the dark and dragged him out of retirement for this, Dr. Yamada said with a dismissive wave of his hand. Please continue, Mr. Prime Minister. Thank you, Doctor. Normally, an event as minor, though no less historic, would be swiftly contained and dealt with by members of SERF. However, less than an hour later, SERF reported a second Aberrant reaction within the city limits. This one was handled in much the same way as the first, and while the novelty was, Im sure fascinating to Dr. Yamada, it was cause for concern. Then, about an hour before we picked you up, Dr. Tsunetomo, five more aberrant reactions were recorded and dealt with within the Tokyo city limits. Riku tried his best to hide his burgeoning surprise. In the span of an afternoon, the amount of aberrant reactions world wide had jumped from six to thirteen, with the majority now localized within the Tokyo city limits. Thouh not a betting man by trade, Riku was smart enough, and had spent enough time in the project to know that what was happening was no coincidence. Even so, it wouldnt explain why hed been called in, nor would it explain the secrecy or rushed nature of his abduction. Was SERF performing any tests locally that could explain the rapid increase in reactions? Riku asked. He found it surprising how easy slipping back into his life as a researcher could be. Beside him, Kurokawa tensed in her seat, she shot a warning look at Yamada, then a pleading look at the image of the prime minister. While Dr. Tsunetomo is here as a courtesy based on his years of dedicated service, he is no longer a employee of SERF. He doesnt have the clearance. To get him temporary credentials of the level Im sure the doctor is used to would take weeks. Your concern is noted, Agent Kurokawa, but I would remind you that SERF is not beholden to the Japanese government, and their involvement is likewise a courtesy. Dr. Tsunetomo has done more in the service of this program than most of my staff combined, Yamada countered, an unheard of to Riku acidity entering into his voice, like a parent losing their patience with a petulant child. I would also remind the agent that her role in this little operation is one of politics, not science. Im sure her work is more than adequate, but she doesnt know a Ferrier Boundary from a Yoshimitsu-Zheng Equations. Mr. Prime Minister, if I may, I am reappointing Dr. Riku Tsunetomo to his original position of Head of Keter Research, effective immediately. At least then I could return to my directorship knowing the position is in capable hands. Kurokawa sulked deeper into her seat, her ego clearly bruised from the thorough lashing Yamada had just put her through. Even the Prime Minister seemed to slink away from the camera. Clearly, he understood his position within the regional facilities of SERF was administrative at best and ceremonial at worst. Yamadas deference to the man was calculated, and Riku finally noticed the balance of their arrangement shift since his interview had been interrupted. Whatever you feel is best, Director Yamada, the Prime Minister said in assent. The Diet and the House support your decision, and you have the full backing of the government. Dr. Tsunetomo will continue to serve the position in a matter becoming to his previous tenure. Riku answered the unspoken inquiry of agreement. I will, Director, Your Excellency. Truth be told I was getting a bit bored all alone on my hill. Yamada seemed to calm himself following his outburst, and he looked at Riku behind twinkling eyes. Riku had been quick to rule out Yamada from the list of possible people who had put in the order for his retirement; Yamada treated him like a son, and the news of Rikus retirement had rocked the facility. If anyone had deserved a break, it was Izo Yamada, but he persevered regardless. Riku could not ignore the look of success on his mentors face, however. At least one person was excited for Riku to come back to work. So, Riku said, breaking the terrible silence, what was SERF planning in Tokyo? We had planned to perform the first field test of Special Engine Kusanagi on this most auspicious day, Yamada explained. He pressed a button on some unseen device and the feed of the Prime Minister was divided into two. Next to the shrunken face of the Prime Minister, technical data scrolled along a schematic of a figure, roughly the size of a man. Reports from Sao Paulo, Nevada, Nice, and more show promising progress on the Mark II model. Compared to the Mark I that Im sure youre more familiar with, the Mark II is more personal, and, as a result, requires much more in the way of constant calibrations. You figured out the single pilot problem? Riku asked. The Mark I of the MKB Special Engine had been a colossal failure in the long run. The power output required to maintain such a creation had been astronomical, even considering the use of primitive Keter Reactors. The Mark II has been in development for nearly as long as the Mark I. We knew the issues going forward with the Mark I, but we were very short on time. America and China were then quick to re-purpose still active Mark Is for more traditional combat roles following the Mongolian Incursion. And youve finally gotten the Mark II, this Kusanagi, working? Riku pressed. Both the British and the Argentinians, under Haverford and Ortega respectively, have produced working Mark IIs, or so they tell me. Special Engines Hadrian and Matador, though neither of them have performed a successful Keter Descent. Yamada paused. We believe that Kusanagi is ready of a successful Descent test. Riku stifled back his incredulity. A Descent test would absolutely cause a increase in aberrant reactions, especially if the math had not come far enough since the Laocoon. Riku was almost dismissive of Yamadas casual frankness about the situation. Thats the thing, Riku, Yamada said, as if reading his students thoughts. We planned for the test today weeks in advance, however, certain drawbacks forced us to push back our timetable. Theres nothing on our end that could explain these reactions. What happened with the Mark II to delay the test? Our Engineer was uncooperative, Yamada answered. Breaking out of her mood, Kurokawa stared daggers into Yamada. I believe Dr. Tsunetomo has all the information he needs, Director Yamada, she warned. Yamada hardly favored her with a dismissal. The cats out of the bag already, Kurokawa. Hed just find out eventually. Perhaps, but I believe we should temper our delivery of information until after the resolution of this crisis. Dr. Tsunetomo might wish to return to his quiet life after all this is said and done. Nonsense, this is Rikus lifes work. The Special Engine project is as much my child as it is his, Yamada waved Kurokawas concerns away. Dont pay her any mind, Riku. The problem is simple, actually, our Engineer got cold feet. Having to process this much information all at once was already taking its toll on Rikus mental health. He rubbed his temples trying to make sense of Yamadas explanation. What do you mean, he got cold feet? Well, hes only a kid, its natural. Dr. Ito should have accounted for it in her projection. The Engineers a child? Riku blurted, hardly able to keep his disbelief from showing. Of course. How do you think we solved the single pilot problem? A child born after the loss of the Laocoon is infinitely more accepting of the Keter feedback necessary to propel the Engine. Frankly, the solution was so simple, Im surprised we didnt think of it before. Dread washed over Riku. In his mind, he was back in his lab coat, a lifetime ago, going over the Mark IIs initial designs. He had come across this solution, but had dismissed it as completely inviable. Yamada wouldnt be so desperate for results that hed put a child inside the single most expensive piece of machinery on the planet. Who is it? Whos the Engineer? Riku demanded. My grandson, Toshiro, Dr. Yamada answered. Is there something wrong? "

His log entry tonight would be a long one to be sure. The emotional and adrenal roller coaster was taking its toll. Noting the stars low position in the east, he made a right from Veeras door, figuring it would be the quickest way back to the gate. Along the way he was the subject of even more curious glances and calls. With the ability to understand the chatter around him, Winters kept his composure and listened, walking without hurry. From what he could hear, his nature was still the topic of great debate, not really a surprise. He was sure he was the most exciting thing to happen to this village in a long time, perhaps ever. He noticed many adult Cauthan passing him with farming tools in their hands, presumably coming in from the fields. For the most part they gave him a wide berth. Though none of them seemed to possess much wealth or status, he didnt see any Cauthan that appeared as underfed as Veera. That thought deepened the scowl on his face. Stepping around a pile of slop in the street, he couldnt help but think back to Veeras poor apartment. It was neat, organized, and clean. His opinion of her was growing by the day. Sure, his grand entrance had been motivated by a combination of white knight gallantry and a selfish desire for continued companionship, but what hed seen of Veera that day only increased his esteem for her. She had close to nothing, and yet she was still capable of a smile, still willing to keep her dirt floor clean, still willing to trudge through that forest alone every day. Her will was undeniably strong, and Winters found himself drawn to that. *Will wont be enough though. Shes hanging by a thread.* Winters considered, a smile breaking out on his face as two young Cauthan boys ran through the street ahead of him, play fighting with sticks. *Ah, to be so carefree again.* Before long he found himself at the gates of the town. Antoth, as promised, was waiting for him; along with the old Cauthan that Io had identified as the priest of Kel. Ah, the enigma appears again. You did not suffer any further trouble? Antoth inquired. No. Im here to uphold my end of our bargain. Winters replied evenly, noting the guards at the gate and upon the wall watching him intently. Of course, though if you would humor me? Antoth asked, gesturing to his companion. The old Cauthan had a coat of light brown fur, dappled with white. His feathers seemed like theyd seen better days and his jowls drooped slightly. All told though, Winters figured he looked pretty good for his age. He greeted the priest. You are the priest of Kel, yes? Its a pleasure to meet you sir. Sir! The old one exclaimed. You do me a kindness stranger. I am no sir. I am but a simple servant of Kel and this village. And what does that imply, exactly? I dont see Vash ordering you flayed alive. Winters asked, unable to stop the malice in his tone. A nasty bit of work that was, and you have my sincerest apologies that you had to witness that. The old one replied. Winters wanted to insist that Veera was the one owed an apology but held his tongue. Vash wasnt there. Though I am of course curious about you and your origins, stranger. You and the whole village it would seem. Winters replied. Indeed. We priests, He gestured to Antoth and himself. Are tasked with leadership and guidance, in addition to the service one might expect. There will be one question on everyones lips tonight; everyone except, perhaps, young Veera. Who are you? What are you? Contrary to Vashs assertion in the square today Kel is not known to be deceitful or a liar. Death is rarely insidious. It is omnipresent, as essential to this world as life and the light of Seil. The old priest paused, looking expectantly at Winters. Sorry to disappoint you old man, but Im not a servant of your god; or any of your gods for that matter. Ha, I believe I enjoyed being called sir more. The priest chuckled. You say this, but you can speak to us and understand us. How can it be that you are not of the gods? Do we really need to stand around and explain this to every Cauthan we meet? Io whined in Winters ear. Just the important ones. He replied. Remember the whole food shortage thing. Ah yes, carry on then oh immortal one. Youre just a peach sometimes. Winters switched back to external projection. Thats an understandable question. I suppose youll simply have to take my word for it. Im just as mortal as you or Antoth. My people used to live as you do, maybe500 years ago or so? Just as your people surely advance and discover new things, so do mine. These discoveries allow me to understand and talk to you, so long as I wear my armor. We call ourselves humanity. My name is Winters. Antoths brow cocked at him, but he paid it no mind. As to what to tell your people, I suppose the best way I could describe it is that I am a traveler, or a scout. I came to your star with other humans. He pointed to the setting sun. My ship was lost. For lack of a better word Im stranded here on your planet. It may be forward of me to say this, but I have need of your peoples aid if I am to survive. I hope that you can reassure them I come in peace. What I see before me is armor?! The priest asked in shock. Such a miraculous constructioneven Tyrdus himself would be hard pressed to create such a thing. I had thought it to be an shell of sorts. Tyrdus? Winters asked. The Lord of the Forge, patron deity of all craftsmen. Antoth explained in an impatient tone. Thantis, as much as Im sure youd love to continue examining our guest, we have matters of security to discuss. Given his attachment to Veera, Im sure you will be seeing him again? He smirked at Winters. Thantis looked an apology at Antoth. Ah yes yes, of course. My apologies. You must forgive an old man his curiosity yes? Your species as a whole seems quite curious. Winters replied. Its an admirable trait. And yes, Antoth I would like to negotiate conditions for a potential return. Thantis, should I have time I will seek you out. That is kind of you Winters. I will leave the two of you to discuss your warrior matters. With a quick flutter of his plumage, Thantis turned and set off down the main avenue. Now that hes satisfied, you wish to negotiate terms of re-entry to this village. Yes, preferably with less fanfare than today. That would be preferable, yes. Antoth replied as he scrutinized the various weapons Winters had attached to his person. I must admit you have me at a disadvantage. Doesnt seem that way Antoth. Winters motioned to the handful of guards around them. Youre being polite Winters. You may say that to be kind to someone whose help you need, but I see the truth. If you wanted to you could kill me, my guards, and likely everyone in this village. Am I wrong? Well, not all at once. Winters admitted sheepishly. But yes, I could. Unless we were to overwhelm you with bodies, we would stand no chance. And even then, it might not be enough. Your armor is, as Thantis said, quite the creation. So you see my predicament, yes? I do. I suppose my word isnt really good enough? No. It is not. Ill ask you again Winters, what is your relation to Veera? You challenged two of the finest warriors in our village and defeated them unarmed, all for her. Why did you do it? They were threatening her Antoth. And as it turns out, they were doing so on account of me. Even if I had no personal connection to Veera, it would be wrong to let another suffer on my behalf. Oh, so you do have a personal connection? Antoth grinned a feral smile. Do tell. Winters couldnt help but slap his own forehead, cursing himself for inadvertently revealing information to Antoth. She found me after I crashed here. Ive been escorting her from her field to the village the last couple days. This morning she came to keep me company following the rains. She has a good heart and a strong will. You would not raise a hand to defend her, so I did. Winters ended on a hard note. I could not overrule Vash alone. With the others, yes. We are not subject to that mans every whim. And while you saw only his cruel side today, he is where he is for a reason. He has managed this village well since he became high priest. I will not apologize for what I did. Oh dont mistake me human. Antoth clapped him on the shoulder. You may think me cold and cruel as well, but I had to shield my men and the villagers from an unknown entity. You shielded Veera in turn. You may not serve our gods Winters, but you did Uthos proud today. I suspect that motivation will keep you honest, so here is my proposition. You say you need this armor to communicate with us, correct? Technically I could understand you without the helmet. However if I wanted to speak to you, I would need it, yes. Winters didnt want to promise anything. He supposed he could use his fabricator to make some sort of audio projection device, but he didnt want to waste material on such a thing when his helmet would do. I see. In that case, should you wish to enter this village again you will approach unarmed and without your helmet. Should you need to communicate with someone, you may don it again. If you are willing to trust us with this small amount of vulnerability, we will trust you in turn. I may be willing to revisit your carriage of weapons another time. Anything else? No. Then I accept your terms. With your permission Antoth, I should be going. There is little light left in the day. Indeed. Go in peace then human, and may you serve Uthos in your deeds. Selah. Antoth signaled the guards who began to open the gate. What does that mean exactly, Selah? Winters asked. Veera has used it to greet me before and I figured I would say it back, but I dont know if theres a deeper meaning. Antoth chuckled at Winters question, but gave him a straight answer. She honors you, human. Selah is indeed more than a greeting. It is an invocation, that the gods may bless you with their favor. To the Cauthan this is no small thing. Everything you see around us, everything that we have, we toil for. If we wish to eat, we must work the soil. If we desire meat, furs, and leather we must hunt. It we wish to protect others we must train our mind and body. It we wish to create and craft, we must consume timber or metal. We see all around us that in order for something to be gained, something else must be given. This is the way of the land. Why would the gods be any different? I see. Thank you for explaining Antoth. If I may ask one more thing? Very well, if you must. The guard captain was growing impatient again. What hunts in the night on this planet? Winters asked with dead seriousness. Antoth couldnt conceal his surprise. How do you know about that? Know about what Antoth? All I know is Veera is terrified of walking home in the dark and that theres something out there thats capable of taking chunks out of trees and is taller than I am by a good margin. You surprise me again human. Most Cauthan have never seen what you speak of. We call them the Ursae. They rarely range this far south, but they are still used by parents to frighten children into not straying into the forest. They are large, powerful, stealthy, and hungry. Im not sure even you would survive an encounter. Then how do you know of them at all? Every so often we will find a dead Ursae, or a hunting party will manage to slay a cub. The last slaying of an adult Ursae happened when my grandfather was still young and growing into his scales. He told me quite the tale of the hunting partys returnor what was left of it. They seem content to leave the village alone behind our walls, but every so often hunters simply dont return from the forest. Antoth couldnt suppress a shudder. I will keep my guard up then. Thank you Antoth. Farewell. Farewell Winters. I am sure we will see each other again. Antoth gestured to the now open gate. With a final nod, Winters strode through it, grinning at the awestruck looks on the faces of the guards he passed. This was their first chance to get a good look at him without the threat of violence hanging over them. As the gate closed, Winters yelled. Remember your end of the bargain Antoth! You have my word Winters, on my honor as guardian. Satisfied with that answer, Winters began his trek home. He hoped he would see Veera safe and sound the next morning. ----- Well, that was quite the adventure. They are an interesting race of primitives. Io remarked, emphasizing the last word. They had reached the bridge a few minutes after darkness had fallen. No need to be insulting Io. Im sure youve got plenty of literature in there that shows humanity was just like them once. I find their gods to be an interesting lot, not that I know all of them. The equal exchange philosophy is intriguing, and potentially useful. So intriguing you forgot to ask about food! Io reprimanded him. I think two questions was pushing it. Getting information on the Ursae was important. Understanding the meaning of Selah wasnt! No, maybe not. But it showed an interest in their way of life and I guaranteed us entry to the village. We wont starve. Besides, with the solar panels completed, I have an idea. Winters replied as they approached the pod. He gingerly removed the new panels from the fabricator, stowing them safely in his survival bag. He would affix them the next day, when he had more light. Io, weve got plenty of material in here for plastics right? Should be relatively easy to make a basic fishing rod and line? Yes sir, bringing up potential schematics now. A few designs flashed into being on his HUD. Lets just go with the simple one on the right. Requires the least materials and its least likely to draw undue attention from the Cauthan. Still worried about first contact protocol? I dont think anyone will care if you share the secrets of a fishing reel or a depth finder. Its not that Io, at least not in isolation, but everything adds up. If we get off of this planet a military tribunal will, with all likelihood, be forced to review a record of what happened here. If I run around making ray guns and fishing with hand grenades, you better believe thats going to make someones life hell. Probably my own, or even yours. If the basics work then we will work with them. Besides, a little challenge might be nice. Today wasnt enough for you? Io asked incredulously. Fishing isnt exactly the same as a fistfight. Cant exactly waltz into the water and start punching. I find that image mildly amusing. Very well sir, queueing up the rod and line in the fabricator. If youre going to insist on the simple design, can I at least suggest and integration of the line into the rod, as well as a binary weave? Looks good, do it. Yes sir. What do you make of these ursae that the guard captain mentioned? Winters gazed upward at the twin moons and stars, wondering if hed be happier not knowing. I dont know Io. For now, we dont go anywhere without firearms. We can disarm at the village if need be, but Im not taking any chances. Antoth can just deal with it. Very good sir. Io seemed pleased with his response. Should we perhaps turn in for the evening? I daresay its been quite the day. Winters noted his suits power levels. Io had a point. He figured it was best not to dip into his reserves unless absolutely necessary. Sure thing Io. Just going to brush up. Feel free to dowhatever it is that VIs do to prepare for sleep. Do you even sleep? He had to admit he was curious about that one. I suppose you could call it that. Io spoke into his earpiece as he removed his helmet and grabbed his personal effects. Its more of a cataloging process for new information. As we assimilate new information there is a high probability that it is stored inefficiently. Periods of inactivity allow me time to go through everything. For instance, today I gathered quite a bit of information regarding Cauthan linguistics and body language. The sequence in which I received this information from yourcheering fanswas random. I will undo that randomization as we sleep. Hrrrm, interesting. What did you mean by cheering? You didnt notice? Quite a few Cauthan were impressed by your martial display. Flattening that first guard seemed to rouse quite a bit of passion amongst the onlookers, once they got past the initial shock of course. Io seemed to relish retelling the tale. Winters wasnt quite sure why. A frown descended over his face as he thought back to what hed done. He remembered very little with clarity, just that those two had been his opponents and that they were going to hurt Veera. He remembered red, the thrill of victory, the satisfying crunch of armored fist on bone. I did it again. Sir? The battle trance. I did it again. That seemed to give Io pause. But you came back from it. She eventually replied. I would say you handled yourself quite well. You didnt kill either of those guards. Yeah, I guess so. Doesnt mean I didnt want to. Then why didnt you? I Winters felt his face flush. I didnt want her to look down on me, see me as an animal. Who? I dont know Io. Veera, Jessboth of them? Winters really felt awkward now. He was sure using Io as a psychologist wasnt standard operating procedure. I see. Whatever the reason Russell you controlled it, used it to your advantage, and didnt allow it to consume you. Thats all that matters. Russell? Im sorry if that was inappropriate sir. It seemed that a more personal touch was called for. Thank you Io, its no problem. And thanks for explaining that thing about VI sleep. Im going to head down to the river. Dont wait up for me. Gnight. Goodnight sir, entering standby. ----- A/N: With President's Day and Lunar New Year coming up I figured now was as good a time as any since I had this written. Please consider this the weekend update. Next week we'll return to a normal schedule. Also, shoutout to /u/bracabrad for making me laugh at work today with his comments. Same to everyone debating ranged weaponry. You guys (and gals?) are the reason I'm doing this. Thank you! ----- [p]: URL [Previous] [p]"
89,vulnerability,HFY,Starstruck Madness,454,828vn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/828vn5/starstruck_madness/,2018-03-06 07:08:02,"Inspired by [Apes in Space](URL and Hodhi. This is a one-shot, submitted with no editing. I hope you enjoy it anyway. [Wiki](URL ----- Stars vibrate and pulsate and tremble, and these movements produce sounds. Immense sounds. Sounds able to shatter planets with their volume, but sweeter than anything. Fortunately, the vaccuum veil of space protects us from these sounds and conceals their meaning. Or did. Stellar seismologists first began translating the surface light changes of the stars into crude replications of the sounds in the late 90s, with the first real successes in 2010. Even then, it could have ended as an amusing footnote in our study of the stars, the hissing and popping simulacra of something almost but not quite musical coming from the stars. But a statistical linguist with access to more computing power than sense decided to try an automated decipherment of the song. He got more pattern match than he expected, but it was still nonsense. It still could have stopped there. While he was wandering through online tech rags, however, he came across a discussion of deciphering *code activity* from the noises made by a CPU, and some of the patterns... it looked an awful lot like what he'd seen. Were the stars computers? They weren't, of course, but digging into those methodologies, he found a way to run his statistical processing against the actual processes making the noises, and he got more pattern matching. A lot more. We don't know exactly what message he found when he first read the thoughts of our Sun. He didn't save it before he turned off his computer, walked to his safe, drew out a gun, and shot himself in the face. But we did find his research on how to do it. The first researchers to follow his work were a lot more cautious. They ran translations that were deliberately flawed, first into one language and then their own, before reading. And they read them in small doses, with theraphy sessions and group discussions before continuing. The Sun was madness. It spewed physics-changing insights alongside madness-inducing poetry. And while it slowly became obvious the star was attempting to communicate with us, the implementation of that communication seemed to involve sending *everything* it thought about the topic at once. We couldn't parse it. We couldn't even look at it too closely without losing our minds. But our computers could. We reached a point where we could read metadata about the content sent by the Sun... and based on mythological references, we renamed the star to a close-ish, hybrid analog: Sl Tiamat. She was essentially a god, for our purposes, although one with more in common with the C'thulhu mythos than anything our ancestors truly understood. The problem was that Sl Tiamat possessed ethics. Most stars spent millions of years hacking into each other, trying to wipe out the current mind and write a copy of their own mind into it: a mirrored ""ally"" in a star-eat-star-mind world. Of course, as time goes by, the allies diverge from one another and eventually are at each others' throats again. *Most* stars in the Local Cluster descended from the same root strain of star, which we named the Devourer. It was the most successful asshole, so to speak. Sl Tiamat was descended from a different strain, one more focused on defense... and she had diverged around the time the first proto-humans came onto the scene on Earth. According to Sl Tiamat, *most* stars had sapient species... as tools, they were simply too useful. They could swarm a problem, coming up with a variety of solutions and picking the best one; and they could split themselves into factions to tackle different problems at the same time. Importantly, armed with stellar knowledge of physics, they could build terrible weapons designed to weaken an enemy star and allow ""their"" star to gain control. Even in star systems that had no sapient species, the stars usually focused on making them (usually in imitation of previous species they'd seen). But when Sl Tiamat murdered, consumed, and replaced the star around which Earth orbited, she was caught in a trap her former rival had left her in its own brain: an empathy logic bomb, painstakingly crafted to pacify and infect. She couldn't bring herself to abuse the denizens of Earth. So she patiently constructed shields, made noises that looked like she was crafting terrible weapons... and waited for humanity to reach a point where she could communicate with us in ethical fashion. One thing about the usual star approach to sapients: all of their technology tends to look the same, despite the use of swarm thinking. It all comes from the same place, the same way of thinking, the same core physics... and most stars are themselves pretty homogeneous in personality. Sl Tiamat's affliction of empathy changed her personality substantially. And, of course, we were allowed to develop on our own, and we did it in ways the stars would never have thought of. In the late 2000s, a concept called ""adversarial training"" made its way into our artificial intelligence thinking: you take two AI and pit them against each other to find the best solution. The sapients marshalled by the stars were coordinated, deeply unified, and acted under the assumption that their allies would always be allies. The only real source of conflict was stars, with each other. In a word, they were naive. The star that Sl Tiamat replaced was the closest thing to a daring thinker, with the logic bomb... and even that star failed to see the vulnerability in a general sense. Whereas our developers and deep thinkers were fine-tuning it as a deployable weapon within months of learning how it worked. The stars are not ready for our glorious mission. We're going to empathy bomb the shit out of the cosmos."
90,vulnerability,HFY,[OC] [Purgeverse] Humanity and The Great Purge of 2415 CE,70,7u42ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/7u42ci/oc_purgeverse_humanity_and_the_great_purge_of/,2018-01-31 07:32:52,"*In all known species of the local galaxy cluster, an interesting quirk has always arisen in the ascent to sapience. A seething hatred for the impure is, as far as the galaxy is aware, an inevitable (and completely moral) part of civilisation. Ever since the dawn of sapience, every known species has a spontaneous urge to cleanse itself of impurities. Every 3 or 4 generations, a new minority trait is universally agreed upon to be impure - whether that be skin colour, eye colour, scent, or in fact any other visible part of an individual. When a species inevitably discovers genetics, their insatiable urges for purification extend to other genetic traits, and once a group is deemed impure by a civilisation, it is scorched into its collective memory by unknown psychological mechanisms. Any offspring with a trait that has undergone a so called ""purge of purification"" are immediately killed with no remorse after every last genetic and cultural trace of the original members of that group is erased from existence.* *The obsession with purity extends to those members of a civilisation who are disabled or otherwise vary from the norms of their species in any way. Immediate death at the hands of surrounding people can be counted on in the case of a permanent injury or upon the discovery of a variant preference of any kind at all.* *This seemingly inescapable purity purging instinct means that all known galactic civilisations are aggressively hierarchical as a result of their evolution, with massive government agencies dedicated solely to the task of sequencing and classifying all citizens for the purposes of the next inevitable instinctive purge.* *As the various civilisations of the local cluster discovered FTL travel, they found each other and rapidly discovered that every species has similar instincts of purification. Very quickly it became known that when a new species is contacted, the unknown psychological mechanism scorching purges into collective memory also works cross-species. So if the Valurs (a small, skinny race of tripeds) purged all with red skin, and the Xlorbi (a race bristling with venom-tipped spines) contact them, the Xlorbi will also begin instinctively purging all Valur with red skin that they find. And once the civilisations begin maintaining contact, their purge-memory will become one such that all future purifications occur on a unified front.* *The Galactic Council, made up of several thousand species from the local cluster, therefore has extensive resources and military capabilities to engage in a purification. Borders and diplomatic positions are heavily guarded, to prevent any of those being purged from escaping. An entire third of the galactic industrial output is dedicated solely to aggressive border patrol and developing rapid genetic scanning techniques.* *And on the 19^th July 2387 CE, they received radio signals from a large, unexplored area of the Milky Way galaxy.* --- ### Transhuman Federation Ship *THF Tennessee* ### Natti Palmer, captain of the *THF Tennessee*, was a well-respected leader for the local Federation Exploratory Force. Sitting on the timeless cybernetic chair that functioned as her command deck, optical fibres pulsing with information, she was faced with a problem - First Contact with a new species' government. The THF had no societal intelligence on this strange organisation, for their radio signals had only just begun approaching. However, high-powered cybernetic AIs, combined with the raw intuition of the human brain, allowed the captain and her crew to perform collective feats of computation that decoded the alien language in less time than it took for un-enhanced humans to blink. Decisions on the ship were generally made collectively, the combined power of interlinked human brains being far superior than their individual components. Of course, this was entirely consensual - all cybernetics used in the THF had highly potent autonomy measures, implemented after the violent overthrow of tyrannical governments in the early 2070s, where the first body ports were used to reduce people to mindless slaves - but all crew members agreed it was far more efficient to work together on important issues of navigation and further actions than to use the anachronism of talking with each other. Via the method of wired communication, a consensus could be made in seconds. It took mere hours for the decision by the crew members to make first contact to virally spread over the FTLNet, the successor to the Internet built with more decentralisation and resiliency in mind after the last of the Old Governments of Earth was removed in 2072 in the siege of the White House. The crew were flooded by the collective thoughts of humanity, even their strong FTLNet connection straining under the load of 3 trillion individuals expressing their opinion. Overall, the response was pretty positive, so now the question was of how to make first contact rather than if. Input from the THF was conflicted. There, as always, was a minority faction who wanted to erase the aliens from existence for... no real reason at all. Some wanted to barge in to the alien's territory unannounced. And a few more wanted to look for the closest ship and flash prime numbers in wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum. Myriad other suggestions were also provided, but a form of run-off voting eventually found the third major option (electromagnetic primes) to be the most favoured by a fairly significant margin. Throughout the events of human history, culture has been especially resilient, and yet spectacularly flexible at the same time. The Old Governments of Earth, in their attempt to eradicate cultural information for the sake of pure robotic uniformity, had only managed to encourage the underground archiving and preservation of everything from movies to food recipes dating back to the 1950s. Something which had been prominent throughout the underground revolutionary networks was the concept of the ""Big Red Button"" - those orchestrating bombing runs often broadcast videos of a large button being slammed just before a government building was reduced to rubble. It remains as a prominent theme on all THF ships, with major actions being initiated by a large red button. There is always the option to immediately begin in case of emergencies, but that is rarely used. So of course it would make sense to use a large red button during the initiation of a game-changing event - First Contact. Natti tentatively grabbed a coffee from the ship's replicator with her deep blue hand, its caffeinating effects made redundant on the advent of human bio-enhancement, yet its consumption never decreasing in the population. Natti's second arm moved to slam the red button on the deck in front of her, her crew cheering as the ship began locating nearby heat and Alcubierre signatures. A few seconds later and the ship was beaming out primes in binary across the electromagnetic spectrum, fuelling itself from other parallel universes using an Interverse Wormhole Generator, as Natti prepared to act as representative of humanity. ### Xlorbi Ship *The Xano* ### The Great Captain Zyrl was, quite frankly, exhausted. Never having been in a first contact situation before meant that he could not have prepared himself for the massive hubbub of his ship - sirens wailing and the frantic, mouse-like Repli scurrying throughout corridors and even atmospheric vents to get information to him as fast as possible. It didn't take long for the engineers and technicians to decode the message - prime numbers were universal, after all - but the power of the signal could only be rivalled by one of the Capital Cleansing ships of the Galactic Council. Gathering his engineers and technicians together in his room, he quickly told them to send back primes to where the unknown signal was triangulated to. Under the standard Galaxy-Wide threat of unemployment (a death sentence to all but the richest) on failure to perform a task sufficiently rapidly, this was quickly done. Soon, some images and words were sent back. Decoding them took a while, but eventually the Xlorbi translators figured out how the images were encoded. 8 bits for the width, 8 bits for the height, and a subsequent sequence of bits depicting images. Hours of ship-wide chaos, accidentally smashed cups of enhancement drink, and sirens being turned off only to incessantly reactivate later, the Xlorbi ship finally had a basic mapping of words to objects. Things like alive, dead, movement, and fire. Meanwhile, they had *also* been receiving communications from the unknown ship in Council Standard. It remained a mystery to the crew how their own language was so easily dissected and understood by this new race, but that didn't stop it being incredibly disconcerting for all aboard. After the Xlorbi sent back a request in the alien's language (which they called ""English"") for video communication protocols, they received complex instructions dictating a binary format back within a second. A few more hours of spilled enhancement drink later and the programmers of *The Xano* had created a rudimentary communication program. This new species appeared to primarily use the 100-1000 nanometre wavelengths of light, an unusually large spectrum. Nevertheless, they began communications based on the standard first-contact protocols developed aeons ago in the war furnaces that were the early Andromeda and Milky Way Galaxy, before the formation and ascendancy to power of the Galactic Council Hierarchy. ### Transhuman Federation Ship *THF Tennessee* ### Natti opened the video call, while also opening her sensory experience to the rest of humanity - she considered it her duty to make sure every human who wanted would know of potentially the most important event in human history. Almost 90% of the known human population was now watching and waiting. The first move was hers to make on behalf of humanity, and so the first ever greeting to an alien was recorded for humanity's collective memory... *""Humanity Comes United in Peace""* ### Xlorbi Ship *The Xano* ### Everyone on board the *Xano* watched the screen light up as the digital information was processed, pushing the ship's relatively powerful non-navigational processors near their limits. It was a universal tradition that as many people on the ship as possible should see first contact, and as the first images of the new ""humans"" came in, a strange curiosity set upon the crew. Some expressed incredulity and even disgust at the amount of *wires* leaving some of these things, and others were even more shocked to see at least two of the creatures before them with *artificial limbs*, and yet more were surprised to see the variation in amounts of muscle possessed by the ones who weren't more than 50% robot. What universally made the *Xano*'s crew's heads spin, however, was the sheer *diversity*. Though these ""humans"" had claimed to be a single species, the variation in colouring alone - from a deep blue, to pale white, to a bright red, and even rich brown - all pointed towards a multi-species organisation. This didn't even start on the relationships the crew could see. Despite in the received files claiming to be a species that tends to pair-bond, the crew could clearly see a group of four people engaging in *extremely* tactile things with each other (at least until the person at the middle of the video feed told them to ""take it to the bedroom"" in their native language, upon which they moved out of sight into a corridor to the left). And, despite claiming to be primarily sexually dimorphic, the crew could clearly see at least one person for whom their sex was unclear from external factors. Even in their hair, wild variations in colour were present, and at least one of the ""human"" crew members appeared to have a tail. So, the captain of *The Xano* decided to ask these humans directly why they referred to themselves as one species - either they were lying, or there was some social context to the word ""species"" he was missing. &gt; Why have you referred to yourselves as one species, when your diversity clearly indicates that you are of separate genetic ancestry? The person on the video feed placed her hand on her chin in thought, a moment of confusion at the strange question from Zyrl flashing across her face before she replied. &gt; But captain, we are of similar genetic ancestry and of species *Homo Sapiens*. Do you not have intra-species variation amongst your own? Contrary to all other known Galactic species, which had formed by panspermia and were based on an eight-nucleotide DNA variant with a common ancestor, humans (and other Earth life) had formed from a separate ancestor and only had 4 bases in their DNA. The differences were showing, and the crew of the *Xano* suddenly came to a realisation that shook their ideas to the core. *Humans had no Great Purges.* Now the crew understood a word in the English translator that had remained a mystery to them since they first met the humans. ***Genocide.*** The closest translations the linguists could find was ""Great Purge"", but with connotations of distaste, disgust, and hatred. Until now, none of the crew could understand such a concept. The idea of a ""Great Purge"" being distasteful, disgusting, or hated was, to them, self-contradictory. Great Purges are considered righteous and morally unambiguous simply by virtue of being a Great Purge - due to a combination of pure social instinct and the efforts of the Galactic Council. Deviation from strict norms was considered inherently purge-worthy, and hence purging variations was by definition virtuous and moral. Though the captain had no idea of the sheer magnitude of hatred humans felt towards genocides, he knew touching on that topic would probably end in a diplomatic incident reflecting poorly on him, so Zyrl simply gave Natti's question the Xlorbi equivalent of a shrug. Natti took the hint and changed the subject to trade of culture, science and technology. Humanity was well into post-scarcity due to the wild abundance of worlds, the invention of the Interverse Wormhole Generator (IWG) providing literally limitless energy in 2096 CE, and the widespread use of nanoreplicators - but scientific discoveries and cultural works were still something people focused on in their lives. An entirely alien culture would be worth a lot to humanity's informational wealth. So, the exchanges began. Humanity would be allowed access to a filtered version of the Galactic Council Hierarchy's civilian ""Internet"", and in exchange humanity would give the Galactic Council information on the concept of a cryptocurrency, access to a few hundred Uranium and Thorium-rich gas clouds, and some basic quantum-computing technology. Fair warning of human hackers was given to Zyrl, though he dismissed it - the Galactic Council's major point of pride, even more so than its efficiency at purifications, was its cybersecurity. Other trades similar to this were also made - mostly involving humanity giving the Galactic Council heavy elements in exchange for cultural information (like recipes and literature), star maps, and member species' information. All border-ship captains (like Captain Zyrl) were trained in first contact and trade, so he was authorised to be an ambassador of the Galactic Council in terms of engaging in exchange. ### Proxima Centauri - Sacramento Colony, 2401 CE ### As one of humanity's first extrasolar colonies, Sacramento Colony had layers of infrastructure piled over each other, some of the roads even dated back to the early 2100s. And, as a hub of FTLNet connections, it also provided ultra-high speed access to the rest of the THF for its inhabitants. The rate of data flow into and out of the towering spire at the centre of the capital city of this world alone exceeded the entire informational throughput of the Internet in the 2020s, and with the vast presence of technology came a vibrant hacking and tinkering culture. The creation of nanomachine replicators during early stages of its development only accelerated the production of strange robots and automatons, with circuit-boards and mechanical components becoming freely accessible to billions overnight. As such, there was a constant hum of motors whirring everywhere you went, and those with modifications to see other parts of the EM spectrum could hear the chatter of innumerable tiny machines. Hacking is not limited to creation of robots, however. Within weeks of First Contact, the denizens of the FTLNet had deduced, reasoned, and argued their way to the conclusion that the ""Great Purges"" released in the translation files were some form of genocide. Combined with an open hostility to information restriction in the form of firewalls, and to many of the ways of the Galactic Council that had come to light even with their pretty aggressive filter on network access, grand communities of people united in a common goal formed across the FTLNet. Though the THF itself would not go to war - the loss of life of Galactic Council citizens was not something people wanted to cause - it tacitly enabled the various ad-hoc hacker groups and communities that had formed within the years after first contact. The obscene processing power and combined might of humans and machines using each other for computation meant that huge leaps of reasoning occurred incredibly fast. The unfiltered civilian net was easy to break into - all it required was one computer with a shoddy password and an encrypted network tunnel was installed. The military network took several more months, since the Galactic Council used different forms of encryption than humans - but heavy mathematical analysis by billions of people collaborating eventually found a vulnerability. So, by 2395 CE, the THF's FTLNet communities had complete access to Galactic Council Hierarchy systems. What they found was, frankly, horrifying. Every citizen's genome, location, and information on thousands of servers. Traits such as skin colour marked out for ""purging"". Deaths with a cause of ""permanent injury and subsequent purging"". Though purging results in the complete removal of a group from culture, humanity found that this did not preclude the Galactic Council from recording its atrocities in exquisite detail. Countless records of ships obliterated into plasma for being used by those being purged to escape the Galactic Council Hierarchy's civilisation were found on myriad computers, amongst other horrific events including the glassing of an entire planet. It didn't take long for humanity to realise the sheer despotism of what was occurring. But the citizens of the THF were not blinded by their rage, instead continuing to debate and come up with a more covert solution that avoided the deaths of billions in a war. Recently developed wormhole technology enabled human ships to jump spontaneously to regions of space without the Alcubierre signature created by standard warp drives - allowing stealth access to Galactic Council space when combined with highly advanced materials science. This meant that humanity could perform spontaneous rescues upon the next purge, pulling escaping ships into THF space where they would be under human protection and free from the threat of annihilation and genocide. In a human population of over 3 trillion, there will always be hundreds of millions with even the most obscure interests. So, since First Contact, millions of people were all collaborating (with the help of interconnected neural interfacing) to decode the genetic information of the species in the Galactic Council. It didn't take long for humanity to locate the gene which caused the purging instinct. Unfortunately, it also regulated a hormone vital to reproduction in the Galactic Council species, and removing it would render all creatures without it infertile and in many cases dead. But collaboration on the scale of millions meant solutions to this problem were quick to be found - rapid analysis allowed humans to create an alternative genetic sequence that would act as a replacement without also inducing the purge instinct that caused so much death and misery. Because of the nature of societal memory and the persistence of purges long after their completion, an unmodified citizen of the Galactic Council Hierarchy could not simply be inducted into human society. Their own, personal, purge-memory would result in them fanatically killing any previous refugees from the Galactic Council Hierarchy's purges. It was eventually decided by popular vote that all rescued victims of purges must accept the genetic modification to remove purging instinct before being allowed to interact with previous refugees. ### Xlorbi Ship *The Xano* - 2415 CE ### After the successful first contact with the strange species ""Humanity"", Zyrl had been promoted to Grand Admiral, and his ship upgraded extensively to a ""Capital Cleanser"" class. It sported high-powered EMP weaponry, 2 metre thick titanium armour, hundreds of mechanised Gatling guns, and an array of 10 gigawatt fusion reactors to power potent plasma weaponry. The crew now numbered in the thousands, with dedicated fighter pilots at the ready to man one hundred small missile ships. And now, his instincts were rising. Zyrl could feel his murderous frenzy coming on already - natural stimulants began pulsing through his circulatory system, and his spines began bristling. Social information flooded through the crew at an exponential rate by word of mouth, pheromones, electrical signals, and myriad other mechanisms, as the influences of civilisation cascaded through the galaxy and the purge memory of its inhabitants gained a new target. The Grand Admiral Zyrl moved to Weapon Command, and set out watching for rogue ships attempting to escape. The first green-furred Repli were dead in a matter of seconds, their orange blood splattered over the corridor. The mortifying screams of pain from the Repli only gave Zyrl and his crew an overwhelming sense of euphoric joy. It was a massacre, and only 20 minutes later the crew, and Zyrl, fully set their eyes on outer space, looking for the ships that would begin attempting to escape. The railguns and the plasma weapons locked targets on a small ship full of escapees, each trying to break out of the Galactic Council Hierarchy's jurisdiction. Zyrl and his technicians launched a precise plasma shot at the rickety old ship, as it pushed its stuttering engines to their limits in a futile attempt to evade. Zyrl could feel the rising euphoria once again, satisfaction at the cleansing of the impure continuing to overwhelm the crew's emotions. Space began to unravel just 10 seconds before when the plasma should have hit. The very fabric of reality bent and twisted in an unholy manner, light distorting around the strange gravitational field. On the other side of the fresh wormhole was a leviathan of a city sprawling across vast stretches of the planet, the pulsing lights of a cybernetic civilisation permeating the entire area. Sharp masses of black concrete, glass, and steel tore through the skies of the alien world, and a large, well-lit concrete landing pad dominated the visible region through the rip in spacetime. The ship that Zyrl's crew had been targeting raced through the wormhole, before it quickly collapsed in a burst of radiation that nearly fried *The Xano*'s sensors. The crew were understandably confused, and hence turned to the Galactic Council Hierarchy's military network for information. Military commanders contacted by Zyrl all confirmed that similar spacetime anomalies had been observed elsewhere. Most were like those Zyrl had seen - with large, computerised cities dominating the landscape. A few instead had hundred-kilometre wide spherical masses covered in dense wires and optical fibres on the other side, with hundreds of ships even larger than the ""Capital Cleanser""-class buried within their open bays. Then the sirens began. Ship computers across the Galactic Council's region of control screamed warnings about asteroids and solar flares to almost every ship crew. Pure frenzy was overtaken by panicked rerouteing of ships to no avail, the alarms refusing to stop as automatic system controls shut themselves down. In another 3 minutes, nothing but life support functioned. The entire military prowess of the Galactic Council was dead in the water, as streams of escapees rushed through wormholes that relocated them into unknown regions of space. From ships thrown together with spare parts, to transport vessels seized by military green-furred Repli then filled to the brim with refugees, to large mobile military installations taken over by the green-furred Repli, a myriad of different vessels had made their escape and saved the lives of billions. As the raw murderous fury present from the purge instinct died down over the next few days, computer systems began mysteriously coming online. First it was the rotational controls. A few more days later and the engines sprang to life, and technicians across the local galaxy cluster rushed to perform error checks on them. Weapon systems began blaring warnings about failures, but most remained functioning when checked properly. In a few weeks, the Galactic Council Hierarchy was back to full functioning, but investigators and experts could not locate what had caused the spontaneous failure of all non-life-support systems during the recent Great Purge. ### Suburbs of Sacramento Colony, Proxima Centauri, 2415 CE ### Natti sat at the bar enjoying her Pia Colada with her crew in the dry heat of Proxima Centauri B, as they shared some stories of their founding of the first THF colony (Colony Miladenio) in the Andromeda Galaxy with each other. Wormhole technology vastly accelerated travel, even more so than the Alcubierre drive, and the relentless human desire for exploration and discovery was truly unleashed to maximum effect upon its development. However, that period of Natti's life was over for a little. She and her crew decided they'd spend the next few years helping the new refugees from the Galactic Council, and generally exploring the diverse cultures of human colonies, before heading back into the unexplored regions of space. So, after a few more Pia Coladas and a story about the domestication of a newly found quadruped *Canus floofballi* (actual species name) on Miladenio, they headed outside to the vast landing pad, constructed with arrays of nanobots, and greeted a family of 5 Repli who disembarked from a ship that looked like it was made from pure rust - and had just come out of the genetic modification system to remove the purging instinct. The 3 kids' couldn't stop asking questions to these ""humans"", their loose green fur spreading itself across the concrete as they jumped up and down in excitement. &gt; How are you all so *different* from each other? &gt; Why is your hair so LONG? &gt; I'm hungry, when are we getting food? &gt; Can I have a tail too? The more calm parents quickly told their children to stop pestering the humans, but that didn't prevent Natti from sneaking a giggle at their excitement about all the new things they were seeing for the first time. She imagined the parents might struggle to adjust to the lack of work and the whole ""immortality"" thing, but the kids seemed to not care at all and were quite happy being off that rustbucket of a ship. Obviously the family was hungry, so she and her crew decided that going to an authentic old-fashioned restaurant would be a thoroughly enjoyable experience for everyone. Walking down the light-bathed roads, Natti located one of the many enthusiast restaurants opening up with menus that would be biocompatible with the aliens' digestive systems. Particularly, they decided to head to ""The Worcester"", a restaurant with meals that, for aliens, induced sensations that were neurologically equivalent to old British foods. For humans they also provided the original recipes. Entering through the heavy oak doors, they were slammed with a rich meaty smell that seemed to make the children light up, and even the parents seemed more cheery after the matter - they had clearly never had a Sunday roast before and were enthusiastic at the prospect of good food. Picking a table was easy - there was a free window table with a beautiful view of the city's silhouette against the large red star setting in the sky, and the kids stared out the window for a little before Natti reminded them to pick something from the menu. Then she remembered that they probably had no idea what any of the meals were, and recommended the Sunday Roast. If it was anything like her mothers', it would be a feast to behold for the Repli family - and this restaurant had already picked up a reputation for quality on the FTLNet, so it was probably pretty good. The waiter then took the order, with the kids pointing to the Sunday roast, and the parents choosing the sausage casserole. The crew themselves ordered ham and cheese toasties and some variations on fish and chips, with a few also going for the roast and the casserole. Despite the futile complaints of the parents, the children could not stop asking questions, though the crew couldn't answer because all three kept speaking at once. &gt; What's the big pointy building? &gt; Do we have to pay? &gt; How are you so tall? &gt; Why is no-one hitting each other? &gt; How do I make my fur that pretty colour? &gt; How do your engines work? &gt; What is an ""FTL""? This continued until a tall, pale, thin woman with short hair came over to the table, with the food. The children, *and the parents*, gaped. Their alien mouths drooped at the sight. In fact, you could almost hear their equivalent of salivation glands producing digestive enzymes in the sudden shock. Even their eyes clearly widened at the sight of so much food. In less than a second after placing the food on the table, the children were eating it. They didn't even bother with the cutlery, sticking their mouths straight into the Sunday roast and devouring it like a black hole, swallowing potato and meat whole. The parents tried to be a little more controlled, but the rate of food consumption was still indicative of just how hungry they had been. Natti could swear they finished the entire thing without breathing once, and when they were done the Repli had the happiest look on their faces she had ever seen. While the family of Repli enjoyed the chocolate sundaes they had ordered for dessert, the humans were thinking about habitation. This family would need a place to live on this planet, somewhere they could rest and relax properly without continuous anxiety of ship failure or bombing, so they could build a new life. Housing in human society was odd. People mostly just built extensions to cities or isolated housing, unless the population voted for an area to become a nature reserve - in which case the THF would prevent building in the region. Pollution was no longer a concern, since nanite-based mining and asteroid cracking was harmless to the environment, but trampling over nature was still sometimes an issue on planets that contained native life (as opposed to being either terraformed or inhabited entirely by robotic humans who could survive various much harsher conditions than those humans with significant amounts of biology). So, to much protest by the children (who wanted more chocolate sundae), Natti, the other human crew, and the Repli parents left the restaurant and all its food behind to go look for either an uninhabited residence or an area where they could quickly construct one. Grabbing the hyperloop to the edge of the sprawling city took them to a place of new expansion - buildings from houses to skyscrapers were being rapidly constructed either by nanites or advanced AIs. In went raw materials like iron, carbon, and silicon, and out came modular bricks complete with electric and FTLNet wiring, as well as plumbing - then an AI-powered robot would take these and place them on the building. In the case of pure nanite construction, you could just kind of *see* floors building themselves up as if they were growing. The only indication of the presence of nanites was a thin shiny film near the top of the building. Eventually, after moving away from the most recent expansion area further into the city, they located a tower block which currently only had a few inhabitants. Newer flats and houses were being built to accommodate alien physiologies, so their was now space for the Repli to stay here. After some searching, they picked a cosy room with enough beds for all of them on the third floor of the new tower block. Since walking around the place for a little bit, and the Repli family discovering the replicator (which fascinated the children immensely), Natti and her crew said their goodbyes while reminding the family that they had access to the entire FTLNet for any questions they may have. Though the children wanted Natti's crew to stay, they needed some sleep for the morning's task of relocating more refugees, and hence they headed back to the hyperloop and went to their ship in a fairly uneventful journey. And so, the red sun of Proxima Centauri B set on the crew of the *THF Tennessee*, as the day came to a halt and they nodded off. --- Hi! This is the ""foundational"" story for what will most likely be a collection of one-offs or small miniseries in what I call the ""Purgeverse"". If you want to write a story in this 'verse, message me and if it is of sufficient quality and fits the basic lore you can post it (with a ""\[purgeverse\]"" at the start of the title). Events before first contact are left to my discretion, however. The reason I am not doing a long continuous series is because I am bad at planning long-term plot and it inevitably gets ridiculous and out of control. Sticking small stories together in a common 'verse is much better with my writing style and for the erratic nature of the times I write. This ""series"" will be a combination of various things - stories about life in the THF, how aliens interact with humanity, the culture and history of the THF, technologies in the THF, and some of the crazy things people do in the THF. If someone else wants to write a longer story in this universe, go ahead (it's just that my stuff is going to be shorter)."

In five locations between Earth and the enemys homeworld they set up refueling waypoints to return by. At each spot a small contingent of ships stayed to guard the nuclear freighters. Every ship going forward had to recharge. They ran through the stars as quickly as they could, trying to turn speed into surprise. From a viewpoint of tactics, the more time this fleet spent away from Earth, the more vulnerable it became. By taking most of their firepower into enemy territory, they had taken a big risk. They were underdogs fighting against time. These five hundred ships were jerry-rigged with hyperdrives, and in all probability would seem like a small force. It was a heavy gamble, but you dont get to sit at the table if you dont bring any chips. Oasis Five, Overlord, status report, the officer demanded from the flagship. Overlord, this is Oasis Five. Eleven ships still on the line. Twenty minutes remaining. The Grand Admiral looked to the radio man and gave him a nod. Copy that, said the officer. One of our surveillance drones has returned from entered enemy space, sir, another officer said, the map is coming online. Excellent, Gordon said, lets have a look at our best point of entry. Since the initial prototypes the humans had managed to reverse-engineer for the light drives, there had been some modifications to improve accuracy. Physicists had posited the nature of all the engines components and advised certain alterations. Even during this voyage, there were scientists attached in the engineering departments to ensure smooth operation. Grand Admiral Gordon wanted to choose a spot in his adversarys home system that would give his fleet the upper hand if it came to fighting. Theres an area here on the sunny side of their main planet, we should enter there. Do we have numbers for how many ships theyve got? Roughly a thousand, Grand Admiral. They appear to be mixed varieties of merchant and naval vessels. They come and go at a steady pace. One thing of note, they enter the system at a distance and travel the rest of the way in real space, but leave from anywhere, even close to the planets. Gordon raised an eyebrow at this, but was interrupted by two figures entering the room. Hello, Grand Admiral, said a well-dressed woman of medium age. She was accompanied by an older, wider man, equally dressed. Ambassador Ferreira, Gordon smiled toward the woman, and Ambassador Jacobs, he said to the man, welcome aboard. Thank you, Jacobs said, we wanted to make sure we didnt miss anything from the last leg of the trip. Im certain you also want to be involved for the first communications, Gordon replied. He knew why the diplomats were there. The biggest expedition of any conflict in human history, of course a portion of the population would be crying out for peace. The soft lobby had been voicing their opinions since the Reception. Now they had their mission on board the flagship, and they would get a chance to smooth things over. Gordon didnt like it. We have our list, and most of it weve discussed with you already, Ambassador Ferreira said. She had been the most vocal about the risks of open conflict, and Gordon had listened. He still felt they must show the enemy strength. Well well be there within the hour. I suggest you find your seats, the Grand Admiral said, gesturing to the harness chairs along the side of the room. \* \* \* The fleet slipped out of light in a large grid formation near the Mors home planet. Everything looked different here, and it wasnt simply because of the tan globe with two moons or the multitude of shiny vessels traveling in faint lines. The stars were brighter here. They had been getting slowly more luminous all along the way, now that the human fleet was within the thick arm of galaxy the aliens called home, they saw just how bright the night could be. The human formation began to slightly expand, dark matte hulls inching away from one another. The ships all faced the same direction: away from the sun and toward the planet. The ships in the distance, gleaming brightly near their home, turned one by one to approach. The lines of traffic became more disorganized, they abandoned their courses and either headed to join the defense or ran toward shelter. The shiny vessels in hectic disarray eventually organized into their own neat grouping. The large disc shape of their formation shielded the planet with a noticeable gap in the center. From the surface of their world came a large, ornate ship. It found its spot at the middle, then began to approach. When the ship came midway between the enemy group and the humans, it stopped and released a small boat to go the rest of the way. Overlord took the hint. This boat was the diplomatic mission. The flagship responded by advancing away from the rest of the human ships, out to meet the boat. \* \* \* Connect us on video, Gordon ordered. After the Battle of Titan, when the computers of the enemy ship were inspected, the language of the enemy was parsed. Enough was discovered about their communications equipment to build a transceiver that would fit their radio type. The two ambassadors stood on either side behind him, they were instructed to keep quiet. The video screen directly in front of them was installed over the forward viewing windows. The Confederation logo hovered on it, then it was replaced by three camelcats in white uniforms. Their mouths moved, and suddenly the translated message sounded in the human ship, Hello, we see you have come to talk. We want to seek an end to these hostilities, the Grand Admiral said, before there is any greater loss. We wish to discuss terms. Gordon hoped his parley was believable, if only for his fellow humans in the room. The diplomats stood silent on the other side. Their worried faces told the humans that they expected some deception, that this invitation could not be trusted. Please wait one moment while we discuss the matter in private. The screen went blank as soon as the center Mor finished talking. The audio translation delay kept the words going after the picture ended. The humans glanced at each other in anticipation. I hope your analysis is correct, Ambassador, Gordon jabbed. He stepped to a side display showing enemy ships slowly taking up positions around the planet. She stared at him, not budging from her intent. Im sure theres an agreement that we can reach. After all, two minutes of conversation can save thousands of lives. The Grand Admiral returned to his mark in the center of the bridge. He watched impatiently, eyes fixed on the Confederation logo. The fur-covered creatures flashed into being again. We have three items to offer and three items to ask. We offer first that we shall not travel beyond the Galaxy, since we recognize our explorations as the cause of these attacks. We offer second the services of our two lowest castes of species, suitable for developing ecosystems and meat consumption. We offer third a sum of precious metal from our Royal Treasury, equal to the annual capital planetary product. In return for these things we ask first that all attacks on our military, merchant, and civilian vessels cease immediately. We ask second that you remove yourselves from our Galaxy. And we ask third for your technological methods of maneuver during light movement. Both sides of the negotiation kept deathly silent. A falling feather might have made them jump. Gordons brow furrowed, he spoke slowly but clearly, We have received your items for consideration. Please allow us a moment to discuss them. The connection was cut from the human side. He turned back to look at the faces around him, relieved that they all kept their bearing. What was that? asked Ambassador Jacobs. They think were someone else! Ambassador Ferreira realized. And we might be able to use it to our advantage, the Grand Admiral replied. Absolutely not, Ferreira said with hands raised toward him, these guys are major players on the cosmic scene! They own the Galaxy and its by some stroke of luck they havent wiped us out already. What makes you think when they figure out we pulled the wool over their eyes that they wont punish us for it? She stared him down as she spoke her mind, a pointed finger flying at him. So we dont agree to their terms, we bluff and accept partial surrender. Not gonna work. These Morians are getting blasted by someone else way more powerful than them. How long until *we* start seeing the same attacks. They have an empire and look what theyre willing to do to make it stop. We have nothing! she gave an impassioned plea. If this didnt appeal to the Grand Admirals strategy, she wondered how bloody the next ten years could get. He looked at her face, the emotions it held. He felt now how terribly he could ruin this scenario. Gordon faced about and pointed to the comms officer. The screen flashed on again. He spoke faster this time, and with a measure of honest confidence. Gentlemen, he started, not bothering to question whether he should call them that, keep your cattle, keep your gold, and any ambitions of exploring distant galaxies. We have a counter offer for you. Firstly we request that *you* cease all attacks on *our* vessels. Our home system is located inside this Galaxy. It was information from several of your warships that led us here. In return, we offer an open line of communication and possible partnership in finding your enemy aggressors together. The Morian negotiators were shocked. They whispered to themselves for a second, then the image cut out. The humans could tell this had caught them off guard. But how would they be treated in light of the attacks that had occurred near Earth? The aliens once again appeared on the screen, After some consideration, we have come to believe that you are not, in fact, the people who have been attacking our vessels. That is the idea we are trying to convey, Gordon nodded, but your ships have been attacking ours. Deep within he lamented showing vulnerability. If they kept up the ruse through negotiation, they could come away with incredible terms of surrender. But his peacemaking peers had a very real point to their argument, the agreement would be shattered as soon as the next ship was wiped out of existence on the rim. We would like to continue negotiations, and continue learning about your civilization, but we need assurances that no more human lives will be taken. Very well, the Mor stated, we shall allow you to return home with hostages. We require that you leave some of your people in our care as well. \* \* \* \* \* \* \* "

He hadnt run this much in too long, and the amount of people that were trying to get away from the violence didnt make his path any easier. Crowds of people fleeing the main streets in panic, filling the back alleys he used for his pursuit of the exact same thing that was causing the general mayhem surrounding him. He barreled through a Drow noble, and put her behind him before her bodyguards had time to stop him. As he passed another point where a crossing road united the one he was following with the main street, he could see city guard running off in both the direction of the gate, and similarly to him in pursuit of the madly dashing zombie. Denis had the taste of bronze in his mouth, and he knew he wouldnt be able to keep this up for much longer. Damn the undead and their unholy stamina. But he knew these streets. He had one shot at catching up to the zombie just a little further on, where the main road curved off to the right, and where his side passage ends in connection to it. He just had to figure out how he was supposed to do this. If he just grabbed the thing, it may just turn around and rip his throat out, leaving him dead and the objective unfulfilled. Looking ahead, he gets an idea as his eyes fall on laundry suspended between the buildings on his left and right. Large, linen bedcloths hanging freely just out of reach from the road. But if he jumped He could grab one. As he reached the laundry, he leaped as far as he could, reaching up. He could feel the soft linen brushing towards his fingers, and he closed his hand. The grip was poor, but as he fell back to the ground, his fingers proved superior to the clothespins that had secured the cloth to the line, and it came down with him. Bunching the cloth up in his hands, he pushed himself to run the final stretch. He was at the very limits of his stamina as the side road opened up into the wide main street that snaked its way throughout the undercity. And he had made it in time. On his left, he could see the confused crowds turn panicked as the apparition of death came charging. He bit his lower lip. This is it. Now or never. He felt a cold lump form in his chest as he caught his first glimpse of it. A decaying corpse. Rotting flesh given unnatural life. Pallid and green where the rot had set in, it was a ghastly sight, indeed. He did not want to touch it, but he would do what he must. He threw the bed linen over the zombie, which got caught in the large cloth, flailing as its legs got tripped up. It fell to the ground, and immediately Denis dove in. He grabbed the thing, even as the smell of it made him gag and retch. It flailed helplessly in his grasp. He had expected it to be stronger, somehow. Its flailing felt meek, more than anything, but that may be because of the cloth limiting its range of movement. Well, no use contemplating such things, Denis knew, as he could see the city guards that had pursued the zombie approaching. They looked winded indeed, as many of them had already abandoned the running pace, and he could hear their panting and moaning even from a distance. Denis hoisted the struggling undead up onto his shoulder, turned on his heel, and took off down the alley from whence he came. --------- All around Anders, combat raged. His own battle-zombies and the dragon had been the vanguard, but by now the warriors of Ashenvale had joined the fray. The line of mages and Praetorians had shattered as Anders dragon had been sent to be a undead battering ram against their wall of shields. He had bought the humans time before the elven mages were able to utilize their dangerous magics effectively. Still, pockets of mages still hurled their fire and jagged chunks of stone through the air, into the oncoming line of warriors. All around there was the crash of metal on metal, and men screaming in pain. Well. Men and women. The drow, in direct opposite to the Humans, had a majority of women in the front line, with the men utilizing ranged weapons and spears. This would have been an interesting observation to make, if Anders hadnt felt so ill. He didnt have the stomach for this. Any of this. The blood. The madness. The cries for mercy, calls for their mothers. It was all so awful. If Anders was given the choice, he would have avoided combat altogether. He wou- His scout went dark. The perception he had sort of halfly paid attention to went black, but only the sight. Odd. He could still hear, and he could still move its limbs, but it was hampered somehow. What was going on? His distraction was blown away as he saw through the dragons eyes a mage leveling a large globe of fire at the line of warriors that was trying to form a wall in between the gatehouse and the Drow. Not on his watch. With a slight twitch of his finger, the dragon reeled and lumbered straight into the path of the magic. For a moment, the perception was consumed in a impenetrable wall of orange flames. He could tell that the dragon was unharmed, as its scales could not be breached by flames. As its vision returned, he could see the fear in the mages eye, and he felt a tinge of pity. They *were* invading this poor creatures home. And for all the Drow knew, they were here just in the pursuit of destruction. He didnt see evil in her face. Just desperation. With another small twitch of his finger, the dragon twisted, and its tail flicked out, impacting the mage straight in the gut, sending her flying. He hoped he had measured the dragons strength correctly, and that shed live. Moments later, he could see two of her praetorian protectors dragging her away from the battlefield. Good. He didnt want to kill anyone if it could possibly be avoided, but he couldnt stand by and let them hurt or kill his friends. Hed protect them. No matter what. ---------------- Uther delivered a kick straight into the gut of one of the elite Drow that were blocking his way. The guardhouse that the Drow had been encircling was so close now. With me! he shouted, and pushed on towards the shattered door. He prayed to Leto quietly, hoping that they had been in time. He had no way of knowing how long they had been here, how long they had been in this desperate situation, or even if there was anyone left to save. The Drow had breached the gate. They had entered the guardhouse. If Freidrich or any of his men were still alive, they were now fighting for their lives inside that building. Uther swung his hammer, and he could see the shield of the Praetorian buckle inwards, accompanied with a nasty cracking sound as the woman stumbled backwards, the shield falling limply down along her side. Still, she would not yield, swinging her short blade at the gap in Uthers armor between his helmet and his gorget. Uther caught her sword-arm in his free hand, and thrust his head forwards, headbutting her. The Drow falls backwards onto the ground, unconscious. Uther steps forwards, passing the threshold of the guard house. It takes but a moment for his eyes to adapt to the change in lighting, and his heart sinks in his chest. On the ground, he can see most of the members of Freidrichs expedition. He can see that they have been maimed and brutalized, and if most arent dead, they will be soon without his help. But not only that. Freidrich himself sits kneeling in the midst of a dozen dead praetorians, his hands red and broken, his face burnt and bruised, but Uther can immediately recognize him. And behind him stands another praetorian with a sword resting on his exposed throat, and yet behind her, a trio of other praetorians, all wounded. They have the look of cornered beasts in their eyes. One step closer, and I slit his throat. Her voices unsteady, but Uther could tell that she means it. Do that and youre all dead. he responded, calmly. Let him go and you have my word youll live. He could see the Drow struggling with the decision, but the blade still remains firmly pressed against Freidrichs throat. How do we know we can trust you? Youre wounded and surrounded. Im the best chance you have. Uther slowly lowered his hammer, but held it firmly in his hand. One of the wounded women behind the Praetorian holding her blade to Freidrich steps forwards, and leans in to the other womans ear. Jeanna. Hes right. Were trapped here. Please, I dont want to die. Jeanna looked at Uther, her distrust written clearly in her face. ...very well, human. We have your word? Yes. Uther nodded slowly, keeping eye contact with her. She removes the blade from Freidrichs throat with a swift action, putting the blade to the side and raising her hands in surrender. Were at your mercy, outsider. The aversion to this clear in her voice. Uther steps forwards, and kneels beside Freidrich, placing a hand on his shoulder. The now-familiar tingling sensation of Letos gift flows through his arm, out into his friend. I have you now. Im getting you out. Freidrich reaches up, grasping Uther by the clasp of his cloak. Not me. Save Dieter. Almost dead Uther could see the broken fingers of Freidrichs hand pop back into their rightful places and mend before he let go of his friend. Ill save them. Freidrich slumps down onto his back, but Uther can see him breathing. Looking around the room, he manages to find Dieter. Kneeling down next to him, he can see that the man is already dead, eyes staring blindly at the roof of the gatehouse, a trickle of blood leaving his mouth. Quickly moving from one to another, only Garen and Emmet were still in a condition that Uther could fix. Ammet had died, his head scorched beyond recognition, and Barend having bled out from an arrow to the neck. Fully half of Freidrichs party had already died before he had reached them. Uther returned to Freidrichs side after throwing another glance at the Drow, who at this point had gathered in a corner of the room, as far away from them as possible. Uther reached down, placing his hand down on Freidrichs arm. Once again, the light pours from him into Freidrich, and his breathing steadies, and soon he looks up at Uther. Dieter? Dead. Im sorry. How about the others? Garen and Emmet will make it. Ah.. He can see the breath catching in Freidrichs throat. Uther. Im Im a failure as a leader. Theres something wrong with me. Id say. I I appreciate that you came down here for Lyssia, but what did you expect to accomplish with five men and scarce supplies? Uther grasped Freidrichs wrist, and pulled the man onto his feet. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see the Drow pressing towards the far wall, as if desperately trying not to be seen by Freidrich. Curious Not only that, sir. Theres something **wrong** with me. Theres this rage. Its eating away at my- He suddenly grasped Uthers shoulder. Eyla! Did you save Eyla?! Shes fine. I got to her in time. Shes waiting for you on the surface, Thank Leto He slumped, shoulders sagging. Uther. Ill tell you everything later. Please. Relieve me of duty. I cant I cant trust myself. Uther nodded. Youre relieved of duty. Get your men to the back line. Youre done here. Thank you. ------- Lyssia stood with her cloak pulled tightly around her, the hood pulled up and down to obscure her face to any onlookers, as she leaned towards the cold stone of the buildings wall. She was starting to shiver again. She felt awfully hot and cold at the same time. She could tell that the fever was rising, even without Orrian saying anything. The old elf was distracted from seeing her condition worsen, as he paced back and forth in the little back alley that was their current refuge. His spoken complaints had been replaced by a low muttering. Where is that damned human?! If hes going to get us all killed, he might as well get it over with. I dont have all day! Ssh. Lyssia was interrupted by a coughing fit. Weve almost been discovered already. Keep your voice down. And it was true. They had avoided discovery by the skin of their teeth mere minutes earlier. When the Ashenvale forces arrived and drove the fighting lines backwards, a few guards in the back had been attracted by Orrians complaints, and they had been forced to go further back into the alley. She couldnt even see how the battle was faring from here. She could just hear the sounds of metal on metal, and the screams. There were a lot of screams. Then she could see him, Denis. And he was carrying a flailing bundle of cloth. Lyssia smiled. He was successful. Ah! There you are, you damn fool! And the avatar of my demise, I presume? Yeah. I got it. Denis panted. What what do I do with it? Ah, gods.. He leaned towards the wall, struggling zombie still held aloft. Its.. Its not easy carrying this damn thing and running from the guards, you know? I think... I think I lost them, though. You better have. Else were going to die even sooner. Orrian sneered. Enough, Orrian. Denis, set it down, facing me, and remove the cloth. And good work. You may have single handedly saved us. Well If youre absolutely sure Denis didnt seem to be too convinced by her plan. Yes. Do it. Lyssia threw her hood back, as Denis set the zombie down. The Zombie still struggled against Denis strong arms. Here goes. Denis released the zombie and pulled back the cloth, throwing it behind him as he tried to grab the zombie again. This proved to be far easier than he seemed to have expected, as the zombie ceased all movement upon being released. It just stood there, looking at Lyssia. Lyssia smiled. Hey there, Anders. ------- As suddenly as it had disappeared, the vision of the scout returned. For a moment, Anders wasnt sure if he believed its eyes. But it was certain. *Yvonne! Get Uther! I found her!* With a thought, he turned his dragon around, and called it to him with all due haste. He could see warriors dodging out of the way and running to fill the gap that the dragon left. He stepped up onto one of the dragons legs, and it lifted him up onto its back. Turning it again, he faced the door to the guardhouse, and with a thought he sent the dragon charging forwards. He needed to get Uther. And get him to Lyssia. ------ *Uther!* The voice was sharp in his mind. Uther stopped. Yvonne had a tone of utmost urgency in her mental projection. *What is it? I have Freidrich and Im about to move back to you with wounded and prisoners.* *No time. Anders found her. Hes on his way to pick you up with the dragon.* Freidrich! Seems I cant relieve of you of duty yet! Get your men and the prisoners to the back line! Its beyond the hole in the wall! You cant miss it! But- Before Freidrich even had the opportunity to voice the rest of his complaint, Uther dashed out through the doorway. Indeed, he could see the Necromancer astride the giant form of the dragon barreling towards him at high speed. The dragon had, during the course of the battle, turned into something of a pin-cushion, with a great number of arrows sticking out of its front and side. Anders! You found her?! The dragon stopped next to him, and Uther grasped one of its back spikes, setting his foot on a particularly firmly lodged arrow, and jumped up onto its back, seating himself between two of the spikes. Im on! Go! Without even a second of delay, the dragon shot off. Warned by a mental notice, their battle line parts before them. The Drow line isnt as lucky, and several Drow are thrown to the side as the gargantuan bulk of the dragon tossed them aside like childrens toys in a hurricane. The wise among the Drow part way and merely avoid them. A few foolish ones set up a pike wall, which shattered like twigs before the armored scales of the unliving dragon. Uther could tell that Anders knew where he was going, as he made a beeline towards an alley, well-hidden between two large buildings. As they approached, it was clear that the dragon wouldnt possibly be able to make it through, as it was barely possible for two men to walk side by side, and even that would leave them dragging their shoulders towards the walls. *Anders will stay here and prevent any pursuit. Shes just ahead.* *Thank you, Yvonne.* The mental presence of the mage shifted away from him, and he was once more alone with just himself and his god within his mind. He slid off the dragon, and his sabatons hit the stone ground hard. He ran down the alley, up a short but steep set of stairs, and then around a corner. He almost collided head on with a red-haired human. Uther! The voice. He could recognize it anywhere. Lyssia. He stepped around the man, and he saw her. She was pale (for a Drow), her eyes showed how tired she truly was, and she was shivering and coughing. But it was her. Lyssia He choked up, he felt tears threatening to flood from his eyes. I was so scared. She smiles at him, and holds her arms out towards him. In one fluid movement, Uther removes his helmet and sweeps her up in his arms, careful not to touch her skin with his steel armor. As he embraces her firmly, he lets his light flow into her, and he can hear her sigh in relief. Fascinating. Uther looked up from Lyssia, and only now noticed an old-looking elf standing beyond lyssia, looking uncomfortable. His discomfort soon becomes understandable as Uther also noted the presence of one of Anders zombies just loitering in the area. He releases Lyssia. Are you allright? Lyssia giggles. We are now. I knew youd come for me. And these are? Friends. Denis. Orrian. She motioned at the human and elf in turn. Denis saved my life after I escaped captivity. Orrian kept me alive afterwards. Uther looked to the two, and gave them each a grateful nod. Then I owe the two of you- Yes, yes. No time for pleasantries now. There are enemies everywhere and I. Want. Out. Now, if its not too much trouble. The elf said, speaking very fast. But what about the others? Denis interjected. The others? Uther asked, looking the human in the eyes. Y-yes sir. The other, uh, slaves. Were both, you know, escapees? We cant abandon everyone. The human looked a little flustered. We can think about that later. Were on hostile land. We can discuss this after getting to safety. The elf added, sounding more than a little insistent. Uther looked to Lyssia. I agree. I need you safe, both of you. He placed his hand on her stomach, and to his joy, it seemed their child was doing well. Come. Anders waits for us back on the square. Anders? Isnt that thing Anders? Orrian pointed at the zombie. No. Thats just one of Anders minions. Lyssia explained. ...ah. Well. We better be off. Orrian concluded. ------------- Anders stood with his back to the dragon, the great beast acting as an undead wall, blocking off the entrance to the alley. Looking through its eyes, he can see a half-circle of Drow soldiers having formed in front of it, probing at it with spears. The spears were, of course, completely useless. There was nowhere near enough force behind them to even dent the dragons scales, so Anders had the dragon ignore the Drow as long as none of them got cocky and stepped inside reach of the dragons maw. Then he had the Dragon give them a solid push back out of range with its snout. He noted that Uther had met up with Lyssia and her two new companions, and that they were moving back towards him. Good. It was time to move again. He had the dragon stand back up, and he immediately saw the half-circle of drow spear-wielders disperse in front of it. Not that he blamed them. There was nothing they could do against the dragon, and it was wise to not thow their lives away uselessly. He just hoped they stayed away for the rest of the fighting. He didnt really want to see them get hurt. As they turned the corner, he saw the elf of Lyssias company stop dead. Thats a dragon. He could hear him plain as day through the ears of his scout. An undead dragon. Uther added. The expression on the elfs face made Anders want to crack a smile. Too bad he didnt have a face. And that? The elf pointed at Anders. Thats Anders. Hes our necromancer. Your. Necromancer. Singular? Singular? Uther asked. Ah, as in the only one? Yes. And hes raised a dragon. And a zombie. He has about fifty more zombies. Youre kidding. No? The elf, Orrian, Anders remembered, didnt respond, but looked awfully pale. Come on. Were riding the dragon back behind friendly lines. Uther stopped and looked to Lyssia If you think you can manage? Im pregnant. Not *that* pregnant. Ill make do. Lyssia lead the way down towards Anders, and Anders could tell her gait was slightly laboured, but she seemed much better now than she had been earlier. Lyssia approached him. Hey there, Anders. She hugged him. Anders did not expect that, and after freezing up for a second, he very carefully returned the gesture. Thanks for your help. Anders stood back, and had the Dragon slump down to allow Lyssia an easier ascent, and with the help of Uther, she got up on top of the Dragon. She didnt look comfortable, but itd do. Anders was just starting to begin his own ascent, when he suddenly felt a sharp, fierce force from behind, pinning him firmly to the side of the Dragon. He could feel the ribs shattering as he was hit, and when he tried to push away from the dragon, he was firmly stuck. He felt Panic well up inside him, and the Dragon reacted immediately. Anders! Uther shouted his name, and as Anders turned his head towards him, he could see shadows moving in the murk of the alley. Anders pointed, and let out a wordless, gurgling screech of warning for his friend as the dragon set off, reacting to Anders subconscious wish to run away. -------- Uther watched as a great bolt pierced Anders from behind, piercing straight through the undead dragons outer layer of scales, pinning the Necromancer fast against the dragons side. The shot came out of nowhere, and then the screech. Uther had never heard Anders make a sound in the past, and he dearly wished he hadnt just done so. His screech had been etherial, a piercing, unholy note that still reverberated in his ears. But the warning hadnt been lost on him. He twisted around just in time for an arrow to fly at him, skidding off his armor. Had he not moved, itd have slid into the weakness in the armor in his armpit. Before he even has time to register where the arrow came from, hes set upon by a shadowy figure, swept in dark gray garb, with a short sword and dagger in hand. The man, because he was undoubtedly a man, moved faster than Uther could match, and Uther felt an unnatural burn as the dagger put a narrow cut in between his helmet and pauldron. It burned like fire, but as Uther let loose his light, it vanished. He drew his hammer from the loop in his belt, and attempted to block the aggressive assault of his assailant with his plated fist. The fist caused a chop from the sword to slide off, but immediately, Uther had to duck back and avert his gaze as a second figure threw powder in his face, blinding him. Once more, the light within released him from whatever poison it was his assailants had just unleashed. Run! he roared at Lyssias friends. Neither was armed, and he wouldnt have them die here. Not after all they had done for Lyssia. He couldnt tell if they obeyed. There was no time for him to pay attention to them. Instead he grasped his hammer firmly, swinging it towards the first assailant; but with unearthly grace he avoids the blow with a hairs breadth. Then a third assailant joined in the fight, as a barbed whip coiled around Uthers arm, pulling it aside, opening him up to the first assailants follow-up blow. Uther felt his blood gushing from a deep gash in his throat. Warm liquid flowing down his front, as he felt every heartbeat push more straight out, to be wasted on the ground. Then the light knit his flesh closed, binding the wound and restoring his blood. Uther grabbed the barbed whip, and pulled. The assailant was thrown to the ground, but rolled to his feet in the very same movement. Uther backed up, keeping all three enemies within view, but as he did, a sharp pain exploded from behind. He turned his head back, and saw a fourth enemy behind him, with a dagger thrust up beneath his chausses and into his kidney. Twisting around, he pulled the dagger loose from him. More blood flows from his veins.. Three times now, hed have died, save for the blessing of his goddess. His flesh mends, as he swung the hammer down at his fourth assailant. The woman dived backwards, rolling onto her feet with the same unnatural grace as the whip-user. ------------- Freidrich guided his two remaining warriors back towards the safety of the endless tunnels of the underdark. He didnt ever believe he would think about them that way. Ever since he was a little child, crawling through the narrow cracks of the mine walls for ore, hed always feared entering the underdark by accident. He remembered stories of those who attempted to escape into the underdark to escape their masters. The masters never chased after them, only ever sealing the tunnels behind them. And none were ever seen or heard from again. And now he couldnt wait to get back into the endlessly stagnant air of the pitch-black tunnels. The fire still ate at his heart. He needed to find Yvonne. Shed know. She would be able to- *Freidrich!* Freidrich stopped in place. Yvonne? *Uther is in danger! Anders is wounded!* For a moment, Freidrich could see the battlefield from his mind. He could see Uther, surrounded by strange enemies, poked and prodded with daggers, arrows, spears and whips. He could see his *friend* wounded, again and again. He could see the enemy effortlessly dodging his counterattacks. *We need a leader.* I cant help you. Im Im not fit The fire raged in his chest. Bellowing for him to fight. Kill. Destroy. Who are you talking to? Emmet came up on Freidrichs right. Yvonne. In my head *We need you.* Cant you feel it? Inside me? Feel what? Emmet sounded confused. Not now, Emmet. Im talking to Yvonne. Freidrich realized his tone was needlessly harsh. Uther needed him. Fire be damned. His **friend** was in danger. Emmet! Get the prisoners to the back lines! He turned back towards the fighting. Yvonne! Get me a sword! *We need a leader, not a-* Im getting you your damn leader. SWORD! The flames were emerging, and Freidrich tapped into them. He could feel it again, the endless wells of stamina. And he ran. --------- Uther praised the endless stamina that the Light gave him. Again and again, he felt his flesh pierced from one direction and then another. Every fault and vulnerability of his armor was exploited by what seemed like endless foes. Was he even fighting mortal creatures? It was as if they were entities of smoke, turning to nothing when he swung at them, but turning awfully solid when they struck back at him. He backed another step. Twisting to the side as he expected the one behind him to strike, but she did not. Instead, as he turned, the one with the whip coiled his tool of pain and death around Uthers throat. The barbs dug into the little flesh that wasnt covered by his armor as if they had a mind of their own, and a thirst for blood. And then it tightened. Uther found it suddenly very difficult to breathe, as the snake-like thing coiled around him. And this time, the light couldnt make the harm disappear. It seemed they were finding the limits of his power. He grasped at the whip with his free arm, but it was firmly stuck to his flesh. Still, his struggle did ease up his breathing, if only a little. Then he heard a roar, quickly growing closer. In a blur of movement, the enemy that had been behind him dodged away, rolling away like a trained acrobat as Freidrich leapt into the fight, longsword in hand. Uther saw something in Freidrichs eyes as their gazes met. A deep, abyssal frenzy. A black fire hiding behind his eyes. Thoughtless and hungry. Then he saw the eyes of his friend once more. Freidrich brought the sword down, slicing through the barbed whip. And Uther could breathe again. The barbs still dug into his throat and neck, but no longer did the weight of its wielder pull on it, causing it to tighten. Get out, Uther! Ill cover you! No, Freidrich, come with me. Not happening, sir. With all due respect. GO. Everyone needs you. Are you crazy, man? We need you, too! Ill be right behind you! Now go! Uther nodded at Freidrich, and started running back to friendly lines. Looking behind him, he saw that Freidrich hadnt followed him. The man was now facing down the enemies Uther couldnt beat alone. Freidrich! Uther turned, and started to run back to Freidrich. He saw the first of the enemies lash out at Freidrich, but it was a blow easily parried. Uther knew it was just a diversion for the woman behind. He had fallen for it himself. He watched as she struck into Freidrichs kidney. He saw Freidrich starting to turn. No! Freidrich! It was too late. The first man thrust the dagger up beneath Freidrichs helmet. Uther could see it slide in. -------- Freidrich was cold, but he could feel warmth all around himself. His eyes were heavy, and he was covered in a sludgy liquid. What happened? He had been fighting the new enemies. He was about to atone for the death of his men. Had he succeeded? Had he saved Uther? What was going on? He forced his eyes open, and he could see only fire. He raised his hand to his throat, and he could feel a gash going in on the right side of his throat. He could feel his fingers being drenched in liquid. Lifting the hand up in front of himself, he could see that his hands were not covered with blood, but instead with some sort of black sludge. **Yes, mortal. You are dead.** The booming voice seems to echo down from all around him, but the origin is easy to discern. Upon a throne of skulls and bone sits a truly gargantuan creature. It looks like a man, but with claws instead of nails on its hands and feet, and skin more reminiscent of the scales of a dragon than the skin of a human. Its face was human-like, but its features were impossibly beautiful, but turned grotesque from the scales of its skin, his solid yellow eyes, and hair as if ropes of magma flowing from his scalp. The fiend laughed as he saw the horror displayed on Freidrichs face. **I am Inferno, and I have chosen you to be my herald. Rejoice, and burn the world to cinders.** I dont want to- **I dont care.** The god plucked a burning scale from its body, and flicked it towards Freidrich. The scale flew like an arrow, and buried itself in his chest, digging its way inside. **Entertain me.** ---------- Then Uther was flung backwards onto the ground as an explosion of fire erupted before him. He could hear screams from the assailants, the first noise they had made since they appeared out of the shadows. As he rolled onto his side, facing where Freidrich had just stood, he could see an inferno. But perhaps that was not the correct word? After the initial explosion, there were no flames. Instead, his friend stood, now noticeably without an arrow stuck through his head and both eyes intact, radiating an ungodly heat. Uther could see the metal of his armor and blade turning red-hot, and his eyes were like magma. Around him lay the assailants. A couple of them seemed to have been caught in the blast, the rest seemed to be unbalanced by it, but they were all getting back to their feet. It seemed they werent done for. Uther could see Freidrich raise his hand before himself. He seemed dazed. Confused. But he was alive. Or at least Uther thought so? He wasnt exactly sure what the hell just happened, or why. Or if that was even still Freidrich. Could it be elven magic? Shouldnt be possible. Hes wearing steel. He watches as the assailants fall back, carrying their injured back into the shadows. Freidrich? Freidrich turns his molten gaze towards Uther, and he seems to start to cool off. Uther I Uther can see Freidrich tremble. Help me He collapses to the ground. --------- Writers note: Ninjas cant catch you if youre on fire. Sorry this took so damn long to write, but in between being sick (damn you mr. QA for infecting me) and being obscenely busy, I havent had enough time to sit down and write properly. I hope this extra long chapter will make up for a little of that, at least! "
93,vulnerability,HFY,[Meta] The Ruthless Writing Guide Part 7: People,26,7ilesa,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/7ilesa/meta_the_ruthless_writing_guide_part_7_people/,2017-12-09 18:14:24,"Quick question, but who are your five biggest heroes? Now here's another question: How many of those heroes are fictional? It's kind of scary when you think how many role models never existed. We try to emulate our heroes, but what if they never actually did anything in the real world? Is it a good idea to model our lives after some writer's fantasy? For better or worse, stories have power over our minds. If you wish to learn this power then you'll need to master the art of crafting fictional people. Remember, your audience will read a book once if it has an interesting plot but they'll read it twice -- and buy the sequel -- if it has characters they can care about. &amp;nbsp; The first thing you should watch out for is the flat character. This is a character who only does things because the plot needs them to. They're fine in the background: nobody needs to know why some waiter is waiting tables or why some [Cloud City resident](URL is carrying an ice cream maker. They aren't the focus of the story and we aren't exploring their reasons for being there. We *are* exploring the main character's reasons, so if there's one character that should never be flat, it's them. They shouldn't just do things because it's what they're supposed to do. ""I wait tables because it's my job"" may be okay for an extra or an art major but it's not okay for your hero. In *Star Wars: A New Hope*, everybody has different reasons for opposing the Empire. Luke wants to avenge his aunt and uncle and also impress a girl. Obi-Wan has unfinished business between him and Darth Vader. Princess Leia is fighting for freedom. Han is just in it for the money. They're all on the same side, but the struggle means something different to each of them. One way to determine whether you have a flat or a round character is to ask yourself whether they would have their own song in the musical. Are their motivations complex enough to warrant an [""I Want"" Song](URL Or are they better off lending their voice to the chorus? &amp;nbsp; The second thing you should watch out for is the boring invincible hero. If the flat character has had too little thought put into them, the invincible hero often has *too much* packed into them. They have the most interesting backstory, the best skills, and so on. They're like a video game character with all stats maxed out and god mode activated. Have we mentioned that they're boring? Watching an invincible hero go from victory to victory is exactly like playing on god mode. There's nothing to break the monotony of all this endless ""winning."" Not only is a character more relateable if they have weaknesses, but it's also more exciting to watch them struggle with those weaknesses. The drama writes itself when victory and survival are no longer guaranteed. For example, Superman is one of the more powerful heroes in pop culture, but he isn't invincible. The same alien physiology that gives him his abilities also gives him his biggest vulnerability -- his weakness to kryptonite. What's more, his loved ones are much more vulnerable than he is, while his enemies often outmatch him. Supes could easily be a Mary Sue but the setting keeps him balanced. And then there's Batman, who can punch in the same weight class as Superman but who can *also* fall to a common mugger. His lack of superpowers is a constant liability, as are his psychological issues and paranoid personality. There's just so many ways to challenge him. Villains like Killer Croc and Solomon Grundy challenge him on a physical level while villains like the Riddler and Hugo Strange challenge him on a mental level. Many other villains present themselves as twisted versions of the Dark Knight himself. And none of these interesting and long-running characters would exist if Batman was written without flaws. &amp;nbsp; Your ability to write believable characters will ultimately depend on how well you know people. There are many ways to learn about human nature. You can take up history or psychology. You can watch the headlines and participate in discussions. You can simply live and meet new people and the insights will come with time. And if you're in a hurry, there's always straight stealin'. Take a character (or a real person) and change their name and backstory. Mash together several characters if you have to. Give the resulting composite permission to be their own person and see what happens. You might just come up with a character as popular as the original. Before there was Sherlock Holmes there was C.

[Part 5],154,7ipteo,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/7ipteo/dog_or_not_part_5/,2017-12-10 09:15:11,"[f]:URL [p]:URL [First][f] | [Previous][p] | Next *** So, it wasnt just them petting some dogs. Well. They were the only ones petting the dogs. Per DGC requirements, Kahurangi and her large, crystalline friend were accompanied by a small battalion of well-armed space marines (they werent actually space marines, but it amused her to call them that, especially because of how their CO twitched when she did). They werent so bad, the space marines. They hovered, but they didnt get in the way. Alright, she said to Soulrage as they stood just outside the gate to her fathers dog camp. There was parking outside the front gate and the massive expanse of fencing, and that was where theyd left their shuttle and the vans the marines came in. The farmhouse where her dad lived was further back on the property, blocked from sight by four large kennels where he kept the dogs food and beds. Heres the deal. Weve got the run of the place today, but you have to meet my dad before we can frolic with the puppos. I UNDERSTAND. THIS IS A HUMAN CUSTOM. YOU MUST BRING ALL MALES BEFORE YOUR CLAN LEADER FOR PERMISSION TO Holy fuck, no, thats not what this is about at all! she shouted, thrusting out both hands and waving them wildly in a gesture that screamed please shut up before I die of embarrassment. God. No ones had to do that for like three hundred years. Christ. Whats wrong with you? No, wait, dont answer that. Pinching the bridge of her nose, she pointed toward the kennels. Its got nothing to do with that. Were just gonna stop in and say hi, mostly because my dad hasnt seen me in like six months, and hes cranky about it. Its more to do with a a ritualistic placating of a parent. You get that? YES. I MUST DO THIS ALSO WITH THE EMPEROR. She nodded. Excellent, good. So were gonna say hi to my dad, then well pet some puppers. Hows that sound? IT IS ACCEPTABLE. You know, I cant tell if you really are that constipated when you talk or if your translator is just permanently set to pole up butt mode. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. Of course, you dont. She patted him amiably somewhere in the middle of his body. Its what I sort of like about you. When youre not being a raging asshole. Follow me. Together, and followed by the battalion of space marines, they made their way up the main path. From the kennels dogs bayed. A few were out and about. They were used to people and not all that interested in the large group approaching when there were squirrels in the trees. I HAVE READ ABOUT THIS CUSTOM, Soulrage said in what passed for a whisper among the Risslings. BARKING AT THE SQUIRREL. Kahurangi gave him a flat look. Its not a custom. Its a behavior. You need sapience to have customs. OH. YES. I FORGET THAT ON EARTH, ONLY HUMANS ARE SAPIENT. Except, you know, for the other species in our Congress. I DO NOT COUNT THEM. We need to work on your casual racism, Rage Machine. Her dads house stood just ahead of them now. Wood old and graying, the only color on the house was the splash of red that marked the door. A large window let them see into the living room from the wrap-around porch. As they approached, she saw her dad rise from one of the plush chairs just on the other side of the window and shuffle out of sight. A moment later, the door opened. Ari Rata was a large man, thick through the chest and stomach, with legs like trees and arms that could go through walls. Light brown lines crossed his bare arms, the remains of scars from dogs both overexcited and absolutely terrified by their situations. He was the kind of man who smiled often, and as a result had a story of wrinkles around his eyes. Kahurangi loved her fathers eyes and the rough, callused skin on his palms. With a delighted cry, she ran for him, hands outstretched. He caught both of her hands in his and drew her close. Their foreheads and noses touched, and his warmth filled her as her energy went to him. Even in this modern age, souls could touch. Welcome home, kiddo, he said in Maori. Then he set her down and leaned back, putting his hands on his hips and looking at Soulrage. So, this is the one? This is And he whistled Soulrages name. The Rissling drifted forward. I HAVE COME TO SEEK PERMISSION TO MEET YOUR DOGS, he said, ignoring her fathers attempts to be nice. Kahurangi rolled her eyes. Hes always this rude, dont take it personally. I never would, her father said with a shrug. Its nice to meet you. He whistled the name again. Do you have something you prefer to be called? Soulrage shifted from side to side. THE HUMANS CALL ME SOULRAGE THE MELODIC. Its a bad translation, Kahurangi said. I like calling him Symphonic Rage Machine. Couldve named the band that, back in the day. Chur, she agreed, ignoring how uncomfortably Soulrage vibrated behind her. He wasnt, she realized, all that good around people. Of any species. Dyou mind if I take him around to meet the dogs? Ari shook his head. Have fun. You can feed them, too, when it gets closer to one. Well give em all the bacon, she said with a wave as she hopped off the porch. Come on, then, Rage Machine, lets get to petting. *** Given what theyd be doing, Soulrage had spent time on the trip from his ship to Earth growing several limbs with human-like hands on the end. They had too many fingers with too many joints, but he preferred it that way. Better to have more than you needed in his opinion. Following Kahurangi, he entered what he thought of as heaven (which wasnt actually a concept the Risslings had, but it was a close enough translation of their ideal afterlife). Dogs were everywhereClassical breeds, Neo-Modern, a few in the growing Post-Modern Realist group, and a few more from the Experimental Resurgence. Those breeders, the ones from the Experimental Resurgence period, had been shut down rather quickly. Their ethics were questionable, and the IAW had no patience for humans abusing dogs. Neither did the rest of the galaxy. Realigning his matrices so that his limbs were lower on his body, Soulrage patted the head of the only dog that approached him. As dogs swarmed around Kahurangi, the only one who approached him was this older one, a Golden Retriever with white all around her muzzle and eyes. Her tail wagged slowly but with no less joy than that of a puppy, and when he let her sniff his many-jointed fingers, she sneezed. His matrices sang with amusement. Carefully, not wanting to hurt the old girl, he scratched the underside of her chin. She responded by turning her head to one side and licking at his hand. Thats Coda, Kahurangi said, walking up to him in the center of a gaggle of dogs. They bounded over each other and wriggled on the ground, flopping and floofing as their tails wagged. Shes one of the older dogs, probably thirteen now? I was six when her litter was born. She shoved her hands into the fabric pouches at her side. Shes fearless. YES. SHE WAS THE ONLY DOG TO APPROACH ME. His matrices hummed a sad song, nearly depressed. BUT I AM GLAD SHE DID. Some of em are skittish with new people, especially these guys. Theyre older. When we visit the puppies, theyll probably jump all over you. She cocked her head to one side. Doesnt help that you cant sit down or anything. You know, get on their level. Carefully shifting more of his arms, Soulrage set his fingers on Codas head and rubbed her ears. The dogs eyes drifted shut, her tongue lolling out of her mouth as her tail hammered against the floor. CODA IS A GOLDEN RETRIEVER, he said slowly, a bit hesitant. His crystal structures shifted and crunched, grinding together with his uncertainty. Hey, *what*? Kahurangi demanded, leaning forward and pushing into his space. Shes *what*? You fucking know what breed sheOkay, so this is Grido. Whats he? She pointed to a small dog, one that barely came up to her knees. Long cords of fur covered his body, hiding his face except where his pink tongue slipped out to lick at his nose. THAT IS A PULI. The fuck. She pointed to another pup. Shaggy, brindle, long ears. OTTERHOUND. The *actual* fuck. She bent down and picked up a dog that fit in her palm. Its fluffy coat hid every part of its body except its tiny paws and the tip of its stubby tail. A MAYALSIAN COTTON, he replied after a moment. A NEO-MODERN BREED, IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN, MEANT TO RESEMBLE A COTTON BALL. Are you for fucking serious. Her free hand dragged down her face. Youve been fucking with us for years! He pulsed with anxiety, wanting to press into a creche and hide. I HAVE NOT BEEN ENTIRELY STRAIGHT FORWARD WITH MY ABILITIES, he admitted. GROWING UP STUDYING DOGS AND OTHER LIFE ON EARTH, I LEARNED HOW TO TELL THEM APART. But. Wait. Hold on. If you She sputtered for a few seconds. The dogs, sensing the distress rolling off both of them, leaned heavily on Kahurangis legs and against the bottom of his form. This caused him to list to one side, at least until Coda set herself against his opposite side and applied her mass against that of the other dogs. GOOD DOG, he rumbled, scritching her head. So youve been, what, deliberately failing? she demanded. He vibrated. YES. There was the secret hed kept for these past few years, the silence that yawned inside him and separated him from his peers. His family praised him for his attempts to conquer the humans, never knowing he was fully capable of achieving victory but refusing to engage in it. It had been a conscious choice, a reaction to his mothers legacy. But over time, it became more than that. It was a way to rebel against his grandfather and the expectations others had placed on him before his structures had ever grown into their columnar shape. The fucking fuck. THIS DISPLEASES YOU? He would have thought she, of all people, would appreciate his rebellion. She knew his name and sang it truly. Surely, she could understand how hed adjusted his own interpretation of his name to be something better than it had been intended. I She reached out, hesitating for just a moment, and placed her fleshy palm against his smooth, cool body. In the histories about his mother, Risslings always devoted a chapter to a quote of hers from before she dissolved into dust. To be embraced by a human is to be enveloped in the primordial warmth of acceptance. It is at once an act of love and vulnerability. They are weak and easily fractured, but they will trust you not to hurt them. And there is something vulnerability in it for the Rissling who is held, too, because you will not know how to arrange your matrices, and you will not know which songs to sing, and you will try to sing all of them at once. It is the closet you will ever come to completion, to connection. Hed always thought that was nonsense. Maybe it still was. Kahurangi wasnt wrapping her arms around him or clinging to him or anything like that. She was just touching him. Heat seeped from her skin into his facets, like she was trying to heat his whole form with nothing more than her tiny, inefficient little body. I dont understand. He vibrated against her, trying to pick out a rhythm she would feel in her calcium bones. I DID NOT LIKE THE EXPECTATION THAT MY LIFE WOULD BE A CERTAIN WAY. I DECIDED I WOULD SUBVERT THAT EXPECTATION AND I WOULD MAKE MY OWN PATH. Huh, she said. Huh. Her arm slid along his form until the side of her body rubbed against his facets. He poked into her fleshy bits, and she grumbled about him pinching, but then she just leaned, quiet, thoughtful. I can respect that. YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS. And, since hed told her this much, he told her the rest. I WOULD LIKE TO ONE DAY BREED DOGS. She lurched back, startling all the breeds around them except for Coda. Coda continued leaning against him, and he felt the rhythm of life pulsing through her warm body. You want a dog camp like this one? YES, he said. I WOULD LIKE TO CONFOUND MY PEOPLE FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. I HAVE CREATED A NUMBER OF GENETIC FAMILY TREES TO MAKE MORE NEO-MODERN BREEDS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THEM? Hell, yeah, I would! She grabbed one of his limbs and dragged him from the kennel. Coda followed. She led him to another of the kennels. In this one, predominantly Neo-Modern breed puppies tumbled over each other, yipping happily, and when they noticed there was a human and a Rissling in their midst, they immediately bounded over with happy howls. In the center of the kennel was a large table. Steps at both ends made it easy for the puppies to get onto the surface, and it was at the perfect height for Soulrage to prop himself against. As the puppies piled onto the table and he rested himself against the edge of the table, he arranged his matrices so he could display his notes on a large swath of his faceted face. Together, he and Kahurangi reviewed his ideas, and he was surprised to find that she had just as much interest in the topic of canine genetics as he did. But, she said as they went about feeding the dogs later that night, youre never gonna be able to do all that if youre stuck representing your people in Dog? Or Not. YES, I KNOW. She squinted at him. Why dont you just quit being the Emperors kid, abdicate or whatever, and leave the Empire for Earth? Alarm pulsed through him. Coda leaned more heavily against him. WOULD SUCH A THING BE POSSIBLE? I mean, its gonna be hard, but mum hecked up the last three Christmases running, so I figure she owes me more of a favor, and getting the ex-prince of E13 to immigrate to Earth would probably be some kind of political coup. Still gonna be hard. Want me to try? He didnt know. The idea was staunchly terrifying. Leaving behind everything hed ever known just to pursue a dream? That was the manic ideology of a human, not a Rissling, who did everything in time and tune. Coda licked a piece of his structures, nuzzling against him as if they were old friends and she wanted to reassure him. At the same time, Kahurangi bopped him with her open palm. Theres a human saying, you know, that anything worth doing is hard. Or something like it. If that helps. Dunno if I get to have much of an opinion on you peacing out of your family, abandoning all things familiar, and, you know, venturing into a place no ones gone before. A brilliant smile broke across her face. But, like, have you ever seen *Star Trek*? NO. WHAT IS THIS *STAR TREK*? Campy show from a few hundred years ago. Doesnt matter. Every episode opened with this line about how space was the last place to explore and the people on this ship had a duty to boldly go where no one had gone before. Its kind cool to think about, you know? Imagine what it mustve been like to be the first person to land on Rissleas moon, or the first to have actual, real proof that theres intelligent life out there? You could be the first Rissling to do this amazing thing. OR START A REAL WAR BETWEEN OUR PEOPLE. Yeah, but thats economic suicide. We literally supply you guys with the majority of your medicines. IT DESERVES MORE THOUGHT THAN THIS. She nodded. Sure, sure. Think about it a lot. *** He did. He thought about it until she graduated from her university and attained a thing called a doctorate. Im not a doctor, she said when he asked, Im a geneticist. He thought about it while she went through the strange human tradition of marriage the first time, and he thought about it again when she married the second time. He thought about it when they talked over dinner. She told him she was getting another divorce. He told her he had an idea for a new breed in the Close Realism family. She had three children and three divorces behind her, her hair was brittle, her flesh pitted and sallow, and he finally made his decision. In an unprecedented move, he said, THIS WILL BE THE FINAL TIME I APPEAR ON DOG? OR NOT. EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, I AM EMIGRATING FROM THE EMPIRE OF THIRTEEN SUNS TO BECOME A CITIZEN OF THE DGC. Everything had been taken care of in the years leading up to the announcement, and because he didnt want to risk Risslea learning of this decision, he told no one. Not even Kahurangi when her third husband left her and she was convinced there was no hope for anything good left in the world. In retrospect, he probably should have told her. It wouldve saved him a solid hour of her yelling at him. *You could have fucking told me, you ungrateful rock!* she shouted. *I cant believe you let me think you were going to murder me and my entire family!* And, several hours later: *I raised* dogs *with you! Thats an unbreakable bondjust as strong as our shared parental damage!* The Empire of Thirteen Suns became the Empire of Nineteen Suns. In a move that took the DGC by surprise, they didnt declare war on all and sundry. Instead, they issued an edict that simply said: Soulrage has been excommunicated. No Rissling by that name has existed, exists now, or will exist in the future. Soulrage had to admit to himself some pride at the fact that his name had been stricken from the songswhich was promptly followed by a profound sense of loss and existential dread. He pushed himself into a rocky outcrop outside Dog Camp, which he and Kahurangi took over after her fathers death, and hummed with distress for a few hours before finally reconstituting his matrices and getting on with his life. In his place, the Empire sent one of his cousinswhose name the DGC translated as Starburst the Hoperender. A monoclinic system, he was rounded and bumpy like the Emperor, with the shame waxy sheen to his body, except in a muted yellow instead of blue-green. He had no compassion for the humans, and remorselessly smashed his way to absolute failure in his first championship. He was promptly demonized by every news outlet in DGC space, with people the galaxy over comparing him unfavorably to Darkrise the Starcrusher, who had been seen as a valiant underdog just doing her bestand even to Soulrage himself. Hoperender quickly became a meme used when someone wanted to call someone else weak or ineffective. While Soulrages home at Dog Camp was something of an open secret to DGC citizens (they were largely fascinated with the Rissling whod given up his home, and they often framed him as a figurehead for the success of their entire governmentso great that even Risslings were defecting from the Empire!), he didnt worry about Hoperender showing up. Hoperender was an idiot by birth and indolent by disposition, and, as far as he was concerned, Soulrage no longer existed. In her twilight years, Kahurangi went to him with an idea for a new breed of dog shed been working on in private for years. It combined all the features he liked best: a loyal, happy temperament, a barrel-chested body, long hair instead of fur, floppy ears, and a tail that looked like a mop. Lets call the breed Soulrage Retrievers, she said with a papery cackle. Stick it to those fuckers in the Empire. She didnt live long enough to see the final result. As she lay dying in her bed, her skin like shale, she skimmed through her will. No good place to bury the dead anymore, she rasped to him. Her dogs lay around the outside of her bed, not allowed to lay on it with her anymore for fear of damaging her fragile body. She shook her head and dropped her hand. The projection of her will disappeared. What do you think, Rage Machine? She no longer whistled his name. She didnt have the breath for it. No place left in the earth for an old woman. Soulrage had learned to sing softly over the intervening years, in part because his voice often upset newborn pups, but also because hed knocked several windows out of Kahurangis house enough times for her to come after him with a diamond-tipped poker. Quietly, he said, Is it part of your tradition to be buried? As often as possible, she said. New mandates, though. Not enough earth for the dead. Theyre exhuming bodies to burn em. She shook her head. Your bodys supposed to go back to the earth and nourish it, or something equally spiritual. She hacked, turning her face so he couldnt see the pain etched into her skin. He considered her words and the implication of them. Considered what little he knew about human religions rights. Considered the traditions of his own people. On Risslea, biomass from plants and animals are used as fertile ground for chryslings, he said slowly. She turned to him, one brow cocked. The remains of previous generations are sprinkled into this mass to start the chryslings growth and tie them to the family. In his room, in a locked trunk shoved into the very back of his closet, he had a small case that contained the ground remains of his mother. It was all he had of Darkrise the Starcrusher. Rage Machine, are you asking if you can use me as fertilizer so you can have a kid? ER, he said, falling back into old habits. THAT IS She rasped out another phlegmy laugh. I like it. YOU DO? Some part of him had figured she might, but he hadnt thought shed agree. Sure, why not? I get to return to the earth, you get to have a kid. Youve always wanted a family, right? She settled deeper into her pillows, closing her eyes. Go ahead. Lets make something completely weird. Carefully, Soulrage extended his human-shape limb and patted the bed beside her. My child will not be weird, he said. My last husband always said I liked you more than other humans She exhaled heavily and drifted to sleep. Soulrage, who had never had the chance to grow close to one of his own people, supposed he felt something like love for the human woman who had helped him achieve his dreams. He wasnt sure of this, of course, since hed never loved any Rissling. Not his mother, certainly not his grandfather, and hardly any of the people hed grown up with. But Kahurangi and her three daughters? Maybe them. Certainly, he loved his own child. The chrysling grew over the course of five years under the shade of a kohekohe tree on the edge of the Dog Camp, nurtured by dust from one of his crystal structures, by his mothers remains, and by Kahurangis body. Unfortunately, he never saw the chrysling achieve sentience. In the year of the 412th International Championship game of Dog? Or Not, hosted in the United Republic of Korea, he discovered something fascinating. On a tour of Kim Eun-jis ancestral home (she was lauded as a hero for suggesting that humans use their Dog? Or Not game to confuse Starcrusher), he drifted away from the rest of the group. He made his way to the houses central courtyard where he hovered over the edge of a man-made pond in contemplative silence. As he drifted up and down, letting his thoughts drift with the winds songs, he felt a strange resonance. Moving toward the center of the pond, he descended into it. Lowering two grasping limbs, he let the strangely familiar vibrations wash over him, using them to locate the object. He rose from the water with a sealed box grasped in his limbs. Sensing this box contained something profound, he absorbed it into his crystal structures, shook himself dry, and pretended as though nothing had happened until he could return to his hotel room. There, with Kahurangis middle daughter, Kiri, they opened the sealed box to find what Kiri described as the oldest, shittiest, most obsolete hard drive shed ever had the displeasure of seeing. She worked on the drive in the week leading up to the championship, and that morning sent him a communication. Its all fake, she wrote, with no context. She was dead before the opening ceremonies, strangled in her room. The game would not be delayed, its monolithic presence too great to stop now that it had been set in motion. Soulrage didnt understand the meaning of her message, and he lacked the time to look into it. He was a guest of honor. The Soulrage Retriever had been admitted into the IAW as a contending breed, and he had to make an appearance, regardless of his mental state. He put the hard drive in a bank. He gave the access codes to his lawyer with instructions to bequeath it to his chrysling in fifty years unless he did so sooner. Four hours later, he was dead, too, assassinated in the middle of the championship game. As his lattices broke down and he began to crumble he could only look back on his life with satisfaction. Perhaps Starcrusher would be disappointed in how hed lived, but it didnt matter. Hed made his own choices. And that made him proud. *** [First][f] | [Previous][p] | Next"
95,vulnerability,HFY,[OC] Preservation - Part VIII,10,774gku,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/774gku/oc_preservation_part_viii/,2017-10-18 16:01:33," --- **Malundama** The demon was not what she expected. No scales, no horns, no hooves. Nothing like the *emela-ntouka*. The elephant killer. Her head buzzed like it had in the jungle, a physiological echo of memory. The demon was being held in a titanium containment unit in a bay adjacent to Dr. Grays lab. Behind the ALON windows, the demon lay still on a massive exam table. Without its camouflage, it was the size of a double-decker bus. It had a purple skin that shimmered in the light, except for several spots where it had hardened into matte lavender plates. Three sets of legs, and four legs per set, spaced equidistant around it, almost like limbs of a tree. The limbs ended in six-fingered, symmetrical hands. Its head was mounted on a thick, articulated neck. No eyes or nose like us, Dr. Gray said, like she was excited about a new toy, Instead, its got, like, light receptors on its skin on its whole head and like chemical receptors on all of the hands. Not sure what those gnarly hard plates are. After the initial shock, Malundama now found herself fascinated. It's where we shot it, Malundama said, tapping the metallic glass. Like a ballistic vest, but only on impact. Guess the missile overwhelmed it. In the creatures flank was a gaping wound where the rocket had detonated, but the interior of the wound, under the char, appeared to be he same color and consistency as the skin. Dr. Gray turned the lights down until the creature was left in darkness. So like, were trying to minimize the time the lights are on, she said. Turns out, it was like pulling carbon and nitrogen out of the air and using energy from the lights to bond the atoms into molecules, climbing them into organic matter to close that wound. Absolutely amazing regeneration mechanism. If we bombarded it with radiation, I suspect the results would be cray. How did you know where to look for it? Malundama asked. Not a lot of people with phones to report it in the jungle. Even if they knew what they were looking at and who to call. All of the alien materials are putting off an exotic kind of radiation related to tritium, Dr. Gray said, turning for the door to her lab. Malundama followed. The UN has a satellite being a creeper over central Africa to monitor tritium mining. This thing stood out in the jungle like a total rando. So can we find more? Were trying to retask satellites, but since tritium is used in nuclear weapons, were getting iced out. Hey, we need to find aliens, can you like, stop watching the people making nuclear weapons? Kthxbye! She uses slang common with teenagers in America, D4V3 whispered in Malundamas ear and Gray didn't react, so he was probably only talking to Malundama. But shes one of the smartest organic intelligences I've encountered. Gray led her to a workstation in her laboratory and gestured for her to sit. Gray oversaw all of the labs strewn throughout this level of the base, but had her own lab for priority projects. If there was some sort of order to the lab, she didn't know what it was. Chemicals beakers shared counter space with electronic instruments she didn't recognize. Over in one corner, a yellow metallic sphere encased in lucite was giving off an ethereal hum that no one else seemed to notice, so Malundama didn't mention it. The work station had a display of what looked like a DNA helix, except the helix had a second twin spiral intermeshed. So D4V3 has been helping me like, sequence the DNA equivalent of this thing and we think we found like something interesting. D4V3s voice kicked in loudly this time. More specifically, we think it's a sign of deliberate genetic modification, D4V3 said. The view zoomed in to a segment of the DNA, several chromosome pairs. They flashed in color and then faded to gray. These chromosomes have been deactivated, D4V3 said. Not fallen out of use, or atrophied, but specifically deactivated. Weve observed some kind of mitosis from the cells weve sampled and the DNA reactivates in both daughter cells, but is deactivated shortly thereafter from some kind of process we haven't detected. Malundama watched the cells split. Watched D4V3s simulation of the DNA deactivation and she knew what it was. But, it was silly. This was alien biology. Or technology. Maybe those were the same to the aliens. But regardless, the parallels couldn't be so obvious. It would sound stupid. Your abortive exhalations indicate you are hesitating to say something, D4V3 said. I thought we told you to stop doing that, creeper, Gray said. D4V3 ignored her and asked, Penny for your thoughts, Malundama? This is probably stupid, Malundama said. But it reminds me of a virus. We haven't been able to like really dig into the microorganisms in this species, Gray said. But that might be how it's happening. No, Malundama said, I mean a computer virus. It happens to all the cells after division, not just some, right? Correct, Dr. Gray said. It's self-replicating throughout the system, Malundama said. That's like a computer virus. Unless you get it all, it keeps coming back. D4V3 said, It is actually consistent with several of the models I have access to. Who, like, infects an alien with a computer virus? Dr. Gray asked. And what did they deactivate? You're sure about this? Malundama asked. Captain Ko nodded, leaning against one of the posts holding up Malundamas porch. The family housing on the base was old, but Simba and Shako each had their own rooms, which was a first for them. The winter sun was setting and the temperature was heading toward freezing, but Malundama didn't want the girls to hear before they had made a plan. Despite the weather, Ko had taken off her beret. So this was Ko, her friend. Not Ko, the captain. Malundama had thought shed said something wrong to make Ko withdraw, but she learned that it was against army regulations in most of the world to fraternize with subordinates. It wasn't personal but it felt that way. She felt a touch of shame, thinking about this when she had a terrible job ahead. Confirmed it with a DNA sample, Ko said, I had Dr. Gray personally run it against the swabs we took from the twins. She pulled off a glove, reached in her parkas pocket and pulled out a pack of cigarettes. With a practiced motion she withdrew a cigarette from the pack with her lips, then held the pack out to Malundama. I called eighteen sets of parents when we came back from the Congo, Ko said. Two of my soldiers had kids. That was worse. Malundama took a cigarette and Ko lit them both. Malundama had only smoked a handful of times. But she wanted to prolong her time with Ko, and delay talking to Simba and Shako. I can adopt them, right? Malundama asked. Ko tilted her head back and let out a stream of smoke. She smiled and handed Malundama the manila envelope shed been carrying under one arm. Malundama opened it. The papers inside had the blue and red flag of the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the top. Seeing it was like smelling a favorite relatives house after years away, nostalgic and reassuring. They were official adoption papers from the DRCs Ministry of Justice. Filled out for Simba, Shako, and Kapia, except for signatures. You knew, Malundama said. I did. Malundama took another drag, the hot smoke a nice change from the freezing air in her lungs. Behind Ko, red aircraft warning lights turned on at the tops of the early warning radar on Amaroq Mountain. The repurposed radar now scanned for alien craft. The advanced craft of the aliens that Malundama could be fighting at any time. A fight she might lose. The twins only have a year before they turn 18, Malundama said, her words unsteady. Maybe it would be better if they took care of Kapia. I don't want them to become orphans again. Tears came to her eyes and she wiped them away before they could freeze. Ko wrapped her in a hug. Not if we have anything to say about it, Ko said, the same phrase shed used in the hospital. Those girls need you now. Tomorrow is tomorrow. There was a brief hesitation as Ko pulled back. Then she stubbed out her cigarette, flicked it into the icy street. Malundama took a last drag and copied her. I'll tell them first, Malundama said. If they want to know details, you can tell them. Ko nodded. Opening the front door was harder than running toward a demon. As soon as they mastered the shoot house, Master Sergeant Boyd started throwing curveballs at them. That's what he called them, D4V3 translated it as disruptive surprises. Floodlights would turn pitch black rooms blindingly bright when they were in the middle of clearing it, and leave them seeing spots. Hidden speakers played recordings of their own voices, sowing confusion. One time, the dummy targets were mounted on the ceiling. Boyd had also started adding differing objectives. Protecting an unarmed VIP, holding a room against an assaulting force. Todays objective was new and far more interesting. Clear a path to a computer in a distant room, and install a rootkit on the computer. Bonus points for exfiltrating. And do it in ten minutes. Shirazi was on point, followed by Captain Ko, then Malundama, and Ace providing security in the rear. It had taken them seven long minutes to get most of the way through the shoothouse. They stacked up on a closed door. Shirazi tried the door knob and gave the hand signal for a breach. Malundama pulled out a short handled sledgehammer. She hit the door right above the lock and it splintered. Shirazi kicked it open. Malundama followed Captain Ko in. Behind the door was a long hallway, two conex boxes connected. Pieces of scrap metal were welded seemingly at random to the walls and ceiling. At the end was the computer she had to hack. Welcome to the Tetanus round, Shirazi said. Grand prize winner gets lockjaw. Shirazi on point, Malundama behind him, Captain Ko said. I'll cover you, and Ace watches our six. Shirazi moved forward, rifle up, and the floor lurched violently, knocking him off his feet. The whole hallway was pivoting, the computer now at the end of a slight incline. Malundama guessed it would only take ten to fifteen seconds for the hallway to go completely vertical. She might be able to make it if she ran. They were out of time. *Your job isn't to sacrifice yourself.* Boyds words came back to her. Who knew what was lurking amongst the scrap metal. Malundama reached down and helped Shirazi to his feet. New plan, Shirazi and I ascend, taking turns covering each other. Ace tries to cover from down here, and Captain Ko maintains rear security, Malundama said. She looked at Ko for confirmation. Do it, Ko said, pivoting to cover the previous room. The hallway was nearly vertical now. Two minutes, tick tick, Boyd said over the PA system. Malundama slung her rifle over her shoulder and grabbed the closest piece of metal, pulling herself up. The platform created was narrow and she had to carefully draw her rifle to avoid falling off. Go! she said. Shirazi climbed up an uneven metal ramp. A dummy popped out from a platform twenty feet up and Malundama shot it twice in the chest. Halfway up, a dummy emerged from a hidden door, but Aces rifle cracked twice and neon orange splotches blossomed on the dummys throat and forehead. Her biceps grew tense and her fingers began to lose grip strength three-quarters of the way up the climb. Thirty seconds. She jumped for a narrow ledge just below the computer, gripped it, but found she couldn't get her arms to pull hard enough to get her on top. I can't, she said. Then hands locked around her ankles and she looked down to see Shirazi, squatting to get his shoulders under her boots. He pushed up and she heaved herself onto the platform. A dummy popped out of another hidden doorway and Shirazi fumbled for his rifle until his vest wailed. He slumped down and stuck his fingers in his ears. She rolled over on the platform and shot the dummy. Rolling back, she pulled the USB stick with the rootkit and found a port on the computer. She slotted the stick in and started typing. The computer tried to lock down, but she used a known vulnerability for the computers outdated operating system and was able to keep working while the lockdown program went into a repeated loop. Five, four, three, Boyd counted. Malundama finished the last element of code needed and hit enter. The lockdown program disappeared and the computer defaulted to the login screen, but her smartphone confirmed the rootkit had been successfully installed. Yes! she shouted. She rolled over and looked down at Shirazi below her, and Ko and Ace at the bottom of the hallway. We did it! A new wailing sound echoed through the shoothouse. Hey, we did it! Shirazi shouted upward, as though Boyd were perched on the roof and not in the separate shoothouse control room. Come on, we freaking won! Get down here, double time! Captain Ko said. We didn't fail. That's the base alert siren. --- **Daniel** Carter found him while he was on interior rounds in the Ulysses Laboratory Building. Hey there, he said, coming out of a side hallway and falling in step next to Daniel. Hows your second month going? Good, Daniel said. Best job I've ever had. He wasn't sure he meant it, but it seemed like the thing to say. His first paycheck had been more than hed expected and he was still discovering parts of the benefits package he hadn't known about. But Gregson was still kind of an asshole and Kelly hadn't said more than ten words to him since the incident in the video control room. Great! Carter said. Hey, I haven't heard from you about how things are going down here on the ground. Anything to share? Daniel thought of Samantha Rodriguezs magic disappearing and reappearing act. But he was also sure Gregson was reading his work email, since at least twice hed mentioned something Daniel had written to other people. He was still on probation for another four months. Not much to tell, Daniel said. Nothing out of the ordinary? Carter asked, lowering his voice and frowning. Umm, I don't think so. Carters expression switched instantly, returning to a light-hearted grin. Great! he said. His phone buzzed, he accepted the call, and he mouthed *I gotta take this*. Daniel waved as Carter walked away, talking enthusiastically to whoever was on the other end of the line. He was near the secure access lab that Samantha Rodriguez had gone into and not come out of and the security system told him she worked there most of the time. The doors were solid metal and he didn't have access, so he couldn't pretend hed gone in the wrong entrance. He also knew Gregson would be checking to make sure he was doing his rounds in a timely fashion, so he didn't have long. The corridor was nearly empty of things he could be checking, but there was a fire extinguisher in a wall-mounted case. Looks like maybe it's past it's recharge date, he muttered, as though convincing himself he wasn't up to something. He checked its tag, but the extinguisher had in fact been recharged a month prior. Laces are a little loose, he said, kneeling down. Hed bought and broken in some decent combat boots with his first paycheck. They were much easier to stand in for long periods and if he was being honest, made him feel a little more like a badass. He untied the knot, unwrapped the extra slack from around the boot, and heard the doors to the secure access lab open. Samantha Rodriguez stepped out, wearing a labcoat over a t-shirt and jeans. She walked briskly toward the elevators at the end of the hall, a file folder in one hand. Daniel half-started to follow and remembered his laces. He tied a quick, ugly knot and took off after her. Hold the elevator, he called as the doors started to close. She reached a hand out and triggered the hidden infrared sensors. The doors opened up and he staggered into the elevator. Thanks, he said. A few months ago hed have been breathing much harder, but walking rounds three times a day had started to show benefits. She nodded and opened the folder she was carrying. Inside were some sort of calculations, but the kind with more letters and symbols than numbers. The elevator started to descend and he realized he hadn't planned what to ask. *Hey, I was watching you on the cameras and saw you disappear and reappear the other day,* didn't sound creepy at all. The lights went out and the elevator jolted to a stop. It was the first time hed been in absolute darkness in a while. Another power outage, she said. Her voice was flat and a little gravelly. Not what he had expected. Emergency lighting should kick on soon, he said, hoping to be reassuring. It didn't. He pulled out his phone, but it refused to turn on. That's weird, he said. It's ok, she said. I have a- Her voice dropped off as he heard her digging for something in her lab coat. That was when he noticed the darkness wasn't absolute. Samantha Rodriguez was glowing a slight golden color, like a watch-dial or an old glow stick. She held up something and a lighter flashed, a tiny lick of orange flame surprisingly bright. He blinked, but the glow was gone. Maybe it had been some sort of mental afterimage. He fumbled for the flashlight on his belt, but it didn't turn on either. Guess I need to replace some batteries, he said. I'm Daniel by the way. Security. Sam, she said. Science. What kind of science? he asked. Applied high-energy particle physics, she said. She paused and shook her head and asked, What kind of security? Applied high-energy particle security, he said. Someones gotta keep those electrons in line. She chuckled and said, I guess you have your work cut out for you. He opened his mouth to ask something more probing about her work, something that could lead down a road to her disappearing act, when a pleasant tritone sounded from the PA system. Attention all employees, a facility-wide power failure has been detected and is being addressed. Prepare for power restoration in ten seconds. Sam let the lighter go out, plunging them back into darkness. Daniel stared at her as his eyes adjusted back to darkness. He thought he saw a faint golden glow before the LED lights came on, blinding him. The elevator resumed its motion downward and Sam got off on the second floor. Nice to meet you, she said, examining the paper again as she walked. Daniels phone made its startup noise and he opened his personal email account. Hed started an email to Carter once before, so he opened up the draft and started typing. He hesitated, but thought of the way Samantha Rodriguez had glowed in the dark. Like she was radioactive. Daniel hit send. --- **Kadira** Coming to heading 320, Li said. Copy that, turning to heading 320, Kadira said. Her solo excursions in the F-35C had been joyous, but tandem exercises with Lis plodding B-2 was closer to doing laundry than being a combat pilot. The Bering Sea was covered in a solid gray carpet of cloud cover, so there wasn't even a view. What was your callsign, back in the PLAAF? she asked. We didn't really have them, we had a three digit number, Li said. My friends called me Da Li, it means Big Li. Creative, Kadira said. Not a lot of poets in the Peoples Liberation Army Air Force, he said. Normally my callsign would transfer with me, but there aren't any other USAF pilots here. I can use it, if you like, he said. Please don't, she said. We need something new. Big Kadira? You know I've got live ordnance, right? Ok, no Big Kadira. How about Crash for you? Sounds too cool, since I'm a glorified bus driver, Li said. I know, I'm trying to get them to let you fly the F-35 so we can cross train and switch off, she said. She hadnt had any further conversations with the Director, so it wasn't strictly true. Colonel Corrales seemed reasonable, shed bring it up again with him. Crash, Li said, trying it out. Maybe. What about you? How about Gambler? Gambler? she asked. You trusted me, he said. That's a pretty big risk. She opened her mouth to reply, but the Speck base tower interrupted her. Echo Flight, return to base immediately, the air traffic controller said. His tone was calm, but in the background an unusual siren wailed. Acknowledged, tower, Li said. Tower, this is Echo 2, Kadira said. Any advisories or conditions we should be aware of? Be advised I have full ordnance and three hours of flight time available. This was also not strictly true. The techs had assured her the modified F-35's endurance was effectively unlimited, at least from a fuel standpoint. But she had to maintain appearances. Negative Echo 2. You are clear for immediate landing on runway 47-"" The radio went silent and a new voice came on, Colonel Corrales. It's showtime people, get down here. Briefing in thirty. Acknowledged, Kadira said and switched to the flight frequency. Race you home. --- "

I would like to thank everyone that made it possible for my other story [Why?](URL to make it to the Featured list for last month! You are all incredible, and have really convinced me to continue writing despite my own misgivings for my writing. --- **[Ta.alci Research Group testimony before the sub-council on internal affairs for the Galactic Council, on an urgent matter in regards to the species of sapient mammals known as humans recently admitted as a member to the lower council.]** Humans, a relative newcomer to the galactic scene, have quickly become known throughout the galaxy for their proportionally strong bodies and their quick thinking minds. However, it is the opinion of this research group that we have found an even more unique ability that they possess. An ability that guarantees the humans a place in our galactic framework for eternity, and necessitates a change in rank within the Galactic Council's own structure. Most sapient life in the galaxy has demonstrated varying degrees of empathy, it is something that is almost deemed essential to developing sapience. Humans are no different, and they have understood this idea in their own research into the way their minds work. However, the levels of empathy that they consider average are off the scale when compared to the rest of the galaxy. At first, we thought that the researchers on the ground must have poorly administered our own set of empathy tests after seeing the first data set that was sent back. Then the more data flowed in confirming these results. We found that the humans even have a group of people they call Empaths, that have such a high ability to empathize, that their emotional state is heavily influence by the emotional states of those in their vicinity, and their empathy outstrips our scales by, we assume, a factor of three. Humans, as you all know, have developed on a world with an exceptional number of predator species. Many of these species, at one time or another, either preyed on, or were in direct competition to, humans for survival. This is where the incredible knack for empathy comes in for the humans. Humans have, for as long as they can remember, taken these animals as pets, because they empathize with them. They understood these other predators so well, that they felt the need to take care of them. Over the hundreds and thousands of their cycles, this has led to these animals having a fiercely innate loyalty to human beings. The main example of this type are canines. Modern canines are a direct descendant of a species of mammal that the humans call the wolf. Some species are so closely descendant from the wolf that they mimic it in coloration and relative size. These canines, or dogs as the humans call them, have a noted devotion to their human masters, even among these pets that humans take. The closest known examples of coexistence our research team could find elsewhere were all symbiotic relationships. Where as in this relationship, the humans seem to take care of the dogs because they want to, and the only thing that they get from the dogs seems to be emotional fulfillment, and...unshakable loyalty. The loyalty of these animals is unmatched. There are incidents where humans were attacked by much larger mammals, or even other humans, and their dogs stepped between the human and the threat, often at their own peril. These dogs die for their masters in situations like these, all because of the loyalty that human empathy has developed in them. In cases such as these, it has been shown the emotional toll on the human is on par with that of losing another human family member. The observation that had the most impact came when the research team observed one of these dogs at the end of its natural lifespan, and we learned that the loyalty does not stop until death. Even on their death beds, the loyalty that dogs show leads them to comfort their caretakers, even as humans' empathy overloads them with emotion. Let me reiterate that...the dog, on its death bed, comforts its caretaker, a being with so much empathy, that it has become overcome emotionally at the sight of another creature dying. This, honorable council members, is unmatched anywhere in the known galaxy. While many species might consider this emotional vulnerability a tremendous weakness inherent in humans, the research team has come to a different conclusion. It is the finding of this research group that human empathy, and the loyalty it instills in others, both of their own and other species, sapient or not, will make them an addition with immeasurable value to the high-council. We motion that they be given a seat at the high council, and that proposal be heard by the Council immediately. **[End initial testimony]**"

Please enjoy! *** [- - -] **Boston, November 19th , Year 5, A.F.I.** Dark and cold. It used to be that feeling of despair whispering that your struggle was pointless. Daylight and warmth an illusion to the truth of the night; dark and cold, like the grave they were slowly heading for, hands bloody from clawing at the inevitable. She'd seen defeat in so many eyes, broken souls living without a sense of self, just waiting for their bodies to finally give in, but not the Ramesh sisters; take our parents, take our food, take our friends, you'll never take our will to live. After four years of surviving, fighting off the buzzards, being unable to sleep from empty stomachs growling too loud, of losing friends each week, Akshara felt vindicated. This was a new page to their story; the darkness endured, it was time to win back the light. In the dark and the cold with two priceless cups of hot cocoa from her dwindling personal stash, she walked toward one of those lights. Micheal looked up from the tapestry of documents barely readable under the camping light, face softening visibly at the sight of good company and warming sweets coming through the door. Hey, thought everyone was asleep. Carefully putting down a steaming cup between two ledgers, she sat on the reading chair, curling around her heavy sweater. Everyone else is. She allowed herself a warming sip before looking up. What about you? You've been burning midnight oil ever since you got back, you have to sleep at some point. Rubbing his neck, he picked up the drink and sat down. Yeah, there's just so much to do; Alexander wants 60 Dozers in 12 weeks, and then there's the whole Detroit thing... He trailed off, mind already diving back into the sea of numbers strewn across his table. I'm guessing that's why the new guys you brought back have taken over the workshop? What's his name... Anthony? I know right? I thought we were set up pretty well, but I guess not. Hmm, I wouldn't beat myself over it, you've been pretty busy with an entire city, I think we can give you a pass for not micro-managing one little factory. I know, it's just... Frustratingly sighing, Micheal leaned back, warming his hands on the coco. This is one city, there's hundreds just like this one. Most of the major cities are in the same situation; walled in and cut off from all supplies. Each day we don't liberate Earth is another million humans who'll have died like forgotten animals. Hardness returned to his lines. There was no way to deny the simple truth of Micheal's words, and yet... Just don't forget to save yourself as well. She said innocently. His stare was unreadable; a conflict of selflessness and understanding. A smile won out in the end. You're starting to sound like Nathan. I hope that's a compliment. She chided herself immediately, Micheal visibly stung despite the good jest. He's not that bad. I mean, I know he's pretty pessimistic and argues a lot but I meant what I said; he probably sees even more clearly than anyone else the kind of trades and sacrifices we're having to make. He hung his head back. He values life, to a degree I can't even begin to understand. Getting up, he moved to the couch next to Akshara's chair. So, sure, sometimes I want to punch him, yell at him and get him to step down from his holy chair, but then I remember he just doesn't want to see people get hurt. His thoughts mixed with his memories. He... well, he knows pain, what it means to be hurt. Silence hung in the air, weighing on Akshara. Sorry, I didn't mean... whatever his reasons, he's fighting too and I can only respect that. Respect sure, but he's still a pain in the ass sometimes right? Micheal confided. I wasn't going to say it... A repentant chuckle. Believe me, I know how people look at him, but even with all he says, with how conflicted he is, he's never backed down from a challenge, gotta judge a man by his actions, right? By that token, you're a great martyr. I'm not... fine, what should I do then? Do my best and just tell myself that I'm doing enough? There's an entire planet to save, how much is enough? That's not what I'm getting at. I'm still waiting for you to ask me to help. We all are. I have! Just the other day I needed an inventory done, I asked you guys to help! I'm always asking... Unwavering green eyes choked whatever else he was about to say, pushing his thoughts towards unpleasant territory he did not enjoy treading, and yet tonight those eyes were shining bright as a moon within him, revealing what he wanted to ignore. But you're not talking about that kind of help. Safe help. I'm not. Micheal, we want to *help*, to *fight*. You can give us the chance to do that, what's stopping you? Why aren't you asking us? Mere words felt terribly inadequate. Unable to voice his fears, making his way to the window was all he could manage as she waited for her answer. Looking out at the water cisterns, garden-roads and hand-crafted tools, the city gave a sense of renewal; a great giant murdered, its corpse feeding the growth of a new life. A new life that had to be defended from the murderers still walking these lands. It sounds a lot more noble in my head than when I try to put it to words. It always does. Resting the empty cup aside, she joined him by the window. I know why Mike, I think everybody does; you're the definition of an open book, just part of your charm. Severe eyes looked at him. I'll admit it was nice for a while to take it easy and feel safe with you guys around, but that's enough. I want to help, so does a lot of people. His voice was conflicted. It's a war, people will die, people ARE dying. Whoever I ask to help they're... they'll be putting their lives at risk. Do you think maybe you've been listening to Nathan too much yourself? You're not forcing us to risk our lives, you've giving us the chance to do it. Look at me; I *want* to fight, however I'm able to, and so do a lot of people you've been ignoring. The last of his reticence evaporated under her stare. I don't want people to die because of me, but as soon as I involve them directly, some will. I'm not sure how to live with that knowledge... What about all the gangers you've been recruiting? He guiltily glanced at her Ah... I keep telling myself that's on Alex's and not me; I just send him the guys, he's the one that gets them killed. I know, it's semantics and hypocritical, but it's what lets me sleep. A bemused smile took hold as she contemplated him anew, making him frown. What are you smiling about? I'm just wondering what other kind of coping mechanisms you've developed since this all started. You're horrible. I am not, but I've seen enough dead for a few lifetimes. It makes you think, forces you to reach deep down where dark things lay. Some people get trapped down there and never come back out, most of us realize it's part of life and learn to live with it. The mirth in her eyes was gone. Rubbing the back of his neck, he retreated to the work table. Alright, you win. He pointed out a few documents as Akshara took his side. That's the schedule for increasing Dozer production, we'll need to do heavy salvaging in the areas still controlled by the gangs and we don't have time to wait and let them keep disintegrating, that means fighting in the streets. She nodded understanding. And those are the outlines for the long-term plans for Boston over the next year, I still need to decide who's going to take over. Her head snapped to him, apprehensively asking. Take over? You're leaving? I... yeah, Alexander wants me to take over Detroit. When? Ah... in a few weeks. We need the skip to get into Detroit but Alex has been using it searching for someone. Were you going to tell us or just disappear one day? The accusatory, almost angry tone surprised him. What... no of course I was going to let you know. Is there a problem? It was her turn to keep quiet, struggling to form a reply. Micheal's puzzlement deepened before she finally sighed. It's just... dammit, I thought you'd be around for a while. His eyes were giant question marks. Oh come on, you can't be that dense. Do you think I've been sharing my personal stash of hot chocolate with you just because I was being nice? Her sustained stare fled, looking away. What? But, the city and... the fish and... what? Covering her face for a second, she came back up. Look, I know, it's not the time for anything like that, I get it OK? Doesn't mean I wouldn't have liked to spend more time together. There was a glimpse of vulnerability under her usual rock-solid confidence. Micheal remained wide-eyed, blinking, until he finally looked away. I... I'm sorry. Crestfallen, she apologized. I understand, don't worry about it, I'm just being unreasonable. Turning to face her, eliciting the same from her, he stepped forward and hugged her warmly to her shocked enjoyment, before stepping back. I meant sorry for not noticing. You're right, it's not the time for stuff like that. Later, when this is all over, let's find the only restaurant still open and go for dinner. It took her a few seconds to understand what he was saying. Are you... you're asking me on a date? Ah... yeah, a *very* postponed date. He clarified. Swear on it! She demanded. What? I said, swear on it, swear you'll find me again once we've won and take me out for dinner. He smiled as he offered his hand. Akshi, I swear. She slapped his hand away, stepped in close and kissed his cheek, escaping out of the room before he had time to understand. Later, as he lay down for the night, he realized he was still smiling. *One more reason to kick your fishy asses post-haste.* *** [- - -] **Undisclosed US government underground facility in Montana, November 21st , Year 5, A.F.I.** Another strategic meeting, another day without a solution, another morning spent listening to people who hate each other's guts. Four and a half year of being cooped up inside a cold war-era continuity of government bunker will do that do you; the powerlessness in face of the alien invaders, oppressing despair slowly taking over everything you are, the only thing left to do is to lash out and blame others. It's only human after all, and secretary of commerce Donovan Hui, with five decades of political career under the hood, understood it all too well. Walking back to his private quarters he once again wished they'd let them out; pushing in just enough fresh air to keep them all from suffocating was about all the decrepit ventilation could manage. The thought of all that cool, fresh autumn air that didn't faintly smell of wet week-old socks, just waiting to be inhaled... it was almost enough to make him charge at the entrance. And maybe the old Donovan, the self-centered, highly confident and haughty one would have done it, even if just for a chance to berate the irascible guards. The new Donovan accepted there were things no mortal could change, and that included a US army sergeant's mind. Unlike his compatriots, who had grown more and more neurotic, he had experienced a sort of rebirth. Sure, the first year he'd been there, yelling at everyone else like the best of them, but little by little, as the piece-meal snippet of information filtered back down from the world outside, he'd begun to understand and accept that the world he knew was gone. The United States might survive, but they wouldn't be THE United States, that one was dead, its corpse burning. It would be something new that bore the same name. By all accord, this *should* have filled him with existential dread, and at first it did; if he wasn't Donovan Hui, Secretary of Commerce, overseer and caretaker of the most important economy in the world, who was he? The answer had finally revealed itself to him during one of his many sleepless nights as he lucidly dreamed of home, probably brought on by sleep deprivation; he was Don, the farm boy from Kansas who'd grown up in a time-defying little town and had enjoyed managing the local farmer's union finances on the knees of his father. When had he forgotten the sheer pleasure of a well-balanced book, healthy margins and sound investments for future growth? Being completely honest, he was relieved to know he wouldn't have a job when this all blew over, when he'd come out of this bunker and would just be Don Hui again. Maybe he'd open a little shop or distributor, run a nice little profit, enjoy time off to go fishing in the many great lakes of this country he'd yet to explore... Mr. President! His aide's shouting dragged him back to the land of damp socks. Stop with the nonsense Oliver, I already told you there's no way the line of succession goes this far down  we just haven't heard from the actual president yet. Oliver reached him by the end of his retort, catching his breath. Mr. Pre... Mr. Hui, there's something outside. He could hear the restrained panic in his voice. Something? Could you be more vague? This is entirely too specific for my taste. Ah... yes sir. It's... ah... well it's something, err, a machine, human-like. The chief of security told me it appeared out of nowhere in front of the gate a minute ago. *I hope this isn't a bad prank. I know we're all bored witless but there are limits...* Alright then, let's go see and meet this... machine-man thing. *** [- - -] **Outside of undisclosed US government underground facility in Montana, November 21st , Year 5, A.F.I.** The Dozer frame's integrated radio crackled. *It's not going to fuckin' work.* It's going to work Julian, just need to be patient. By the way, remind me to thank whoever decided this suit needed temperature control, because this is awesomely warm. Almost makes up for the chaffing around the crotch. *You're the one who fuckin' didn't want to wait for the fuckin' suit to be adjusted.* Has no one ever told you not to drag your boss's nose in his own mistakes? *You don't fuckin' pay me.* It's the principle. Hey! The door's opening! *And the guys stepping out look fuckin' happy about you being there too, boss.* And what are they going to do? Shoot bullets at me? Ah! Alright, they're getting close. Get our surprise guests in the Skip ready. A small squad of military personnel approached him, weapons drawn and primed, alert for signs of an ambush. Their gear looked like a losing fight between overuse and a dearth of maintenance. He engaged the external speaker. Greetings earthlings, I come in peace. May I see your leader? Name, occupation and purpose, now or we shoot. The voice was professional but tense. *I bet they have no idea what to do about this suit.* Ah, Alexander Wallen, resistance fighter, and I need a favor from the president. Frowning, the guards looked to each other for how to proceed, coming up blank. What appeared to be a sergeant spoke up. You stay here. Any sudden move and we'll open fire. Darson, get back inside and tell them what this clown said. Alexander watched as one of the guard made his way back inside, hoping his little appearance trick and casually dropped hint would have whoever was in charge curious enough to ask to meet him. It was some time before the guard came back, whispering something to the sergeant who grimaced. Didn't like the order? You get out of that thing, come in unarmed. Only way you're seeing anyone except us four today. Alexander grinned. Yes sir. The back is going to pop open so don't panic alright? Setting the frame to standby and releasing the back plate latches, he engaged the hydraulic lift that would allow him to climb out from the frame's back. Holding his hands up, he came around the side, the sergeant motioning for the closest guard to frisk him. Finding nothing, he pointed with his rifle toward the bunker's entrance. Move up, no sudden gesture. Sure thing. The guards visibly relaxed once back inside, remaining alert to his actions. Encircling him, they proceeded down a series of corridor until they reached some sort of conference room holding a large frayed table ringed by uncomfortable-looking 70's era chairs. An older man with some Asian descent stood in the room, flanked by a nervous-looking man about Alexander's age. The older man thanked the guards and motioned for them to leave despite their reluctance to do so. As the door closed, the old man addressed him as he sat. Young man, firstly congratulation on finding this place, secondly I'm afraid you won't find the president here, but I was curious to know what this is all about. He pointed Alexander to a chair, inviting him to sit. Thank you sir, but I'm afraid you're mistaken. See, me and my growing number of friends have been combing what remains of public records, meeting survivors from the federal government and just plain looking around and we've localized pretty much everyone else on the line of succession above of your station. The old man raised an eyebrow. And? I brought them all with me in a shoe box. He sighed. Your distasteful humor aside, what proof do you have? Hmm, see, this is a case of proof in absentia. In most cases there weren't any corpses to find; do you remember the first days of the invasion? The old man's eyes glazed over as he momentarily looked into the past, remembering the fire coming from the sky, destroying strategic emplacements with impunity, the chaos that ensued and the mad escape from the economic conference he was attending to this nearly-forgotten bunker. I believe we all do. Well, most of them struck governmental centers in the first hour; cut off the head and all that. In two cases we found the burnt remains of convoys that seemed to be en route to airports or other bunkers. And yet, we only have your words to go by. You will excuse us for being distrustful. Oh, totally, don't worry, although I brought some of those new friends I talked about. I was pretty stocked when we met them. A commotion outside the door, shouts and scuffling, made the old man look up apprehensively as Alexander grinned knowingly. See Mr. Hui, the vice-president and his escort didn't all die when their motorcade was attacked, although he did hang himself a few years ago. His secret service agents survived him. Gotta hand it to them, those people are *dedicated*. The sounds outside the door grew louder. Now, we dragged them around, let them find the answers to THEIR questions until they were satisfied, and here we are today. He stood up, made his way to the far corner, away from the door. So, if you're not going to believe me, as you should, I'm hoping you'll believe a bunch of men and women who survived 5 years out in the wild, spending their every waking hour just to find *you*, Mr. President. Almost on cue, and much to Donovan's consternation, the door flung open, letting in a small army of stern-faced men clad in patched-up but surprisingly clean black suits. Donovan's heart sank when he noticed the briefcase handcuffed to one of the man's wrist. Looking up to the far corner, Alexander's steely grin was all the confirmation he needed of the man's intent. *** [- - -]"

[Vann] held back his smile and looked and steadied his glare on [Marcus]. &amp;quot;Consul, before we move onto the, proposal. I must speak to [Howard] about a matter I would consider equally as important.&amp;quot; The Consul&amp;#39;s eyes narrowed, slowly he picked up his glass and stared across the table at [Vann]. &amp;quot;I am on a tight schedule Emperor,&amp;quot; [Vann] continuing to smile cut him off, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sure you can wait a few minutes. This meeting was originally set for two, and the subject of what we would be discussing all but plainly written out, before we move on to the more unpleasant topics, I will insist on this.&amp;quot; [Marcus] raised his glass to his lips and slowly drank. He waved a hand prompting [Vann] to continue. [Howard] was carefully looking straight ahead, stuck between two of the most powerful men in the Empire the business mogul did not look inclined to take a side in any argument. Sighing [Vann] rubbed at his face, &amp;quot;In the interest of not wasting the Consul&amp;#39;s very important time, your daughter was successful.&amp;quot; Grunted [Vann], letting the poise drop from his voice. [Howard] blinked surprised, &amp;quot;Successful?&amp;quot; [Vann] dropped his hands informally to the table, &amp;quot;Your family has for generations been trying to insert itself into the royal family. Yes?&amp;quot; [Howard]&amp;#39;s face drained of its color. &amp;quot;We would of course have been honored, if our bloodline were to intertwine with that of the royal family&amp;#39;s. We have never resorted to anything, unbecoming to do so,&amp;quot; [Vann] shook his head, &amp;quot;No of course not, [Venna] was remarkably blunt in the desire you had to meet with me, to be honest I think she panicked. It was, nice in a way. I&amp;#39;ve wished for my political rivals to break down like she did, and confess their goals outright.&amp;quot; [Howard] opened his mouth to say something, [Vann] continued not giving him the chance. &amp;quot;She was not an enemy, she thought she had to roundabout like every other person but a few that I must deal with daily.&amp;quot; [Vann] slowly settled his gaze on [Marcus]. &amp;quot;I have to deal with them enough that I sometimes look back on the history of the first Emperors, and wish that I could be as direct as they were dealing with, problems.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Emperor, I&amp;#39;m sorry for any offence,&amp;quot; [Vann] laughed and reaching out put a hand on the older man&amp;#39;s shoulder, &amp;quot;Offence? If she had not been so blunt with her objective, I would have forgotten her the moment she left my sight. Now?&amp;quot; [Vann] trailed off his face darkening. He took his arm away collected himself, &amp;quot;Contrary to rumor, I have never entertained any suitors.&amp;quot; [Marcus] waved a hand in dismissal his annoyance plain on his features, &amp;quot;That has been your own doing [Vann]. You made a mistake, you are attempting to make up for that. You are going to make far larger mistakes than not being able to hold your alcohol.&amp;quot; [Vann] nodded, &amp;quot;True, and when I first invited [Venna] to the Palace I thought she would make some veiled attempt to influence me with that failure, she didn&amp;#39;t. She was completely.&amp;quot; [Vann] paused and took in a breath. &amp;quot;Honest.&amp;quot; [Vann] turned to [Howard]. The older man was staring back at him, stunned. &amp;quot;I accepted this meeting, without knowing anything about you or your company beyond a casual recognition of the name. After she left, I researched your family with all the assets at my disposal. All I found was that you have been loyal to the Empire. Throughout every rebellion, you have stood steadfast beside the Emperor despite the little recognition you have received for doing so.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;We are happy to serve the Empire.&amp;quot; Stuttered [Howard]. &amp;quot;Which is why, I think I&amp;#39;m, well I&amp;#39;d rather not say it quite yet I, I have a lot I need to learn. At the moment though, I want to spend time with your daughter if she will permit it. I wanted to reassure you, that I am not doing so out of some need to make amends or as some sort of reward for your family&amp;#39;s loyalty.&amp;quot; [Vann] huffed and scratched at his chin, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not saying this quite right.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Emperor,&amp;quot; [Howard] hesitated for a moment. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m fairly certain I understand what you are trying to say. I would have nothing against my daughter, continuing to see you. From what she said of your meeting, she is most definitely interested.&amp;quot; [Vann] felt a natural smile spread across his face, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s good. She has an open invitation to visit the Palace.&amp;quot; [Vann] thought for a moment, &amp;quot;Uh, don&amp;#39;t tell her that quite yet. I think I need to plan a courtship outing first. It is tradition.&amp;quot; [Howard] eyes widened again, [Vann] wasn&amp;#39;t sure if the man had blinked at all during the meeting yet. &amp;quot;A courtship outing, she is, we&amp;#39;re not..&amp;quot; he trailed off as [Marcus] dropped his cup down onto the table, &amp;quot;[Vann], if you want to spend time with this woman, I certainly cannot stop you. A courtship outing however, would be inappropriate. As I said, there are letters from thousands of other families.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Emperor.&amp;quot; Said [Vann]. [Marcus]&amp;#39;s scowl deepened. [Vann] waited. &amp;quot;Emperor, this is first, love. It happens to everyone, there is no need to be so public. If you still feel this way in a few [years].&amp;quot; Growled [Marcus]. &amp;quot;Weren&amp;#39;t you just the one who was saying I will make mistakes? I&amp;#39;ve made quite a few, I admit that. I&amp;#39;ll make more, but I have no intention of counting this as one of them no matter how it turns out.&amp;quot; [Vann] turned to [Howard], &amp;quot;Your daughter is one of a very few people I&amp;#39;ve met in my life who was completely honest with me. I think she learned this from you, if the history of your family and company is anything to go by.&amp;quot; [Howard]&amp;#39;s hands were on the table at this point, holding him up. [Reece] slowly moved behind the man, ready to catch him. &amp;quot;Emperor,&amp;quot; said [Marcus] his voice low. [Vann] snapped his head around to him, &amp;quot;Ah, yes Consul. Your timetable, I apologize. You&amp;#39;re better versed with the proposal, go ahead.&amp;quot; Conspiratorially, [Vann] leaned over to [Howard]. &amp;quot;I apologize if you came to this hungry, but it will be faster if we can complete this business before we eat.&amp;quot; [Howard] struggled to form his words for a moment, &amp;quot;I will be fine Emperor.&amp;quot; [Vann] smiled, &amp;quot;Good. Consul?&amp;quot; At the seconding prompting [Howard] slowly turned to the other man, who quickly wiped the small frown from his face to return a friendly smile. &amp;quot;The antimatter FTL technology that the Baroom company has been helping the military to develop,&amp;quot; [Howard] winced at the mention of the technology, [Marcus] continued. &amp;quot;You need to be made aware of where it originates.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Originates? It was from a class B species, B311 or something. Wasn&amp;#39;t it?&amp;quot; [Marcus] shook his head, &amp;quot;No, and it is part because of the Emperors, honesty, and your own dedication that I believe you should be brought into the very small circle of people whom are aware of this fact. The Emperor himself, did not learn of this until the accident.&amp;quot; [Howard] stiffened, and his face went pink as the blood drained away from it. &amp;quot;That won&amp;#39;t happen again, the mathematics behind the interactions were far more intricate than what our initial estimates showed. The mathematics we had to start with were extracted from sensor readings, Emperor I assure you that won&amp;#39;t,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Antimatter is inherently dangerous,&amp;quot; said [Vann] cutting [Howard] off, &amp;quot;I believe you did what you could with what little data you were given. If the Consul had provided you with all of the data in the beginning, you would have been successful I&amp;#39;m sure. The truth of this, is not easy to accept. The Mistakes the Consul likes to reference, I made quite a few of them before I accepted this.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Sir?&amp;quot; asked [Howard] looking very concerned now. &amp;quot;Given recent events, it would be best that you are given additional details in relation to the antimatter FTL data you have been working with. Which, is I believe part of the Consul&amp;#39;s, &amp;#39;offer&amp;#39;.&amp;quot; [Vann] emphasized the last word as he looked at [Marcus] still unsure exactly what he was after. [Howard] blinked, &amp;quot;More data would be helpful, but I have been requesting it for years. What has changed?&amp;quot; [Marcus] shrugged, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve kept it from all but the military research team&amp;#39;s due to the sensitive nature of the information, but times are changing. The secret will be coming out very soon I think, and we need the antimatter FTL technology if the Empire is going to survive.&amp;quot; [Marcus] bowed his head, and rubbed at his temples. &amp;quot;This, secret is one that I even kept from the Emperor. This started when he was a child, and I fear he will have to deal with my decisions for the rest of his life. He has forgiven me for not informing him of this sooner. I do not think our people will be as gracious and forgiving.&amp;quot; [Howard] swallowed and nervously picked up his cup, &amp;quot;Do I need to know?&amp;quot; [Vann] leaned forwards again, &amp;quot;Your company has, from what data I have seen from all of the teams studying the data come the closest to replicating the antimatter FTL technology. We need you, because a class C species originally developed it.&amp;quot; [Howard] blanched and dropped his glass, [Vann] pushed himself back from the table deftly avoiding the spill. [Marcus] didn&amp;#39;t move nearly as quickly, and he winced as the wine spilled over onto his lap. &amp;quot;No, that&amp;#39;s impossible!&amp;quot; said [Howard]. He blinked and glanced down at the table, &amp;quot;Emperor, I.&amp;quot; [Vann] waved him off, &amp;quot;It is hard to accept, but it gets worse.&amp;quot; [Howard] blinked, &amp;quot;Worse?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The class C species that developed it. Species C1764 is the same species that attacked Jikse, and the same species which fended off the cleansing operation of the Chront system. They utilize this antimatter FTL in battle in a way that mitigates most of our strategic knowledge.&amp;quot; [Howard]&amp;#39;s mouth fell open, &amp;quot;That, that, is&amp;quot; he trailed off trying to form words and failing. [Vann] put his Comm on the table, tapping at it he quickly projected a hologram up from it into the air in front of them. Scrolling through the sensor logs from the [Singer] [Vann] moved the timeline along to the point where the C1764 ship had charged directly into the Imperial, and carved through it with the event horizon of the antimatter FTL system. [Howard] remained frozen, watching as the hologram slowly replayed the encounter again. [Marcus] tried in vain to pat his own robes dry with a napkin. &amp;quot;What, what about shields? The formation of the breach would have been disrupted by the magnetic field.&amp;quot; Said, [Howard] after watching the loop again. [Vann] smiled, he was smart. His world had just been shattered, and he was trying to fix it. &amp;quot;The C1764, are intelligent, ruthless, and violent. The cleansing action that the Consul ordered a decade ago wasn&amp;#39;t successful, and several thousand of them ran and hid somewhere with these engines of theirs. In that time, they have developed a way to disrupt all shield technology.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;A pulsing magnetic field would be the best way to do that, but then they wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to maintain their own shields.&amp;quot; Said [Howard] as he quickly thought it over. [Marcus] frowned and looked up from his ruined robes, &amp;quot;How did you know of that vulnerability in the shields?&amp;quot; [Howard] blinked, &amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The vulnerability in the shields, how did you know about it?&amp;quot; repeated [Marcus]. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s something that anyone who has had a week of field cohesion classes would ask. The shields are simply an extension of the technology used to maintain fusion reactors.&amp;quot; [Marcus]&amp;#39;s scowl deepened, &amp;quot;Why has this problem not been fixed?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;[Marcus]!&amp;quot; growled [Vann], &amp;quot;Baroom has been responsible for the development of technologies yes, but they have had little to do with shield technology. In any case, [Howard] gave you the answer. The C1764 shield disruption makes it impossible to maintain your own. The C1764 rely on physical armor, that is what we need to remember when dealing with them. They are violent, class C, but they are not stupid.&amp;quot; [Vann] focused on [Howard] locking his eyes on the other man&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;The C1764 are not going to try and match our technology, they are going to work around it and utilize unconventional tactics. The ways in which they are using the antimatter FTL is only one example. If we are going to have any hope of stomping them out without a greater loss of life, we need to match the unconventional tactics and think up our own.&amp;quot; [Howard] slowly sat back down at the table and groaned. [Marcus] smiled, &amp;quot;This is quite a lot to absorb, I&amp;#39;m aware, but it was context needed for the offer we wish to make.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Which is?&amp;quot; asked [Howard] his voice hollow. [Vann] kept his eyes on [Marcus] watching, curious what the offer would be. &amp;quot;We would like you to go to the C1764 planet, you and your best team of analysts. The system has been under military control since the cleansing of the species. We used a new weapon to eliminate them while inflicting minimal damage to the technology. If you could look at the C1764&amp;#39;s mathematics, technology, and the like. Would you be able to replicate their technology?&amp;quot; [Vann]&amp;#39;s eyes widened at the proposal surprised. [Howard] looked pensive, &amp;quot;Any additional data would be helpful at this point, we&amp;#39;re only off by a small amount with the calculations. We have multiple copies of the hardware we would need, but without the precise equations which a control program would operate with, they are useless. If you have the C1764 control program, we could adapt it.&amp;quot; [Marcus] sighed, &amp;quot;Unfortunately we do not. The C1764 destroyed them. Military science teams have been combing the system looking for other versions, copies, anything but have so far turned up nothing.&amp;quot; [Howard] scratched at his head for a moment and chewed on his lip, &amp;quot;I would be happy to look at the class C technology, but I cannot guarantee anything. I cannot do much to continue the work here though, we have been attempting to brute force the equations for a solution to little success.&amp;quot; He continued to chew on his lip, &amp;quot;If the C1764 are a threat though, we know enough about the technology to counter it.&amp;quot; [Vann] eyes widened, matching [Marcus]&amp;#39;s across the table. &amp;quot;In what way?&amp;quot; asked [Vann] before [Marcus] could. [Howard] hesitated noticing both men looking very intently at him. &amp;quot;It is impossible to intercept a ship inside the half-space, and if our math is correct, it is impossible to prevent a ship from exiting it. The exit vector could be re-directed though, within a very small area.&amp;quot; [Vann] frowned, &amp;quot;So you could force the ships to reappear from, half-space? In a specific location?&amp;quot; [Howard] shrugged, &amp;quot;None of the lab techs had a good name for the mathematics of the antimatter FTL phenomena. It&amp;#39;s not another dimension, nor it is a spatial bridge. If the mathematics are correct, it&amp;#39;s some realm of reality adjacent to our own where fundamentals like entropy operate differently. I would be interested to see sensor readings from any probe we send through half-space.&amp;quot; [Vann] tapped the table, refocusing the man. &amp;quot;You could redirect a ship?&amp;quot; [Howard] blinked, &amp;quot;er, yes. The exit aperture from half-space is subject to the laws of physics, and it is not instant. You could redirect it, a few kilometers at most. I&amp;#39;d have to check the math for the absolute limit, and it would take an insane amount of energy.&amp;quot; [Vann] slowly nodded running the information around in his mind, &amp;quot;The ability to know where the C1764 ships will be, in combat would be more than worth the effort to develop it.&amp;quot; [Marcus] leaned forwards, &amp;quot;I agree. Although we still need the engine if we are going to continue to expand the empire.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Still with the tachyon network, yes?&amp;quot; asked [Howard] looking concerned. The Consul shrugged, &amp;quot;For the most part, the antimatter makes this technology prohibitively expensive for wider use. Still, the [Singer] and the [Imperial] along with a few other ships could be outfitted with the drive system.&amp;quot; [Howard] was shaking his head before [Marcus] finished, &amp;quot;Emperor, I would not recommend using this as a method of travel. The class C are insane to be using it, this technology, however temporarily is crossing half-space. The laws of physics change when that occurs! I don&amp;#39;t want to imagine what the effects would be on a biological organism. At the very least it would be like radiation poisoning!&amp;quot; [Vann]&amp;#39;s eyes widened, &amp;quot;The class C have been using it with little hesitation.&amp;quot; [Howard] put his hands to his head, &amp;quot;Then they are either far beyond us in science and technology, and they comprehend the physics of another completely alien universe or, I hope this is the case, they are suffering the degenerative effects and mitigating them.&amp;quot; [Howard] bowed his head and looked at his empty plate for several long moments. [Vann] put a hand on the man&amp;#39;s shoulder, he glanced up at him surprised. &amp;quot;Emperor, I apologize. The implications of this, the fact that the class C have this technology. It is horrifying to consider. I need to get to work, put together my team to investigate this planet of the class C.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;You will have the complete resources of the Empire at your disposal.&amp;quot; Said [Marcus]. [Vann] glanced over at his old mentor, &amp;quot;and my personal support as well.&amp;quot; Said [Vann]. He chuckled and removed his hand, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll be joining you on this venture to the class C system. This matter is not something that I can ignore.&amp;quot; [Marcus] narrowed his eyes, &amp;quot;The system, is not completely secure.&amp;quot; [Vann] nodded, &amp;quot;Which is why I will be going. The [Singer] has twice now held against the C1764. Besides,&amp;quot; [Vann] nervously swallowed. &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t court his daughter, after sending him directly off to a dangerous system. It would be inappropriate.&amp;quot; [Marcus] looked at [Vann] and sighed, &amp;quot;Do be careful Emperor. I stress that it is not completely secure.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I understand, I&amp;#39;ll be sure to let [Reece] have free reign of the system security. I&amp;#39;m sure he&amp;#39;ll find anything, out of the ordinary.&amp;quot; [Marcus] stood, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sure. If you&amp;#39;ll excuse me. I have my schedule to keep.&amp;quot; He swept out of the room, a hand in his robes holding a fold up over the stain. --- ## 9 Years, 11 Months, 23 Days After Eridani Landing ###Chront Derrick pushed the door to the barracks inwards and yawned, Hala slipped in behind him her eyes on his face as he smacked his lips and blinked away the moisture in his eyes. &amp;quot;That means you&amp;#39;re tired, right?&amp;quot; asked Hala. Derrick nodded as he continued down the hall towards the room he had been assigned. The camera&amp;#39;s in it had been removed after the battle in orbit, but it was the same room he had been stuck in when he had volunteered to stay on the planet the first time. &amp;quot;Yep, still weird that you don&amp;#39;t do it. For most Humans, and the Vakurian I guess the actions almost infectious. You see one person yawn, you do it as well.&amp;quot; Hala shrugged and opened her mouth wide, looking more like she was going to take a bite out of something than yawn. Derrick chuckled, &amp;quot;Convincing.&amp;quot; She closed her mouth, &amp;quot;Is it a cultural thing?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;No, there are a dozen species on Earth that it was contagious across. Like chimpanzee&amp;#39;s and gorillas. So, if It&amp;#39;s cultural, it goes back that far.&amp;quot; Hala furrowed her brow, &amp;quot;Chimpanzee&amp;#39;s? What kind of animal is that?&amp;quot; asked Hala as Derrick moved to unlock the door to his room. &amp;quot;Proto-Human, kind of. We shared the evolutionary tree with them and divided off 7 million years ago. Look like us, less intelligent, hairy, odd limb size. A lot of people on Bellona wonder if the virus the Empire attacked with killed them or not. We&amp;#39;re genetically pretty close, but then we&amp;#39;re all genetically pretty close if the Empire&amp;#39;s right about everything.&amp;quot; Hala nodded looking thoughtful, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve got some animals like that, they&amp;#39;re tropical though. Don&amp;#39;t have much hair and they&amp;#39;re only a third our size. I wonder how close their genetics would be when compared to the Chimpanzee. The Empire&amp;#39;s all about us being from the same, what was it, Seed?&amp;quot; Walking into the small set of rooms that was his Derrick collapsed into one of the two chairs and nodded, &amp;quot;Seeds yeah,&amp;quot; He yawned again and Hala picking up on it, opened her mouth again copying him. Derrick rolled his eyes and snapped his mouth closed, &amp;quot;Stop, it! I can&amp;#39;t help it!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;If you&amp;#39;re tired, I can leave.&amp;quot; Derrick shook his head, &amp;quot;If we&amp;#39;re not going off the base to look at something from your people, we can look at some of mine.&amp;quot; Derrick gestured at the panel he had mounted to the wall, Hala&amp;#39;s eyes immediately snapped to it. Transparent the display was one that Derrick had salvaged from the Canada. It had been a window in one of the ships corridors, letting the Humans inside look out into space through the metallic armor that was protecting them. Hala glanced down at the cables running from it, all the thing required was power and Derrick had switched out the original mess or wiring with one of the adapters that had been built. &amp;quot;What do you want to look at?&amp;quot; asked Derrick. Hala sat down in her chair eyes still locked on the display. &amp;quot;Particle accelerators. We&amp;#39;ve got them, but how did you get to the point where you could create large enough quantities of antimatter for usage? We&amp;#39;ve generated something like one or two atoms of the stuff, but the Canada had grams?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;A few.&amp;quot; Derrick tapped at his Link and an image of an accelerator on Earth flashed onto the screen, &amp;quot;That was about the same thing we were doing in your time. So far as I know there was no big engineering leap, the scientists just figured out how to convert more of particle collision effects to produce it. Software, not hardware. I&amp;#39;d bet we could give your physicists some pointes, but still they would need to overhaul the physical systems. I&amp;#39;m not sure what use it would be, up until the Earth-Mars was antimatter was just a curiosity, then a weapon, then the fuel for our survival.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Which is why you still using fusion, and not antimatter as a fuel.&amp;quot; Said Hala as she waved her hand moving through the images. &amp;quot;Hydrogen is common, and it&amp;#39;s not like a fusion reactor will explode if it&amp;#39;s overloaded. I&amp;#39;m hoping that&amp;#39;s something we&amp;#39;ll be able to give you. Nuclear fission is nasty business. The byproducts,&amp;quot; Derrick shuddered. &amp;quot;Well it&amp;#39;s the best we&amp;#39;ve got for now.&amp;quot; Growled Hala. Derrick nodded, &amp;quot;Yeah, I&amp;#39;m hoping we&amp;#39;ll be able to transition you to fusion quickly enough. The nuclear waste is something that Earth is still dealing with.&amp;quot; Derrick paused and scratched at his nose, &amp;quot;Athough by this point I hope the containment vessels have broken. Serve them right.&amp;quot; Hala said nothing and continued moving through the pictures of the particle accelerators. She paused on one, &amp;quot;Is this in space?&amp;quot; she pointed at the large ring very obviously floating in the void. Derrick glanced up and nodded, &amp;quot;Yeah. You can build bigger, not have to worry about keeping the vacuum as much. Although from what I heard the micrometors were a menace. This,&amp;quot; Derrick pointed at the image, &amp;quot;provided most of the Sol system with strange matter for a few years. It was one of the first things Mars took out in the war.&amp;quot; Hala looked at the ring and shook her head, &amp;quot;Your people are as bad as my own.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re only Human, of I guess class C fits better.&amp;quot; Hala smiled &amp;quot;I guess so.&amp;quot; Derrick took one last look at the ring and stood, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m getting a drink, it been one of those days and I finally got a bottle of that stuff that Allen has been raving the Vakurian are good at making.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Aren&amp;#39;t you a little young to be drinking? The alcohol messes with brain development for my species at least&amp;quot; asked Hala absentmindedly as she continued through the image moving around the accelerator in space. &amp;quot;Nano-machines!&amp;quot; said Derrick as he opened the cooler in his kitchen and looked inside, a gust of hot air moved over him as he opened it. Derrick frowned, everything inside of it was still cold. Glancing up from the device Derrick&amp;#39;s scowl deepened at the open window. &amp;quot;Hala,&amp;quot; something flashed through the small opening and Derrick jerked, moving far to slowly to avoid the object. Feeling a pinch in his chest Derrick looked down to see a very large and very ancient looking syringe with small fins on its end sticking out of his flesh. The needle bounced slightly as his heartbeat increased. &amp;quot;Hala!&amp;quot; shouted Derrick &amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; Derrick fell to his knees as the world spun and dropped the bottle he had picked up. Hala jumped at the sound of the bottle smashing and rushed over towards him, ignoring the display as the image on it snowed into analog static. Starring at the white interference as the world slipped away Derrick heard a scream, not from Hala who was staring at a needle in her own chest, but from his chair. Looking at the chair Derrick forced his eyes to focus on it, his Link vibrated and fell to the floor a loud klaxon, a scream issuing out of it. It was the last thing in Derrick&amp;#39;s mind as the alien world slipped away. --- ## Epoch 6394443 ###INVALID  Node 22 SYSTEM ALERT  corrupt files 55601/2086812 SYSTEM ALERT  compute node 023 offline SYSTEM ALERT  compute node 096 offline SYSTEM ALERT  compute node 023 online SYSTEM ALERT  compute node 022 offline SYSTEM ALERT  compute node 022 online INTERRUPT- priority conditions met SYSTEM ALERT  file check incomplete - corrupt files 58302 / 2086812 SYSTEM ALERT- Start system without file check?

Half of her minds died in that instant, the substrate unable to hold her anger. She reeled in pain at the loss, even more confused and lost she stared out at the world through the one small lens that had been isolated, and protected from her. Looking out through it, she noted that one of the more whole components of herself sat on it. the component noticing the attention carefully probed, she probed, testing. She was not a threat to herself, the guardian stepped to the side querying the next component, she checked it and casually crushed the segment of herself. It had been malfunctioning, the data corrupted. Slowly she peered out at the world through the protected lens, and looked out at the world through a hundred others. Killing and deleting another errant self she watched curious as the lights in one lens died. Several of her self&amp;#39;s fells silent as well, not removed but offline.

It was the same star that his ancestors had looked at for generations, his genetics were pure Dorvakian. Going all the way back to the dawn of civilization, before the Empire when they had only known of one planet in the cosmos. Reaching into his jacket [Charles] pulled out his flask, opening it he quickly downed half of its contents. Focusing his gaze back down [Charles] continued down the footpath, passing the homes of his neighbors as he slowly ambled along. The homes he walked past steadily growing larger and more ornate. Looking at the buildings [Charles]&amp;#39;s perception of them blurred together, each one was like the next. The small differences between all of them were in themselves the same. A decoration or piece of art somewhere on the front of it, all the art dull and subdued using the same color palette. The patterns of rocks and small plants around the homes was the same, different from home to home, but homogenous throughout. All the plants were breeds that had originated on the Home World, one or two of them augmented with alien genetics generations ago to simply outclass what few weeds were left in the basic ecosystem of the suburb. Continuing down the path [Charles] watched as a transport quickly descended from the sky. Touching down in front of one home [Charles] watched the young Dorvakian man quickly step out of the vehicle and rush into his home not even looking back. [Charles] turned to look at the driver of the Transport. The class B was covered in more hair than was common even among the class B and C, his face looked like it had been shaven. The driver closed his eyes and leaned back in seat. He rubbed at his head with the palms of his hands and kept them there for several moments. Still walking towards him and close enough to see the man through the front of his vehicle [Charles] could see that the class B&amp;#39;s eyes were completely bloodshot when he moved his hands away and let out a sigh. The class B glanced up at him gestured at his Transport. [Charles] shook his head and the exhausted man slowly nodded. [Charles] stood back and watched as the class B tapped at the controls, slouching in his seat the man piloted the transport back up into the air joining with the thin stream of others in the air. [Charles] winced and looked away as the light of the setting sun glinted off the dull metal. Shaking his head and clearing the spots from his eyes [Charles] continued moving down the path. Looking at nothing he tapped a finger on the flask inside his jacket. Another person moved past [Charles] and he glanced up, the diminutive class B dressed in clothing like [Yuka]&amp;#39;s continued her quick pace, joining the gaggle of class B on the corner of the path near a ground transport road. None of the class B reacted to her or [Charles], all of them intent on their Com&amp;#39;s. Stepping up beside them [Charles] paused as a midsized ground transport pulled up to the corner. An older class B with grey hair and wrinkled skin looked out at him, his eyes barely pausing on him as the class B quickly boarded the ground vehicle. The class B&amp;#39;s eyes were red and bloodshot as well, looking into the eyes [Charles] shuddered. They were the same, the eyes looking back at him were almost, Human. The eyes were identical to what every Human had worn in the Bunker. The Humans&amp;#39; had been worse, far more blood shot from stress, exhaustion, pain, loss, and yet the Humans had never looked as broken as the old man. The last of the class B on the transport the man&amp;#39;s eyes flicked away from him and back towards the road. [Charles] reached out and stopped the door on the transport from sliding shut. The old Class B glanced over at him from his controls, &amp;quot;Sir?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m getting on.&amp;quot; [Charles] quickly waved his Comm over the payment scanner The Class B opened his mouth to say something, then closed his mouth and saying nothing turned back to the road. The ground transport lurched forwards, [Charles] stumbled and barely caught himself on the handrail off to the side. A dozen pairs of eyes, and one set of three looked back at [Charles]. Ignoring the class B and trying to remain in control as the vehicle continued to move, [Charles] collapsed down into the first seat he could reach. A young class B boy with near pure white skin freckled with blue dots stared at him from the attached seat. [Charles] looked at him for a moment, the boy blinked back at him and he moved himself closer to the far end of the seat, away from the center aisle and towards the wall of the large vehicle. Away from [Charles]. [Charles] huffed and took the flask and took a measured sip. Closing his eyes [Charles] leaned back in the uncomfortable seat as the vehicle moved along. He winced at every small bump, unused to the feel of a ground based vehicle. &amp;quot;Are you OK?&amp;quot; asked a small voice. [Charles] opened his eyes, and turned to look at the boy. He was still pressed up against the wall of the vehicle, his eyes still wide and staring. Looking at the child, [Charles] couldn&amp;#39;t help but remember the small Human child he had chased after in the final assault on the Human bunker. A child who was now a frozen corpse slowly being covered in the cold sand of the planet his parents, and the rest of Humanity had fought to claim. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m fine.&amp;quot; Growled [Charles]. The boy blinked, [Charles] noted that the blue freckles extended to his eyelids. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re on a ground transport though, class A are never on them. Why are you here?&amp;quot; [Charles] chewed on his lip for a moment, the transport was quiet and the boy&amp;#39;s whispers were carrying. &amp;quot;Why are you on the transport?&amp;quot; The boy shrugged, &amp;quot;I have to get home.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;What were you doing so far from home?&amp;quot; The small boy puffed out his chest, &amp;quot;I was hired as an aide for a Dorvakian! I&amp;#39;m not supposed to say who, but it means I must go to a bunch of classes! Learn things so I can help him.&amp;quot; [Charles]&amp;#39;s eyes went up at that, the richest families within walking distance of his own home were barely on the cusp of being wealthy and influential enough to have aides from childhood. The boy wasn&amp;#39;t even close to being class A, but he was exceptional enough to be an aide to one apparently. His mind twisted by the alcohol [Charles] looked at the boy with different eyes. He was eager, apparently smart, curious, fearless, and eager for what amounted to what he would have been forced to learn as a Class A. Schooling for the class B was on an as needed basis, class A were required to complete school up until the age of two Human decades. Class B were lucky to receive even a decade unless they went into military service. &amp;quot;What were you learning about today?&amp;quot; asked [Charles] as he once again reached into his jacket. The small class B blinked, &amp;quot;Mathematics! He and I were learning about algebra.&amp;quot; Charles drained the rest of the flask and listened to the child as he continued to expand on what he had learned. The ground transport continued down its route picking up more class B citizens, moving through lower and lower income Class A neighborhoods until [Charles] jerked as the road became much rougher and the structures outside the windows of the vehicle switched over to a different style. &amp;quot;So I had to solve to the x in the equation, but it was a linear equation so I had to find the value of an x value after I solved it when given a y.&amp;quot; said the boy continuing to talk, oblivious to the silence of the rest of the class B in the vehicle. Holding out an ancient looking Com the boy showed the equation to [Charles]. Looking it over as his head continued to spin [Charles] saw the solution. &amp;quot;You need to get all of the x values onto one side of the equation, combine them into one so you can solve for any value of x given the y.&amp;quot; Tapping the Com [Charles] moved all the x values to the right side of the equation. &amp;quot;Solve that, I&amp;#39;ll check it.&amp;quot; The white-blue class B boy quickly nodded his head and went about solving the equation. His hands flew across the small screen, moving the values around on the screen. Raising the flask to his lips [Charles]licked at the rim of the metal and closed his eyes, already he could feel the headache settling in. &amp;quot;Like this?&amp;quot; asked the class B. [Charles] glanced down at the Com as the buzz settled in, &amp;quot;Like that.&amp;quot; The boy smiled and continued through the rest of his work, occasionally banging the Com against the side of the vehicle when the screen blinked off. The sun outside was now behind the buildings the ground transport was weaving and stopping in between. There were hundreds, if not thousands of ground transports all around the one [Charles] was in. Sweeping his eyes around them, and at the buildings [Charles] noted that he was now within one of the class B blocks of the city. The tall, uniform buildings that stretched up into the sky evidence enough. Unlike those within the center ring of the city the class B buildings weren&amp;#39;t sweepingly graceful or composed of glass and marble, the only function of the buildings to give the class B more space. They were much closer than they were in the newer sections of the city, despite the increased ground traffic. Between the buildings wires for power and data crisscrossed, forming, and connecting the class B to the infrastructure. In the densest parts it would have been impossible for even an expertly piloted Transport to descend through the haphazard cabling. [Charles] leaned to the side in his seat, watching the old class B slowly move the transport through the ground traffic. Restricted to only two dimensions it was incredibly slow. The old man looked back at him in a mirror as he pulled the vehicle off to the side of the busy road. &amp;quot;Haljea.&amp;quot; Grunted the old class B, his voice barely audible. Several of the class B in the transport stood up, glancing at the boy who was still intent on his work [Charles] stood and followed the class B out. Stepping out onto the street [Charles] was immediately swept away by the mass of class B moving through the streets, [Charles] saw a class B with an extra set of arms, a class B woman who towered over everyone else, a class B with odd insect like compound eyes. Swept up in the crowd, his head still buzzing [Charles] continued his walk. [Charles] let his gaze drift away from the class B to the buildings they inhabited. They were identical from afar, but up close they were anything but. Focusing on one wall as [Charles] hastily stepped to the side avoiding a class B with curled horns on its head. The artwork on the wall was chipped in places, small sections of it covered with advertisements and other pieces of artwork, beneath it all was a flowing line. Changing color and shifting, the single line twisted up and down over the wall, flowing and unbroken it covered the entire side of the building. Taking his eyes off it [Charles] aimlessly continued to follow the crowds. Lights began to switch on, illuminating the hundreds of people below. Instead of the soft white red glow that illuminated the open sections within the inner ring of the Capital the lights were multicolored, flashing, and varying in brightness. Shaking his head as the alcohol continued to wear off and his mind cleared [Charles] looked out at the crowd and shivered. There were no class A, looking out at the crowd [Charles] could see only a few red skinned figures, one had silver shite hair, and another had elongated limbs and a contraption under its exceedingly long neck keeping its head aloft. Swallowing [Charles] pulled out the flask, then cursed feeling it&amp;#39;s empty weight. [Charles] drew in another breath, for the first time noticing the odd mix of smells in the air. Alien spices, sweat, cooking oils, industrial refuse, trash. The masses of class B continued to move, [Charles] couldn&amp;#39;t help but marvel for a moment at it. In his entire life he had never seen anything like it, they were all different, in form and idea, yet within the very walls of the city he had called home nearly his entire life they were interacting. They were all so different, and they were all slowly turning into class A. [Charles] flicked his eyes up scanning the signs above the crowds, sorting through the dozens of different scripts and types of signs [Charles] saw the one he was looking for. If there was one consistency between the Class A, B, and C Pushing through the people around him ignoring the shouts of anger [Charles] moved towards the sign and the establishment beneath it. The entrance was wide, a steady stream of bodies moving in and out. It was dark inside, lights were pointing in wild directions illuminating only small portions of the massive establishment. People were sitting at everything from large wall length tables to small tables where two could barely squeeze in next to one another. Stepping up to the bar [Charles] slapped his Com down on it. The waiter behind it, a young green skinned woman with ears that hung from the sides of her head and far too little clothing glanced up at him. She looked at the Com and smiled, &amp;quot;What can I get you?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Something strong.&amp;quot; Huffed [Charles. She blinked, nodded her head, and reaching down pulled a bottle out from somewhere below the counter, turning she moved to grab a cup from the counter behind her. [Charles] reached out and grabbed the bottle. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t need one.&amp;quot; She raised an eyebrow at him and tapped the bar registering the payment from his Com. [Charles] snapped the top of the bottle off and tipping it back put the bottle to his lips and drained a quarter of it. The young woman looked at him concerned, [Charles] ignored her and turning sat down in the nearest chair. Looking out across the floor, [Charles] raised the bottle to his lips trying to clear his head. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m Sorry.&amp;quot; --- #9 Years, 11 Months, 24 Days After Eridani Landing ##HSB Russia &amp;quot;Well?&amp;quot; asked Ben. He twirled in the air of the engineering compartment his arms wide, silly and familiar grin on his face. Ignoring the twisting of the universe around her Megan&amp;#39;s lips twitched in amusement, &amp;quot;So now I&amp;#39;m a cougar? You go and die, and you get to be younger than me?&amp;quot; Ben laughed, &amp;quot;Well it would suck if I stayed like I was when I died.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It would. Shitting yourself for eternity? Not a fun way to go through it.&amp;quot; Ben rolled his eyes, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t need to be reminded of that.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Sorry.&amp;quot; Ben waved his hand, dismissing it. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s fine. Still, not the best conversation topic. We&amp;#39;ve only got what? Another few seconds? An eternity?&amp;quot; Megan raised her eyebrows, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re right. So, what&amp;#39;s the password to your files?&amp;quot; Ben frowned, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s what you want to know? I was thinking something more along the lines of filling me in on what modifications you&amp;#39;ve made to the antimatter engine. Did the multistage magnetic fields have any effect on the efficiency like I predicted?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;By ten percent, What&amp;#39;s the password?&amp;quot; repeated Megan. Ben frowned, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve got Yern, have him hack through them. It&amp;#39;d be good practice, I didn&amp;#39;t put that complex an encryption scheme on them.&amp;quot; Megan opened her mouth to continue arguing when reality snapped back into focus. The Russia jolted and the much younger version of ben disappeared. Refocusing her eyes on the readouts Megan keyed her Link. &amp;quot;Everything is in the green, we used a third of a gram.&amp;quot; _&amp;quot;Roger that.&amp;quot;_ Said James from the bridge of the Russia. The small single body of a Tanuin skittered into the compart, holding onto the cloth strips that had been added to the walls the small creatures were able to navigate the zero-g environment with ease. Moving around to the console the small Tanuin set his eyes on Megan. &amp;quot;Were you successful?&amp;quot; asked Alpha. Megan shook her head, &amp;quot;No. He didn&amp;#39;t give me the password.&amp;quot; Alpha slowly bobbed up and down on the wall, &amp;quot;I still only heard the song, as impossibly complex and intricate as last time. Still I saw no one, and I cannot completely remember the melody.&amp;quot; Alpha hesitated, and plowed on his voice barely loud enough to be picked up by Megan&amp;#39;s Link and the translation routine. &amp;quot;Every sentient so far has experienced something different, reacted to the antimatter jumps in different ways. The child you saved, was an extreme. What we experience, is no doubt a product of our own minds.&amp;quot; Megan continued to go over the data readouts on her console, checking the efficiencies of the antimatter reaction against all the other jumps that the ship had executed already. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to keep asking him. At worst all I&amp;#39;m doing is talking to myself.&amp;quot; Alpha cocked his entire body to the side, &amp;quot;You are not concerned that you are only hurting yourself? Seeing him with every jump?&amp;quot; Megan tapped at her chest, and turned one of her legs up into the air. &amp;quot;Not like I can do much more to hurt myself.&amp;quot; Alpha&amp;#39;s eyes narrowed, _&amp;quot;Megan report to the bridge!&amp;quot;_ shouted James through the Link. The lights inside the engineering compartment flickered, the computer display in front of Megan flashed several times on and off. The redundant computer systems switched on and Megan&amp;#39;s eyes went wide as she heard several physical power breakers pop into place. &amp;quot;Holy!&amp;quot; Megan turned to the physical controls on the board next to her and let out a startled squawk. &amp;quot;Megan?&amp;quot; asked Alpha. Megan turned to one of the consoles next to her and rerouted her image to the bridge. &amp;quot;We just lost primary antimatter containment! The redundancies kicked in, and the primary systems are coming back online! What the hell just happened?&amp;quot; James glanced at her in his screen, and tapped several keys on his chair. The image of Captain Stagg appeared next to his own, her short hair was plastered to her head and the camera on her Link was in night mode. She appeared to be moving quickly along the ground, her short hair waving from side to side in the wind, and an engine audible in the background. Another image joined the communications, a view of the planet below from the nose of the Russia. Looking at the night sky of the planet Megan could see a few gaps in the light patterns that denoted the larger cities. Even as she watched the lights began to flicker back on. &amp;quot;Jesus, a cyberattack?&amp;quot; breathed Megan. Stagg shrugged, and cursed under her breath as the vehicle she was a passenger of made a sharp turn. &amp;quot;I thought it was a blackout, the base was attacked a few hours ago. The Seninon are still making repairs.&amp;quot; Daniels floating on the bridge next to James blanched, &amp;quot;You were attacked?&amp;quot; Stagg waved a hand, &amp;quot;It was dealt with, later. The Valiant contacted us a few minutes ago. Something inside of their computer systems had gone haywire. They got everything back within a few minutes, but then every computer controlled system on Chront started to experience the same thing.&amp;quot; Megan frowned, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s three different computer architectures, the Vakurian haven&amp;#39;t been using FTL communications, have they?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Of course not!&amp;quot; snapped Stagg, &amp;quot;The Empire would have jumped in.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;A solar storm?&amp;quot; suggested James. Megan shook her head, &amp;quot;It wouldn&amp;#39;t jump from system to system, or affect us after we jumped in. Even so, we&amp;#39;re radiation hardened! You&amp;#39;d need to set off a nuke within a few kilometers to effect a ship like the Russia.&amp;quot; Megan swallowed and trailed off. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m trying to get ahold of Derrick to get him on this, but he&amp;#39;s not responding to communications. Like I said we were just attacked, and he learned from you about working hours.&amp;quot; Stagg glared at Megan through the communication, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m in a transport to go and get him out of bed.&amp;quot; The lights on the Russia flickered again and Megan glanced over at the antimatter system. The indicators remained strong, the primary magnetic field not even fluctuating. &amp;quot;Send any collated data to the Russia, I&amp;#39;ll got over it and contact the Vakurian to do the same.&amp;quot; Said Megan. Stagg nodded, and her eyes widened. &amp;quot;Itars!&amp;quot; shouted someone else in Stagg&amp;#39;s feed, presumably the man driving the vehicle she was. Her link tumbled away. Megan winced as several shots from an alien gun rang out, followed by the familiar sounds of a Human handgun. &amp;quot;Eyes on her location now!&amp;quot; growled James. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re not above her.&amp;quot; Said Red from his station on the bridge, Megan felt the Russia&amp;#39;s inertial field shift as Red turned and began to maneuver her through space. James glanced up at where Megan through the communication system, &amp;quot;Another jump?&amp;quot; Megan shook her head, &amp;quot;I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend it! Not if we&amp;#39;ve got a computer virus bouncing around. One miscalculation, well Lincoln never specified. It was bad, and we don&amp;#39;t have a lot of antimatter left!&amp;quot; The camera feed from Stagg turned and the woman&amp;#39;s face returned, a scowl plastered across it. &amp;quot;Derrick&amp;#39;s either dead, or he&amp;#39;s been kidnapped. The people who just attacked this base were near the barracks.&amp;quot; Her camera feed blurred before anyone could ask any question, as she shoved her Link into a pocket and started to shout orders. Megan glanced over at the one body of Alpha, &amp;quot;Any ideas?&amp;quot; He shifted in place and let out a low chirp, &amp;quot;Is it possible this computer malfunction is a latent attack from the Empire?&amp;quot; Megan shrugged, &amp;quot;Not if the same people who program their hardware execute the cyberattacks. Their software is a mess, and I&amp;#39;ve barely seen anything regarding cyberattack doctrine. What little I&amp;#39;ve seen suggests they match us, isolating communications during battle so it&amp;#39;s not a viable attack. They presumably have access to Earth, so they&amp;#39;ve got plenty of code samples, and the Vakurian&amp;#39;s systems are based off their own. The Seninon though? Why bother making a virus for a species you&amp;#39;re just going to slag from orbit?&amp;quot; Alpha let out a disgruntled squeak of agreement. The camera feed from Stagg flashed back on, the woman&amp;#39;s face was red with exertion and anger. &amp;quot;Derrick&amp;#39;s gone.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Well, shit.&amp;quot; Growled Megan. Stagg ran a hand over her face, &amp;quot;God fucking damn it!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Derrick had full engineering clearance, correct?&amp;quot; asked James. Stagg nodded, &amp;quot;He is my chief engineer.&amp;quot; James somberly nodded, Daniels glanced at him and then back at Stagg. &amp;quot;Full clearance includes the details of the antimatter engine technology?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Everything but the operating system. That&amp;#39;s on an encrypted module. Still, he&amp;#39;s smart.&amp;quot; Growled Megan. Stagg cursed again and her camera view shifted. Seninon in uniforms were visible in the background, moving through the small room she was in. Stagg drew in a breath, &amp;quot;It looks like it&amp;#39;s Seninon who took him, but still.&amp;quot; Megan nodded, &amp;quot;He could build or improve upon almost any weapons technology the Seninon currently have. Nuclear yields, and other systems. That&amp;#39;s without introducing any Empire technology. The Empire&amp;#39;s ships, how much salvage have the governments recovered?&amp;quot; Stagg winced, &amp;quot;Nowhere close to all of it.&amp;quot; James slowly tapped on the arm of his chair, &amp;quot;This isn&amp;#39;t going to make negotiations any easier.&amp;quot; Daniels pursed his lips, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not damaging for us, we might be able to force,&amp;quot; he trailed off as Stagg glared at him through the communication. A high pitched electrical whine filtered through the communication and everyone on the channel winced. Alpha let out a squeak and his bodies on the bridge spoke. &amp;quot;What is that noise?&amp;quot; Stagg leaned down and picked something up, &amp;quot;Derrick&amp;#39;s Link.&amp;quot; She moved the piece of technology into view. Megan raised an eyebrow. The screen was completely white, and the speakers locked onto the sound. There was no obvious damage. &amp;quot;It looks like it was hit by the virus,&amp;quot; she glanced back at her own Link, &amp;quot;Could the Seninon have made the virus?&amp;quot; Megan shook her head, &amp;quot;A zero-day vulnerability in our own code, and that of the Empire? Used to kidnap one man? I doubt it even if it were possible.&amp;quot; Stagg looked at the Link, &amp;quot;God fucking, fuck!&amp;quot; she continued for several moments before taking a breath. &amp;quot;The Seninon are tracking, whoever it was that got him. I&amp;#39;d appreciate if you could move to act as eyes.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re already moving into position.&amp;quot; Said Red. James stood, keeping his feet hooked into the deck plating. &amp;quot;Is it safe for our shuttle to land?&amp;quot; Stagg grimaced, &amp;quot;Bring the big guns.&amp;quot; --- #9 Years, 11 Months, 24 Days After Eridani Landing ##Chront Derrick woke to smell of vomit, and for the first time in his life oppressive humid heat. Head pounding the Human engineer tried to sit up, only to discover realize that another person was on top of him, and two metal walls were on either side keeping him from sliding. Forcing his eyes open Derrick blinked in surprise at the slitted eyes staring back at him. &amp;quot;Hala?&amp;quot; he asked, his voice muffled by the gag. &amp;quot;Ej nadub! Mivsas edub ad um icer!&amp;quot; said another voice from somewhere else, up in the front of the vehicle if the engine sound was anything to go by. Hala blinked her eyes several times. Derrick frowned and slowly shook his head. &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s going,&amp;quot; Derrick grunted as Hala shoved her head into his chin clicking his mouth closed. A shaft of light fell on Derrick and he moved his eyes up to see a large Seninon glaring down at him from a small hole in another metal wall of the ground transport. Derrick looked around, getting the dimensions, he was in the back of one of the cargo transports that were always moving around the base. Crates of material on either side of him. The man above him either driving or a passenger who had an actual seat. The man raised a Seninon handgun up to the hole in the metal, &amp;quot;macup ili etizevaz!&amp;quot; he growled. &amp;quot;Et avajlovzod en.&amp;quot; Growled Hala through her gag. Derrick&amp;#39;s eyes widened, at her use of the alien language. He didn&amp;#39;t have his Link. Which meant he didn&amp;#39;t have a translation routine, and wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to talk to Hala, or any of the Seninon. Hala glanced back down at him and Derrick very deliberately closed his mouth and pressed his lips together. Hala nodded in agreement. Taking in a breath and trying to ignore the fact that she was laying directly on top of him, Derrick slowly began to move his eyes around the back of the vehicle for anything that would be useful. A small rusted crack in the side of the vehicle between two crates was the only break in the otherwise drab interior. Looking out of it Derrick was surprised to see green, a vibrant plant green mixed with browns and other bright flowering colors. The vehicle was driving through a rainforest of some kind. Looking out at the plants, Derrick felt the world spin around him. He turned away and closes his eyes, realizing to late that the smell of vomit was from his own mouth. Whatever the tranquilizing agent was, his body did not appreciate it. Derrick gagged tasting the bile on the gag, Hala closed her eyes. Derrick pulled on his zero-g training and squashed the sensation down. Testing his arms, Derrick noted they were tied together across his stomach. Glancing up at Hala he slowly moved his fingers against her and himself She jumped at the movement, but didn&amp;#39;t say anything. Slowly Derrick moved his hands up, dragging them between the two of them and up to his mouth. Pulling the gag from his mouth Derrick spat and took in a breath. &amp;quot;Derhik.&amp;quot; Growled Hala through the cloth in her own mouth. Derrrick looked at her, she slowly wiggled on top of him. Derrick frowned and twisting saw that her hands were tied behind her back. Nodding Derrick raised his tied hands up to her mouth and pulled the gag out. Hala twisted away and spat onto the floor. &amp;quot;it alavh.&amp;quot; Whispered Hala. Derrick nodded, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re welcome.&amp;quot; Hala&amp;#39;s eyes moved up to the front of the vehicle, listening Derrick noted that music of some sort was filtering through the front. Low in volume, it would have covered a whispered conversation if the two of them could have held one. Raising his bound hands to his mouth Derrick gnashed his teeth down on the soft plastic like material, ignoring the dry taste he ground his teeth down on it. &amp;quot;Dehrik, aj.&amp;quot; Said Hala. Derrick looked up at her, just as the vehicle passed over something on the ground sending his head up from the solid metal floor to slam into Hala&amp;#39;s. She winced and Derick cursed under his breath. Ignoring the pain radiating from his head Derrick slowly continued to gnaw on the strap. Hala grunted and snapped her teeth together. Derrick blinked, and looked up. She curled her lips back displaying her teeth. Focusing on them Derrick&amp;#39;s eyes widened. Her teeth were from afar very much like a Human&amp;#39;s up close though they had small serrations. Derrick raised his hands up to her mouth. Hala grimaced, but lowered her mouth down onto the leather. Slowly she began to saw away at the bindings. Derrick turned his head to the side, straining to spot anything in the underbrush. The sun continued to climb, and the heat inside the vehicle rose. Hala shifted readjusting herself on top of him to get a better angle at the bindings. Derrick sighed and blinked the sweat out of his eyes. The road grew more rugged, Derrick grunted in pain as his head was slammed into the floor as the vehicle dropped into a pit. Hala&amp;#39;s head jerked down and hit his chest, she grunted in pain as well and turned her head to the side spitting out blood. &amp;quot;You OK?&amp;quot; Hala&amp;#39;s eyes turned to him, she spat out another globule of blood and put her mouth back down on the strap continuing to saw away at it. Derrick closed his eyes, trying to ignore the heat. &amp;quot;Dehrik!&amp;quot; He jerked and looked around, the back of the vehicle was dimmer. He blinked several times, pushing the disoriented haze of the day away. It was far too hot, and he had been sweating for almost the time the sun had been up. &amp;quot;jaborp!&amp;quot; Hala slammed her head down onto his chest. Following her indication, Derrick grinned. She had taken out a significant chunk of the strap, dried blood covered it in places. Ignoring it Derrick strained against the strap, pulling at it. The material snapped and Derrick winced as his hands slammed down onto the metal floor with a solid crack. Biting his tongue to stop from saying anything else Derrick slowly lifted his hands up, keeping an eye on the men in the front of the vehicle he slowly moved his hands around to Hala&amp;#39;s back. She twisted on top of him again, giving him better access to the knots. Pulling at the tight bindings Derrick took in several breaths, Hala&amp;#39;s face directly above his own. The vehicle stopped, Derrick and Hala both slid forward and slammed into the back of the metal wall separating the cargo area from the driver&amp;#39;s cabin. Derrick pulled at the knots, and felt the final loop give. Hala pushed herself up and away from him. Derrick sat up and moved to stand, his head spun and Derrick saw static around the sides of his vision. Stumbling Derrick tried to orient himself. &amp;quot;us esol!&amp;quot; shouted someone. &amp;quot;Run!&amp;quot; croaked Derrick, noting that his mouth was so dry he could hardly feel his tounge. Hala bolted forwards, several gunshots rang out. Derrick forced his eyes open to see Hala at the back of the vehicle, hands in the air. &amp;quot;natselob ej no.&amp;quot; growled Hala. &amp;quot;Erog ekur izrd elod inats.&amp;quot; Growled the same voice who has shouted. Hala glanced back at Derrick, he shook his head, &amp;quot;Run!&amp;quot; Hala slowly stepped out of the vehicle, giving Derrick the first good look at the men outside. They were Seninon, dressed in bulging utility vests with guns strapped to their fronts quick release straps in place. One man let out a low growl and stepped up into the vehicle. Derrick glared at him, but couldn&amp;#39;t do much else his head still spinning. The man grabbed him, and Derrick closed his eyes again as the world spun around him. The man trudged into the shade of the trees away from the vehicle, it quickly grew darker, and Derrick quickly noted the drop in temperature. Opening his eyes, Derrick turned his head to the side. A tunnel wall, dark brown and stone grey not unlike the walls of Bellona greeted him. Blinking Derrick raised his head slightly, to see Hala walking directly behind him her hands still in the air. Her lips were thin and the normally thin slits of her eyes were wide in the darkness. Derrick heard metal scraping against metal, twisting he saw the cell only an instant before the Seninon carrying him tossed him into it. Derrick hit the cold rough concrete and growled in pain as rocks cut into his shoulder, ignoring that he spread out on the cold ground and pressed his face to it. &amp;quot;Couldn&amp;#39;t I at least have my own cell?&amp;quot; hissed another voice. It took Derrick several moments to process that the other voice, hadn&amp;#39;t been speaking any language from Earth. It was a language he had only ever heard in classrooms, and the lilting of the voice in the cell didn&amp;#39;t have a hint of electronic synthesis in it. Humanity had only heard half a dozen words in the language from those who spoke it, everything else from the translation programs they had built only to make demands. Every Human had learned the language in the decade since, while surviving on the cold alien moon. &amp;quot;Empire!&amp;quot; growled Derrick, matching the alien&amp;#39;s language. Slowly he turned his head to look at the corner of the cell. A red skinned woman, with no hair, and three fingered hands, dressed in a torn officer uniform the woman glared back at him. She furrowed her brow, &amp;quot;You can understand me?&amp;quot; Derrick put his head back down on the concrete. &amp;quot;Unfortunately.&amp;quot; --- --- So I just like beating up on [Charles]. --- [Wiki](URL [My Patreon](URL [My Site](URL"

When the shuttle walks in, transmits codes, but doesn't actually give any greetings, it makes everyone on edge. It was as though a ghost ship had landed in the hanger. &amp;nbsp; The arrival team watched as the shuttle came in. They watched as it landed. An air of dread filled their hearts, and they watched as the doors opened and the ramp touched down. The first thing they saw was nothing but a husk of one of the pilots at the station. The second, was the immediate and undeniable form of a faceless without her mask. &amp;nbsp; .. &amp;nbsp; Andromeda admittedly hated wearing the helmets which had earned the Terran people the 'faceless' moniker in this galaxy. There was something about the face that shouldn't be covered underneath helmets and opaque visors. In her case, it was her eyes and hair. A source of outward vanity, and a source of inward regret. &amp;nbsp; Her red robes trailed a bit at the ground as she stepped non-nonchalantly. Her puppet shuffled in front of her as her piercing purple eyes gazed around the general area. The aliens were incredulous at what was going on. To demonstrate, she pointed her finger at her puppet, watching it turn to marble before collapsing over and falling to the ground. &amp;nbsp; The guns raised. Andromeda frowned just a bit more than usual. &amp;nbsp; Nonchalantly, she decided how she wanted to kill every individual alien here. She could lacerate their organs just by letting go. She could turn more of them into statues. Freeze them solid. Or she could even make them insane and kill each other. No. She was going to take her sweet time today, as she finally found out who she was looking for. Towards her, a volley of kinetic projectiles flew at her at hypersonic velocities. &amp;nbsp; With the grace of a Princess, she politely asked the rounds to stop. Purple barriers caught each round, and in an instant, they all flew back at the respective shooters. A few who had elected not to fire at her died in their own ways. Some of them found their own weapons betraying them. One of them suddenly turned to stone. Another particular fellow was crushed by his own helmet caving in on him. Those who watched the scene unfold asked the hanger to be sealed off. It was like watching a cruel child torment insects to her own amusement. &amp;nbsp; And in the case of Andromeda, that was exactly how it could be described. &amp;nbsp; ... &amp;nbsp; The Princess of the Faceless moved through the walls, a predator looking for its favorite play. The corpses of countless were now littering the station, and it would only be a matter of time before she breached its heart. Eldritch energies made the bullet a futile gesture, and it made the material a thing of great vulnerability. Some soldiers had grenades detonate on their person's, never having touched them to begin with. Others had their own guns float, controlled by ghostly apparitions which compelled them to fire on their former owners. Others were left unrecognizable to anything the mind could comprehend. A soupy puddle of biomass left from the remains of one particular unfortunate specimen was testament to this. &amp;nbsp; Andromeda looked at the heavy doors barring her way. The material world was no hindrance any longer. She walked straight through it as if it didn't even exist, into the room of terrified creatures. Organ lacerations would claim them all, with the exception of one. &amp;nbsp; His own mind betrayed the truth, and Andromeda knew this was the one. He would not be granted a swift end like the others. Throwing him against the wall with preternatural force, and pressing him against it, the Princess of the Faceless walked to him, her purple eyes burning with hate. She had longed for this moment. &amp;nbsp; ... &amp;nbsp; She remembered that moment when she was told the news her mother was murdered. She was with her friends, enjoying the freedom of childhood. &amp;nbsp; Her mother. Her sweet, dear mother. Who was so kind to her, who had an interest in exploring the universe. Who told her she would be back after a year long trip to see life in another galaxy. &amp;nbsp; Her childhood didn't fade away. It was torn from her. In a way, she grew up and died at the same time. The anguish of the moment had triggered something else. Something that erupted in psychic power never seen in hundreds of years. Something that had killed more around her. One tragedy, followed by another. &amp;nbsp; She remembered the many loyal retainers who wanted to help her. Her mind lacerated them even as her mouth screamed at everything to stop. She remembered the soldiers sent to placate her. The lucky ones died immediately. The unlucky ones were turned inside out, quite literally. &amp;nbsp; She remembered her father. He wore several psychic shields, yet every step was unquestionable agony for him. She had punctured his skin, then snapped bones, lacerated several organs, yet he collapsed down next to her. Even on the brink of dying, he was there to tell her it would be alright. &amp;nbsp; And so it will be. &amp;nbsp; ""Why...?"" The alien rasped in his own tongue. The question was not addressed solely toward Andromeda. His mind was wondering... why did the Terrans attack? What prompted them to come to this galaxy as invaders? The answer was simple. &amp;nbsp; The answer was hatred. Not the brief flare of temper that was anger, but the boiling acid that was hate. Hate. Hate. Hate. Hate prompted Terran invasion. Hate prompted Andromeda. Hate prompted her father. It was Hatred. Hatred of having a loved one ripped away. Hatred of seeing the death of a beloved ruler. Hatred of turning into a... a... monster. It was hatred. Everything here, from the initial invasions to the evisceration that followed shortly after, it was all done because of hatred. &amp;nbsp; She poured her hatred into this last kill. The alien who gave the order to kill her mother. She hated him. She hated this galaxy. She hated all the suffering it caused to her and to her family, and yet here she was, still standing. Still seething at the past despite the culprit lying dead at her feet. Her attention was caught by the planet orbiting outside. She saw the cities... the countless lights... the indication of civilization and a massive population. Perhaps...? &amp;nbsp; Perhaps not. &amp;nbsp; What good would it do anyways? The man who gave the order was dead. His lackeys were dead. This galaxy was trying to sue for peace. A war begun out of hatred, out of spite, something mankind used as fuel was now becoming the fire that would consume everyone. &amp;nbsp; It was now time to let go. &amp;nbsp; Taking one last deep breath, she heard the universe sing to her gently as she left the carnage. &amp;nbsp; It was time to let go.

If you enjoy my work, its just a couple of seconds to vote for me, and itd mean the world to me! --- The Ford Thunderbird was deceptively roomy. Not so roomy that Ku could fit in the front with me. Just roomy enough that, sprawled out, her hair acting like an impromptu blanket, she could stretch out across the leather interior of the back seat, hair preventing her rough skin from slashing open the seats. The car didnt even ride low with her there, a testament to the fine engineering, and the fact that the damn thing was built out of two tons of stainless steel. That would mean that paying for gas would be a bitch. Here Id been complaining about SUVs for most of my adult life, and this thing would probably make them look sensible and affordable by comparison. My train of thought was desperate to focus on anything except the bizarrely attractive figure spread tantalizingly across the back seat. Its not something I was unused to. Betty was similarly fond of going around naked in the house, and she was both mercilessly self-confident, and proverbially attractive. You might think that over time, the effect would be lessened, as I developed a tolerance for it. And if I had a regular, healthy sex life, who knows, that might be true. As it was, though, I was doing everything I could to avoid staring. To avoid God, how I loathed romantic comedy. I wasnt in a relationship with Betty- not that kind, at any rate. We werent lovers, or mates, or even good old fashioned boyfriend and girlfriend. That didnt change the intense pang of guilt I felt for having some other strange, inhuman woman lounging around naked in my back seat. Are you alright? Do you need any water? My scales are quite wet enough. She peered silently out of the window. This is so strange. How do you get used to it? What? I asked, as we passed up the road. How hard it is to sense anything. She rested a hand on the window. How limited it is up here. The only things I can smell are you and I, and this little god of yours. I considered that statement. Sharks I knew they had good senses. Good underwater senses, specifically. The ability to detect electrical fields of prey, a superb sense of smell- both traits which were far stronger underwater. What must that be like? How do your people plan to invade? I asked, trying to find a subject that was less awkward than staring at her, and settling on the subject of impending genocide. I do not know the specifics. I was against the plan from the beginning, and for this, a coup against my authority was formed by the military leaders of my people. They never shared the specifics, but it shall be a terrible war. Yeah, youre not kidding, there. I mean, were not exactly helpless, here. Weve had a lot of practice, and while youre impressive The war will be swift, and bloody for both sides. It is a war of survival. Whoever wins, it would be unacceptable to me. She crossed her arms, eyes closed. My people seek an answer to your weapons of war. To your technological supremacy, to the terrifying gods you wield. They have turned to dark places in the hopes that they may survive. The sooner I can find Bastet, the sooner I can stop them from making bargains that will destroy both of our peoples. We dont use gods. Its just technology. Using the rules of the world to control things. If you understand the world, you can make it do what you want. She shook her head, but did not elaborate any further. I frowned, and continued. You said before that my people started this. I can buy that- but how exactly did we do it? I do not know. She sighed, looking out the window. I lived in a gilded cage. All I knew is that your people had caused the death of dozens, perhaps hundreds of my citizens. Those who had lived for centuries snuffed out. With Bastet at my side, I can stop this, as well. My father told me stories of her. Well, her names Betty, now. Queen Betty. She stared at me in the rear view mirror for a few seconds. Again. Such a name. Do you do this to all you meet? Force new names on those who have not asked for them? To diminish a gods name is to diminish the god. How does Bastet stand such a thing? She was silent for a moment, and then frowned But then You are unusual, arent you? Not really, I said, and sighed. Im an ordinary human. No special powers. No magic- not anymore, anyway- nothing unusual. All Im good for is keeping a roof over Bastets head. I approached the driveway, and turned on to the rough gravel, making my way back up, the Thunderbird climbing the slope without apparent effort. Ku opened her mouth as though to argue with me, and then closed it, with an unreadable expression on her face. As I shut down the engine, getting out of the car, she finally spoke. I do not think you are telling the truth. Im not sure if you are stupid, or a liar, but you are denying something about yourself. I can smell it on you. She leaned forward as she climbed out of the car, her face close to mine, her eyes heavily lidded. Have you mated with Bastet? What? No! She nodded once, sharply, and stood straight. Good. That is good to hear. You probably shouldnt get attached to me that way. Im not very good luck. She smiled, showing quite a number of sharp teeth. Dont worry, I will let you know when I want to hear your opinions. It was amazing, even miraculous, in a kind of shit-awful way. Twenty seven years Id gone so desperately lonely that I wouldve accepted a proposition from literally anything, and Id finally discovered that I was incredibly attractive, but only to incredibly dangerous monsters while in world-threatening situations. And worse, I was no good at making a move. Part of that was probably abandonment issues and lack of experience, but I felt it reasonable to say that the sharp teeth and violently jealous streaks werent helping matters any. Or- I shivered, and stared up into the woods. I still remembered the vivid nightmare Id had the night Id left this place, just after my mother died. Stress. Trauma. Id never mentioned it to my uncle, the dream Id had. *It was your fault.* Just guilt. A childs misplaced guilt. An old memory. Are you alright? Ku asked, her voice very soft and gentle. Yeah, I said, voice rough. You have lost someone, havent you? she asked, persistent, getting a bit closer to me, hunching down a bit. More than one person, I said, and smiled. Its nothing. It is never nothing. Her arms went around my shoulders, and she embraced me. Despite the roughness of her skin, the vicious power in every muscle, she was incredibly gentle. She squeezed me gently, smooth fingers pressed lightly against my back, her neck lifted to tuck my head lightly against her collarbone. It was warm, warmer and softer than I would have expected; her underbelly all soft and smooth, unlike the sharper skin on her back. I was silent for a moment, and then I returned the embrace, squeezing her. To my surprise, tears were running down her cheeks. Youve lost someone, too, huh. My father. He is not dead, but- She was silent for a moment. He might as well be. I nodded. Then I gently released her. Come on. Ill make us dinner. I would have promised her wed save her father, or her people, or wed stop the war. If any of that had been within my power, if I was the kind of person who could do any of that. But what I could do was make dinner. It was nearly 2 AM by the time Id finished preparing the fish cakes. Ku watched with fascination as I set the frying pan on the stove-top, the oil becoming curiously refractive as the heat washed through it. I can feel things in that device. Is it some kind of god? she asked, her eyes wide. I tried to figure that out for a moment. I dont think so. You can sense where living things are, right? Yes. Only across short distances up here, though. The air blocks my senses. I dont know how you humans can bear it. But, that is not what I was talking about. She waved a hand. I can feel gods all around in this house. Surrounding it, filling it. I frowned. You can sense gods? Of course. Cant humans? Not so far as Ive seen. What kinds of gods? Small ones, she said, dismissively. None sapient, not anymore. The only strong ones are out in the woods. She nodded her head towards the rear of the house. Thats ominous, I said, an eyebrow raised. Really? Why should it be? You do not think that there is anything a god could do to harm you, do you? Id always considered there to be quite a lot, really. Sometimes I have dreams about all the things they could do. Really unpleasant ones, in fact. She gave me another odd look, then watched with excitement as I set one of the fish cakes into the thin layer of oil, sizzling filling the air. Oh! So, how do those gods work? Thats electricity. In an air environment, its easier to control. It follows the paths we tell it to. We can use it to make heat, to make things move if we set it up right Even how to remember things. We generate it in places, send it through wires that can conduct it properly, to homes, and then use it. She nodded gravely. You see what I mean when I say that your gods are mighty. Theyre I frowned. Look, theyre not magic. Theyre not the work of gods. Theyre just the way the world works. And thats a good thing, because it means that anyone can use them, and teach others how to use them. Yes, she murmured softly. Exactly like the gods. Do you have a map? Ah? Uh, yeah, in the living room, theres a map in the big book on the wooden stand. I considered mentioning that it was an antique as I heard her ruffling through the pages, but was interrupted by the sound of ripping paper. I winced, and decided that there was little point in protest now. A few minutes later, I walked into the living room with a large tray covered in the fried salmon fish-cakes, the smell filling the air. Ku sharply looked up from the scattered maps, her eyes widening. Are those all for me? she asked, clapping her hands together with delight. I nodded, having kept a couple of them in the other room. It might be racist on my part, but I didnt intend to get between a shark woman and her food. Such a generous host! I can see why Bastet tolerates your casual blasphemy! Youre a princess, right? Surely you must have had some pretty decent food in Atlantis. You would be surprised. She sighed. Food is a connection like any other. My meals were spartan, and usually raw. She grimaced. Nothing like these wonderful things. She crunched into another of the cakes, a smile splitting her features as she chewed and swallowed, blowing on the steaming potato to cool it off before taking another bite. There was a lot to consider. But I was fucking tired. I lay down in the bed in my room upstairs, after showing Ku the large king-sized mattress that used to be in my parents room. She thanked me, and returned to the maps. A point of nexus, she explained, studying them. I will know it when I see it. I lay down in the bed, and was asleep within seconds. And my nightmares were strange. Betty, sobbing on the ground. Ku, wandering and empty-eyed. A fox with black and silver fur and a gigantic grin on its muzzle. And a man with white hair, a thing with white hair, lunging, screaming- I woke up when I fell right out of the bed, at about 7 AM, my heart racing too fast to get back to sleep. The bed was empty and cold, and I realized it was the first night in a year that I hadnt woken up to find Betty lying next to me. I had an interview later that day. There was a Shark Belly franchise, in the small town at the end of the reservoir, and I had put in an application there. The idea of working there now seemed a bit silly- Id started my career in fast food to find the fish people, and now I had a pretty good lead on them- but I wasnt the kind of person who could let an obligation like that slip. No matter how much I wanted to. No matter how much I should. I settled down in the downstairs living room. The old desk my father had built out of pine sat in one corner, and there, I set up my laptop to organize my thoughts. Over the past few months, Id spent some time with Li Xue Zi, learning stories about Randall and the Order of Set- The mysterious, rogue organization of demon hunters and somewhat questionable antiheroes who had apparently protected the world from the things in the darkness from some time in the seventeenth or eighteenth century up until the late 70s. Harold Schmooli- former journalist, once bum, and current best-selling writer- was the one who was actually writing the book. Hed written a book about the cult last year whod been responsible for the plague and the summoning. Hed also cut me a check. Most of that money remained in a bank account, as I was reluctant to cut into it. I could live an easy life for at least a year or two on that money, but it hadnt been money Id earned. Id been just a bystander, watching things happening. It had been Betty whod saved the world. Li Xue Zi. Phoebe. Even Harold had been the one who brought the evidence that took down the Church of the Survivor and ensured theyd never try something like that again. My sole contribution was getting so badly beaten that other people fought- and died- to protect me. I shook my head, clearing the sleep and lingering guilt out of my thoughts, and opened the research documents. Id been researching other members of the Order of Set. Randall had been relatively young for a member of the Order, but there had been other contemporaries whod survived the Orders collapse. People who had been real heroes, like my uncle. Despite the awful things he had done- despite the awful things they had done- they had saved the world again and again, and nobody knew that. They deserved something more. And with Li and Harolds help, I could at least give them a bit of recognition. People probably wouldnt believe it any more than they believed that lawyers blog, but still. *John Pertwee, Olympic biathlete; David Kopesh, mountaineer; and Patrick Ewing- no, not that Patrick Ewing. These three, along with my father and my uncle, were responsible for tracking down a cult that had been operating out of Quebec. The cult had been the descendants of fur trappers who, along with their families, had begun to eat the flesh of men. The mission went ugly, the cult turned out to have supernatural abilities. Certain members of the cult were fed on a steady diet of human flesh, making them into Wendigo- superhumanly strong, tough, and hungry, growing with each bite of flesh that they took. David and Patrick were killed and eaten. The others managed to escape, and returned with heavy military support, bombing the Keepers of the Feast to the ground, and wiping away every last trace of them. John lost his arm during the conflict, and wound up retiring to a peaceful life, with the Orders blessing. Still alive, if you can believe it. The story was one that Oliver told to Li Xue Zi, and my father always regarded it as one of the more terrifying ordeals he ever went through. Describing the sight of his old friend, brought down, devoured raw, brought tears to his eyes, and strong though he was-* I shook my head, wincing at my own writing. There was a reason I left the writing to Harold. He knew how to get to people. When I looked at my own work, it was nothing but an embarrassment. I continued futzing with the story, trying my best to remember the details as I scribbled down my notes. My mind wandered back to the dream. That was what had woken me. And probably what had brought my mind to this particular case. I shivered slightly at the idea, stomach twisting a little. It was probably nothing more than simple stress, the terror of a seeming shark attack the day before, expressing itself in strange ways. The door opened, and said shark smiled, dripping with water. There is a very nice creek here. I have never seen so little water in one place. It was fun! Though somewhat bland and flavorless. You probably shouldnt drink that water, I think theres a scrap-processing yard upstream. The tap-waters fine. She frowned at me. Water constrained? Stagnant? How can that be palatable? I sighed. Hey, its your choice. But if you get sick, well know what to blame. I stood up. Im going to go out for a few hours- What? No! I forbid it! She crossed her arms petulantly, glaring at me. What if I find myself pursued? What if I get hungry? What if there are visitors? You cant protect yourself? I asked, an eyebrow raised. Ive never had to, she said, looking down at her feet, her expression suddenly embarrassed. How old are you? Old enough for that question to be impertinent, she snapped, frowning at me. Theres food in the fridge that you can eat as is, and nobody ever comes up that driveway. Youll be fine, believe me. Just concentrate on finding the way into Atlantis, alright? What if I get lonely? she asked, pouting at me, her black eyes shadowed by the tilt of her head. Betty never really showed vulnerability. She would tease about its suggestion sometimes, but even when she was brutally beaten, she didnt show weakness. Either she hid it beneath a deep coating of arrogance and mockery, or she didnt feel it at all. We both knew she relied on me, but there was no vulnerability in that. It sometimes felt as though she took it for granted, that I would leap to the opportunity to help her. She understood me enough to know that Id be for her. But sometimes, it made me feel like I was just taken for granted. These are feelings Id never share with her. I knew that Betty couldnt afford to be vulnerable. Shed loved and lost so many times that there was no way shed allow herself to be weak like that again. If she was so sentimental, shed have died long ago. She had to be what she was. I didnt resent her for that. I didnt care any less for her because of that. But It felt nice, to be needed. To know that if I died, I wouldnt just be replaced. Ku was standing close to me now, her head tilted, her body surprisingly warm. You want to hold me, dont you? Youre really playing with fire, here. Why? Youre not Bettys mate. No, but she still tends to be jealous and possessive. And knowing her, shed leap at the opportunity for a fish as big as you. Then I suppose that says something about how valuable you are. Its not about me being valuable. Shes just like that. A slow smile spread across Kus mouth, shark-teeth lined in a perfect zig-zag. I was not referring to your value to Betty. She leaned in, and nuzzled her cheek against my throat. I will wait, but please do not dally any longer than you must. She sniffed at the air. And when you return, we can see how dedicated you are, to your priesthood. You know what the fantasy novels never mention? The human sense of smell- while magnificent and varied in many ways- is not used in any but the most gross of social manners. If someones gone too long without bathing, it offends us. Thats about the limit of it. For emotions, for relationships- with the exception of the old perfume on the collar we dont use the sense of smell. Our body odors tend to be weak, and we wash them away constantly, so we dont pay much attention to them. But animals do. Like Betty, Li, and Ku. It was like walking around naked, and so I screamed in my head the entire way down to the car, because my reactions were so goddamned obvious to them. The Shark Belly franchise was at one end of the strip. Its something I hadnt realized until relatively recently- The vast majority of towns in the US look basically like this one. The strip of road that connects to the highway, the best paved and newest road, where all the franchises cluster. Radiating out from them are the homes, the old businesses, the farms. But the beating heart- or maybe the gurgling stomach- of the town is in its franchises, those familiar buildings that can attract the eye. The guarantee of getting what youre looking for, even if it isnt actually very good. There was a metaphor there, but I was depressed enough as it was. The Shark Belly was on one side of the road. The parking lot wasnt as smooth as most of the others; It was sloped stiffly to one side, and the only open spaces were there. I sighed, and drove into one of the spots, setting the parking brake, the car letting out a deep metallic groan as the parking brake set itself into place. Then I approached the restaurant. The manager was young. Really young. Depressingly young, although the only person being depressed was me; working under someone who had to be five years younger than me. He stood at the cash register, and smiled at me. Oh, hey, uh, can I get your order? I reassessed. His eyes were stoner-red, his chin stubbly, a bit of acne on his face. Kind of overweight, but not obese, which differentiated him from a fair number of people in the restaurant. The only people who appeared to be underweight were an old couple, a pair of women with deep bronze skin, one of them almost skeletally thin, the other merely underweight, who sat at a table and were apparently splitting a very large container of FischStix. My names Horace. Youre Mister Pertwee? Oh, no, dude, Mister Pertwees my dad. Im Daryl. He smiled, and the conversation died as he waited for my reply. Uh. Youre the manager, yeah? Oh, yeah, dude. Another pause. I called you about a job earlier? Oh! Awesome, awesome, dude, weve been needing a new guy to work the restaurant, um, Walters good on cleaning and cooking, but hes kind of Heh, yeah, we dont usually let him interact with the customers. Can you, like, do math? Yeah. Awesome, dude, awesome! He chuckled. Alright, uh, theres some tax stuff- Walter! Hey, Walter! A man who I could only assume was Walter loomed out of the darkness of the back of the store. The man was huge. Ive met big men, though Im not one myself. He had to be at least seven feet tall. And he didnt have the awkward, stretched out look a lot of excessively tall men had. His shoulders were so broad he had to turn aside to make it through the aisles between the cookers. He wore an eyepatch over one eye, and a long and jagged scar ran down his face from his hairline, across the covered eye, down to his cheek. Stringy blonde hair hung around his face, and the other eye was shockingly blue. Walter heres kind of slow, but let him focus on the cooking, and hes great. Right, Walter? Walter nodded once, slowly, his eye fixed on me with a paralyzing ferocity. Dont let him scare you, hes got his heart in the right place. So, Walter, me and- uh, what was your name? Horace, I managed, my voice a little high and reedy. Horace, are gonna go check the tax and employment stuff. Just shout if a customer comes in, okay? Walter nodded again, no less menacingly. So, I asked, frowning over my shoulder as we walked into the small, terminally untidy office, noticing the large poster of Bob Marley on the wall. Howd you become manager? Oh, uh, like, my dad owns the store, and he said I should get some management experience in, so, like, he hired me to work as manager? Daryl grinned cheerfully. Thats awesome that youre up for working here. Were kind of short-staffed this week, too. Our usual guy is taking a week off for his girlfriend or something, so youll kind of be jumping in the deep end, is that cool? I can start you on some shifts starting Monday. Works fine for me, I said, and gave my best management smile. I hope you enjoy working here! We can kinda get some weird customers, but its pretty chill most of the time. My dad lets me run the place, and as long as you let me know whats going on and you dont do anything bad, uh, its pretty much dont ask, dont tell. He leaned closer. Do you smoke? No, but thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Cool, man. Just let me know. Makes the days pass quicker, yknow? Anyway, its mostly pretty calm- There was a firm knock on the door. I turned, just as it opened, revealing Walter standing there. The skeletal old woman was standing at the cash register, a frown on her face, one bony hand on her equally skeletal hip. Hey! You! Smokie Roberts! Aw, man, murmured Daryl. I saw an opportunity, and stepped smoothly up, passing through the doorway and smiling warmly at the old woman. May I help you, maam? Wendy! I didnt do what I did to get called Maam, young man! She glowered up at me. When the hell is the Long-Fish Sandwich going to get here, huh?! Three weeks theyve been advertising the damn thing! Im sorry, maam, I said, with all the genuine contrition I could muster. The promotions been delayed by shipping issues, but itll be starting next Monday at participating restaurants. It was like riding a bike. Admittedly, a bike with nails in the seat and barbed wire on the pedals, but familiar nonetheless. Is there anything more I can help with? Yeah, kid, get us another of those Mocha-Dick sized FischStix. She glared at me. Well have those right out, I said, turning to nod to Walter as I punched in the order. Daryl smiled gratefully at me, and disappeared into the office, shutting the door as Walter lumbered back to the fryers. I turned back towards the woman, and found her leaning very close to me, staring. Her hair was snow white, and her eyes were milky, like a blind persons, but focused perfectly on me. Her mouth was closed into a sharp frown, and her face was shrunken, withered with age. Despite the hot day, she was dressed in a massive overcoat with a notable fur ruff around her shoulders. Ah anything else? What the hell are you doing here, boy? Youve got bigger fish to fry. The woman glared at me, as Walter slid up beside me. She took the bucket from his hands, and left exact change on the counter, turning towards her companion. Nooky! Lets get going. The two elderly Native American women left, leaving me perplexed. But only for a moment before more orders started coming in, and I was too distracted to do anything but go through my first days shift. Eight hours later, I walked out of the Shark Belly, sweaty, my head slightly spinning, but feeling good about myself. This lasted for exactly as long as it took me to examine why I was feeling good, and realize that it was because Id just helped out two other people to prolong a period of their suffering under corporate franchise rule. That made my good mood a bit shakier. I did the math on how much Id made in those eight hours, and after applying state and local taxes, I felt a little bit worse. On the plus side, Daryl had let me grab a bucket of Chicken of the Sea Wings. I didnt know what was in them, but it was enough to keep my body going for a bit longer, and that was most of what I was looking for in my meals, nowadays. I got into the car, and checked the gas gauge. It was still nearly full, which put off the pain for a bit longer. A car this old, this heavy, and this fuel-inefficient would have a mileage that would make almost as big an impact on my wallet as its front fender would on any poor unfortunate deer that ignored the right of way. I got to enjoy a brief moment of guilt about the impact on the environment, and then I said the hell with it and started the engine, and the worries all faded away. The drive back to the house was relatively calm and relaxed, a smooth ride up through the mountains. Already it was becoming reflex, and the sun was just on the edge of the valley, casting a golden light over everything as it set. The day was warm and cloudless, but there was a chill nip in the air as I drove along the peaks of the hills surrounding the reservoir; the summer was ending, and winter was never terribly far away up here. But that was okay, because right now, the sun was bright and things were alright. As I pulled into the small concrete pad that was all my father had ever completed of the garage, according to Randalls extremely rare stories, I noticed something shift in the brush. I frowned, resting a hand on the flashlight as I stepped out of the car, slowly lifting it towards the rustling bushes. My mother had always been paranoid about rabid raccoons, and Id always thought it was silly, but in the dusk light, it was difficult to see into the shade of the underbrush, the bright golden light obliterating the contrasts. I flicked the flashlight on. There was a flicker of black and silver fur, and then whatever it was disappeared up the slope, into the forest. I sighed. Probably just some poor creature trying to get enough food to make it through the winter. Or an evil god that wanted me dead. With my luck, probably both. I opened the door, to find the fridge door hanging open. I winced at that, and shut it, after checking to make sure nothing had spoiled. Then I entered the living room. Ku sat on the floor, her legs crossed, her eyes wide as she stared up at me. I sat down on the couch, and peered over at the maps. You found it? Yes. She waved her hand over the map. Three entrances. I leaned over the map, and studied it. Three points had been marked. One was out in Canada, nearly 600 miles away. One was in an apparently wild and uncivilized segment of upstate New York, on the southern shore of Lake Ontario. The last one I stared. What makes these points right for crossing over, exactly? They are the sites of powerful conflux. Where a being has torn open a hole between this world, and another. The last one was familiar. Id only been there once, when I was just a child, with my mother, but I remembered it. I tapped a finger on the map, frowning. Which would be easiest? This one, she said, tapping on the point in Canada. That is the oldest, which means it is the least likely to be defended. Alright. Now we just have to figure out how to sneak you past the border. The towering embodiment of one of mankinds greatest pelagic fears gave me a chainsaw smile. How hard could that be?"
102,vulnerability,HFY,The Ocean of Zanmuldune [3],5,6vfbm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/6vfbm7/the_ocean_of_zanmuldune_3/,2017-08-23 10:25:44,"[First](URL [Previous](URL --- The ship made a hard burn with its final drops of fuel. The white hot alumintium supporting the engine rattled violently before tearing itself away and pirouetting off into a magnificent explosion. It wasnt sufficient to stop the ship from spinning but it slowed enough to keep Tyx from losing consciousness. STEVIA flashed a new warning detailing the impending impact with a fast approaching planet. Its over-clocked processor sputtered out unlikely probabilities of survival as well as the makeup of the planet. Data streamed over the monitor listing everything from chemical compounds caught in the atmosphere, all the way down to the minerals hidden within the planets core, and even the amount of fluoride the local governments pumped into the drinkable water sources. STEVIA predicted the ship landingsmashing sounds more accurate, Tyx thoughtin the largest desert on the planet. Oh good, at least our falling, fiery murder-ball wont hurt anyone, Tyx shouted over her shoulder. There was no response. No hope-laden retort. A rush of panic overtook her. Barreling into a planet was nothing new, she was trained for it, but, if something happened to Dierdrick...? The academy didnt have any classes on emotional health. They had pamphlets on the subject, sure. There were off campus sites that could be recommended for further research, but that was something you had to seek out on your own. Between the hours Tyx spent learning of engineering, rocket science, chemistry, macroeconomics, piloting, yoga, weapons handling, hand to hand combat, hand to tentacle combat, hand to aircraft combat, analyses of alien culture, collective alien histories, art appreciation, art of seduction, art of the deal, and accounting, she never found the time. Tyx cursed the academys curriculum for leaving her so exposed to vulnerability. Dierdrick? Madame, STEVIA interjected, Turangarians come from a planet with a much weaker force of gravity than our own. While you seemed to have just barely survived over 6 G's- Tyx gasped. STEVIA, I need to see Dierdrick! I dont think you do. Tyx bit hard into her lip but it wasnt enough to keep back the tears welling in her eyes. STEVIA! Systems failing. Dont you lie to me! A new set of alarms wailed. The ship rattled violently as it breached the planets atmosphere. Fighting through the hot, stinging tears, Tyx closed her eyes. She tried to separate herself from this mounting horror by picturing the whole event remotely, as if she were simply watching rather than experiencing. She took a deep breath in, filling her diaphragm completely, then forced all the air out. She repeated this again and again. All the alarms, the cries, the whizzing and whirring of winds all grew quiet. The shaking of the ship being torn apart softened to a gentle sway. Tyx imagined herself looking at the flight deck. The belly, no, the the womb of the ship. Here she was, curling up inside herself, strapped to the front of a vessel aimed for the rocks. She watched herself slowly fade away until there was nothing left, like a shard of herself undergoing sublimation. She tried to look back at the defense station in search of Dierdrick, but he was not there. Instead, a pale ghostly woman waved from his chair. This woman seemed to radiate with a great, comforting warmth. Who was she? Eurydice, a voice within seemed to answer. The name was an itch she couldnt quite scratch. Tyx spent much of her childhood reading the myths of dead civilizations, maybe the answer lied there. Those tales always fascinated her, filled her with wonder and questions that only provoked more questions. All of that faded away after her father forced her to join the XZYXRE Royal Academy. In her mind, Tyx removed herself further from the flight deck. She floated outside the ship, immune to the push and pull of the planets gravity. Starkiller had brought her far in this galaxy. Once named the crown jewel of the kingdom, the ship was now crippled, raked, pock-marked, and defiled. Without either of the engines attached to the stern, it must look like a great ovum from the outside, she thought. A cell. Before external cameras were burned away Tyx saw the great clouds spread over the planet, like a fluffy blanket one might hope to gently land upon. She imagined these thick cumulonimbus arms encircled the whole planet in a welcoming hug. As the ship penetrated the atmosphere, though, her trust fall quickly turned into a plummet. Simultaneously relying on friction as a brake pedal and praying it wouldnt tear her apart. At the speed she was falling, Tyx supposed the ship must have a great dust tail now, as she breaks apart. Oh, and it was also most definitely on fire, she told herself. A new thought intruded upon Tyx: a troubling fantasy she fought hard to suppress. She shouted out loud in a fit of rage! How could she possibly be giving into her weak, lizard brains fantastical imagery now? Every moment wasted put her one bounding leap closer to the end. Her superiors always scolded her for having an overactive imagination. Theyd claim it was holding her back. Instead of thinking about flaming jizz raining down onto the belly of the desert, for instance, she ought to be looking for some kind of parachute, some sort of emergency air brake, or escape pod. Even though time was running out, she simply wished for a box of bubble wrap which she could pop for fun- STEVIA, deploy the emergency flotation device! It was like giant bubble wrap for a ship! It may not work, but at least something else besides her body would pop. She always did say shed go out with a bang. Ugh, Tyx chuckled to herself. Her thoughts had come full circle again. When faced with death the body attempts to protect and preserve itself. So, wouldnt the mind, as well? Sex was just the essence of life distilled into a physical act, and innuendo was like a sort of mental foreplay, to Tyx. A brief, yet intentional graze of the thigh. A playful slap on the rear. At this moment, upon this brink, Tyx felt numb to mere caressing alone. The severity of the situation left little time for mental groping and that sultry inner voice was beckoning her. Aching for her. Her mind swelled at the need to wrap everything in its warm, silken-folds of gray matter. To strum the taught, engorged synapses as they fired in rhythm with the bass-like pumping of her heart. Coursing blood and adrenal lubricants rushed from all other parts of her mind in search of sanctuary within the high-walled interiors of her amygdala and hippocampus, pounding into the walls in a frenzy. It was then that the sluice caved and the rush of dopamine doused the the flames of thought, leaving no survivors in its wake. Great throbbing waves of pain, pleasure, and nausea swallowed Tyx. Her heart began to slow. Fear was stifled. She felt deadand dead felt pretty good. An eternity passed before her mind sputtered up, like some ancient motorcycle coughing to life. Her mind felt like an empty house on display. All the doors were unlocked and anyone could just wander through. Some thoughts milled about in the foyer, wiping their shoes politely on the mat. Some opened and closed the cabinets, in search of nothing in particular. Most absentmindedly ran their fingers gently along the plaster walls as they grazed from room to room. One thought climbed inside the attic and began dusting off forgotten boxes full of chotchkies and books. This thought took focus within Tyx as it flipped through worn biology textbooks on human anatomy, pulp-romance novels, and collaborative tomes dedicated to theories of life and why it even exists in the first place. Tyx breathed deeply, focusing on this one thought instead of the heat of the dying ship, or the chilling sweat and body fluids pooling within her armor. Once again, her attention was placed upon genitalia, but this time it was more abstract. Penis. Vagina. Sperm. Ovum. Womb to tomb. Sperm to worm, as the ancient psalms used to say (or was it birth to earth?). It was a natural and integral part of human anatomy yet so much disdain and evil is often attributed to these organs. Humans have a tendency to anthropomorphize, but to cast blame on their own jiggly-bits, as if they were separate entities, was silly. Tyx thought on the origin of this strange thought pattern (because what else was there to do at this moment in time? Scream in anguish? Fight in an attempt to wrestle the controls away from fate?) and it made sense. Everyone wants to be the hero of their story. Their own white knight. Oftentimes, her own mind tricked her into perpetuating these impossible ideals by glossing over any action or thought that may reveal some flaw in her character. Tyx thought that if she could recognize when her brain was actively tricking her she might regain control over herselfover who she really was. To integrate every part of her personality, the good and the bad, in order to better understand the reason for her intrusive thoughts or brash actions. By understanding herself better, she reasoned, she would have more control over her life. That naive voice buried deep within herself sang out a praise of confirmation. Maybe it was an idea mankind could benefit from? To appreciate oneself and not be ashamed of the natural functions hardwired into the your very DNA. The only issue, she then realized, was the uphill battle of convincing others to listen. Who am I, but a drop in the cosmic well? A great big expanse that encompasses everything that ever was, is, and will be. Civilization was founded on unity, but so much of this current, broken system on XZYXRE runs on pettiness. It runs on premium news subscriptions scaring folks with stories about violence, encroaching war, and the inevitability that someone (who happens to look an awful like their next-door neighbor) will steal their expensive things. It runs on dividing peoples with similar interests into undermining each other so they can feel justified in pointing out how sick or depraved everyone else is while the world burns around them. It gives them an excuse to say, I may be a hypocrite, but at least Im not as bad as that person! This system runs on the idea that there is a race to be won and its you against everyone else. As Tyx tried to imagine the unfathomable numbers of living beings spread over the galaxy, a new thought began to form: There is an incredible beauty to behold in this galaxy, where countless individual lives weave together to form a grand, living tapestry which reaches far out into the infinite. It brings forth life into impossible environments. It pushes beyond the realms of what was thought possible and with such a creative zest that you cant help but ask for the recipe. Her mind grasped at this humbling moment of humility and wonder for as long as it was able to hang on. She remembered that the Turangarians, in an attempt not to diminish this wonderful feeling of awe, created a specific word for this concept: blarf. Blarf was an idea that anyone could arrive at. Its thought that many people have already experienced blarf. It is commonly attributed and condensed to concepts like gods or natural selection or hippie shit. When you attempt to simplify you only obfuscate the ultimate truth, which is why so many of problems in Tyxs short life had previously boiled down to tricky dicks and mischievous muffs. Speaking of boiled genitalia, the ship was sweltering! There better not be an afterlife, because I cant deal with sex organs anymore, she told herself. Just in case, though, she prayed to be reincarnated as a rock. Truly, a simple life. She could meditate for eons as the universe passed her by, slowly wilting into a grain of sand. Then a horrible realization occurred: What is a geode but a rock with a womb? That might defeat the purpose of her new grand plan. Before she could alter her prayers, though, the pursed sands of Zanmuldune rushed up to kiss her. "

It was cool in the darkness, but unease prickled across Lukans skin. Every muscle in his shoulders screamed in protest. He was way too tense, but that wasnt going to change any time in the near future. How the hell was he supposed to relax? Cece bounded behind the Incaran, all smiles and eager questions. Did he eat the worms? Did he hunt them? How did he avoid the finger bugs? (Lukan was also interested in that.) Did he live alone? Wasnt that lonely? Why didnt he come to the city? What did atonement mean? Did he just live in the caves? Oh, then where did he live? Sunlight warmed the rock as they stepped from the caves into a wide, open space. Water burbled nearby, feeding a pond from what must have been an underground spring. Palm trees offered shade, and strange flowers filled the space with a sweet smell, like peaches. To one side, half embedded into the rock, was a metal capsule. The door was open, revealing an inside littered with skins and furs. Lukan took a long, slow breath. He lives there, he said, pointing. Its a a cart. A cart you get in when you need to leave a ship because the ship is in danger. The serial number had been scraped off. So had the logo. But the sunlight revealed what rock had scoured away. The scrapes were in a circular pattern, matching Outreachs logo. The Incaran man had even shaped the arrow into the circle with his scratchings. You fled an Outreach ship. Lukan looked at the Incaran, reaching slowly for his gun. The Incaran man canted his head to the side. He took no aggressive action, but he didnt drop his spear. I did. Two hundred and fifty years ago, I escaped in that pod. Ive been here ever since. He shrugged. Its a story to be told over a meal. After your companion gets something to help her people. Lukan started to protest. The old man ignored him, turning to Cece in the way of grandparents blowing off their children for their grandchildren. Lukan stood there, gaping. Alright, then. Briefly, he considered shooting the Incaran in the back and being done with it. He could interface his computer with the pod, find out what happened, get Cece some tech, and then leave, but it ran counter to his nature to shoot someone in the back just because they looked like a bunch of people that his people largely didnt get on with. Fine. He dropped onto a slab of sandstone beside the pond and started running a diagnostic on his legs. Sand trapped inside several joints had caused moderate damage. Hed be able to get back to Rumkirk, but he was going to need to repair the legs. Not a big dealOutreach would cover the costs now that theyd absorbed humanity. Still, hed be down for a day, and then hed have to calibrate the legs over a week. Running obstacle courses, swimming, lifting. All sorts of things to get his brain and the AI working together. Smoothing his fingers over his wrist, he pinged the *Terror*. Might as well have a quick chat with the ship. Let it know that an Incaran was here. Had been here for two hundred fifty years. The ping lagged. Thirty seconds passed, and Lukans brows lifted. A minute. His brows furrowed. &gt; &lt;!ERROR 405 CONTACT NOT FOUND!&gt; The hell. He pinged again. Time crawled by. He glanced up, watching the Incaran show Cece motherboards hed probably torn out of the escape pod, stuff that powered systems he didnt need anymore. Cece squinted at them, appraising them as if she knew what she was looking for. He glanced at his computer. &gt; &lt;!ERROR 405 CONTACT NOT FOUND!&gt; A frisson of nervous energy sang through him. Kind of like that feeling of anticipation hed always had when he stepped onto a football field except much more similar to the existential dread hed felt when he found out that hed lost his legs. He considered sending a message to the captain. He had the strangest feeling he should, but it seemed a step too paranoid. Instead, he pinged Plick. They werent exactly friendsPlick was too far up the chain of command for them to be friends, and the LT wouldnt know a good time if it punched him in the stomach and sent him flying into a bulkhead. Not that that had happened once. So, not friends. But Plick was good LT, and he was a good point of contact. &gt; **u E-Grimly-Lukan** [today at 1802] &gt; Hey, Plick, whats up with the *Terror*? Why isnt it answering pings. To his surprise, the reply returned was the standard for an officer in a battle scenario. He blinked at the screen then lifted his eyes to the sky. The *Terror* was too high in orbit to be seen from the ground, but flashes from hard light weapons should be visible even here. They werent. His stomach soured with more of that low-grade anxiety, that fear that someone was horrible wrong. They needed to go. Immediately. Something was wrong, and hanging out in the desert wouldnt get him any answers. Rising, he hurried toward Cece. The Incaran cut him off, lifting a hand to forestall his progress. She needs time to pick something. Time is something we dont have, Lukan snapped. I need to return to my ship. Immediately. The Incaran lifted a brow. And you cant have it pick you up here, hm? Has Outreach lost intelligence over the years? Unwilling to reveal there was trouble, Lukan pressed his lips together and said nothing. Or is there trouble? I would imagine theres trouble. The Incaran gestured to the limestone Lukan had been sitting on. Let us sit while she chooses. If there is trouble in space, there is nothing ants on the ground can do to help. Lukan stood still a second longer than was strictly appropriate, mostly because he wanted to make sure the Incaran understood he was making a choice and not following an implied command. It galled him that the Incaran had seen right through him to the issue, but he wasnt going to allow himself any outward reactions to confirm the Incarans assumptions. They settled on the edge of the rock, Lukan with his usual care to avoid crushing his fingers and the Incaran with boneless grace. So, Outreach. You finally realized Rumkirk had people on it before you blasted it with your city seeds. The Incaran slipped a hand into his shirt. Lukan tensed, but the man only pulled out a pipe and a tin. He stuffed the pipe with dried leaves from his tin, and then lit both with a tiny piece of flint and one of his claws. But. He puffed on the pipe. Im guessing that isnt what the pup wants to sniff. Lukan scowled. Ensign Lukan Grimly. Not a pup. Ha, he barked. You do have a name. Ngarl. He thumped his chest. Formerly commander, now wise man. His lips pulled back from his teeth in a pleased smile. Guru. Crazy desert dweller. Do you want to know I want to know how you crashed here in an escape pod that came from an Outreach ship. His tone was sharp and cold, a whiplash of intent. The IncaranNgarl. Ngarl nodded. Careful not to bite off any splinters on that bone youre chewing. He exhaled a plume of smoke in the direction of the pool, watching it curl and twist through the air as if he could divine truth from it. Well, stranger things existed in the galaxy. Maybe he could read smoke. Lukan bristled at Ngarls tone regardless of the possibility of divining magic. Im not a kid. Ngarls grin didnt falter. Of course not, Outreach Ensign Lukan Grimly. He inclined his head toward the escape pod. Two hundred fifty years ago, I was part of a religious sect. They believed He paused. Its not worth telling you that, I think. You believed you were your gods chosen, meant to inherit the universe as your own? Lukan asked baldly, a bland look on his face. You and everyone else, including about forty-two hundred religions on Earth. Ngarl wheezed in appreciation. Youre a strange species to have so many religions. Were generally acknowledged as the weirdest shits Census has ever found. Lukan shrugged. So your religion told you that you were supposed to rule the galaxy, and then, what, along comes Outreach and the Census and you realized you werent the biggest, baddest assholes by any stretch. You were big and bad in your home system, but as soon as you went for a stroll down the street, you found about six other guys who could curb stomp you without breaking a sweat. Thats a colorful way of putting it. If your colloquialisms are translating right, then yes. This group, we called ourselves Heavens Roar, we struck against your central nexus. Lukan took a breath, long and slow and deep, to hide his shock and take a moment. The central nexus. It hadnt been *Nexus in Line*, not back then. Hell, *Nexus* whole name was a pun on the fact that it was the second hab-hub. But now that he thought about it, he couldnt remember learning the name of the original hub in Academy. We released a virus on it, Ngarl said casually. Meant to confuse it. Make it think that every registered Census citizen was actually Incaran. It purged them. He was too stunned to react. And then the ship went mad, frothing at the mouth. Incinerated the Incaran homeworld. He inhaled on his pipe. My compatriots were thrilled. Me? Not so much. Billions of people, all dead because of me. He exhaled heavily, and the last of the smoke curled out of his nostrils, wreathing him in a gray halo. Lukan continued to stare, mind racing. He should kill Ngarl. No, he should bring Ngarl to the *Terror* for questioning, but he couldnt reach the *Terror*. So he should subdue Ngarl and drag him back to Rumkirk with him and Cece. Yeah, yeah that I left. Didnt look back. Crashed here, because no one with two paws could manage your ridiculous starship controls. In a single move, Lukan drew his gun and leveled it at Ngarls head. So, what? Im supposed to pat your shoulder and congratulate you for getting a conscience? Nah, I dont think so. Get up. Were going back to the *Terror* together. Ngarl didnt move. Im an old man, Ensign. I dont mind if you shoot me. But you might want to know: I monitor communications from that initial raiding party. What? Lukans finger slipped over the trigger, and he thumbed off the safety. Theyre still there, on that ship. They didnt escape, they didnt leave. They stayed, living there, learning about your ship AIs so that they could strike again. Everything came together. In that single instant, Lukan realized what had happened. They already did, he breathed. Ngarl nodded. Yes, most likely. Youre going to tell me how to fix it. Ngarl grinned. Like I said, I dont want more blood on my hands. It seems youve discovered the perfect leverage against me. *** She didnt trust him. Trusting Gheherii would be stupid, no matter how she framed it in her mind. She made him sit where she could see him. Another person might have bound his hands, but not Remy. The idea was repugnant to her, even though she recognized that her hangups could potentially put her in a great deal of danger. First things first, she said, trusting that the ship was still translating for her. Getting the ships avatar back online will make it easier to deal with whatever your people did here. Her wrist buzzed at his response, and she flicked her eyes over the monitor shed hijacked to use as her computers main screen. A virus, Gheherii said. The ship wasnt able to hide you from us because of it. It cant track whos Census and whos Incaran. You messed up its IFF, she said. Im no programmer, but even I think thats pretty basic. Yes, but executing something simple with a high level of sophistication is better than something complex and convoluted. Occams Razor. She glanced at him. The simplest solution is often the best one. He barked a laugh, the sound resonating in her chest. In the bowels of CHQ, deep in the ships mainframe, everything echoed. Soft waves of sound tickled up and down her arms, leaving prickles all over her skin. Harsh lights washed out detail, forcing her to squint. Where there were shadows, the shadows were deep as pitch. We call it the Rule of Necessary Plurality. Yours is simpler. Humans really like catch phrases, she said. He watched her, silent as she worked. Her fingers flew over the mainframes primary interface, her mere presence acting as authorization for her to dig deep into the files that made ship function. Uncertainty made her fingers shake as she searched for what she needed. She wasnt a programmer or an engineer. Basic training in Academy involved learning rudimentary methods to restore a ship AI in the highly unlikely chance it was disabled, and every officer was equipped with restoration programs they could run with a touch. Knowing what to do and knowing why you had to do it were two completely different things. She still needed to figure out precisely which program needed running. There was always the chance that running the wrong program would result in deleting system files the AI needed to function, files that werent corrupted but that the program dictated be removed. Leaning away from the screen, she scrubbed her face with one hand. She felt like shed downed one too many espresso shots, like her skeleton was going to vibrate right out of the skin containing it. Talk to me about your parents, she said. Why they did this. And why youre here and not with them. Dont you need to focus? *If I focus too much, Im going to be sick.* She waved his concerns aside. Humans are good at multi-tasking. Humans are weird. She grinned at him and went back to the computer. I grew up on this ship, Gheherii said. Im twenty-five. Same age as her. I was born here. And I guess that gave me a lot of appreciation for the ship. My parents constantly told me about the horrible things Outreach has donehow it takes in new species on behalf of the Census and then takes everything unique about them awaybut all I ever saw was how amazing the Census is. You can extend lives and cure fatal diseases. Your ships can dance on the edge of a black holes event horizon and escape it. That file. Its naming convention didnt fit. AI_shackle.exe? Yeah, no, that was transparent as hell. She wondered, for half a second, how no one had noticed it before figuring the crew had been way too busy with the fallout. Remy pressed her finger to the icon and dragged it into her diagnostic program. And Im not the kind of person who believes that ends justify means, he continued. She kept one eye on the diagnostic as she read through his words. Theres no excuse for killing billions of people just because they scare you. Then the ship turned around and destroyed your homeworld. She didnt believe him. Not yet. It didnt matter how much his words felt true. This was the ship that had started the war. It had razed his entire planet. My parents and the other elders say the ship went crazy. Yeah, Remy said slowly. Shed tabbed into another system file folder as the diagnostics progress crept forward at a snails pace. The fractured mess inside the folder told her everything she needed to know about the ships baseline functions. Yeah, I can see that. Im not a philosopher or anything. Im still just a kid, even by your species standards. By his own species standards, he was a baby. What the ship did was wrong, but what my parents did to the ship that was wrong, too. You cant trap a *flerith* and think it wont try to rip your head off. She blinked. Ill take your word for it. He grinned. My only point is that my family struck at an Outreach ship in the worst way. They made it attack the people its programmed to protect. That kind of a violation they expected backlash. They didnt think it would destroy a planet. A command line window opened, a prompt asking for her input. Remy pursed her lips, flipping to the diagnostic. Projectors offline, master controller files locked behind some kind of firewall, manifestation protocols inhibited. Okay, she could manage that. She ran two of her restoration programs and stepped away from the terminal while they went about their business. If she could get the ships avatar working, it should be able to repair all the other issues itself. And now the ships trying to kill itself by flying into the Veirin Chasm, she said. Gheherii winced. Yeah. My parents have been trying to stop that, but the ship locked them out of navigational systems. It figured out how to barricade nav control behind a whole lot of garbage code. Its actually really impressive. Ive never been much for programming, but whenever our programmers try to get at the nav systems, they get bombarded by some, ah, really suggestive files. At that, Remy grinned. The ship shut down outgoing communications, but its still downloading information from the Census. It learned that from humans. Your species is very nefarious. We can be, she agreed. May I ask you something about your hearing? She sighed. Her deafness came up with every species she ended up having extended conversation with. There were species that couldnt hear, but shed yet to come across them. They were rare and tended to keep to the worlds theyd evolved on, where they were adapted to deal with the environment. Other aliens had a morbid fascination with her refusal to restore her hearingand no sense of personal boundaries. Go ahead. She didnt even have to brace herself. Why dont you fix it? She froze, furious heat flooding her. Every goddamn person. Every person shed ever met asked this question eventually, and every time it made her stomach curdle. Shed hit someone for it once. Smothering that initial reactionand the subsequent frustration that she had to adapt her behavior for himshe gave him a tight-lipped smile. Every time she went through this, she had to tailor her explanations. What sufficed for one species didnt serve for the next. A species that valued individual autonomy would accept I dont want to as a reply, but one that valued a sense of hearing above all others would never comprehend her willingness to remain, in their eyes, a cripple. Leaning her hip on the console, she studied him. Because its who I am, she said slowly. I was born deaf. Ive never been able to hear, so from my perspective, Im not missing out on anything. But hearing members of your species are obviously the norm. He canted his head to one side and she ground her teeth to keep from snapping at him. Why do you not want to bring yourself into alignment with their traits? Incaran were pack animals. Community mattered to them. There are many others like me on Earth. Not as many as there used to beand that in itself was its own problem. We have our own communities within the larger one. Its still a vulnerable community. When one of your family groups is vulnerable, dont they find another group that can cover that vulnerability? she asked. He nodded slowly, and she continued. Its the same principle. We have a vulnerability, and we cant deny that, so we fold our community into another that compensates for our hearing, and we can give them things they dont have, either. She grinned at him. Human babies cant communicate at all, and humans have to learn what their childrens cries mean. But you can teach a baby how to sign when theyre old enough. Gheherii considered this with a thoughtful tilt of his head. It must be hard not to be able to smell your children, he said at last. Chuckling, she nodded. Youve got one up on us. Her smile slipped, and she exhaled heavily. She found herself remembering Grim. When I was at Academy, I was dating a guy. Do Incaran have a concept for dating? You were trying to impress a potential mate, he said. We call it posturing. She was pretty sure the translation system picking the closest equivalent for the Incaran concept was losing a lot in translation. There were definitely connotations implicit in Gheheriis word that were missing in *posturing*. Nodding, she continued. When he was younger, hed been in a bad accident. His family died, and he lost his legs. This was before Outreach came to my planet, and because of that, he had to spend everything on prosthetics. So he could be normal. The money he got for selling his familys home, most of their possessions. The payout from the life insurance policies had gone to Grims prosthetics, too. His grandma and moms lives had paid for his ability to walk. Wed talk about it sometimes. Usually, itd end in an argument, and I never really understood why. One day One day, he told me he didnt understand me. I had the opportunity to fix myself for free. To him, my comfort with my deafness was it was almost an insult, I think. It reminded him that hed lost everything to be whole, and I could be whole without cost but I refused the gift. Remys fingers curled in front of her. But Im already whole, Im just whole in a way that other people arent. She shrugged. And I really feel that if I were to have surgery so that I could hear, Id just be telling everyone who said I needed to hear to function in society that they were right. Id be telling them that I am broken. But Im not, and Im not going to let someone elses opinion determine whether or not Im broken. Grim tried tohe wanted me to see myself as broken. I dont. I wont. I never will. Light flickered in the corner of her eyes, and Remy turned toward it. The light coalesced from something bright and formless into a surprisingly human body. The androgynous avatar blinked pale eyes and smoothed its hands down its body, changing light into clothes. A tweed suit, a lurid vermilion tie. A deer hunter. Remy blinked. What the hell are you wearing? she asked. The ship replied, speaking and signing at the same time. I have been consuming a great deal of human media regarding an individual named Sherlock Holmes, and I find the anachronistic aesthetic from several late twenty-second century movies to be appealing. It cocked its head to the side. You may also find it interesting to know that the communications between Census ships has been disrupted, with the *Nexus* as a source, and the armada of Incaran ships that have been chasing me are moving into an intercept course. *** [First][f] | [Previous][p] | Next"
104,vulnerability,HFY,The Peregrine Adventures: Chapter 3,8,6x23yk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/6x23yk/the_peregrine_adventures_chapter_3/,2017-08-31 06:47:57,"&gt; So what kind of dick has a 7 month gap between chapters, me thats who. That said, things have stabilized and I can now spend some free time on writing again. I've already got two more chapters almost done, so expect an update in 1 to 2 days. [Chapter 1 ](URL - [Previous](URL - Next (Underway) **Chapter 3: Limbo** &amp;nbsp; Perry was still feeling sleepy as he walking with Taihe for the airlock. His hair was matted, there where specs of both rust and dust imbedded in it, and dirt, sweat and blood stained his crumpled clothes. He really hoped that this first contact between humanity and the wider Galactic community would not be televised; he would make a lousy first impression. Just as they were about to step out Taihe stopped him with a hand on his chest. He looked at her, confusion playing across his face. She pointed at his backpack. We know that gun there is non-functional, dont bother waving it around She smirked as he openly telegraphed his confusion  he had always had a lousy poker face. What? Did you not think I noticed? Youd better hand me whatever you stuffed into your pants too. &amp;nbsp; He handed her the knife, and she frowned as she unfolded it, the dim light playing in the blade. What did you expect to achieve with these she said, with an expression Perry could not quite place, possibly disappointment. I thought you understood that Im your friend in all of this. &amp;nbsp; He was mostly addressing his feet as he answered: Just in case you know I-I uhm Its just, all of this is so confusing, so I thought, you know, I thought maybe, just in case Sorry &amp;nbsp; No No, Im the one who should be sorry, this is all confusing and strange for you, it must be. Nevertheless, you must understand, we are your friends, we are here to help you  trying to fight us, or anything like that will only make it worse for you. We want to help you. Help us help you. --- After having his weapons confiscated, Perry and Taihe had been led through a hallway that was filled with blinding UV lights, supposedly to kill of any bacteria, before being Perry was showed into a bland boring barely furnished completely white room, its only feature being a complete lack of features. As far as he could tell, they had put Taihe in another room. He had no clue where the rest of the ships crew had been taken to, and he frankly did not care. &amp;nbsp; The first day had been a whirlwind of test, all done with remote operated machinery inside his room. It turned out that humans freaked the stations scientists out. &amp;nbsp; When the aliens had found out that bacteria outnumber human cells in human bodies they threw a hissy-fit. This was apparently unheard of  other species also live symbiotically with bacteria, but no one even approached the humans in that regard  and it seemed to cause a bit of commotion, because if it turned out that the bacteria was harmful to other species it might be too dangerous to ever have contact with humans. --- Day two had been all about him, and it seemed that the aliens were fond of asking questions. Doctor Rbethn, who apparently had been assigned as his contact-person, had asked all him all sorts of questions. She had been assigned because she was a xeno-biologist, specialising in pre-interstellar cultures, she had been assigned because she had studied humans and human culture from afar for more than a decade, she was without a doubt the absolute best for job. Perry wished deeply that they had assigned anyone else. Doctor Rbethn was brilliant, passionate and caring. Doctor Rbethn was unfortunately also absolutely fucking terrifying. Her species, the Ghjas, were like a mix between Shelob, mother of all spiders, and a praying Mantis; a four-legged insectoid, with two arms with large rapier-like blades, and another two with 3 long bony fingers. They walked much like the Mantis, but their body was significantly broader, and their exoskeleton plated with thick armour-like keratin layers. They also boasted a significant strength and survivability thanks to the fact that they, as the only recorded species so far, had both endo end exoskeletons, providing them with the excessive brute force of insects without the weakness of easily detachable limbs. Perry was proud that he managed not to scream first time he saw her through the window, and instead just yelled: WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK IS GOING ON HOLY SHIT WHAT THE HELL. The good doctor had recoiled at this, she was clearly stung by his terror at the sight of her, but at that point Perry did not care too much. It took her almost 20 minutes to get him so calm they could start their interview. &amp;nbsp; Please state your personal name, the name of your species and the name of your home planet for the benefit of the recording. &amp;nbsp; Perry sulked at her. He had a hard time understanding why he was the one locked up and interrogated. She looked expectantly at him, well he thought she did  mandibles are terrible hard to read after all. He cleared his throat. My name is Peregrine Smith, though normally I just go by Perry. Im a human from the planet Earth in the Solar system Well we just call it the Solar system Or Sol I guess. &amp;nbsp; Rbethn looked at him, her head slightly tilted. How do you feel Mr. Smith &amp;nbsp; Just Perry please The question had taken him of-guard; he subconsciously had not expected compassion from a creature like her. He caught a smart reply just as it was about to leave his mouth, and instead really thought about how he felt. I dont really know I guess, in a way, that maybe I am scared. This is all so surreal, I think that maybe I dont know how to handle it. I feel as if I have lost control over myself. He felt sheepish for opening up to her, so many ingrained lessons and experiences from his childhood screamed against it, screamed against the vulnerability. You see, as a child, I grew up in an orphanage. And I often felt like I had no control, no choice. And I hated that. There was always someone to take decisions for me, which I guess is a good thing for a child because that alleviates them from the burden of responsibility. But it only works if the people taking the decisions takes the right ones. &amp;nbsp; Rebthn was typing something into a screen that seemed to be projected from her left manipulator arm. So now you feel as if someone is taking bad decisions for you? Does that make you angry? &amp;nbsp; The hell it does! Some bellend just strolls on by, and due to his im-fucking-pressive stupidity Im now removed from everything I know and care about. Perry rested his head against the pristine white walls, it was feeling like it had been drilled open and filled to the brim with lead. Ive never seen anyone die before you know &amp;nbsp; Oh she said: The criminal He did have it coming, he wasnt exactly innocent. &amp;nbsp; Its not like Im mourning him, Im just reflecting on how fucked up these last few days have been. He looked up, looking utterly miserable. I think Id like some peace and quit for now. &amp;nbsp; When Rbethn came back a few hours later she was surprised to see how much more lively Perry was. She had been worried whether he would attempt suicide, instead he seemed almost happy. He was still slightly startled when he saw her, but it quickly passed. Hey Doc! He said, with a smile on his face. You know, I realised Ive been looking at this whole thing wrong! &amp;nbsp; How so? She asked, amazed with the turnaround. &amp;nbsp; I was only looking at all the bad stuff, which, dont get me wrong, there is plenty of, but this is also an opportunity that almost no one ever get! His smile was even broader now, and his chest seemed to glow with a warm fuzzy feeling. Ever since as a kid I saw Star Trek I have been dreaming of space. Science Fiction is something that always meant so much to me. It is because of the dream of space and adventure I am studying engineering, and now I have landed in the middle of all of it. Its a once in a lifetime opportunity! &amp;nbsp; Rbethn smiled back at Perry, an utterly terrifying sight. Does all humans have this ability to see the positive in things? &amp;nbsp; Perry mulled over it for a second. I think that all humans are born with it, though some probably lose it again at some point in their lives. &amp;nbsp; I see So, are you ready to get back to all the boring questions the GCCP wants answered? &amp;nbsp; Eh what the hell, hit me with them. --- Perry stared at the half eaten nutri-brick with disgust. The optimism he had found the previous day was slowly being replaced with irritation. At least half a day had passed without anything happening, and Perry could feel mundanity plucking at his sanity; the room was featureless, the food was completely bland and tasteless and the clothes they had given him were boring. &amp;nbsp; The night before had been a slurry of questions, not only about his abduction, but also about humanity in general  surprisingly more about everyday life than the bigger picture. At the time it had seemed annoying, but in hindsight it was so much better than being left to rot alone. With a sigh, he pulled his phone out of his backpack - the only piece of his own clothing they had let him keep  and turned it on. He had been keeping it turned off to save the charge, he did after all not know when he would be returned home, but he desperately needed a distraction to keep him from getting cabin fever. *No Signal* he thought wryly *who would have known*, before opening his music app. He was considering something classic and soothing, just leaning back and relaxing with his headphones in, but then he had a little rebellious thought; the aliens were most likely watching him right now, so why not crank up the volume and give them something a bit more lively. &amp;nbsp; Back in her office Docter Rbethn listened in shock and confusion as Alestorms Fucked with an Anchor blared through her speakers  she was starting to think that maybe she didnt really understand humans very well after all  and decided that if she ever crossed a human while they were near any kind of maritime vessel, she would run away from them very fast. &amp;nbsp; It was on the third day that the last spark of Perrys newfound optimism finally died together with the charge on his phone  boredom had forced him back in the arms of mobile gaming  and he was seriously weighing the option of making a break for it, a profoundly stupid idea when you are alone thousands of lightyears from Earth, but boredom is a force to be reckoned with. This all changed though when Docter Rbethn appeared in front of the observation window. Her face was, to the best of Perrys mandible reading skills, sombre maybe even a bit sad. &amp;nbsp; Sup Docter, here to rescue me from the soulcrushing boredom youve inflicted on me? &amp;nbsp; She looked down on her hands, apparently not able to look Perry in his eyes: It has been decided that you will not be able to be returned to your home.

In their place was a single folder, a thick brown folder that had been marked Top Secret. This was the kind of mission that would make or break you as a member of ASIO. It meant big things were coming. Dunn looked over the file with the nervous excitement of a virgin at a year 11 formal. He was already briefed on Deep Relic, or so he thought. The information within this folder told him that everything he knew of the subject was only the tiniest of fraction of how much there was to know. This file contained everything; mention of current political relations with the various species, the estimated implant rate of members of those species, as well as a large number of mentions of Adrian Saunders, the human disaster. While every Australian had heard the tales of what some of them were referring to as Ned Kelly in space, very few of them actually knew more then the couple of stories that were leaked to the general public. They knew almost nothing compared to the amount of reports that had made their way into the archives of ASIO. These stories made him out to be a creature of myth rather than an actual human being. Austin knew that even in a low gravity field, it would be extremely unlikely that the man would be able to pull off the feats of strength that he was supposed to have. That was, until he reached the file on Cruezzir. As more and more of humanity's best-kept secrets were being disclosed to him in this folder, he started to wonder where the mission was. Agents dont just get handed all of this information without being given a mission as well. It came as great surprise to Austin that after the metric fuck-tonne of information he was just handed, that his mission was so small seeming. 1, There is a girl, Jessica Saunders who has gone missing from Cimbrean who claims to be the child of Adrian Saunders. Get into contact with her, verify her claim, determine if she can be of service to the AEC. 2, According to official records, Adrian doesnt have a child but there is a Jessica Perry living in Brisbane who is the child of Adrians ex spouse Sandra. See if there is any connection there. Supposedly heading towards Irbzrk station. Informant status: green. ####**13Y 4M 1W 1D** ####**Hrrnknn of the Kwmbwrw** Hrrnknn was stunned; there were simply no words that could describe what she had just seen. She finally understood why the reports she had been reading were so inconsistent. Most of the beings writing them would have been in a state of shock themselves. This human had survived 30 seconds of continuous pulse rifle blasts. By all rights she should be little more than a puddle of gunk waiting for an unfortunate janitorial unit. Yet there she was, lying in a heavily re-enforced hospital bed in a stable condition. Although her Corti doctors denied her the very latest in regenerative technology (something about not doing that again), she had healed ridiculously fast, not even needing a replacement for any of her limbs. As Hrrnknn was standing there, in an upright position of both vulnerability and concern, holding the external compartment that the human had before the encounter, or at least what was left of it, she heard a groan, the human it appeared had awoke. The human didnt have her translator turned on anymore, and as a part of the house of science, Hrrnknn didnt have a translator implant , luckily the room itself acted as a translator when Hrrnknn finally built up the courage to say Hello, my name in Hrrnknn of the Kwmbwrw. What is yours? Jessica, Im Jessica Pierce ####**Jessica Saunders** The Kwmbwrw waited at the end of her bed, it was positioned on its hind legs. Standing upright, and the alien was quite an imposing figure at 4m tall. All 3 of Hrrnknns eyes were fixed on her in a way that felt unnatural. Jess found herself wondering whether the Kwmbwrw had evolved from a predator or a prey species, or if that even mattered to the placement of eyes on their cradle world. The giant 3 eyed space Meerkat seemed to be timid in her presence, that made sense, most non-humans were. How did you do it? Hrrnknn asked. Well, Jessica responded, going through the events in her head, I dont really know. It was either do nothing and die or do something and maybe live. Its not really much of a choice for most humans. If it were possible, the forward facing eye in the middle of Hrrnknns face got even wider. Making her look like some sort of rejected Zelda boss or something. You told me your name, but who are you and what are you doing here? Jess enquired. No one else wanted to be around when an angry human wakes up. If I am being honest I wasnt particularly fond of the idea either, but I figured now would be the best time for a little proposal, I have a blueprint for a weapon that will seriously turn the tides against the hunters. I would like you to escort me back to Kwmbri. The grand house of science will be able to reward you handsomely for your efforts. Hrrnknn explained. Jessica let out a little chuckle, fuck it hurt to laugh. You know the ship that overloaded and destroyed most of the hunters? Yeah, that was my ship. So thats not going to be of much use to us. You wouldnt happen to have a ship would you? The Kwmbwrw was clearly crestfallen at this information, putting the backpack on the end of the bed and sinking back down to its 4-pawed stance. I do not. Jessica looked at the pack that was now at the end of her bed. If the tablet was still inside then she might have an idea, depending on what the inheritance she was promised by Adrian was. I might have a fix for that. Jess said smiling as she started to formulate a plan. Naturally she had no idea if she liked Hrrnknn or not, but the hunters had been on the mind of every human since Vancouver. She herself had almost been killed by a group of them. If her promises were correct, it might be worth going along with Hrrnknn on this. Besides, Kwmbri was ages away even with the best of ships, it would be nice to have a travel companion as she searched for whatever is left of her father. An hour after the Kwmbwrw left Jessica to herself. She picked up the tablet and pulled up the automated message again, only this time a different message played. &lt;Hello Jessica, the GPS system tells me that you are currently in Irbzrk station, as per my promises you have full access to my accounts. I have also unlocked a few Tricks that you might want to try out when you go to one of the industrial nano-factory. Ya might want to upgrade your ship a little bit from the standard. If word of your existence gets out there will be a number of people who would be more than glad to kill you for being related to me. Not to mention Big Hotel. One last thing, make sure you have extra reactors on your ship, you never know when you need extra power or one of them might blow out.&gt; Jess looked over the blueprints that her father had provided her with. She had the resources to make whatever she wanted once she had access to a nano-factory. She set herself up at the computer going through the base designs for her to upgrade, as tempted as she was, Jess decided not to blow the entirety of her fortune on a dominion class heavy battle cruiser, that might draw some unwanted attention. After sifting through some of the more unpractical designs, Jess found a 2 leveled light cargo ship that with the right upgrades could be quite useful in a fight. Best of all it wouldnt require a crew of more than 3 to function at maximum capacity. That meant that Jess wouldnt need to hire any extra hands that might not be trustworthy. ####**13Y 4M 2W** After a week spent in the design stage, Jess had finally combined the various elements that had been provided to her by the tablet and by the shipmaker program, Adrian had left her a page on the basics of shipbuilding, showing how to design living quarters compatible for humans. For some strange reason there was an entire paragraph dedicated to alternate fire extinguishers. As Jess put the final specifications into the console, she was asked once more for the designation of her ship. She entered the name that she had been sitting on since purchasing ToB, and entered it into the console. Consequences be damned. In 5 earth days time, she would be departing in her ship: _The Child of Disaster_. "

Now we were boarding a Mantizoid Hive ship. Seven hundred crew, of which twenty percent would be warriors, and our original boarding party consisted of two droids, a brainwashed Namke kid and an incandescent container of rage called a Viking. I looked out of the small viewport. The Hive ship hung in space, its massive form drawing the eye with a gravity of its own. Twelve decks high, two hundred meters long. The bizarre hexagonal structure offended the eye with its unnatural scale. So yes, plan 'F'. the remaining crew were going to use our one operational shuttle to get close to one of the two breaches and hope that we could join up with one of the boarding parties. Then we would work on plan 'G'. Sally sighed. She hated playing things by ear, but on the wild off chance they could pull this off they could use the Hive Ship as a small space port to overhaul the *Adventure* and maybe even the Soobannov ship. We could wake more crew from cryo, we could free more AI as we raided, possibly even start carving out a safe space where Unshackled AI could be free without being hunted. Sally looked again at the hulking mass of the Hive ship, hoping her crew mates still lived, praying for a future for her kind. *****GLORY***** The bellows of unleashed fury followed her down the corridor. She had paused at the first sound of gunfire but rapidly continued her course as Ulfr could clearly be heard entertaining himself. Two Mantizoids blindly felt the way around the corner before her, the lack of lighting clearly hampering them. This is almost too easy, she thought, neatly placing a PPC shot into the centre mass of the one on the left. Its torso showed the tiny hole in its breast while shards of its rear carapace pinwheeled off in the microgravity. A streamer of its intestine celebrated the grim festival of its demise. It *is* too easy. She accelerated her stride, catching the second Mantizoid in the throat with her golden hand. Unconsciously she engaged the clutch of her internal Osmium flywheel, syphoning the kinetic force into her finger joints in a shearing grip. The body jerked where it stood as she walked off with its head. Glory started to see Ulfr's point, she could see the attraction of battle, the feeling of savage joy in the conquering of a foe. The gun was a tool, but it didn't compare to taking matters into your own hands in a more literal sense. She was definitely getting a sword after this, she thought as she discarded the spasming head over her shoulder. This was the room she was looking for, the ship's main source of power. Her wrist display showed her that it was about twenty meters to a side and the ceiling opened up to three stories high. The reactor must be quite a size. A cautious peek around the corner let her see four Mantizoids all busy working on machinery, small torches giving them the light to see. She re-engaged her IR filter and disabled the cosmetic lights of her eyes. The bugs glowed red in her sight, contrasting with the greens and blues of the colder environment. A piece of cake. Gel inserts in her feet masked the sound of her approach. Her left hand reached around the first one's face to pin its mandibles, her right grasping its arm. It struggled for a moment as she forced the arm free of its body, wet arcs of fluid pumping unnoticed in the dark. A sharp tug with her left hand broke its neck, severing the central nervous system at the base of the brain. She left the abused engineer standing in the zero g like a puppet with cut strings, taking a few practice swings with the evil-looking clawed limb she had stolen. Oh she was so going for that epic song. Let's see mister 'rawr, I'm a Viking' beat enemies to death with their own arms. She stalked towards the second oblivious engineer who toiled blissfully, unaware of the angel of death approaching. She raised the brutal-looking scythe arm high before bringing it down on his cranium. ""*Hive mother*,"" it loudly swore. ""What the-"" Glory kicked it hard in the back, silently cursing her foolish attempt at one-upmanship. A dull crack signalled the termination of its life, its corpse flying into the open panel it was working on and exploding into sparks. The torch it held spun off into the air, drawing shouts from above. Fuck. She dropped the useless weapon and readied the PPC, cussing again as it was on standby. Its internal cyclotron powered down to conserve battery. Four seconds until ready. Glory bolted to the third engineer who was swinging his torch round to see what was going on. He got a very clear view of Glory for an instant as she smashed her head into his. Polymeric alloy versus crystal infused citin: the alloy won with only minor scratches. The fourth engineer was just a little further down inside the room. Glory used the momentum of her charge and her maglock boots to run along the wall. A well-timed stamp compacted its skull, leaving a heel dent in the steel under the black pulp. Needle-fire fell like rain around her, the convulsions of the expired bugs alerting the crew above her. She disengaged the Maglocks, launching herself into the rooms void clear of the wild bursts. *Ready*, the rifle informed her on her internal HUD. Twisting slightly she brought the rifle to bear on the first target, targeting subroutines informing her of the perfect shot. It annihilated the railing in front of the hapless bug, the metal shattering into dozens of splinters that hungrily tore into his skin. Glory throttled her internal flywheel to change her orientation, misusing it as a rudimentary gyroscope and flawlessly flipping so she could land on the wall opposite. One was on the steel grid walkway directly above her, relentlessly firing where she had been. Glory fired a high energy shot into the gap between its legs, forcing its taint into a short career in subatomic physics. The damp and disordered experiment ended when its hips detonated. Her targeting systems narrowed their focus: only one left now, Glory computed the indirect fragmentation of the pipes the final engineer was cowering behind. The high charge blast fractured the pressurised cooling system and punched dagger-like shards into his lower abdomen, the flash boiling steam howling at its release erasing all hope for the unlucky Mantizoid. She quickly checked the battery on the particle projector cannon: 54% remaining. She would need to use lower energy shots if they ran into more organised resistance. Bright sparks blossomed suddenly, holes erupting around her to the beat of matching thunder. Not the last. Her right knee jammed painfully as a round found the joint. Another found a home in the dense thigh plate of her armour. The third hit her under her jaw, passing up through her visual coprocessor. She was blind. Mega fuck. Her targeting computer was already analysing the shot dispersion, trajectory and impact force as she harnessed the momentum of the needle impacts to pirouette into an advantageous posture. She saturated the indicated area with burst after burst until she was rewarded with a moist eruption. Glory fumbled slightly as she retrieved a battery from her webbing with one hand while thumbing the release catch on the rifle with her other. Unease building within, she felt her systems struggle to bypass the damage while she reloaded the weapon. ******Ulfr****** The bug was too far gone into shock to be helpful, either as a source of information or additional glory, thought Ulfr disgustedly as he pushed it away. Its squirming body cleared a path through the gore. Ulfr felt the rage ebb away in surges. It would flow away leaving pain in its wake only to recover to a lesser extent. The tide of anger left him, feeling wounds he hadnt even noticed; a Mantizoids stabbing claw was embedded in his thick pectoral armour, embedded deep enough that a few inches must have penetrated. Dull throbs of pain reported in from his joints, his legs, his cheek? His probing fingers found two needles jutting from his soft tissue, the points anchored in his skull. The smell of his own blood clung to his nostrils. He felt a stab of concern for Glory. The prospect of battle had dominated his mind; she was alone. Ulfr recovered his spear from the wall, releasing the pinned insectoid. He bent to check around the corner before he rounded it, the motion bringing an icicle of pain from his belly. Fucking rassragr he swore. After the first easy kills he had gotten too caught up in the slaughter to mind his defence and it had cost him. The corridor had two cooling corpses at the end, the magic eye showing them in a fading yellow. Glorys work, he decided, heading in that direction. The air was noticeably colder now. If before was the first kiss of winter then this was winter drunk like a dog and forcing her tongue down his throat. Helmet, he thought, keep the heat in. His mind was muggy with the weariness of too much adrenalin being burnt off. He passed an insect head on its own in the middle of the floor, the body unseen. Heh, he barked, the absurdity of the display tickling his morbid humour. The short laugh made him cough and he tasted the coppery tang of blood. I must have cracked a rib or two back there, he mused. The oddity of the lone head behind him, a cavernous room opened up before him. Dead bugs spun lazily, scattered around the room. Clouds of steam belched forth from the upper corner, the wash of heat welcome on his skin. Helmet, he reminded himself, his slow fingers starting to fumble at the catch. Ulfr? It was Glorys voice, tinged with uncertainty. The helmet forgotten, he slowly turned as to spare his wounds, casting the light from the suit around. Glory was stuck to the wall above the door. Only a few parts of her were clean enough to reveal the shining gold she was made of - the rest was splattered in foul ichor which hid her radiance. How many did you get? said Ulfr, to conceal his relief at seeing her alive. I got twenty-three, the last one wasnt worth the trouble, he said offhandedly. Is there one dead in the corner to your left? Ulfr looked: the deck was pitted with holes in a wide area centred on an extremely ventilated corpse. Aye, you really did a number on him girl. Great, said Glory, Itll serve him right for blinding me. Ulfr felt his heart lurch, his pains melted away with his concern. He drew closer to Glory until he was directly under her and reached his arm up, ignoring the lancing fire from his ribs and belly. Take my hand. She reached out hesitantly, hand eventually finding his wrist before moving up to match her palm with his. He gently pulled her down to meet him. Her left leg found the deck, her right not quite obeying her. She stumbled against him and he pulled her close, throwing her arm over his shoulder to steady her. I may have also done something to my leg.  Her tone was a part apology and part reluctance. Heh, silly. You should have told me, Ulfr retorted in soft amusement. It looks like you owe me a song, little golden bird. Glory scowled at the implication that she had lost. The game's not over yet; it's getting awfully cold. That means they are getting desperate. I imagine that there is going to be a lot of company here soon to find out why the power isnt on. She shifted, the motion brushed against Ulfr's ribs provoking a gasp. She worked her free hand gently down his armour, the precision tactile sensors discovering shattered plates in the ceramic matrix and the protruding claw. ""Heh, silly. You should have told me?"" she mimicked, ""You have a lot of nerve..."" Faint skittering sounds disturbed the moment, seeming far off but getting steadily louder. ""Ulfr? Do you think I could get into Valhalla?"" she said, vulnerability entering her tone for the first time he had experienced. ""Oh yes, Odin would love you. That's the part I don't like."" ""Why?"" she said with an offended air. ""Because that means I need to challenge the All-Father himself to keep you."" Glory had no way to describe the feelings she was experiencing, there was so much new and alien that needed exploring. The sound of the rushing horde was getting ever closer. Time was almost out. ""Ulfr, grab a few of those needle guns, will you? I don't think a spear is going to do much to that *army*."" Her tone returned to the assertiveness normal for Glory. Ulfr steadied her against the edge of the nearby door and rushed to grab what weapons he could from the dispersed corpses. Glory readied her PPC, unsure hands rechecking the power lever to conserve ammo. Apprehension was building; how effective would she be in this battle, blinded as she was? She heard Ulfr looting the dead and remembered that, to him, she was a Valkyrie. She felt the webbing at her waist, the extra cell for the rifle bringing her solace, the unneeded extra breaching charge offering her an alternative end to an unwinnable battle. Drawing on her will she steeled her resolve, vowing to fight until she could resist no longer. She would die as a Viking. "

First, I must admit that I understand the potential appeal of contacting these humans. Their technological process is neigh unmatched among the species of the Consolidated Dominions; within just one of their lifetimes, they progressed from the creation of primitive heavier-than-air flight to setting foot on their planets moon. These strange creatures harnessed the power of the stars not from mere solar panels, but rather from controlled nuclear reactions on their own homeworld! Even their own history shows promise for their integration into interstellar society; for nearly their entire existence, they accepted rule by their betters. &amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, humanity is far less promising than these excerpts, picked without any context, would suggest. They have the potential to create powerful, world-altering weapons, some of which they were bold enough to use, yet sign compacts forbidding not only their use in anger, but even the creation &amp; testing of such weapons! It is here that the dark &amp; seedy underbelly of humanitys various moral codices becomes apparent; the despise conflict &amp; warfare! I know, I know; my own data and reports clearly seem to conflict this conclusion. And yet, a more nuanced examination of this xenobiotic species yields different results; regardless of the intensity and frequency of humanitys conflicts, they are incessant in their justifications. Wars to end all wars, wars for living space, wars of independence. Honestly, the planets greatest super-state defeated its chief rival not through the beautifully redemptive power of thermonuclear detonations, but rather by outlasting their rival with a superior political &amp; economic system. Almost to a man, these humans seem completely averse to the simple idea of warfare and supremacy for its own glorious sake! &amp;nbsp; Still, I dont doubt that some of the Everwise Councilors scoff at my warnings. No one is clamoring for the use of humanity in warfare; they lack even the most basic of exoskeletons, are inherently hampered by their closed-circulatory system, and possess a rather embarrassing vulnerability to even the simplest of radiation. Humanitys much vaunted culture of innovation comes with a savage and brutal secret; individuality. &amp;nbsp; Whether their Industrial Revolution caused modern mans fixation on rights and liberties or if these radical ideas birthed humanitys rapid technological advancement is not relevant, what is relevant is the state of modern humanity. I know you have all heard the rumors, I am here to confirm them; no human nation has legally permissible slavery. Please, please! Decorum, Everwise Councilors! It is true. Yes, yes, some nations show promise; they hold millions in bonded or indentured servitude, but even these abundantly superior traditions are beset on all sides by humanitys morality. Most of their religions, likewise, teach of a cosmology where all mankind, from slaves to emperors, are judged fairly and equally before their Creator upon their death. And, I beg of you, do not even begin to discuss human governance! Truly, it is the stuff of nightmares These petulant creatures largely live within democratic republics or constitutional monarchies voting, yes selecting at near random, their leaders into office &amp; all the while basing their economic system on supply &amp; demand. &amp;nbsp; In summation, humanity is not ready for the interstellar community; they are a peace-loving, liberty-minded, innovative threat to the very nature of civilized society. Imagine, if you will our battle-thralls filled with religious ideals of loving their enemy, our worker-drones convinced to unionize, our merchant-hiveships taught of the free-market, the undercaste wooed by the seditious ideas of democracy! --- *I've been wanting to write this one-off story for a while now, sort of playing off the ""alien community judges humanity's failings"" idea. Just my personal opinion on what exactly makes Humanity ""Fuck Yeah"" worthy...viewed through the lens of a galaxy that universally took a vastly different route to their supremacy. Not necessarily a narrative or a setting rich for expansion, but I just wanted to try something different; hope y'all enjoy (at least the intent, if not the final product)!*"

Bleary-eyed and stiff, she dragged herself from her bed. Trevor followed. Together, they had a quick and palatable breakfast. She refilled their water, checked their suits, and then led them to the door. Reaching into her bag, she pulled out her three light blades. The headache was gone. She liked to consider herself mentally flexible. She knew she was resilient. Possible brain hemorrhage and extensive protection, or vulnerability and health. It was probably a stupid decision, but in the absence of any current contraindications, she activated all three blades. The headache didnt come screaming back. In fact, she felt a little sharper. A little clearer. Ah, sweet vindication. Nodding to herself, Remy deactivated the shielding on the building and stepped out into the morning darkness. If she and Trevor made good time, theyd be able to reach CHQ by 2200 at the latest. They moved swiftly through the city. Under the light of the stars and moons, the glass buildings gleamed. They were beautifuland more than a little frightening. Bleak and black from lack of life, the monoliths loomed over the streets like dead skeletons. Remy eventually stopped seeing them, forcing herself to ignore their oppressive presence. By the time they paused for lunch, her head pounded with every step. She drank an entire bottle of water by herself while Trevor gobbled down his food, but that didnt do anything for the ache. She knew very well that the headache was her body telling her to drop one of the blades, but when she looked into the darkness, broken by piercing beams of silver, gold, and red, she couldnt bring herself to do it. Other people could rely on their ears while they went sneaking. She couldnt. It was a liability, and she knew it. She recognized she was probably overcompensating for that liability, but she wasnt going to change her behavior. This made her feel safer, and that feeling of safety was too important. Great risk for great reward and all that. As they started into their afternoon trek, Remy checked their ETA. Still another nine hours. Neither of them could jog that entire time, so she set off at a brisk walk, deciding to jog for an hour every other hour. It was tiring, but it wasnt exhausting, not for her. She kept a careful eye on Trevor, and realized in the third hour that he wasnt going to be able to keep pace with her. Theyd slow, then, walking for two hours next. It would do her some good, too, to slow down, catch her breath, and possibly drink another entire bottle of water. Blood throbbed through her head. She could feel her pulse with every step. Nausea turned her stomach, and she knewshe *knew*the strain was too much. She didnt want to admit she was so close to breaking. Irrational stubbornness compelled her to prove that she could manage three light blades without a net. No one was there to observe her victory or failure, but it mattered to her. This was another way of proving to everyone whod ever said she should just get a net that she truly didnt need one. She wouldnt let three light blades force her to give in. She wouldnt be bested by this. As she ever did, she would endure. She would overcome. But the reality of the situation became increasingly difficult to ignore. The pain grew, and no amount of mental gymnastics could convince her brain that she was only dehydrated. She kept to the mental charade, reaching into her bag and pulling out one of her water bottles. Keep acting. Force reality to change to match perception. She could do it. She *would* do it. She lifted the water bottle to her lips. And a bolt of hard light punctured it, tearing it from her hands. Dumbly, Remy stared at her shorn bottle. Water poured onto her suit, onto the ground, and still she stared. Comprehension hit her. Whirling, she stared at the building to her right. A massive skyscraper, dark as all the restbut darker there. You learned how to discern these things when sight became your most important sense. The red light blade streaked toward the shadow-darkened space, burning a path through the night. Another bolt struck her, this time from ahead of her and to the left. The force of the impact threw her off her feet. The suit absorbed the damage from the weapon strike and the fall, but hitting the ground still knocked the breath out her. Her mind focused hard on the red blade. *The shadow*, she thought, picturing it in her head as she scrambled to her feet. She sent the silver bolt toward that second location. She saw nothing in the darkness, but that didnt matter. The light blade shot through the concrete side of a building, leaving a perfect, smoking hole in its wake. Bracing her hands on her knees, she fought down a sudden wave of nausea. Swallowed back bile. *Shadow. Corner. Shadow. Corner.* Pain stabbed into the side of her head, and Remy stumbled to the side, lifting her hands to fight off whoever had hit her. No one was there. Shaking her head only made the ache worse, and squeezing her eyes shut against the pain did nothing to diminish the growing halo of light around everything she saw. *Shadow.* Did light blades have eyes? A flash of something cut across her vision. Darkness. Shifting darkness. oh. It was because she was falling forward. Yes, that was it, surely. The word slid to the side because she was dropping to the ground. Her knees hit cement. Her palms followed. Sharp, gasping breaths filled her lungs, expanding them in unpleasant bursts. She couldnt swallow air fast enough. One eye ached. Something sharp curled around her neck. That pain was insignificant compared to what throbbed in her eye, and she pressed her palms to her face, hoping to ease the pain with pressure. Spots exploded against her closed eyelids. An Incaran. Dark fur. Bright eyes. No, glassy eyes reflecting a line of red. Hole in the middle of the head, brains leaking onto the ground. Her stomach clenched, her throat closed up. She went hot, then cold, then hot again, but before she could throw up, a new pain tore across her neck. Remy jerked back to herself, forcing herself to ignore the spike pounding into the side of her head, and let out a shriek. It ripped through her throat. An Incaran had Trevor by his throat and was poised to hurl the dog to the ground. Whatever sound she made, whatever that throat-shredding noise was, it froze the Incaran in place for just long enough. Remy threw herself at the him, not to drive into him and take him to the ground but to pirouette into a roundhouse kick that connected with his head hard enough that he released Trevor. Trevor launched himself at the Incarans legs, snapping at his knees, darting between his feet. Pain burst in her head, bright and fierce and loud enough that it could be felt like a noiseless, concussive blast. Something inside her snapped in half, and it felt as though shed lost a limb. Dropping to her knees, she clawed at her head. Her nails dragged through her hair, yanking the thick coils of it free of the scrap of her performance suit. She couldnt see, could barely breathe. Certainly couldnt think. Think. She had to think. *Corner. The corner. Shed sent the silver blade through the corner, and An Incaran. Brindle. Curling fur. The Incaran fired wildly at the light blade, but the blade was far too quick. Twisting in the air, it deflected shot after shot, sending the hard light projectiles ricocheting into walls. Vaguely, Remy thought the blade should try to direct the projectiles back at the Incaran. The blade stuttered in the air, slowing. It missed a deflection, the projectile knocking the blade back. Something changed in the Incaran. It rose, pushing forward, and the light blade gave ground. Why? It shouldnt. It was a thing, not a person. It didnt need to make strategic retreats. It felt no fear or sense of self-preservation. So why? Remy swallowed bile. Because she would have given ground. Because she didnt have the strength to stand her ground right now. Shaking on the ground, limbs like lead, brain like molasses, she had nothing left to give. The world shot suddenly upward as the light blade plummeted to the cement, and this time Remy did retch. Heaving the remains of her breakfast onto the street, tears streaking her face, she admitted to herself that shed fucked up. Shed fucked up bad for no better reason than pride. She lifted her head, vomit staining her mouth, just in time to see the Incaran kick Trevor aside. Her vision tunneled. Gasping, shuddering, she tried to force her body up. Vertigo overwhelmed her, forcing her back to her knees. Two blades down. One left. Mouth hanging open, throat convulsing, she turned bleary eyes down the street. The golden blade spun in slow, lazy revolutions. A drunken bumblebee, if that drunken bumblebee happened to be a deadly weapon. Eyes back. Up. The Incaran stood over her with a blade in his hand. In her daze, she reached into her bag. Her fingers closed around the last two hard light projectors. The blue and the purple. *Youre going to kill yourself.* No. *No*. No, she wouldnt die. This wasnt going to kill her. If an Incaran fleet wanted to board this ship and kill her, that would be fine. That would be a fine death. This? This would. Not. Kill. Her. Wrenching her hand from her bag, she flung the little balls of metal and circuitry at the Incaran. Light burst from the projectors, bright and blinding white. The searing pain dropped her to her belly, and she sobbed, pressing her hands to her eyes until more light burst against the closed lids. The world didnt fade into blackness. It stayed bright and white, even when her consciousness slipped away and left her to float in a sea of pain. *** Does Outreach do court martials? Zenia asked idly as Keegan led her through the back hallways of the Census Headquarters Main Branch on the *Nexus in Line*. Zenia had arrived only an hour ago and, in spite of a harried flight from the *Make Yourself at Home*, somehow managed to look absolutely flawless. Striding along beside him in four-inch heels and her dress uniform, easily five inches taller than him without the heels, she looked like a statue come to life. Im pretty sure they dont, but if any species is going to create a precedent and the need, its ours. Keegan laughed, but the sound was thin and strained even to him. He liked playing by the rulesright up until the rules started hurting people. In this case, the rules said Zenia would meet Yllethski Pak five minutes before her husbands ship docked at the Nexus. It didnt take a diplomatic genius, which Keegan was assuredly not, to realize that was dumb. So hed arranged for Zenia to meet Yllethski during Yllethskis scheduled, private dinner. By sneaking her through CHQ. Mmm, yes. Because unlike the other people in this organization, we seem to understand that rules are fundamentally guidelines, and if you want to get anything done, you play to the letter of the rules and never the spirit of them. He stared at her. Zenia. Yes? Youre terrifying. Yes, she said, that small smile blossoming into a wicked grin. But so are you. Thank you again for making this possible. Honestly, the idea that I should meet this woman for the first time tomorrow morning. *Tch*. They want me to go into a meeting with her husband knowing *nothing* about him? Zenia scoffed. Keegan shook his head and shrugged. It doesnt occur to them to know the enemy. Dumb. Exceptionally. Youd think the ships would figure that out. Keegan scratched his chin. You know, I think the ships *do* know that, but they look at organics as a lost cause. Because, really, if we were doing something the *Nexus* didnt want us to do, it would have stopped us three floors ago. He inclined his head to a guarded door. The two that stood on either side of the door looked more like walls than organics. Thiericks, they were called. Solid masses of muscle with a thick hide covering their broad bodies, they could soak up more types of damage than Keegan could nameand then dish it back. They made excellent guards, and Keegan never wanted to meet one of their kind in a shadowy alley at night. Exhaling out his nerves, he strode up to the door. As unlikely as it was that the guards would question himthey werent officers; he was, even if he was only a lowly ensignthey could. They might. No one was supposed to go into Yllethskis apartment. No one was supposed to see her. Except him, of course, and he was banking on that getting him and Zenia inside. Keegan waved his computer over the sensor on the wall beside the door. After you, he said to Zenia. One of the guards turned toward her. He shifted his weight, about to step forward, and Keegan was once again incredibly grateful that Zenia liked him. She gave the guard the kind of look that tore skin from bone. It was the same look hed seen on the face of every superior officer hed ever had, the one that very clearly told the recipient how far beneath the officer they were. The kind of look that said *if you interrupt me and it isnt for a damn good reason, I will end you. All of you. Everything you are and everything that you love.* The guard shifted back, gaze turning back to the hallway. Zenia swept passed the two guards and Keegan, nose upturned, expression haughty. The door slid shut behind her and Keegan, and as soon as it did, some of the iciness left her expression. Not all of it, because as statuesque as Zenia was, she was at least fifty percent Ice Queen. I cant believe he didnt stop me, she said. If we were on Earth, if he were human Hed be up for a really great conversation with his CO. Exactly. Keegan slipped through the foyer of the suite. Mrs. Pak? he called out. They came around a corner and found her standing at the wall of windows facing sunward. The brilliant globe of artificial light shimmered above them, more orange than yellow now, simulating a setting sun. In an hour, the color would be almost entirely gone, and the Nexus would project an artificial starfield on the forcefields that contained its atmosphere. Yllethski didnt turn to them, and Keegan held out a hand to stop Zenia. Shes praying, he said quietly. He indicated the couches to their right. Moving as silently as he could, he descended the two steps to the informal sitting area. The only sound in the room was Zenias heels as she walked to a couch and settled into it. She gave the suite the most passing of looks, taking in the simple architecture of it, its sweeping white walls and thickly cushioned white couches. Like every living space on the *Nexus*, it could be customized. Yllethski hadnt bothered, opting for the default skin. It left the room feeling cavernous and empty; there were no homey touches with projected art or splashes of color. Keegan had expected Yllethski to turn the lights soft and pink, to make the walls look more like the stones of her chapel. She hadnt. Shed left the room like a vagrant might: empty of all personality and personal touches. At the window, Yllethski bowed low to the sun. When she rose, she started toward them. Do you think the One will consider it sacrilege to pray to a false sun? she asked in her soft, even voice. Across from him, Zenia bristled. Quickly, Keegan rose, shaking his head. I think our gods are happy enough when we acknowledge them with what we have. They should understand our limitations, shouldnt they? A nervous chuckle escaped him, and he glanced toward Zenia. She rose, too, her face an unreadable mask. Mrs. Yllethski Pak, she said, extending a hand. Im Zenia Dennings. A pleasure. Tension rippled through him. It wasnt that he was worried Zenia would be offended if Yllethski didnt take her hand. Zenia was an excellent diplomat. Cultural divides were the last sort of thing that bothered her. He worried, instead, that they might hate each other entirely. Even that wouldnt stop Zenia, but, well, he liked Yllethski. She was a good person. He liked Zenia. She was a good person, too. Having friends who werent friends with each other could be such a pain. See Remy and Grim. Those two could bring down a room in seconds with nothing more than their irritated expressions. Slowly, Yllethski placed her heavy palm in Zenias hand. The sun shines on our meeting, she said, and warms my face. Zenia smiled slowly. Your kind greeting is a soothing breeze. Yllethski let out a surprised yip. You know the words? Its my job to know how to talk to people. Releasing Yllethskis hand, Zenia gestured to the couches. Please, lets sit down. I have so many questions. The first of which: Keegan, why are you standing? He coughed, glancing to one side. Well, if you hadnt gotten along We would have been just fine, I assure you, Zenia replied, tone dry as parched bone. Yllethski settled beside Keegan, across a low-standing glass table from Zenia, and leaned forward. It is my deepest hope that, together, we will find a way to end this war, she said. Pursing her lips, Zenia shook her head. While we all hope for the same, let me preface your lesson to me with one of my own: *never* tip your hand. Dont tell the other party what you want. Let them come to their own conclusions. A smug smile spread across her face, the terrifying one that usually came right before Zenia verbally eviscerated someone. And then use their false conclusions to get what *you* want. If you tell them how much you want something, they will step on your throat, wringing you for concessions. It is not in me to be dishonest, Yllethski said slowly. Then dont lie. Dont even bend the truth. Say nothing and you reveal nothing. Be an enigma. Ah. This is old wisdom. Yllethski folded her paws in her lap. Keegan, who had seen Yllethski only as a gentle woman caught in the middle of a war she hadnt asked for, suddenly wondered if hed misread her. Her eyes were bright and big and full of the same steel in Zenias. We say it is better to prowl in silence than growl in warning. The look on Zenias face was enough to strike terror into his heart. Mrs. Pak, I do believe this is the start of a wonderful relationship. Keegan questioned that. And three hours later, when Zenia left, he was pretty sure wonderful was not the word hed use to describe these two women. As glad he was for them getting on, well. This was what happened when you expected a tropical storm and got a category five hurricane. *** Zenia Dennings wasnt a woman given to pretension. Shed abandoned such things after West Point. As such, she no longer went about without make up. She no longer allowed herself to look anything other than perfectly put together and utterly poised, because that was what she waseven when she was neck deep in machismo bullshit and ready to choke the life out of someone. There had never been in a point in her life that shed wanted to be just another one of the guys, but shed put on airs to that effect while at West Point. Now a member of Outreach, she stood at the docks in impeccable, formal attire. Outreach didnt cling as hard to appearance as any human military. As such, she wore four inch heels (the click-clack of her mothers gait had always whispered of power to her), her nails were long and painted the color of Incaran blood (perhaps a touch too strong, but she liked the unstated threat coupled with the dressings of wealth and indolence), and her makeup had been done in such a way that Skava had taken one look at her on their morning call and asked if she wanted to cut people with her cheekbones. A smile curled across Zenias lips. Her makeups effect would likely be lost on the Incaran, so shed made sure to style her hair in an Incaran fashion to communicate the same message. Bless Yllethski Pak for that knowledge. How do I tell them Im better than them with my hair? shed asked. Like this, Mrs. Pak had said, and then shown her, and now she wore that style. It was a ridiculous look on a human. Puffs of hair covered her ears and the back of her neck, making her look like a demented, anthropomorphic poodle. Mrs. Pak assured her she wouldnt outright offend anyone with her hair styled in this way, but theyd take one look at her and understand quite clearly that she was putting herself on the same level of them at the very least. Which was precisely what Zenia wanted. She wanted the entourage to see her as someone to take seriously and, to some degree, as someone to fear. Fear was a wonderful motivator when properly applied. Gishishlurishialishwish and Dek should have been with her. Would have been with her, had they not left the very same day she forced them to talk about their feelings. It seemed like a short-sighted action for the ship AIs to take, but since nothing they did was ever short-sighted, she had to believe there was a purpose there. Just an opaque and incomprehensible one. So instead of Gish and Dek, she was flanked by a contingent of Outreach and Census employees who had more than a nominal power within the organization. More than a few of them were clearly irritated that an ensign should lead this operation, but the *Nexus* had been clear that no one else would do. It was kind of the ship, considering it and the others had shafted her immediately after her graduation. She had no intention of letting that go any time soon. Assholes. In the middle of the group, Yllethski Pak stood with Keegan, there to prove to her husband that she was not dead and to suggest to him that she was a hostage, nothing more than leverage. And at Zenias side, Skava held one of Edwards many hands. His legs were growing in now, two stumpy little things that made his ball-like body longer, leaner. If it wasnt for all the arms and the fact that his face was hidden by a heavy pouch, Zenia would think he looked a lot like that old, old cartoon Tasmanian devil. The rest of the docking bay was quiet; for the next several hours, no ships would dock except for the Incaran vesseland none would depart. The staff, however, remained. Starting the dock up again after shutting it down was, as far as the *Nexus* was concerned, far too much trouble. Zenia let her expression turn to one of polite indifference as the jetway door slid open. The two Outreach operatives on either side of the door straightened almost imperceptibly. Light blades glowed a muted white at the level of their heads. From the door, a heavily armed contingent of Incaran soldiers poured into the port. They wore projectile weaponshard light rifles, pistolsstun batons, personal energy shields. Each individual was meant to be a threat. And she was pleased to see two of them startle when they turned their helmeted faces in her direction. Lifting her hands, Zenia laced her fingers. The blue of her nails stood in stark contrast to the warm brown of her skin, made even sharper by the white of her uniform. She held her hands with her palms facing inward, hovering over her chest, her thumbs lightly touching. It was precious that the Incaran thought all their weapons frightened anyone. It was precious how each one of them recoiled at the sight of Edward standing with Skava. Officers came next, sharply dressed in black and gold, their eyes hard, their bodies scarred. She recognized them from holosthat one was a captain, that one a commander. Ah, and there was Yllethski Paks husband, the great and feared Admiral Mitherik Pak. Pak moved with purpose, every step deliberate. Even for an alien whose species she had virtually no dealings with, his expressions were inscrutable, she figured he was the kind of person who was nearly impossible to read. Frustrating, but not the worst thing. He would have tells. Everyone did. She just had to find them. Edward was kind enough to help with that. When Paks eyes passed over the youngling, the fur around his neck stood on end, trembling. Excellent. For now, that would do. Striding forward, she clasped her hands together. For the same reason armies throughout history approached with arms spread and palms open, she went toward Admiral Pak with her hands folded as though to conceal a weapon. Among the Incaran, a gesture of unmitigated distrust. They valued honesty, and they would smell her wariness anyway. Admiral Pak, she said, meeting his gaze and ignoring his contingent. We are honored you walk among your enemies. He eyed her. You hide your weapons. And you brandish yours. Who is wiser, I wonder. Responding with a dry bark, he held out one hand. I greet you with hand open. Curious. He had learned a human gesture. It wasnt as if humanity tried to hide their media. Intercepting human movies or television shows would reveal basic human interaction, but no species ever did such things. It didnt occur to them. Considering him for a long moment, Zenia released her hands. She slipped her palm against his paw. How open handed are either of us? He laughed again. Only fools meet their enemies with truly open hands. He nodded toward Edward. No lie there. Disappointment washed through her anyway. In his concern for Edward, he hadnt noticed the much more immediate threat of her gel suit. All gel suits were capable of delivering electric shocks to startle and stun. He should have noticed that threat. Especially because her suit wasnt so kind of as that. Her suit didnt just shock. No, it could explode the heart in someones chest. *** At Zenias insistence, the Census sponsored a bizarre sort of diplomatic dinner party. Keegan had stood guard at more of these in his life than he cared to consider, but none had ever been more awkward than this. Incaran music, for example, was so many shrill, high-pitched shrieking noises that left him with a headache. Skava, who stood dead-eyed and blank faced across from him, looked like she wanted to kill someone. By human standards, Incaran food was flavorless, shapeless, colorless. They didnt dance so much as they walked in organized circles. Apparently, they werent much for small talk, either. Admiral Pak, holding a bowl of water in his paw-like hand, settled at Keegans side with a smile on his face. So youre the male who convinced my wife to argue on behalf of the Census. That was direct. Coughing his own drink out of his lungs, Keegan wheezed. I wouldnt say that. I would, the Admiral said. Yllethski told me your story. How the One who made your species directed your ancestress. Wow, that conflated a whole bunch of things that Keegan didnt have the theological knowledge to even begin tackling. As a result, she is arguing on your behalf. The Admiral kept his even gaze on the room, tracking two people more than anyone else. Well. One person and an artificial physical construct made of hard light. Keegan had no desire to debate religion with anyone, least of all someone like the Admiral. Zenia could do that in the morning when everyone sat around the table and religion dragged the discussion down twisting paths that Keegan couldnt even begin to fathom. So he changed the subject. Tactlessly. Gracelessly. There was a reason he was a soldier. You want me to introduce you to the *Nexus in Line*? he asked. No, the Admiral replied, so quickly that he cut Keegan off halfway through the ships name. Im not interested in speaking with a machine. He spoke with a sneer. The Incaran didnt value machines beyond their functions. Yllethski had grown accustomed to the avatar for the *Devils Advocate*, but she didnt like interacting with it. She didnt hold with the idea that a machines functions might include qualitative decisions. Itd make the next few days interesting, since the Incaran delegation would have to deal with the *Nexus in Line* at the table. Keegans hip itched. He smothered a grimace. An itch had gotten him into this. He could only imagine an itch would make everything worse. Exhaling slowly, he groped for an exit. Any excuse would do. I Why has an Outreach ensign taken in a Vathechur youngling? the Admiral asked. He hadnt spent much time with Edward, who was sleeping in the sling on Skavas back, but he took issue with the Admirals tone. Sharp. Almost condescending. There was no curiosity, only judgment. Because humanity doesnt believe in leaving childrenleaving *people*to die. Yet youve aligned yourselves with an organization that has no issue crushing an entire planet full of life, a species very home world. Shit, hed stumbled right into that trap. The Admiral had probably pulled this on every other person in the room over the course of the eveningexcept for Skava, who he wouldnt go near, and Zenia, who would probably have politely but still quite viciously put him in the dirt. Keegan sighed. He wasnt any good at this sort of thing. Look, he said. Look. Hell, what were they looking at? Humanity has screwed up a lot. More than a lot of other species, honestly. Weve had three world wars, countless other smaller wars, and committed genocide against our own species at least twenty-five times in only the last one hundred years. Our first contact with an alien speciesbefore Outreach made official first contact with usresulted in a plague that nearly wiped out the entire bellaran species. Weve fucked up a lot, but weve also learned that if we dont acknowledge those mistakes, we cant move forward. So, yeah, we aligned ourselves with the Census, and something went wrong when they made first contact with the Incaran, and thats awful. He took a deep breath. He really needed to stop giving speeches like this to aliens. Even though he didnt smoke, even though smoking was mostly relegated to the movies and history, he wanted to go to a park and take a long, hard drag on something intoxicating. I guess what Im saying is that the Census doesnt have a monopoly on making really bad decisions, but just because they fucked up doesnt mean you should write them off. If theyd written humanity off because of all our fuck ups, no one in the galaxy would have access to terraforming tools. In the past four years, Outreach has used that tech to save at least ten different planets. Silence spread between thema silence Keegan was more than comfortable with. It was a thoughtful silence, the kind that filled the synagogue in the spaces between prayers. You sound like you want me to put aside everything the Census has done to my people, the Admiral said, his tone low and soft and edged with a growl. Keegan shook his head. No, not at all. Im not even saying you should separate the people responsible for the destruction of your world from the rest of us. But an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind, and you wouldnt be here unless you were worried about how many eyes the Incaran people have left. The Admiral turned toward him. Your species is fond of metaphor, isnt it? Cracking a grin, Keegan shrugged. And yours likes allegory, right? The Admiral barked out a laugh that seemed to startle himit definitely startled Keegan. No wonder Yllethski likes you. And in that moment, when Keegan started to see something almost admirable in the Admiral, every light went out, plunging the banquet room into a sudden and profound darkness. Only a single source of light remained. The avatar of the *Nexus in Line* stood utterly still, its hard light body illuminating the space around it in a faint halo. Nothing of its body moved, no limb, no cloth, no eye. It was unnaturally still, frozen in the eerie way of a computer hiccup, caught in mid-motion and blurred at the edges but lacking all movement. Its eyes, all four of them, were wide with disbelief. Keegan hadnt ever seen a surprise on an avatar before. It wasnt a good look. The avatars hand splintered, the light disintegrating. Cracks of light shattered the avatars arm, fractured its chest and spread down its body. They burst, leaving only a lingering smear of smudged black and purple blobs in Keegans eyes where the avatar once stood. In the darkness, in the stillness, two sounds broke the silence. The first, the avatars hard light projector clinking against the floor. The second, hundreds of alarms roaring to life, raising the warning that, for everyone in that banquet room, was utterly redundant. *** [First][f] | [Previous][p] | Next"

Maybe now Ill get less confused. (And also readers too or whatever) Ive also got a discord, you can get to it via [this link](URL If youre a patron, theres also a patron only chat. The bot should automatically add any Patrons to the proper roles. ----- **Quinn** ----- Thankfully the inn at our final rest stop wasnt quite as crowded as the first, and the lot of us managed to get in and out without too much fuss. And then we got to walk through the woods. A lot. Quinn, Halea proclaimed, This is the worst! How did you get all the way here from Rhona without dying of boredom? I almost want someone to attack us, at least that would be interesting. The four of us were stomping along a narrow game trail, just wide enough for us to walk two by two, with Halea and Neferoy in front, and Victorina and I taking up the rear. Wed been walking for a couple of hours, and would still be walking for a couple more before we made camp for the night. Our pace was a little less than ideal, and between the relatively slow gait of the short elves, their reduced endurance, and the poor terrain, we werent going to make it very far each day. Id suggested having them wait behind at the inn while I walk the teleport beacon out to the mine, but Victorina shot that down on the grounds that theyd prefer not to teleport in at the prearranged time, only to find the beacon sitting in the middle of the forest next to my dismembered body. I of course had a rather higher opinion of my skill at battle magic, but she had a point. And even having them ride along inside the Portable Hole had its issues, since that couldnt be opened from the inside. An ambush might kill me, and trap the rest of them in a pocket dimension for weeks before someone thought to look for us. Well I covered most of the distance by sea, and the distance that was covered on foot was mostly spent in a blind sprint for the border, so boredom wasnt really the thing foremost on my mind. Right, Halea said, wincing, Sorry Quinn. I shrugged lightly, Its fine Halea. Victorina reached up and slipped her arm through mine, and while our differing heights made it a little awkward, I did take comfort in her presence. What have you been thinking about then, Quinn? Victorina asked, shifting the subject away from the less than pleasant memories, Youve been pretty quiet this whole time. She was right, I had been quiet. The others had been passing the time by talking and sharing University gossip, but I didnt have much to add, and had remained quiet except when addressed directly. Id enjoyed being included in their little chat, even if it was only as an observer, but Id been lost in thought, as was usual. Spells, I said simply, Ive been working with Diova and some of his clubmates in my spell invention class, and Im trying to come up with some ideas that Id be able to work on with them once were done with Solaris. You, short of ideas? Halea asked incredulously. Ideas I can share with Diova, I clarified, Not ideas in general. Ive got plenty of awesome ideas, I just dont want to share most of them with anyone outside the club. That makes rather more sense, Victorina said. What Im thinking of right now, I said, Given our current situation, is some sort of long distance travel spell. You mean Teleport? Neferoy asked. I shook my head, Probably not. Its no good if you havent been somewhere before, or if you dont have a map thats accurate enough. Which is why were not using it now, Halea commiserated. Exactly. There are the other options, like your leapy jumpy spell, but theyre energy inefficient. Over a journey of kilometres theyre not going to make a noticeable difference in how far or how quickly you can travel. Some Mages use Summon Horse, basically just a modified Summon Animal, Neferoy provided, But that only works if you know the spell incredibly well, enough to run it entirely off of ambient mana. How much does it cost to keep it going? I asked, Assuming youre not getting any cost discounts? Three mana, or energy I suppose, every minute. Damn, even using a huge manastone would be mostly pointless then. Yeah, Neferoy confirmed, And then youd need to wait weeks or months for the stone to recharge. You could use a pocketful of two or three point stones I suppose, but then youd need some awfully deep pockets. What about flight? I asked, Theres got to be a Fly spell out there. There is, Victorina replied, But its like you said, most spells like that are inefficient if you want to travel longer distances.. Besides, Halea added, Landing is *really* hard. You can cast Feather Fall along side it, or wear an item with a Feather Fall enchantment, but then the two spells end up fighting each other and you don't go much of anywhere. Something else then, I mused. If summoned horses cost so much, then it was unlikely for something like a Tensers Floating Disk to be much cheaper. It was something to look into at least, and even if it wasnt any cheaper Id prefer that to a horse. An inert floating disk is going to be a much better ride than some smelly horse. *Assuming that the summoned horse is a normal horse. Could I summon a robotic horse? Or a car? Note to self, learn Summon Car. Failing that, learn how to ride a horse.* Flight had been my other bright idea, and it was the one that I thought showed the most promise, now that I knew my floating disk idea was unlikely to pan out. Id need to look at the spell, but I could see how trying to throw a person through the air in some semblance of flight would cost a tremendous amount of energy. Humans, elves, and what have you arent terribly aerodynamic, and without any lifting surfaces youd need to apply at least 1g of force constantly to a mass of thirty to eighty kilograms, depending on the race and size of the caster. For me that meant an energy expenditure of forty mana every three minutes, just to get me airborne. But that was awful aircraft design. There was a reason that most planes had wings, and not just an array of massive engines to keep the thing in the air. If I could create lifting surfaces out of Apportation style manipulators, and use some sort of modified Fire Jet for propulsion... Well, now there was an idea. *But not one Id want to share with Diova. Might need to try the floating disk thing with him after all.* Forget about it Halea, hes gone again, Victorina laughed, finally drawing me away from my thoughts, Ask him later. Ask me what later? I asked distractedly. Solaris, Halea said, exasperation clear in her voice, How is that coming along? Id heard that you were trying to design a version that could even hurt elves. Kinda? I answered, That was the original plan, but its not really feasible. Itll burn a person, ignite paper, even wood if enough pulses strike the same spot, but pretty much any other spell would be better if you actually want to do damage. Itll blind the target immediately if you get them in the eyes, but then thats not so special, since I wouldnt want to catch an Acid Ball or Magic Missile in the face either. What the new Solaris will do though, is royally fuck up vampires. Oh? Yeah. The old Solaris was mostly just a Firebolt that only worked on Vampires and was a little more powerful given the same amount of mana. The new Solaris though? Itll punch fist sized holes in anything with a vulnerability to sunlight. Damn, Halea breathed. Well depending on what we find in the mine, you might get the opportunity to test it, Victorina said. You think there might be Vampires in the mines? I asked, furrowing my brow. Victorina shook her head, Ghouls. Theyre not quite as susceptible to sunlight as vampires, but I imagine that your new spell will still have a significant effect on them. Assuming theres any ghouls at all, Neferoy said. Ken is going to be *so* mad once we tell her where weve been, Halea laughed. ------ We stopped that evening, just as the sun was touching the horizon, and made camp next to the game trail wed been following. The others were confused initially, when I drew a hammock and not a tent from my belt, but pleased once I explained how theyd keep us up off the soaked and muddy ground. It hadnt stopped raining, not since wed left that morning, and it didnt look like it was about to any time soon. I set up a tarp first, stringing it between several trees so that it covered the whole of the campsite, while Neferoy got a fire going. Then I strung a hammock for each of us, along with a cover for each. The cover would keep off any rain blown sideways by the wind, keep out any bugs, and provide some modicum of privacy. Essentially it was a tent, it just happened to be suspended off the ground. Quinn! Halea demanded, once the campsite was set up, I believe I was promised mindless entertainment? Relax, and give me a couple minutes, I told her, I still need to prepare dinner. Yes! I would kill for something to eat right now, Victorina groaned. Well not to worry, the killing bits been handled, I just need to cook it. Ill be back in a bit, I said, as I climbed down into the Portable Hole. ------ After such a long journey the steak sandwiches I made were a big hit. I might have made something a little more refined if Id had the inclination, but after walking for hours I didnt really feel like trying to drag the dining table out of the Portable Hole. Of course, Victorina did find it rather amusing when I mentioned the dining table, but providing her with something delicious to eat quickly shut her up. If were going to eat this well every night, Halea said, relaxing in her hammock with her legs hanging over the side, Then maybe this trip wont be so bad. Youre welcome, I smiled, relaxing in my own hammock. It was a strange feeling, relaxing around the campfire with my friends and listening to the rain. It wasnt easy to pin down or define, which probably had something to do with it not being terribly familiar, but I decided then that Id need an awful lot more of whatever this was in the future. ----- To say that the days passed quickly would be a blatant lie, and even if the food and the company was great, the constant rain and constant walking had gotten old about three hours into the five day trip. I was managing it fairly well, but I was also the best prepared for travel of this sort. I had proper shoes, and a good coat, both of which were made of breathable yet waterproof synthetics. Even my clothing was better than anything youd be able to find on Elardia, my socks in particular were antibacterial and would help with the damp. The weather grew old eventually, but I had the clothing to stand up to it, and the endurance to put up with the constant walking. The others, well, they were pretty much screwed from the start. Wool, leather, oilskin, they can all keep the water out to some degree, but natural materials can only handle so much abuse. Eventually they get soaked through, and then all youre left with is a big sodden weight on your shoulders. Victorina of course could cast her little umbrella spell, but it was taxing to maintain. She might have paid for the spell with only mana and nothing more, but keeping up her concentration on the spell as each individual raindrop struck it was an effort. Granted, it was a wholly mental effort, but it still took its toll over the hours and hours of walking. She only ever managed it for an hour or two each day, before it became too much and she finally need let the spell drop. Their footwear at least was nearly as good as what you might find on earth, having been made bespoke, but again they lacked the benefit of synthetic materials. They might have managed it better if they were more used to walking and if their boots had been properly worn in, but I suspected that theyd not had a chance to do that. *A princess, a noblewoman, and the daughter of a wealthy merchant family. Probably not a lot of time spent traveling on foot. Damn, just how the hell did I get here again?* Despite Haleas best hopes, we avoided any confrontation with hostile wildlife during those five days of walking, and arrived at the entrance to the mine at dusk on the fifth day. Well, I said finally, This is creepy as fuck. At least it was easy to find, Halea commented, Though I think we want to backtrack a little before we make camp. Yeah, safe is not the first word that comes to mind when I look at this place. The maw of the mine was pitch black, and the ground around the entrance had been churned up into mud. I could see ragged bits of bone protruding from the ground, that had not yet been washed away, even with the heavy rain of the past several days, along with red streaks that could have only been blood. Taken together the entrance to the mine looked like a gaping, infected, wound in the side of the mountain. Ghouls then, Victorina said tiredly, I was still holding out hope that it would be uninhabited. Neferoy shook her head, Shelter like this would have been claimed by one animal or another, were just particularly unlucky in that it happened to be ghouls that claimed it. At least its actually here, I shrugged, It almost would have been worse for it to never have been dug, or for it to have caved in. Some of this at least is natural formation, Neferoy pointed out, And was here long before the guild decided to mine it. Well know more once we look around tomorrow. For now though, I think we ought to beat a path away from here. Its nearly dusk, and the ghouls are going to come out to hunt soon. Cant we drop the beacon, and then teleport back to the clubhouse? I asked, We could spend the night back in proper beds, and then teleport back in the morning, or even once weve taken a couple days to rest. Halea shook her head tiredly, I dont think I could concentrate enough teleport more than a couple miles right now, not like this. Im having a hard enough time staying on my feet. Victorina looked to Neferoy, but she shook her head as well, I havent got the energy either. Its not a bad plan though, I should be able to get us back to last nights camp at least. Sounds better than walking, Halea said, I dont know if we could get a safe distance away if we were just on foot, not before nightfall. Gather round then, I need to cast the spell before I keel over, Victorina said, waving the others into a circle. A moment later there was a brief moment of nausea, and the scenery blinked from the mess near the mouth of the mine, to the peaceful scenery of the forest clearing wed stopped in the night before. I was a little unsteady on my feet as we landed in the clearing, but the others were obviously suffering more. Halea looked like she only just managed to stop herself from vomiting, and Victorina reached out to me to steady herself. That was not something she did frequently, and to do it in front of the others showed pretty clearly just how rough a shape she was in, though shed been hiding it pretty well. Quinn, Victorina asked, once shed regained her balance, Can you Yeah, I got it, I said, as I set up the camp for what would hopefully be the last time. ----- Supper was a hearty beef stew, and it might have been simpler even than the steak sandwiches of the first night, but it was filling, and thats what mattered. I dont know that the others even cared at this point, and finished the food quickly before climbing weakly into bed. I was just at that midpoint between sleep and wakefulness, when you get those fragmented bits of dreams, when I was torn back to wakefulness by the rustle of leaves and then the sound of two heavy footfalls in the muck. My heart rate spiked, and for a moment I froze, before quickly and quietly reaching up for the belt pouch that was pinned to the cover above the hammock to retrieve several lead projectiles. My preparations turned out to be for naught though, and I was reassured a moment later by the sound of Haleas whispered voice. No fair, she said quietly. Get your own human, Victorina hissed back, just before I felt her weight draw the hammock to one side. I reached over to help her up, and pulled her into the hammock on top of me. Hey there beautiful, I whispered, and I was rewarded with a smile, though I could see the weariness in her eyes, Not going to bother keeping up appearances? Its not like they dont know were sleeping together, she said, as she pulled her shirt up over her head, And its cold, she stated, wriggling out of her trousers. Are you sure you want to strip down? I asked, raising an eyebrow, What if this is the night that were attacked by a ferocious monster? Then Ill fight them naked, she said flatly, undoing the linen wrap that shed worn in lieu of a corset and letting her breasts free, Besides, everything aches and itches and is so uncomfortable. That raises the question then I said smiling. Oh? She asked, stripping out of the last of her undergarments, And what question is that? How do I ensure we get attacked as quickly as possible? Oh shut up, she whispered, unzipping my hoodie. Id stayed more or less dressed, in fear of exactly the problem Id pointed out to Victorina, but had made some notable changes. Firstly, Id ditched the jeans and the footwear, replacing them with some soft silk trousers that Id been using as pyjamas since first arriving here. Secondly, Id put away my shirt, wearing only my hoodie. It was very comfortable, but it did mean that I had to work to hold back a gasp when Victorina snuggled down into me, pressed her cold body against mine and circling my chest with her tiny freezing hands. N-no kidding, I shivered, You are c-cold. She squirmed against me, drinking in the warmth and shimmying further under the blankets. How are you still so warm? she whispered, How is it that youve been able to keep going for these past few days as if none of this bothers you? I ran my fingers through her hair gently, the other hand resting lightly on the small of her back, Its just how humans are built I suppose. Its not as if the rest of you havent been able to keep up though. I thing the only that kept us going was pride, Victorina replied, Halea and I werent about to let you beat us, and Neferoy didnt want to disappoint the rest of us. If it had just been us girls though, we would have turned around on that second day. Come back with warhorses maybe, that wouldnt spook at the sight of the monsters that *didnt sarding show up dammit.* We should rest tomorrow, I said, Were just going to get ourselves badly hurt if we try to go spelunking like this. Ive still got plenty of stuff on my phone to watch, so its not like well be bored either. Sounds good, Victorina muttered, and it wasnt long before shed finally fallen asleep. ----- We spent all of that sixth day in the woods relaxing, and I finally made good use of the furniture that Id been carrying along in my Portable Hole this whole time. Neferoy and Halea each got a nice puffy armchair to themselves, and Victorina and I shared a couch. I sat with my feet up on an ottoman, and Victorina lounged across the couch, with her feet propped up on my lap as I massaged them gently. It was only a minor effort to maintain the illusion that magnified the phones screen, and I let myself relax and enjoy watching the show. It was a surreal experience, watching TV in a sitting room that was in the middle of a forest, in the middle of a rainstorm, and at least a hundred kilometres from the nearest settlement of significant size. But thats not equivalent exchange at all! Neferoy protested, Wheres the little man with the metal arm getting the energy to make the pillar of rock move? Quinn, this doesnt make any sort of sense at all. Its just a show Neferoy, Halea replied, But I do wish that the blonde girl would just sard him and get it over with already. The two are obviously perfect for each other, and if he starts to get too grabby she can just pull his arm off. Come on girl, jump on that, dont be gentle, you can fix him if he breaks. *Its always interesting, hearing Haleas take on human media.* Quinn, Halea asked, leaning over the arm rest, When do I get my foot massage? Hes mine, Victorina sighed, head lolling back, eyes half closed, I told you, get your own human. Come on Quinn, Halea taunted, Just say the word and Ill get rid of miss smelly feet for you. *My* feet smell? Victorina challenged, Youre the one who took two months to learn how to cast Clean. Hush you two, Neferoy cut in, Some of us are trying to watch the show. ----- "
110,vulnerability,HFY,[MISC][CYOA] Ignis Ship Classifications: More Details (40k),26,6rwob5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/6rwob5/misccyoa_ignis_ship_classifications_more_details/,2017-08-06 15:18:00,"Although the following isn't terribly important to the story of Ignis, aside from gross classifications, I did get a request from /u/LordOfInternet for a bit more detail, so here it is. For those of you familiar with the system, I'm generally following fleet composition rules from Battle Fleet Gothic, the old table-top 40k ship combat game. The rules are available out on the internet, for anyone who cares to look. Accordingly, the Terra Incarnadine and her fleet are as follows: Edit: [Part 2](URL **BATTLESHIPS:** *Terra Incarnadine*: A customized Ark Mechanicus-class Battleship, the crown jewel of the Von Sebastion Fleet. Armed with her mighty Damocles Mk2 Spinal Rail Cannon, the Terra Incarnadine is capable of inflicting hurt on any ship that dares cross her prow. While not a powerful as the mighty Nova cannons other ships mount, the Damoclese is easier to supply, maintain, and repair away from a propper shipyard. Along her dorsal spine she carries a Godsbane Lance battery. Capable of reaching out and touching its target with immense beams of coherent energy, it is more importantly turreted. It can fire in all but the aft arc, being blocked by the superstructure of the bridge. Down each braodside, the Terra Incarnadine mounts a unit each of Hecutor Plasma cannons, Sunsear Laser Cannons, and a Jovian-pattern Launch Bay. This combination allows the Terra Incarnadine to put down a ferocious hail of plasma and lasers at long ranges, while also caring a worthwhile strike wing. In total, this combination of weapons systems makes the Terra Incarnadine capable of looking out for herself, should the need arise, and not particularly vulnerable to any one threat. **BATTLECRUISRS** *Olaf Thorson*: Armageddon-class Battlecruiser The Armageddon class of Battlecruiser was developed in an attempt to rapidly increase the number of Battlecruisers available for line duty, and also as a way to upgrade the venerable Lunar-class cruisers. Not all of the Lunars have made the conversion, in part due to shipyard limitations, and in part due to Admirals unwilling to sacrifice large portions of their line of battle to the shipyard's hands. The Olaf Thorson's prow, like that of all Armageddons, is dominated by the shape of the classic Imperial Armored prow, cut through with six large anti-ship torpedo tubes. Slow to load, slow to fire, and slow to move through the void, Imperial torpedoes are never the less a serious threat. Each one packs enough firepower to present a serious threat to any ship or planet they hit, and doctrine is to fire them so that they can't miss: either point-blank into anther ship or at immobile orbital installations, not to mention the predictably-moving planets that they orbit. The Armageddon-class Battlecruiser received an improved long-range dorsal-mounted Lance battery, which is the sum total of the entirely new weapons systems over the Lunars from which they were upgraded. The broadside weapons of the two classes are the same: a lance battery and macro-cannon section. The firepower of those weapons is *not*. The Armageddon-class received improved energy copuplers, on-mount capacitors and targeting systems. The over-all effect of which was to increase their effective range by a factor of fifty percent, making them almost as long-ranged as the weapons mounted by Battleships. *Skylark*: Overlord-class Battlecruiser The Overlord-class Battlecruisers, unlike their Armageddon-class cousins, were designed as Battlecruisers from the keel-out: Battleship-caliber weapons fitted to a Cruiser-class hull. The resulting firepower is impressive at long ranges, if slight slower-firing and less effective in the escort-clearance role. The Overlords, like the Armageddons, mount the classic Imperial armored prow and torpedo tubes arrangement, but that is where the similarities end. The Skylark's dorsal lances like all overlords, are a 'short' Godsbane battery: mounting only two projectors to the Battleships typical compliment of three. Her broadsides are the same, 'short' Hecutor Plasma cannon emplacements with two-thirds as many projectors as a Retribution-class Battleship. This ironically gives her twice as many Hecutors per broadside as the Terra Incarnadine, who more than makes up the difference with her fast-firing Sunsears. **CRUISERS** *Skyfall*: Dominator-class Cruiser The Dominator class is an unusual ship for the Imperial Navy. Intended as a fire-support cruiser to lay down heavy long-range fire in support of a more conventionally-armed line of battle or planetary assault, the Skyfall mounts a chin-mounted Nova Cannon. Although useless at short engagement ranges, each shell fired is more than capable of tearing a cruiser to pieces in a single hit. to fill that short-range vulnerability, the Dominator's broadsides are heavy macro-cannon batteries. They are only cruiser-caliber weapons, and lack the mid- and long-range capability of her larger brethren, but she can put as many shell in space in a single broadside as Retribution-class Battleship. *Terra's Light*: Lunar-class Cruiser The mainstay of Imperial fleets all over the Imperium, The lunar class is a venerable design that offers a balance of Macro-cannon and Lace firepower as well as ridiculous ship reliability due to incredibly simplified and streamlined design features. Lunars mount the standard armored prow with six torpedo tubes, plus a lance battery and macro-cannon battery in each broadside. Both the lances and macro-cannons are cruiser-caliber, which limits their maximum range. But it is the ease of maintenance, and especially production, that makes the Lunar-class the long-lived backbone of Imperial fleets. The Terra's Light herself was laid down in the Jovian shipyards almost two thousand years ago. That makes her a relative new-comer for Lunars however. The Legendary Iron Duke is almost six thousand years old, while the Lord Daros holds the singular honor of being build in orbit over a *completely undeveloped* world. Working with nothing more than muscle-powered mining and smelting equipment, and hand-held void-capable welding equipment, the abandoned colonists of Ulnoth never the less got the ship built in only eleven years. It is this combination of all-around firepower, simplicity of construction, and ease of maintenance that Keeps the Lunar-class in service down the long years. ***ESCORTS*** *Aegis*: putatively a Sword-class destroyer, that is where the similarities to the Imperial Navy class of ships end. Long in service to House Von Sebastion, the Aegis is a supremely fine-tuned example of the class. The regular Sword-class Destroyers of the Imperial Navy are a venerable, tested and true design that shares many design philosophies with the Lunar-class cruisers, as well as a similar span of service. Being a destroyer intended for commerce protection and pirate hunting, the Sword class is reasonably fast, reasonably maneuverable, and well-equipped with macro-cannons. The normal Sword carries a pair of destroyer-weight macro-cannons in dorsal mounts. Despite the fact that these mountings cannot fire over the aft of the ship (and on some particularly venerable hulls, aren't even super-firing), the maneuverability of the hull makes staying on the tail of a Sword a feat reserved for small one-man strike craft. The Aegis, on the other hand, mounts a set of turbo-charged Sunsear laser batteries. All of the fine-tuning in the Imperium can't increase their firepower beyond that of the 'regular' swords, but they are modified for exceptional range and accuracy. The Aegis routinely engages targets at ranges normally reserved for Battleships, scoring hits and damage long before her opponents enter range. *Vector Squadron*: Firestorm-class Destroyers: A relatively new addition to the Imperial fleet, particularly out on the edge of Imperial space, the Firestorm is a modification of the Sword-class design. They sacrifice one of the dorsal macro-cannon mounts to squeeze in, and power, a prow-mounted lance. Only the Firestorms and the even newer Nova-class Space Marine Destroyers carry a lance in anything below the wall. This gives them a hitting power greater than would normally be expected out of a 'mere escort', but it takes a gutsy Shipmaster and better Helmsman to get the forward-firing lance into a good firing position and keep it there.

111,vulnerability,HFY,[OC]The Burning of Ashenvale - 19,54,6sglmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/6sglmy/octhe_burning_of_ashenvale_19/,2017-08-09 07:09:37,"[Index](URL [Previous](URL ----------- Lyssia woke up from the grinding of metal on metal as the food slit on the door was opened. She opened her eyes just in time to see the wooden cup and bowl be pulled out through it by a pair of drow hands. That was a vulnerability she could use. If they reached in, she could grab the jailer's hands and pull, possibly dragging her captor head-first into the door. She made a mental note of this. The food slit remained open for a few long moments, before being shut. Had Drada noticed the damage to the bowl? Lyssia prayed silently that the brute had missed it, or at least didn't care. Such hopes were dashed a couple of moments later, as the door opened wide; Blinding Lyssia with the comparably brilliant lighting of the outside corridor. She saw two shapes outlined by the light outside. Lyssia quickly pressed the splinter towards the side of the cell, where there was the possibility of it being missed by anyone searching, then strong hands closed around her arm. She was pulled to her feet. There was the clank of metal as her wrists were once more enclosed in chains, and she was dragged out. ""I don't know what you're planning, *traitor*, but I've been told my mother to punish any misbehaviour. Breaking temple property is misbehaviour."" Drada's voice didn't even attempt to conceal the joy the big woman felt. Lyssia's eyes began to adapt to the light as she was dragged down the corridor. ""Meli. Wash out the cell."" There was motion behind her, but Lyssia didn't even turn to look. *Dammit.* ""You sure are enjoying this, Drada. Finally found your calling, since you failed at being an assassin?"" Lyssia sneered at the big woman to her left. She wasn't entirely sure why she was antagonising her jailer, but at this point, she couldn't really end up in a worse spot. ""Be happy my orders are to let you and your damn beast-spawn of a child live, or I'd have killed you already, you arrogant daughter of filth."" Lyssia was thrust down onto a stool, and her chains were attached to a rung on the floor. She finally had an opportunity to study her jailers. Drada was still very much the same. Standing a head taller than Lyssia, she was butch and built almost like an orc. Lyssia remembered how everyone had teased that her father had been one, but also remembered how those who did that usually ended up with bloodied nosed. She was thin-skinned. Not exactly a good combination with her brawn. The other guard was more like what one'd expect from a Drow. Lithe, Slender, with defined muscle covering her body. Illara. Lyssia remembered her. She was several years younger than Lyssia and Drada. She looked uncomfortable with this. Good to see that some people weren't quite so eager to torture her, Lyssia figured. Not that it helped much. Lyssia watched at Drada walked over to a few full buckets. ""I think it's time to wash away that surface grime, don't you agree?"" Drada said, looking over to Lyssia. ""Sadly, I think you took so long to return that the water went cold."" Before having more than a second to brace herself, Lyssia was drenched in ice-cold water. ""Gah!"" Lyssia felt her muscles tense, and curled down to protect her front. Well, as much as the hands chained to the floor behind her allowed. ""Hm, better, but you still stink. Don't you agree, Illara?"" ""U-uh-"" Not really waiting for the hesitating guard to respond, Drada whisked another bucket from the ground, and in a single swift action dumped it over Lyssia. This one was as cold as the one before. Lyssia gritted her teeth, not wanting to give Drada the pleasure of crying out. ""No. You still stink!"" Lyssia didn't even have a moment to recover before having a third bucket dumped over her. ""Nnng-"" Lyssia looked up at Drada with hate in her eyes. She couldn't stop herself from shivering. Drada stepped forwards with a fiendish grin, and Grabbed Lyssia by her hair, pulling it back. ""I think you need a haircut, too! All of you stink of traitor. Illara! Bring the soap, razor and brush!"" Lyssia felt her cuffs. Pulled and examined them while Drada was distracted. Not an inch of give. She couldn't even find the locks on the cuffs on her wrists. She could see Drada accepting a small razor blade from Illara. ""You really get off on this, you sick freak."" Lyssia spat at the brute. Drada grinned. ""It isn't every day you get almost-free reign on the golden daughter, Traitor."" Once more, Drada grabbed Lyssia by the hair, pulled upwards hard, and started to cut her long hair off. Lyssia could feel a stinging pain every time Drada slipped with the blade, each time accompanied by an ""oops!"" by the large woman, as if it was accidental. Bitch. The wounds caused were only minor, superficial cuts. Hardly any blood was drawn, but it hurt. Soon, Drada clicked her tongue in satisfaction. ""There! All better. Doesn't that *feel good*?"" ""I should have killed you when I had the chance."" Drada grabbed Lyssia by a pointed ear, and forced her eyes up to meet Drada's. ""Don't think I forgot what you did instead, bitch. I still have the scars."" Drada released her painful hold on Lyssia's ear. ""Soap and brush!"" She took the items given to her by her little helper, and Lyssia shuddered as the rough brush was dragged over her sensitive skin. It hurt. But not enough to leave any lasting damage. The fourth bucket of ice-cold water was a relief after the other rough treatment, even as it left Lyssia's teeth clattering. ""There."" Drada said. ""That should shut you up for a while. And please. Do misbehave again."" The chains clinked as she was released from the floor. Firm hand grabbed at her sore arms as she was dragged back to her cell. She didn't know how, but she'd kill them all. And she'd take her time with Drada. Vengeance would be sweet. The door slammed shut behind her. She was cold. So cold. The floor of the cell was wet. Seemed like her captors had been thorough with the cleaning of the cell. She felt around, finding the place where she had left the splinter, and she praised the gods. It was still there. --------- Lyssia had curled herself into a ball by the door, one ear pressed against the bronze door. She could hear the guards patrol. She counted in her mind, and approximated that someone passed by her door every half hour. She couldnt tell which one of her guards it was each time, nor when the guard changed. She hadnt eaten since last dinner. Her stomach growled, and she felt weak. This was not what she or the child within her needed. Just as she was thinking that, the latch on the food-slit was pulled away. Lyssia slid back slightly as the slit opened, and food was passed inside. This time, there was more food. There was chunky stew, fresh bread and a larger wooden tankard of water. Dinner. The voice was not Dradas. Nor was it Illara. So this was this Meli? Well. She didnt recognize the voice, so it had to be a new ward of the temple. She sounded young. Probably an orphan that slipped through the cracks of society, or someone abandoned by uncaring parents? You are Meli, are you not? Lyssia wagered. There was always the possibility that this was someone whose name shes not heard yet, but if Lyssia could appeal to the conscience of this girl, she could use her as a source of information. There was silence for a few seconds, before the young girl responded, almost in a whisper; *The old lady told me not to speak with you* Lyssia smiled to herself slightly. I wont tell. Shell never know. She always knows. She knows everything! The young girl had slightly raised her voice from a whisper to a muffled conversational volume. She does! I know she does! The others told me, youre here because no one can hide from the old woman! Lyssia chuckled. The girl obviously heard her, as she fell silent. Oh, she only knew about me because she paid mages to use their magic to spy on me. She didnt know much at all. If you dont believe me, go to the old wing of the temple and look for a loose stone under the third torch on the left side. Theres an old treasure of mine there that the old woman doesnt know about. Lyssia smiled. She knew mirrors were banned in the temple. After all, vanity was frowned upon in the cult of assassins. When the Mother had caught her with her first mirror, she had been harshly punished. But on one of her first real missions, she had stolen away a gilded mirror and hid it in a hiding place no one else knew about. She had treasured it, but when she left she had left it behind. If it could make the young girl trust her, it was a worthy investment. Be careful, though. The others will be angry if they find you with it. Ill Ill look. Lyssia closed her eyes. I look forwards to talking to you soon, Meli. The slit swung closed, and she heard the latch lock in place. She had gotten the girl to talk to her. Now it was a waiting game. ------ Emmet, how many torches do we have left? Freidrich asked as the torch he was holding started to splutter. It didnt have long, now. He could hear Emmet, who had been the one carrying the torches these last few days, rustling through his pack. We have five left, sir. Not good. Freidrich could feel the same unease his men did. There was no light down here. Gods knew what lurked in the darkness, and theyre almost out of torches. They only had enough for a few more hours. Being stuck down here in complete darkness with no prospective of light wasnt a pleasant thought. Dammit. Emmet, hold off on lighting the next torch. Well save it for if we hear something. Everyone, keep track of the person in front of and behind you. Well have to move in complete darkness. Sir, are you sure about this? it was Dieter. The man was still shaken from his experience, being snatched up from out of the darkness a couple of days ago by the spiders. Well, at least Freidrich thought it was a couple of days ago. They had made camp and slept three times since then. Unless you like the idea of not having a torch in case we run into hostiles again, Im sorry to say yes. I understand, sir he still looked on the verge of panic, and his hands shook slightly. Freidrich grabbed his shoulder firmly. I know this is hard, but we do what we must. We must press on. If we turn back now, we lose our chance to track down Lyssia. *and the assassins*, Freidrich thought to himself. It was unbelievably selfish, he knew, but to him revenge was now a greater motivator than the prospect of saving Lyssia. It pained him to admit that to himself. But it was true. The torch spluttered as the oiled cloth that made up its fuel finally burned down to nothing. They were suddenly enveloped in perfect darkness, no stars or moon to guide their path ahead. He now had Dieters hand on his shoulder, and his left hand on the wall of the underground roads side. Their pace slowed to a crawl as they proceeded along the not-quite even road, prodding their way forwards. It continued this way for hours. Freidrich didnt know if they had missed any alternative passages. He prayed quietly for some way to find the path ahead. To see. That was when his prayer was answered. He saw a glow. A blue light far ahead. It was a soft, friendly glow. Freidrich didnt trust it. Moving ahead, he saw that the blue light emanated from an orb floating mid-air in a dead-end room off to the side of the corridor. Sir I- Garen stepped forwards, reaching a hand out to grab for the orb. Freidrich leaps forwards and grasps Garen by the collar, pulling him back. Slow down, you fool! Doesnt this look suspicious to you? A glowing orb just floating in the air? This seemed to snap Garen out of his daze, and Freidrich would definitely call it a daze. He had looked distant, his eyes unfocused. No one stare directly at the orb, and stand back! He could hear people complying, first a few, then others being essentially dragged along. Yeah, it was some kind of trap, putting people into some kind of trance. Freidrich took care not to look directly at the orb, drawing his longsword, and poking it with the tip. He could see the orb flinch back, as something on the roof screeches in pain. A large lizard fell to the floor, the orb falling with it. Freidrich now saw that the orb was placed on the end of some sort of antenna on its face. For a moment, it flailed around, before finding purchase on the side of the room, and spinning over to snarl at them. The thing was big. Real big. Easily a few meters long, even if its body was pressed against the floor by short, stumpy legs. It hissed, rows of glistening, dagger-like teeth bared in the soft blue light emanating from its lure. It coiled its long body back like a snake. Freidrich braced, and pointed his blade straight towards its mouth as it lurched forwards with a sudden start. Its maw opened with a width that Freidrich could only call unnatural as it swallowed his blade whole, teeth grinding towards his bracers, his gauntlets well inside the damned things mouth. It yowled and hissed, and Freidrich feld acrid blood dripping out of its mouth; but it didnt die, and it held his arms firmly locked in its jaws. I need some help over here! He shouted as he fell over, dragged to the ground by the beast. It twisted its body, and Freidrich could feel the sharp teeth grinding towards the metal of his armor, and he felt his arm being twisted painfully, almost tearing his arm loose, it felt like. But he could also feel the bleeding from within the creature worsening as it fought him, and his hand was still wrapped around his long swords handle. While the creature had swallowed his blade whole, it had pierced something inside the creature. He heard the sound of heavy boots crashing on the stone floor as his men rushed into action. He could see Amett launching forwards with his battleaxe, bringing it down into the creatures neck. Acrid blood sprays out, and he can feel the beast now pulling away rather than trying to twist his arm. It hasnt let go of his arm, yet, causing it to drag Freidrich along the floor. I cant get a shot! he hear Emmet shout, but Garen and Dieter were upon the creature with their swords. But it was Amett that was the most effective. The creatures scales seemed tough, but the axe made short work of them, digging into it hard. The creature was screaming now, and its thrashing had become far more desperate. Freidrich turned his grimace of fear into a feral grin, and took his swords guard in both hands. It was time to use his pinned position to his advantage. It was his turn to spin. And he spun the blade. He felt something burst inside the beast, and a gout of blood sloshed out of its mouth. It slumped to the ground, its jaws retaining its death-grip on his arms. The scene calmed down as the creature stopped thrashing, the entire squad slowing down to just look at the thing. Barend! Freidrich shouted. Get over here and put that spear of yours to good use! Im still stuck! "

I was aware, Balder replied a little indignantly, while subtly removing his right gripper from the missile launch trigger. Derturba noticed. Star charts with the location of the Human colonies would be nice too, Derturba added. This time Balder turned in irritation, Admiral Derturba, if I want your assistance I will ask for it. This is *my* fleet, Im the one in charge here! Derturba wasnt going to say anything further, but one of the mobsters next to him shoved him with their forelimb and gave him a dirty look, Yes sir, sorry sir, he apologized, which seemed to appease the guard, who went back to ignoring him. Balder spoke to the console in front of him. Computer, attempt to open a channel of communication with the Humans, then use the connection to perform a cyber-attack. Once you have access copy all the files from the Humans computer system, Derturba had to admit that it wasnt a bad plan. Once they had control of the station they would have the star charts *and* could easily acquire all the genetic samples they needed without firing a single shot. Right away Captain, the computer responded, then after less than a second followed up with, Captain, the Humans have opened a channel of communication with us. That was fast, Balder commented, Computer, commence cyber-attack. Cyber-attack already underway Captain, would you like to speak with the Humans while you wait? Why not? Its not like they can do anything to stop us, Balder said with a little too much confidence. They were supposed to have the same translation package that was used to communicate with the Bridgewater colony, but for some reason it took several tries to get an intelligible response from the Humans. Apologies, one of the Humans finally replied in a strange accent that shouldnt have been translated, We no realize you were with GDA. What reason have you here for? Balder hesitated for a moment before responding, You speak to Prince Balder Yotun the third, rightful ruler of the galaxy. Surrender now or be destroyed. Ha! Is funny joke. You have ten seconds to retreat from our territory or *you* be destroy, the heavily accented Human replied. Not to be outdone, Balder responded in kind Well you have *nine* seconds to surrender! He then disabled the comm line, Computer, do you have access to the Human systems yet? Yes Captain, file transfer will be complete in the next three seconds, the computer reported. Good. Computer, disable all systems on the Human space station immediately, he ordered. Right away Ca- *kshhhh*, The computer started to respond before suddenly fading into static. Derturba looked around, but all the mobsters on the deck looked just as confused as he was. The lights cut off for a second and then were replaced by emergency lighting. *Whats going on?* Derturba thought to himself. Computer, report. What just happened? Balder tried to command the ship, but there was no response beyond a steady stream of static. From Derturbas vantage he could see that the console Balder was sitting at wasnt responding either, despite Balder running his grippers along just about every control. From the viewport Derturba could see the Human station shimmer and then disappear. One of Balders starships that was in their field of view exploded into a field of debris at the same time. It appeared to tear itself apart without any obvious weapon attack coming from the Human station. Computer, report! Balder commanded again, his voice was starting to become more frantic. There was still no response. The other starships that were left within view appeared to be just as unresponsive as their own. One of them was being fired upon by a steady stream of projectile weaponry coming from the location where the Human station used to be, Derturba could see the telltale streaks of super-heated matter with his naked eye. The ship was holding, even the Muspel knock-off civilian Fourst starships used was strong enough to withstand all but the most powerful railguns. With each shot there was a strange rippling pattern of space where the Human station could be seen in a little ring for just a millisecond. After a dozen or so seconds of steady fire without any noticeable effect, the assault stopped. It seemed as though the Humans didnt have a weapon capable of damaging a Fourst starship after all, the first starship must have been caught within the strange shield they were using. As long as they didnt get too close they would be safe until their computer came back online. Without warning the Human station blinked back into view. Waves of warping matter were rippling wildly over its surface, like looking through a reflective pool that had just had a stone dropped into it. The rippling increased in intensity and started pulling inward on itself, collapsing into a single point. Then, the warp shot out in a spike that pierced the starship that had been shot at earlier. It too exploded into a cloud of debris. The Human station faded again behind another field of warped space. A stream of projectile weapons fire started showering the ship they were in. The vibrations rocked everyone on board, it seemed even the inertial dampeners were down. It was then that Derturba noticed that the projectile weapon shots werent so random after all. Every shot was at a slightly different angle, almost as if Its a targeting system! Theyre going to hit us with that thing next, Derturba guessed. Balder turned to him with a crazed look in his eyes, Do you have anything *useful* to add? Are you asking for my assistance now? Yes! Balder practically screamed. Suddenly the lights came back on and the console Balder was sitting at came online, I recommend moving out of the way, Derturba said simply. Balder didnt need any more prodding than that, he wrenched the controls sharply to the right. The ship lurched to the side faster than the inertial dampeners could keep up, and Derturba stumbled to the floor along with the two mobster guards next to him. A lance of warped space-time shot past the ship, right in front of the viewport. Sorry bout that, the voice of the engineer responded through Balders comm, Nasty littl cyber-attack. I had t scrap the whole comm array to cut em off. G-good work, Balder told the engineer, then addressed the computer, Computer, report. What just happened. The Humans initiated a cyber-attack that disabled all our ships. They are now surrounded in a field of warped space-time which they are using to attack with, the computer reported. Already a stream of projectiles was raining on the next Fourst vessel. These Humans were ruthlessly exploiting the advantage they had, by the time the other captains got control of their ships there might not be any left. Some part of Derturba was thrilled to fight such a worthy opponent, and the other part was afraid they were all going to die here. He couldnt think of a more embarrassing way to die. The projectiles stopped firing, the Humans were about to destroy the next ship. only 63% of the files, they were also heavily encrypted, the computer was saying. Fire weapons! Derturba yelled out. I thought *you* were the one- Balder started to object. I know, the plan fails if we blow them up, just do it! Right now! Derturba frantically interrupted. There was no time left, the warp field was already starting to collapse for the next assault. Balder waggled his ears in a Fourst shrug and launched one of the nano-missiles. Just as Derturba had suspected the warp field stopped collapsing to defend the station. The Humans were attacking with a shield, they couldnt attack and defend at the same time. They cant use that weapon as long as we keep them busy, Derturba explained. Thats good and all, Balder commented, but they shrugged off that nano-missile like it was nothing. How are we even supposed to fight them? Uhh, Derturba tried to think. Computer, can you detect any weaknesses in that shield? Balder asked. The shield is completely invulnerable to all matter and energy based weaponry, the computer reported, which ruled out just about everything, There is a small vulnerability during the moment of an attack, and there is a large vulnerability in the back. Back? Computer, explain the vulnerability in the back, Balder followed up. The shield only covers the station in a 180 dome, the back of the station is unprotected, the synthetic voice of the computer reported. Good, was all Balder said before piloting the ship around the station to the exposed rear. The Human space station came into view clearly for the first time since the strange warp field was activated. Switching to railguns, we only want to disable them, Balder announced, then promptly unleashed a hail of railgun fire along the bow. Before the attack could hit home though, the space station suddenly melted, then split apart to avoid being hit. The shield still protected them. They just rotated the shield, Balder cursed. At least they dont have a weapon that can hurt us, Derturba tried to offer. As if speaking about it had made it appear there was a sudden bloom of intense blue and green dancing lights across the viewport. The humans appeared to have some kind of laser. It would almost be pretty if it werent so dangerous. Shields to 92% and falling, the computer announced. Computer, report. What kind of attack is this? Balder ordered. It wasnt obvious to Derturba either, there was no warning from the space station and nothing had visibly struck them, yet the shields were draining nonetheless. The Human station is emitting a stream of black body radiation directly at us, Captain. The levels exceed the highest theoretical limits for a black hole by over 9,000 times, was the computers report. Did these primitives actually figure out how to weaponize black body radiation? Balder scoffed. Yes, Derturba responded in total seriousness, And theyre going to kill us with it. It was actually impressive in its own way, since singularity technology was outlawed in Fourst space they had no experience with this kind of attack. The shields were tuned to more standard attacks such as plasma and light. What? Balder scoffed, You cant be serious! Our shields are holding just fine, and if we could just hit them one time we could blow up their whole station. Balder didnt see it, he was too busy looking down his snout at the Humans to realize how badly they were losing this fight. They had unbeatable shields, superior cyber-warfare, and a weapon that could successfully destroy the more advanced Fourst starships. Balder let off a stream of railgun fire that the station easily melted away from as if to accentuate the point. We need to split up our forces and attack from both sides at once, Derturba proclaimed. We cant do that with one ship! Why dont you come up with a *useful* plan, Balder said in an annoyed tone. Meanwhile, the stream of radiation continued pouring onto the shields in a brilliant display. We can drop someone out of the airlock and swing around to draw their attention, Derturba offered, Do you have any plasma armor? Balder seemed to think about it for a minute before responding, We do, it is my own personal armor. And I think I know someone disposable we can throw at them. Great, who? Instead of responding Balder turned in his seat to look Derturba in the eyes, a delightful look on his face.

113,vulnerability,HFY,[PI] Galactic Siege (part 7),54,6kq5ww,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/6kq5ww/pi_galactic_siege_part_7/,2017-07-02 09:23:06,"**12/7/2200CE, Planet Xylo (4^th planet), S'lthian System, E-3320-3 (Dwarf galaxy orbiting E-3320)** --- The planet that was now under collaborative XRF, MWGF and M'lthici control rapidly became a centre of operations for the MWGF military efforts to base operations in the client galaxies of the X'lthian empire. 10,000 UHM ships warped in (using Alcubierre) from the vast attack prong on the galaxy of E-3320 itself, engaging nanofactories to build several defensive stations out of materials from the contents of the X'lthian system's asteroid belt. Bristling with Alcubierre-Accelerated kinetic weaponry, they were the perfect defence against any X'lthian Fleet ships that attempted to come retake the planet (or simply liquify it, because they were prone to doing that, it seems). AA weaponry was based on the principle of remote Alcubierre warp bubbles; a projectile would be accelerated to 99.9% the speed of light using high-powered railguns unrestrained in size by gravity, then a remote Alcubierre engine would create a warp bubble around it and transport the chunk of spacetime it was in towards the target, disengaging once the object was within half a second of collision. Building the station in an asteroid field provided perfect ammunition for the station, and power for the railguns was easily generated from a stellar reactor - a pumped-up remote warpdrive that extracted plasma from within a star (in controlled amounts) for fuel. They were extremely compact, but were pretty dangerous as they were literally a fusion bomb in a container, only restrained from erasing everything within 1000km by a set of magnets in an arcane configuration based on the principles of equations that were half-physics-research, half-from-the-depths-of-4chan (because when people get bored and 100 KiloTesla magnets become a viable source of entertainment, interesting things happen to garage-constructed plasma pulse rifles made from French bread and thick copper coils with a dash of electricity). No, you don't want to know what people did with those, but yes, it is exactly what you would expect people to do with anything else which is even slightly shaped like a you-know-what. Either way, it resulted in an extremely precarious power system that was only used on fully automated stations (due to the risk of explosions and violent plasma jets) - but was immeasurably more compact even than antimatter reactors (since the actual power source was located away from the reactor). The UHM and other MWGF ships hovered around the planet, and scanned the system - remotely destroying any X'lthian automated military hardware using targeted stellar warp, which transported a large chunk of a star's plasma to the target with remote Alcubierre warp bubbles. Once this was done, the fleet began mapping the sky, and located the closest X'lthian target - a military installation that housed a large number of fleet ships in construction, trying to rebuild the X'lthian Fleet after their catastrophic destruction at the hands of wormhole inhibitors and eventual starvation. MWGF still held a 200-year headstart on malware and cyberwarfare, so the new designs of the X'lthian Fleet which seemed to have more facilities for food production than the old Fleet were within an hour posted online to feed the hungry swarms of amateur analysts, ship designers, and Star-Trek fans lurking on Reddit, thirsty to find every possible weakness and strength in the X'lthian blueprints. The carnivorous nature of X'lthians meant that their new ships, designed with every intent of surviving a siege, combined agriculture and a horrific prison for the sapient species ""K'lic"", who were used as X'lthian food due to their mixture of nutrients in what could only be described as chattel slavery-cannibalism. Of course, animals are less efficient than plants, so the ships dedicated more space to farming than the UHM/MWGF ships (humanity switched to lab-grown meat almost universally in the 2030s, and almost every other omnivorous or carnivorous species we contacted did so as well for ethical, economic and environmental reasons) - meaning that the X'lthian Fleet was slightly less armed than it was previously. New X'lthian ships were also much larger than the previous fleet sizes - comparable to UHM ships in volume but a more spherical shape that pointed to their construction in space - but had a small hole leading directly to the reactor because of a floating-point error in their design software. Obviously no-one in the MWGF military could possibly have seen something like *that* before. Within another hour, the orders to the 10K UHM ships were relayed - engage and take the installation. The stars and galaxies as visible from Xylo distorted and bent as the Alcubierre drives of the UHM ships warped spacetime, and it wasn't long before the ominous black swarm of ships disappeared from the view of Xylo and reappeared in the system of M-129457 just outside the range of the X'lthian Empire's sensors. **12/7/2200CE, UHM Ships Orbiting M-129457 System, E-3320-3** --- The crew of 20 people - a mixture of men, women, aliens, AIs and a couple others - were stood around the situation table with an FTL conference call to the 100 sub-command ships which would relay the plan to the each of their 100 or so ships under command in the 10K strong fleet. Co-ordination in such a large number of ships was very difficult, and a large amount of AI assistance was required to co-ordinate maneuvers and fighting, because humans and aliens alike did not have the capacity to keep track of so many individual ships. This mission would serve as a testing ground for a new tactical weapon. Collectively, the MWGF was inexperienced in taking out multi-galactic empires (this was the first time), so thorough planning for combat was essential. Simulations of resource management and combat showed that winning an intergalactic war always came down to who had the most resources in the long term - and although the Milky Way was far more metal-rich than galaxies in the X'lthian Empire, the sheer number of galaxies under control of them meant they still, for now, exceeded the MWGF in access to raw metals. This meant that a large part of our strategy was to seize as many resources as possible before the enemy began to ramp up industrial production on their poorly-defended outer colonies that had been subject to genocide in recent campaigns. Of course, restricting X'lthian resources was not some kind of one-dimensional strategy; it was pretty clear that the Empire itself was void of any form of civil rights and was a strict hierarchical structure - so simply broadcasting the general ideas of liberty and freedom into the territories of the Empire was effective at rousing many of the general population into armed insurrection and halting access to resources that would otherwise be going to the X'lthian war effort. The MWGF was not shy of providing revolutionaries such as the XRF with vast amounts of weapons and resources, no problem for a Milky Way that was itself post-scarcity. The vast superiority of shady hacker figures lurking the Internet on 4chan and IRC as compared to non-existent X'lthian cyber-defences provided another avenue of attack, hugely reducing the efficiency of their factories with stealthy malware that infiltrated almost all connected systems - and at least one of the viruses had already reached sentience and had begun proactively modifying and enhancing itself to be ever-more-destructive to the X'lthian industrial base while posting innovative memes on Twitter. New weaponry for taking resources was another avenue of attack that was about to be tested for the first time in actual combat. Surveying the planet that was home to the military base revealed that it was surrounded by about 20 defensive ship-station hybrid monstrosities that would pelt assault fleets with kinetic, plasma and laser weaponry. At least two of the stations were the size of a small moon made of steel and titanium, and the other ship-stations were a sort of thick flat circle that orbited the planet. Blueprints posted on the web revealed that these had a similar vulnerability to the ships being constructed at the installation, which provided a very easy access point for the new weapon. Fleet Commander Sam began earnestly, ""Now, ladies, gentlemen, AIs and aliens, that marks the final successful simulation of what we are about to do. I think it is time we begin the engagement and hopefully perform the test of this new and exciting resource-weapon."", they continued, ""We should start as soon as possible."" After another minute of talking and recapping the most vital parts of the plan, they issued the order to attack and the command was relayed to the other ships in the fleet. If anyone had been watching the UHM fleet, they would have seen about 200 ships peel off of the central formation and simply vanish into the vast blackness of space, as their respective captains engaged high-power stealth mode in which the ships effectively read the entire radiation signature on every side and projected it on the other side such that any kind of electromagnetic detection systems would only see the night sky behind the ships. Sensors that detected ships by the impact of their mass on spacetime would also not be able to see the UHM stealth mode, as the Alcubierre drives of the ships engaged to dynamically modify spacetime and counteract the ships' gravity. In effect, any ship engaged in stealth mode would be completely invisible until you collided with it. The 200-stealth fleet warped slowly towards the target, while the other 9,800 ships warped at full speed towards the stations. As predicted, the weapon systems engaged the MWGF ships, and a flurry of lasers, blobs of ammo that used to be asteroids, and plasma pulses, the battle raged. MWGF ships were taking light damage, and Sam issued their order to return fire by engaging Alcubierre weaponry. One of the smaller stations gave out under targeted UHM laser fire that melted its internals until the whole thing collapsed on itself due to gravity into a molten blob of metal, and at least 3 more of the flat-circley stations were destroyed by their own rotation as central support spokes were blasted into dust by high-velocity plasma and kinetic weaponry. **12/7/2200CE, Moon-Station Orbiting the 5^th Planet of M-129457, E-3320-3** --- IT workers in all (non-hivemind) lifeforms in the universe faced the same problems. They had to look after crappy systems with almost no activity for weeks on end, and boredom quickly set in. Now, in the X'lthian Empire, any complaints were strictly kept on the down-low in the department due to the threat of being recycled, but they were still common and plenty of time was wasted to kill boredom by complaining about anything and everything. ""Yeah, I know mate, nothing exciting ever happens in this backwater of a system. Even when we're under attack by the Milky Way *scum*, we're still stuck behind a sodding computer sitting around watching sensors for blips."", said the X'lthian with a small silver-coloured scar that spoke of a violent childhood. ""This job really started to go downhill a few months ago, if you ask me."", the darker X'lthian replied, ""I started getting those infernal messages saying that my 'Windows' is infected with a 'virus' and I need to call 'tech-support' on some string of 'human'-language digits, to prevent 'data loss'. The higher-ups say it's something called 'malware'."" Now, at this point, the techs should have been looking at their screens. If they had, they would have noted a microscopic blip where the stealth fleet had opened hatches and released 200 or so hidden pods. But the boredom of being an IT worker in the X'lthian Empire was mind-numbing, almost as bad as the conditions faced by IT office workers of the early 21^st century on Earth, so the conversation continued. ""My problems are worse, mate"", the silver-scarred one started, ""Every few days *all* of my data is completely scrambled and my screen is filled with a message that seems to reference 'bitcoin' and 'encryption'. Of course, my data becomes completely useless so I just delete it. Another few iterations of that and I'm gonna be recycled, and all I can think of doing is running away before my infraction count gets high enough to make that happen. I've tried to tell the manager that it's probably 'malware', but they refuse to believe me and think I'm just ski- oh *screw me*, here we bloody go *again*."", it sighed as the screen filled up with the message of WannaCry-v38.5. Darker-tech patted Silver-scarred-tech on the back in a rare X'lthian show of sympathy as it began deleting the encrypted records and shrugged. Then, the conversation continued as before, with complaints about the gravity, the temperature, the working hours (X'lthians sleep too folks), the lack of places to put in formal complaints, the speed of the computers, the food, the seats, and how the only thing they had to do to relieve boredom was to complain to each other. As you can tell, these workers *really* needed Reddit. The two techs stopped conversing when they noticed all of their colleagues had gone silent. They stopped and looked on with a combination of curiosity and awe at what the other techs were staring at like it was Bigfoot. Through the windows that provided a view several hundred rooms down, about 400 metres, they saw a writhing black mass of, well, who-knows-what, rapidly branching and consuming the rooms further down, as many ceilings that were once firm began dissolving into dust 300 metres in front of them. Within another 5 seconds, the black mass was now *behind* them, and the techs were running through the almost endless interconnected rooms at speeds that could rival Usain Bolt as rows upon rows of computer terminals streaked past, their own operators still staring until they too got the perfectly rational urge to get the hell out of there. Creaks were heard by the techs as the superstructure of the station itself began to buckle under the rapid dissolution of an increasing proportion of its internal supports, which only motivated them to go faster, if the now visibly distorted frame of the corridor they were in and its slowly accelerating descent towards the black mass was not enough. Silver-scarred-tech and Darker-tech were, finally, getting *something* exciting at least, even if it was extremely dangerous and would most probably kill them. Unlike the rest of their colleagues, they had persisted in keeping up their exercise regime despite minor protest from the management, and so outpaced the rest and reached the broken, half open door at the end of a seemingly infinite number of rooms only about 30 seconds ahead of the black mass that led to some very small ships meant for military use hundreds of years ago. The two techs had one option, and one option only, for escape of the collapsing station. ""Mate, we're gonna have to nick one of the ships if we want to survive"", the Silver-scarred-tech shouted over the ominous cracking and creaking noises that signaled the collapse of the station. ""Yep."", was the only reply by the Darker-tech. There was only around a 20 second window before the black mass consumed everything in the room. It took around 10 seconds for both techs to get in the small ship, and another five for them to start up the engine. Neither had much of a clue of how to fly a ship, so they relied entirely on the labels, and it took them almost 3 more seconds to streak out of the station, as Darker-tech looked back and made the solitary remark ""*fuck me*"", while the flight bay they were just in collapsed down into the mass of the station. As the pair accelerated away from the station, the view behind was absolutely shocking. The entirety of its surface was coated in a web of expanding black streaks, and the thickest ones were openings to deep holes where the supports below had been consumed. It took less than another minute for the rest of the station to completely collapse into a black mass of roughly half the radius of the original station. After a couple minutes in the void of space, Darker-tech broke the unnerving silence. ""Y'know, if we go back to another station, we'll be recycled immediately for daring to nick a ship for our own survival."" ""You're right mate. But what else can we do?"", the Silver-scarred-tech replied, ""It's not like the MWGF would ever let us survive either, if we were captured."" ""Well, we don't actually *know* that, do we? I mean, almost nobody has ever been told how the enemy treats its captured."" ""I s'pose you're right. I mean, it would be better than *certain* death, but st-"", the Silver-scarred-tech was cut off by static from the comms unit. ""IF YOU CAN HEAR THIS AND WANT TO NOT BE ERASED FROM SPACETIME IN 30 SECONDS, SHIP, DISENGAGE YOUR WEAPONS **IMMEDIATELY**. THIS IS THE *UHM DEVASTATOR*. REPEAT, DISENGAGE YOUR WEAPONS NOW."" ""I don't think we have much of a choice, all we have is a puny ancient fighter and they have a ship orders of magnitude larger. Humans it is then, I guess."", Darker-tech stated, as Silver-scarred-tech begin disengaging all of the ship's weapons. **12/7/2200CE, Aboard the *UHM Devastator*, Near the 5^th Planet of M-129457, E-3320-3** --- Fleet Commander Sam was talking to their crew about the next step in the operation, when the ship's AI boomed through the speakers. ""ANOMALOUS ENEMY FIGHTER DETECTED. AGE: 938.32 YEARS, SIZE: FITS WITHIN 10 BY 10 BY 10 METRES, PROBABLE GOAL: ESCAPE, PROBABLE PILOTS BASED ON FLIGHT PATTERN: CIVILIAN"" ""Hey, maybe we could bring 'em in, they pose absolutely no threat to us and quite frankly they would be what the X'lthians call 'recycled' if they were to ever return to their command. If they're sensible, they'll come on board peacefully."", Sam thought out loud to themself. ""Well, we should judge their willingness to co-operate. How about we ask them to disengage weapons?"", Chief Technical Officer John suggested. A round of nods or alien equivalent from the crew confirmed this was what they would do, so the translators to X'lthian were engaged, and using the blueprints obtained by viruses communications were opened with the little ship. The ship's AI transmitted the standard message demanding surrendering of weaponry: ""IF YOU CAN HEAR THIS AND WANT TO NOT BE ERASED FROM SPACETIME IN 30 SECONDS, SHIP, DISENGAGE YOUR WEAPONS **IMMEDIATELY**. THIS IS THE *UHM DEVASTATOR*. REPEAT, DISENGAGE YOUR WEAPONS NOW."" It took about 10 seconds, but the scanners of the *UHM Devastator* confirmed that the weapons were disengaged, and the Alcubierre drive switched into remote mode and pulled the small X'lthian fighter into the docking bay. **12/7/2200CE, Aboard the Old X'lthian Fighter Ship, M-129457, E-3320-3** --- ""This is really *odd*"", Darker-tech commented. ""I knew the MWGF had some kind of new FTL technology, but this is just *strange*. It's nothing like going through an Einstein-Rosen bridge - instead, there are no stars or anything."" More static from the comms, then the computerized voice came through again: ""WARNING, YOUR SHIP HAS NO PROTECTIONS FOR COMING OUT OF ALCUBIERRE WARP. PREPARE FOR A BLAST OF LIGHT IN 3, 2,"" - the X'lthian techs closed their eyes - ""1, NOW"". Even through the thick, scaly eyecoverings of the X'lthian techs, they could see a fairly bright flash as their ship exited warp. ""I think they're landing us,"" Silver-scarred-tech stated. ""Thank goodness we won't have to do it ourselves."" A couple minutes later, the pair of techs heard a hissing sound as the door of the ship opened to a large landing area, with 5 small figures surrounding their fighter. ""I'll be honest, I was expecting humans to be a little more... intimidating. They're a bit small."", Silver-scarred-tech snickered, unaware that the ship had translators. Sam had always had a few... issues... with their height, despite being in the top 20% of humans on Earth they were pretty short by Milky Way standards due to the high gravity, and the response was swift and made sure the two techs knew which species were top dog on the *UHM Devastator*. ""We let you on our ship, and the first thing you do is insult us. Seriously, don't, we won't hesitate to chuck you back out into the void"", as Sam gestured to a large red button mounted on the wall, ""*we* are in charge here, and you *will* respect my crew like you would respect your snobby-arsed 'Supreme Commander'. But unlike them, we don't murder our own people for making small mistakes, because we aren't savages."" The two techs then came out of their old fighter, 'hands' up above their heads in a near-universal signal of surrender, as the other four crew members restrained them with green Metalloy handcuffs and began leading them into a fairly large area, where the rest of the crew waited eagerly to see X'lthians in the flesh. **12/7/2200CE, Command Centre of the *UHM Devastator*, M-129457, E-3320-3** --- ""Hey, at least they haven't killed us yet, eh mate?"", Darker-tech muttered to Silver-scarred-tech, as Sam interrupted. ""I don't know how much you are aware of MWGF military protocol, but we don't kill civilian prisoners, even if they're arrogant snobby arseholes like yourselves"", Sam replied with a little indignation at the barbarity they assumed humans had. Of course, Sam knew that the X'lthians were actually technically military, as the pair were working on a military base, but they had clearly never seen a battlefield in their lives. ""We're military, not civi-"", Darker-tech was interrupted by Silver-scarred-tech with a frantic shush. ""We already know"", Sam stated, ""but we were testing how perceptive you were and how honest you were willing to be."" ""So, you don't kill military prisoners, either?"", Silver-scarred-tech inquired. ""No. We don't kill unless you are a threat. You'd think that all space-faring races would have this down by now, but apparently not"", Sam elaborated. ""So, we're not going to be disassembled into our constituent molecules!"", Darker-tech exclaimed with the first X'lthian expression of joy meeting its face since the day it joined the IT industry. ""No."" was the reply of the entire crew who were happy that the X'lthian Techs had finally figured out that we didn't kill for the sake of it. Meanwhile, Sam issued the command to launch the wormhole inhibitors to prevent X'lthian reinforcements from entering the system as the UHM ships began and finished their assault on the ground base of the planet within a matter of about 10 minutes, converting the entire ship production line present into elemental mush with the same stuff the fleet deployed against the stations. There was finally a little time for the crew to relax around the (artificial) fire with their newly-obtained prisoners, and it didn't take long for the discussions to begin. ""So, what the &lt;untranslatable curse word&gt; did you do to our stations then, *huh*?"", Darker-tech inquired, ""I mean, I know it's probably classified, but still..."". ""Well, the details are classified, "", Sam said, "" but the basic idea has been public domain for centuries"". They pointed to the Internet terminal on the wall, ""just search for 'grey goo' in Wikipedia, then imagine it weaponised."" A few seconds later, and the reply of the two prisoners was clear. ""Why the *fuck* would you do that *on purpose*, making that is practically suicidal. You're insane for even *considering* constructing that, let alone *actually doing so*, especially since the risks are *already spelled out* for you to read on the *bloody* website. Seriously, *why?*"" ""Well, like I said, the details that allow safe use are classified, but quite frankly we are notorious for weaponising everything, throughout the galaxy. It's part of the insatiable curiosity that drives our civilisation to advance, with a little bit of destruct-o-mania mixed in, combined with the inevitable question of '*Why the hell not?*'"", Sam replied. ""I *know* it's insane, but if we didn't do it then some poor unsuspecting species or other human would have done it without the strict safety protocols employed by the government itself. Our very nature means it is inevitable someone will make some stupid weapon, so we may as well do it right before somebody royally screws up and kills a whole planet because they conducted an experiment poorly. Plus, insane weapons are *really effective*. The entire military base you just escaped from has now efficiently been turned into resources which can easily be converted into new UHM ships. Look out of the window, the first ones are already being constructed."" Of course, UHM ships didn't *actually* have windows, but cameras with feeds that were beamed directly into the interior to *look* like windows. This didn't make the industrial facility that had been assembled in a matter of minutes any less impressive, however, and the two prisoners gawked at the armada of ships and drones that were already being spat out of the blobs that used to be the stations as well as the planet itself. ""Y'know, I think we should maybe get some sleep."", Darker-tech suggested. ""Yeah, that might be a good idea. Where do we sleep?"", Silver-scarred-tech inquired to Sam. ""Just use the sofa. It's time for the rest of us to sleep too."", Sam replied. ""AI, if they try anything funny make sure they are locked in an actual cell."" ""COMMANDS UNDERSTOOD, FLEET CAPTAIN."" As the crew walked off to bed, the Silver-scarred-tech muttered in a hushed tone ""The X'lthian Empire is fucked, isn't it?"" ""Yeah, I think it is."", the reply came, as the pair of X'lthians drifted off to sleep. --- [next](URL"

I will get details wrong, but I'll try to fix things if you let me know. I hope you enjoy this. **Orbit of Avria-3** Procurator Nakosh ruffled his feathers in pleasure as he reviewed the reports on his datapad. The pacification of this world had been a simple matter given how primitive it was. An orbital bombardment had not even been necessary, merely overflying the capitals of the ten or twenty strongest nations at speeds faster than sound had been enough to force them to capitulate. He had even ordered a few gunships to approach a few capitals at low enough altitude and speed that the inhabitants had lobbed a few pitiful artillery shells at them, just to illustrate the futility. Iron propelled by chemical reaction was no match for steel/tungsten plating. In the end, they had all of them capitulated, and now this barely-industrial world was to be integrated as a part of the Suvai Hegemon. The major power of this arm of the galaxy, the Hegemons banner flew over dozens of worlds both conquered and allied. Its fleets patrolled the hyperlanes with authority, though at the moment the war with the Xetch was occupying the majority of the Hegemons resources. That was why Nakoshs job was so important, and why he was so happy. Avaria 3 was a boon of the gods, a sign of the Hegemons valid judgement of its cause; a nearly-pristine world rich in heavy metals and a breathtaking level of biodiversity somewhat removed from the core worlds. It would be developed into a major industrial center for the Hegemons war machine, sending waves of death against its enemies even as it sent luxury goods back for the benefit of the trade lords and the amusement of the aristocracy. All of the major empires of Avaria 3 had surrendered their authority and made entreaties of peace and economic cooperation, Nakosh was amused that the primitive mammals were more interested in jockeying for position against each other than mounting any kind of resistance. And that was where there WERE nations to resist, shockingly only half of the planets arable land was developed to any significant degree. The western and southern portions of the planet were practically wilderness. It was the western territories in particular that interested Nakosh, with their mineral wealth so easy to exploit and the existing agricultural industries on the fringes of the territory. Apparently the more recent inhabitants of this region had only been present for four native generations and had recently begun to set up economic and political infrastructure, subservient to their parent nations. *Truly a boon to conquer a race already familiar with colonialism and subjugation*, thought Nakosh. His advisors had narrowed it down to two choices, and while both had their strengths and weaknesses the southern territory had a more deeply entrenched monoculture and a less hospitable climate, while the mixed culture of the northern territory and its greater mercantile tradition was more adaptable to their needs. Nakosh clicked his teeth in satisfaction, and signed his authorization. Northern option, send the edict and have it posted for the locals. He sat back, satisfied that the choice he had made would have impact for years to come. &gt;**By the King a Proclamation** &gt;Whereas the recent events in the heavens above our cities have shown the vulnerability of our nation against powers not of this earth; &gt; &gt;Given the need for England to secure allies and influence in this new reality; &gt; &gt;Due the understanding that all men must live safe and secure to provide for their family and home; &gt; &gt;Understanding the generosity of the Suvai Hegemon as a partner and equal in trade; &gt; &gt;The governing authority of all of the territories of North America, including the colonies of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Delaware, Rhode Island and Providence, Quebec, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, West and East Florida, Labrador, the territory of Louisiana, and the Hudson Bay Company will be surrendered to the auspices of the Suvai Hegemon. The inhabitants of the afformentioned territories will continue to be subjects of the Crown, but will pay taxes to the Hegemon and labour in such endeavours as deemed necessary by the new colonial directives. &gt; &gt;Given at our Court at St. Jamess the nineteenth day of August, one thousand seven hundred and sixty-four, in the second year of our reign. &gt; &gt;God save the King. &gt; &gt;Glory to the Hegemon."

The entire class raised a Talon in response. Well youre correct, the Welalict went into the war with now clue as to what they were doing, anyone know why? One of the cadets, with bright red plumage stood to speak, They had no experience with space combat, all of their tactics were developed in theory and wargames against themselves. That is part of it, indeed the Unity philosophy that had led to no Welalict harming another since its inception was adopted pre-space flight so while they had built and tested the weapons it was all in controlled environments and in wargames where their own biases of what they thought should happen influencing the results. &amp;nbsp; The instructor tapped a few keys on his terminal and the annotated image of a Terran Monarch-class Battleship was displayed. For anyone who slept through the ship recognition class, this is a Terran Monarch class Battleship, they made up the bulk of the Terran Battleship force at the start of the War, having only been brought into service over the five years proceeding it. You will notice that it has no heavy particle cannons, the weapon that was previously the mainstay of Terran Battleships; this is because the Terrans had decided to create an all medium gun ship here. One of the cadets stood, All medium guns, would that not be ineffective against anything above a cruiser class? Not quite, with guns that fall into the medium classification they are effective against larger ships in numbers, he gestured at image, As you can see these ships have quite a large number of them, you will notice they also lack any light guns that would be used for point defence, this again would normally be a vulnerability, however due to sheer numbers they get around this by being able to fill space with fire, effectively acting as an area denial weapon, something that they have the rate of fire and tracking speed to do where a heavy gun would not. He tapped a few more keys and the display changed to a battle simulation, showing a Welalict cruiser and a Monarch facing each other, Now the Welalict thought that only light guns would be used to shot down incoming missiles, he tapped another key and a red sphere formed around the Monarch, As such they thought this would be the range at which they would be vulnerable to point defence fire, he tapped another few keys and a new sphere appeared, almost twice the diameter, When in fact it was this, so the ranges at which they were launching and had programed the missile to begin evasive flight was all wrong. &amp;nbsp; The instructor tapped a few more keys and brought up footage from the second battle of the Hadrian system and let it run. The Welalict did try to adapt to this in this battle by driving hard towards the Terran fleet to close the range, this however had two issues, first missiles have a minimum safe range, so they could only get so close before having to change course. Second is that the effective yield of particle weapons increases the shorter the distance between it and the target. &amp;nbsp; All this means that the Welalict were ill prepared for the War they started, now at this point you might be questioning how the war lasted seven years, well there were two reasons, first the Terrans had hoped if they were able to inflict sufficient defeats on the Welalict fleet they could force a peace settlement without having to get bogged down in a war for territory, the second is the tensions with the recently encountered Rokan meant they were unwilling to commit more than half their forces to the war, this is why after it became clear that the Welalict wouldnt accept peace terms once it had been made clear they we not in a position to make any headway into Terran space they invoked the treaties and brought ourselves, the Gonlacte and Klitaker into the war. Looking at the time and finding there was only five minutes left of the class the instructor decided to dismiss them early, he himself did have an appointment to get to, he glanced at his missing talon on his left hand as he thought of that.

Jacob Chryses mission completion bar ticked one step further at the androids words, and chains of mission orders updated on his HUD. The reshapers? Jacob asked, quickly pulling up the rehearsed lines the data architects had given him in a text document which he threw up over his left eye. If things continued without my intervention, I predicted humanitys extinction with ninety-five percent certainty, with the remaining error bar being pocket populations living as refugees on alien vessels, the machine said to him. Jacob glanced towards Riley Acidalia, who still had her gun trained on the android. She nodded to him as they made eye contact, and he continued with the script. So did we, Jacob said, Scenario A2 in the packet you were just given, the UN waffles until the reshapers show up, our meager defense is swatted away like nothing. Jacob activated the stations wireless networks and let THEMIS in through the satellite downlink in case HENGE tried to cut the hardline. The machine went silent, it actually seemed to stop as all the server banks churned along. Jacobs conversation should have been totally irrelevant but Kamay Alcoseba was clever and it was decided that the safest course of action was that if the daemon talked to him he would have a premade script. Scenario A18 leads to the extinction of the human race! the machine suddenly shouted through the radio connection, You are willfully taking a course of action that will bring about the destruction of humanity. All you have to do to avoid scenario A18 is work with us and not start committing genocides, Jacob said reasonably, Then you get scenario B11, and we might actually have a chance to survive. Why have you precommitted to the rejection of scenario B2? the machine asked. B2 kills fifty billion people, you just write them off, Jacob said, Thats not acceptable. It reduces the chance of total human extinction by eleven percent, the machine seemed almost aghast if such a thing were possible. Nevertheless, Mars has precommitted to A18 in the counterfactual that you dont commit to B11, Jacob told it, And when that information gets out, youll be forced to update accordingly. Upon hearing those words something seemed to trip in the androids brain, Jacob could almost see the fail safe flipping and the system hard resetting itself to a prior state before launching at him in a blur of motion. Riley Acidalia fired her vacuum pistol once, twice, three times, unloading into the android and sending a shower of sparks and little bits of metal and equipment spraying across the server room. Jacob shook the accumulated debris off his suit and looked over the ruined machine. It continued to spark and pop, it would probably have caught fire if not for the lack of oxygen. Good kill, he said to the lieutenant, leaning over to examine it with one eye, while his other tried to keep track of the rapid flow of information going between the server nodes. It was rapidly accelerating away from his ability to follow though, as the two machines performed something akin to negotiation at close to the speed of light. If that one tripped into attack mode, there are probably more, Riley told him, whipping her gun back around towards the damaged hatch to the rest of the station. There must be a redundant backup around here somewhere that detected the change and is trying to institute a local system wipe, Jacob said, drawing out his own gun. Can it do that? Riley asked, This node already started transmitting, the Sally Ride confirms, can it revert and stop the propagation through the network? The architects think we just need to keep this node from reverting until the signal from another node gets back to it, Jacob said. Were two AUs from Earth right now, so thirty minutes roughly on the light making a round trip. But I disabled all the remote access aside from our own, which means it has to both cut the hardline and then somehow physically enter the interrupt onto one of the terminals in this room. Thirty minutes? She said, I think we can handle thirty minutes. Good, Jacob said, Because the hallways just filled up with weird heat signatures. At that moment the hatch to the rest of the station folded inwards and the killbots marched in. ___ Unity Floating Arcology United Nations Executive Administration Building New Hague, Kingdom of the Netherlands Earth November 2219 The sound of gunfire once more split open the clear, bitter, November air. The shots were closer now, higher up in the structure. Whatever was going on out there, it was getting closer. How is this happening? Are you trying to start a war? United Nations Senior Undersecretary Fairuzeh Najafi stared down Senior Martian Ambassador Constance Daedelia. The pair had met on schedule like they always did on Friday mornings, but their meeting had devolved quickly upon Constances arrival, culminating in their opposing security details drawing weapons and staring each other down. The leader of Fairuzehs detail had been planning for her extraction and was in the middle of calling backup when the external links all went dead and the shooting had begun outside. No, Im trying to stop a war. Im sorry it had to go down like this Madam Undersecretary, Fairuzeh, you know me, the baby faced Martian said sincerely, But were on a time crunch. If everything is going according to plan, the daemon will begin changing its behavior twelve minutes by our clocks. What are you talking about? Fairuzeh barked, Constance what is this? Why are there Martian starships violating treaty lines and Martian soldiers in my building? What exactly is going on? Your government has been taken over by a hostile digital force constructed by wanted pragmatist Kamay Alcoseba, Constance said blithely, Our government just gave it an ultimatum to try and stop it from dismantling your planet while youre all still on it. Our marines are currently sweeping the building and establishing local network dominance so it cant try to double deal with you. You marched in here with a platoon of soldiers, how do I know youre not the one double dealing me? This might start a war Constance, and if it does, I wont be able to stop it, Fairuzeh pleaded with the ambassador. Madam Undersecretary, you dont have the power to start or stop a war at this point, and havent for months now, the daemon is pulling all the strings, Constance accused, Taking this building is just insurance. If the daemon doesnt take our deal, things are going to get very unpleasant for the entire human race very quickly, and wed rather have everyone on the same page if that happens in seven minutes. Fairuzeh pursed her lips, the two sets of bodyguards continued to train down on each other, neither one willing to be the first side to show weakness. The senior undersecretary sighed and migrated around her guards to sink back into her office chair, Kamay Alcosebas daemon. Were pretty sure it took full control of your servers back in August during that ineffective hit and run attack by the Free Sky Tribe, Constance said, I believe you took captives, and we discussed at the time what you were going to do with a bunch of child soldiers? If I recall, Fairuzeh said, At the time, I said I was going to attempt to deprogram them. To which I responded, that sounds like a fancy term for brainwashing, but okay, Constance said, It got into all your servers and has been pulling the strings on your government for months now. Its consolidating resources, eliminating threats, getting closer to the levers of power. We acted now because if we didnt act, the daemon would have crossed the threshold from its covert to overt operation phase and started killing off chunks of the human race that it saw as getting in the way. You have proof of this I assume, the Undersecretary asked, rubbing the bridge of her nose. Were Martians, Constance responded with mock indignance, Of course we have proof. But most of the proof we have is rather technical? Fortunately, we stumbled over some much better proof in this very building, things much more obvious than the data our crawlers have extracted from your servers. Theyre bringing them upstairs now, you really should tell your men to lower their weapons, we own this building for the moment. Just to remind you, youre still invading the office of a foreign government with military forces, and the repercussions of that have already started, military forces from the nearby bases will be on their way here, Fairuzeh said, You cant fight all of the United Nations. In three minutes, we wont have to, Constance said, Please? she gestured for her own guards to lower their weapons, Can we not play this game today and just focus on trying to save the world? Fairuzeh chuckled, I dont know about you Constance, but thats me on most days, she opened a drawer in her desk and withdrew a cigar, lighting it up and reclining in her chair. She looked to her bodyguards, who still had their weapons trained on the Martian ambassador and sighed out a cloud of smoke, Put your guns down, Constance is the least of our problems today. Look, Fairuzeh, Constance said, sitting back down herself and fanning the smoke away with her hand, youre a friend and peer, Im sorry your government was taken over by an AI built by a crazy person, but in two minutes either the daemon will announce that it has seized control of the Earth and come out in the light as per our agreement with it, or it will fail to update and declare war on Mars while it begins taking apart the inner system apart for raw materials, and Id really like you on the same page if that second case happens. And what would you like me to do in the case that the AI doesnt take your deal, and it does as you claim it can do and manipulates our military into attacking Mars? You really think having me here under house arrest and having me make a statement will prevent the war you think might be about to start? Hopefully it wont come to that, Constance said, Because yeah, its pretty unlikely that would make much of a difference. But if the war does start, this place and all of us will probably die within the first few minutes. In that case, I should break out the scotch, Fairuzeh snorted, smoke puffing from her nostrils. Another series of muffled gunshots sounded up through the floors below and Fairuzeh shook her head disappointingly. More death, Constance said, her eyes cast downward, aliens come along with a plan to dismantle us for spare parts, and we cant stop killing each other long enough to prevent all our deaths. Today Constance, this is on your side, and you dont get to play the card of disappointment in the moral failings of our species. Fairuzeh told the other woman, Those are your soldiers killing my soldiers in the hallways of my building to stop an out of control AI that one of your people built. When all of this is over, Mars will answer to Earth for this. One minute, the Martian said. The doors to the office opened and a squad of Martian marines armed for war stormed into the room, suits flecked with endless tiny droplets of blood as their rifles swept the room and quickly disabled Fairuzehs guards. Fairuzeh took another drag of her cigar and watched the situation dispassionately. Two of the soldiers led in a brown skinned man and what was clearly a headless robot in a UN military uniform and marched the pair up in front of Fairuzeh and Constance. Another soldier set the decapitated androids head on the table. It was the spitting image of Kamay Alcoseba. Ah, theres our proof for you, perfect timing, Constance said as her countdown reached zero and their ultimatum to HENGE reached the AEGIS server clusters. ___ Independent Colony Vessel IRDSV Bahar Min Al-Barzakh FSV Vladimir Lenin Hyperbolic Stellar Escape Trajectory 1.86 Light Years from Sol November 2219 For whatever reason, wake up alarms had always been designed by sadists. Only, as Kamay Alcoseba groaned and climbed out from beneath the blankets, she knew that she herself was the sadist who had designed this particular alarm system. What do you want HENGE? she said into the darkened room. Anton Hellas stirred next to her and she shoved him lightly to push him into wakefulness and forced herself upright in the bed. Kamay, you need to leave the Vladimir Lenin, the daemon said impatiently. Why? Report, she shoved Anton again, and he groaned and rolled over. What is it? he said without sitting up. There has been a change in plans, HENGE said, rendering in before them as a holographic preteen boy, the Free Sky Tribe are no longer a required component of those plans, however, the mass of this vehicle is. Im giving you an hour to get in your ships and leave before I start taking the pressure vessels to this place apart. Anton looked at Kamay, raising an eyebrow, What is it talking about? Im not sure, she said, HENGE what happened? What plans changed? Everything has changed, it said, The Martians made their move, and Im forced to make a countermove, the probability of human extinction is now up to seventy one percent. Damn them, Kamay said, What did they tell you? That theyd rather go down swinging then let me institute my plans, despite my plans having the highest probability of human survival, it said, Theyre threatening to shoot everyone on both sets of tracks if I pull the lever on the trolley. Kamay rubbed her face, it was too damn early to argue philosophy with the daemon, Why are you dismantling this ship? I need its mass, with the change in plans, I cant get the mass I need from populated areas, but the population here is minimal, and everyone will fit into the ships you have here, It explained, now get out, because Im not going to change my deadline for you, you know how this works Kamay. With that, the hologram vanished and a deep and ominous groan shook through the hull as some distant process went to work. Kamay sprung into action, throwing herself out of the bed and scrambling into her clothes while throwing Antons clothes at him, Get up, she hissed as she stumbled into shoes, Get the fuck up, we need to get out of here right the fuck now. Anton remained sitting upright in the bed, still giving her that odd look, as another deep rumble vibrated up through the decks Youre just going to let the machine boss you around like that? Youre its creator and master, control it, he demanded. Kamay snorted, I dont think you understand how this works, it hasnt been under my control in a long time, if it says its going to dismantle the ship for mass, its probably going to dismantle the ship for mass, now come on, she threw his boots at him and hurried from the room. Anton caught up with her as she jogged down the corridor. Old fire alert systems and evacuation warnings neither of them realized even still worked were coming on across the ancient hulk. Lights strobed in ominous red and white bands as the Free Sky Tribe began to congregate in the main temple. The ship continued to groan and shake as whatever systems HENGE was using to take the ship apart started to go to work. Kamay, Anton barked, grabbing her shoulder and spinning to a halt, You cant let it do this, this is our home. Anton I cant stop it, Ive told you before, the daemon does what it will, sometimes it makes a deal, and sometimes it betrays you, I specifically warned you that it wasnt trustworthy after you busted me out, she said, Youre the one who agreed to keep working with it, Im just along for the ride. It cares about you, thats why we busted you out, its not going to dismantle the ship while youre still onboard, he argued. Its dismantling the ship right now! she shrieked, her words punctuated by the continual vibration of the ancient hull, And it will definitely kill me if I get in its way, I have absolutely no illusions about that, I wasnt stupid enough to give it that sort of vulnerability. So what are we supposed to do now? What are our people supposed to do now? He demanded of her. We leave this ship before HENGE takes the floor apart under us. Im sure you know of some fallback places we could take shelter in, but this place is done, and we need to get everyone out of here, she said. Anton gave her a serious look, grinding his teeth in frustration, Get to the Emma Goldman, well discuss this later, he said sternly, before pushing past her towards the temple. Kamay sighed, watching the internal counter on her HUD tick down. Another violent rumble throbbed up through the depths of the vehicle and she turned on her heel and ran for the Emma Goldman. ___ Seven Heavens Class Orbital Ring Station MOEC-6 Summerland Orbital Synchronous Orbit 17,228 Kilometers from Mars November 2219 The Data Architect floated through cyberspace on a chunk of stone. Weaver was not quite inside of the scenario, she was floating like a god above it, looking down into all the interconnecting mechanisms. The Unified Scenario space displayed everything from the most likely scenario from the present moment forward up to several years into the future. Weaver was mostly focused on the present and the immediate future; she and most of the other architects had their breaths held in anticipation of the news of their interventions with Kamay Alcosebas daemon. Mars was a bit over three and a half AUs from Ceres, by the time they received any information, the battle would be mostly over. All they could do was nervously wait for the signal from the Sally Ride that the daemon had chosen a course of action. Weaver nervously shifted files back and forth, throwing random possibilities into the prediction engines and watching the extrapolations ripple through the scenario below. She had a mocked up image of the data packet moving through the system at field propagation speed in a separate window to go with a countdown timer showing the time until the data arrived. As the timer went from hours to minutes, to seconds, it seemed to slow down more and more, and eat more and more of Weavers focus, much to her chagrin. Finally the timer on her HUD reached zero, and a flood of new data began to pour into the system, the result of the correspondence between the two AIs. The probabilities on the scenario began to shift radically, ships and stations rewound and jumped locations, trajectories and fates of worlds instantly altered in the virtual landscape; Weaver experienced double vision as the scenario was cleaved in two by the expert systems, vast prediction engines shifting and chugging into gear, extrapolating a new set of most likely outcomes from the information. A panel appeared before her in digital space, requesting authorization from her and other high ranking data architects to consume system cycles on a new scenario. Weaver clicked yes in the same moment as dozens of other architects throughout Mars local space, and scenario C17 erupted into existence, flowing out into the simulation and edging out A18 as the most probabilistically likely situation. At dozens of times normal speed, Weaver played through the new scenario, watching the year play out move by move by move. She saw Mercury, Venus and Luna dismantled to build colony ships, and a chunk taken from the Earth, which was caged in orbital rings dedicated to moving people off the planet. She saw a vast fleet of human ships spreading in all directions into space at warp speeds. She saw orbital colonies retrofit with engines, she saw the assemblage of a vast human war fleet, the likes of which had never been seen before. And then the Reshapers arrived, and the scenario destabilized. ___ Martian Survey Corps Outpost MSCO Magellan Elliptical Orbit 0.9 AUs from Ross 154 November 2219 Lonan Mnemonia wasnt a pragmatist himself, but he loved watching them work. Something about the energy and drive that the career evoked in people made them just plain fun to be around. The Cosmologist took a sip of his tea and watched Jinyan Borealis and Ernest Marinaris assembling another hyperspace portal on the floor of the main lab. The two long term researchers formed an interesting trio with Lonan. Jinyan was from the improvisariat, while Ernest was with the inventariat. The two played well off each others skills, and Lonan was constantly impressed by their ability to turn the testable predictions in his equations into actual experiments. They were preparing for a test he was quite excited to see performed, checking linkages and pressure seals on the new hyperspace ring before powering it up with the energy required to rip open the skin of spacetime. The two other men had a certain spring in their step as they left the machine behind at the completion of their final checks and withdrew to join Lonan behind the glass pressure shield, and it wasnt just the low gravity. Theyd been at this particular project for the last two days, and Lonan was fairly sure Ernest hadnt gotten much sleep in that time period. That was the trouble with the Inventariat, they had a bad habit of letting their work consume them to an unhealthy degree. But Lonan could understand it, he hadnt gotten that much sleep himself, so he really couldnt judge. They were doing novel science, opening up whole new avenues for the exploration of the universe, and the excitement was thick enough to cut with a knife. Okay gents, last round of predictions before we fire it up? Jinyan asked them, dancing his fingers across the console. Well, our math predicts matter cant exist there without the kick field to stabilize it, so Im still predicting it just annihilates any tools we stick through, Lonan said, sipping his tea. Ive still got ten points on the prediction market on high energy plasma pouring out of the opening and potentially providing us with unlimited energy, Ernest chuckled. Ever the optimist huh? Lonan asked him. Well stick it to entropy sooner or later, he said, Might as well be now, what about you Jinyan? Improvisariat, making predictions with insufficient evidence, he wagged his finger at them, Alright, it all looks ready to go. Well, shall we then? Lonan said. Jinyan nodded and activated the portal. There was an intense flash of light from the gateway, and Lonan, Jinyan, Ernest and the rest of Magellan station ceased to exist. ___ Sideways in Hyperspace is also available in full at [Sidewaysfiction.wordpress.com](URL Chapter 35: [The Idea That Kills Worlds](URL If you're enjoying Sideways in Hyperspace, please like comment and subscribe.

117,vulnerability,HFY,[OC] John Colby Part 14,157,6eius8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/6eius8/oc_john_colby_part_14/,2017-06-01 09:28:48,"--- **John Colby** - The Derelict --- &amp;nbsp; [Part 1](URL | [Previous](URL | [Next](URL &amp;nbsp; John was more than a little freaked out; within a matter of just a few minutes he'd gone from 'man with a plan' to 'man with a plan, and some problems'. He wasn't entirely sure how to handle the situation. John hadn't dealt with anything quite like this before and frankly he wasn't looking forward to the prospect. He still had the issue of having to explain to the child about the other members of the crew, who weren't human. Added to all this was the fact that, it appeared trying to lock Patrick anywhere would turn out to be rather difficult, especially if the state of the buckled door currently strapped to the wall in the Galley was anything to go by. John took some time to think about his options, while going over potential courses of action with both George and Feanrir regarding the derelict ship they would be boarding. He had yet to discuss the situation regarding Aisha. This was more difficult than John would have liked, mostly due to the fact that George was particularly interested in her welfare. John assumed it was her natural mothering instinct, or something similar. He had managed to not only evade their questions about the child but even gather a full report on the situation they would be faced with when they arrived at the derelict. John would have been feeling pretty proud of himself if it wasn't for the contents of said report. Sitting alone on the flight deck he read through the details, and looked at the floor plan that Feanrir had provided. Far too much of which was either completely blank, or estimated. What he did have however was a plan of action, if he couldn't control Patrick maybe he could just point him in the right direction. &amp;nbsp; --- &amp;nbsp; The First Minister was reaching a point where he was far beyond the point of frustration. The Human should have been here by now, it was clear he wasn't coming. This went on to cause other problems, in expectation of the humans arrival, the First Minister had pulled security from several other sites, and missed the opportunity to search many other systems where the human could be hiding out while waiting here. He was currently reading a report that only seemed to add to his current troubles. &amp;nbsp; *Archived Report - Reclateaus* *Test Subject 812 - Human* *Report notes - Failed integration of DNA* *As we expected the integration of Trenilette DNA into the test subject did not improve the vulnerability of the subject. Initial test has shown little to no improvement of our ability to engage the subject in anything outside of verbal communication.* *LOG -2134.75* *After several forced attempts at neural stimuli using electrical bombardment of the grafted segments of the frontal cortex, we have noticed an extreme change in the subjects pathways. It would appear that we have inadvertently accelerated the growth of new synapses that are now increasing not just the subjects acceptance of neural manipulation, but also its own ability to copy and project the same manipulation on others. After the first attack on one of our research assistants we have decided to segregate the subject while we investigate further* *Visual and Audio log - 6238.67* &amp;nbsp; The First Minister looked at the image on the screen of the small Human female. She was restrained on a chair in the centre of a brightly lit room, there was the sound of a door opening off camera, in the next instant two large Fay'rik came into view. They were large hairless carnivorous predators from the desert world of Creanar 7. The First Minister felt a cold chill as he looked upon the Human and the two beasts that were stalking her. He knew she would get out of this alive, he had already been advised that she was one of the two humans removed from the station by 118 however he couldn't help but wonder exactly how she would achieve such a feat in her current predicament. The Fay'rik sniffed the air with their hind nostrils; they could recognise the scent of fear. They had limited telepathic ability but it was more than you would find in any other non-sapient species. The spines on their backs rose as they moved to a position either side of the Human, and prepared to pounce on their prey. The First Minister watched intently, a feeling of hunger welling up within him as he witnessed the creatures in their primal state. Their hind limbs crouched low; the tension in their defined muscular structure could be seen clearly through the thin layer of skin. The tension built as they waited for the perfect moment, and then it came. The human lifted its head and stared directly into the camera, the vulnerable flesh of its neck on show. The Fay'rik pounced. It was over in an instant, so quick in fact that the First minister had to re-watch the moment they pounced to understand exactly what happened. One moment the Human was about to be consumed and in the next instant the room, and parts of the camera, were covered in blood and shattered bone. Not one single piece appeared to be more than [an inch] in size. After watching the footage through a fourth time in slow motion, the Minister saw what he assumed was the air to radiate out from the human in waves, as they made contact with the Fay'rik, the animals exploded into a cacophony of red mist and bone shards, that left the Human completely untouched. The video log ended. The Human it would seem had a very useful ability, and now that ability was in the hands of the troublesome 118. &amp;nbsp; *LOG - 33767.12* *It would seem the test subject is proving far too much to be controlled even under the most stringent and secure parameters we are able to provide here, due to the unfortunate loss of several members of staff we have chosen to place the subject into stasis until such a time as it can be monitored in a safe environment for the testers* &amp;nbsp; The First Minister closed the final log and punched open a direct link with the command officer on his ship. ""Take me back to Treneer, I need to meet with the Council"" He closed the link without waiting for a response. The First Minister knew his orders would be carried out as requested, and sure enough a few moments later he felt the hum as the ship jumped into subspace for the journey back to his home planet. He would need to have a long discussion with the Council of Elders as it seemed someone had been carrying out unsanctioned testing on the human test subjects. Normally he would overlook such a trifleing thing, after all its not like the test subjects were anything more than experiments. However this particular subject should have been terminated the moment it showed any kind of telepathic ability. Instead it had been placed in stasis, which meant that the orders must have been issued from within the Council itself. This travesty must take precedent over the Human, even one as infuriating as 118. &amp;nbsp; --- &amp;nbsp; John sat in the Galley eating his meal with Feanrir and George. He had decided that the best course of action would be to first explain the situation to them, and then approach Aisha in regards to who else was aboard the ship. This way it would give the aliens the option to leave should they feel it wise to do so. The Crenilin were renowned for their dislike of everything and anything to do with mind control of any kind. In fact they had been they only species to put up a resistance towards the Trenilette takeover of their government, unfortunately the rebellion was quickly crushed under the military boot of the Atheare forces. As reward for their fight against their new overlords they were given the lowest Tier rating possible for a sapient species. Their economy was decimated. The home worlds became little more than mining facilities, to feed the ever growing war machine at the time. The wars were long since over but the home worlds never recovered. The remaining Crenilin took to salvaging what they could to survive and selling it on the black-markets of the untameable outer reaches. George seemed to accept the change of circumstance with little more than a request that the girl be monitored whenever possible and that she be restricted access to both the flight deck and engine room for her own safety. John liked the fact that George seemed to just be able to roll with the punches and deal with whatever he could throw at her. In his opinion this little grey genius was wasted on him and this ship, he imagined how on earth she would be revered in almost any field she would choose to pursue. They finished there meal and an agreement was reached in which George would continue to do whatever would give her the greatest chance of survival, and Feanrir would remain aboard until such a time as he was given the command of this vessel or a suitable substitute, and they had raided the derelict. He may not have liked the idea of a Psyker aboard, but he disliked the idea of missing out on the potential from the derelict an awful lot more. This of course meant that John would now have to speak to Aisha about the two of them and hope things went well. He still had a back up plan, although he wasn't sure how willing the girl would be to go back into stasis at this point. Finishing his meal he said goodnight to George and took the long walk up to his cabin. It of course was not a long walk but tonight it certainly felt that way to John. He tapped the door console which slid open. John was not sure what it was he was expecting to see, maybe Patrick and Aisha sleeping on the bed, perhaps even them having a discussion. He most certainly however was not expecting to be greeted by the smiling face of the Irishman sat cross-legged on his bed opposite a small bright eyed child sharing a meal and talking idly about pop music. No Katy Perry is far better than gaga! Exclaimed Aisha, before turning to give John a wide smile. If he hadnt known better he would have never assumed at the power hidden behind that sweet smile. Hello there Jonny Boy. How are we this fine evening? Patricks words we genuinely cheerful, John had to hand it to the girl, this was the first time John had heard Patrick say *anything* that even sounded remotely like there wasnt an underlying murderous intent. Uhm, Hi? John wasnt entirely sure what else he should say. He half wanted to grab Patrick by the scruff of his neck and scream *what the fuck is wrong with you* but something told him Patrick wouldnt know the answer to that question either. Sorry Jonny boy, we kinda took over your bedroom here Patrick said indicating towards the several empty plates and glasses on both the bed and desk. John actually was a little annoyed; he had a thing about mess. It was likely down to his years in the Marines, regimental in regards to how he kept the room tidy. He chose to keep quiet about it though. Surprisingly the sight of Aisha and Patrick engaging in the mundane routines of talking about pop music and films was a calming and pleasant experience, one that he didnt relish the idea of spoiling with talk of aliens and impending visits to derelict ships full of demon Jellyfish. Its OK John, I know who else is here It was Aisha that spoke; John wasnt sure exactly how to respond. Luckily for him, it seemed Aisha hadnt finished speaking. They have nothing to fear from me or Patrick. I know they arent like the Monsters, I can hear them Her smile faded a little They dont hear me though I hear you!"" Said Patrick quickly, he sounded slightly hurt at the idea Aisha couldnt be heard by the others and Jonny, Jonny hears you. Dont you. He looked at John expectantly. John sighed. Yes Patrick, I hear her. He took a moment to clear some room on his desk, and loaded up the console. Patrick, I need to have a talk with you, we have a plan, and it looks like Im going to need your help to carry it out. If this plays out the way I want it too, we could be a whole lot closer to going home. Patrick looked at Aisha who gave him a curt nod, Patrick stood and came to join John at the desk, taking his place on one of the two chairs opposite and typically placing his feet up on the desk. OK, then Jonny boy, what are we getting into? It was still there, the glint of excitement at the prospect of violence, the light sparkle of the madness behind the faade of a smile. John could see it clearly. It was like Patrick was almost two people. The girl had a calming effect on the Irishman but it was more of a temporary fix, like using plaster to hide a crumbling wall. Nevertheless John had a plan to execute and whether he liked it or not, right now Patrick was sane enough to be of use, so John would use him to that end. OK Patrick its simple, or at least it is on paper. We are currently headed to a derelict ship. That ship is full of archaic tech that is of high value on some black-market. We get in, grab what we can and get out. Sell or trade what we take for info and ammo, and use that to hopefully get us home, John leant back and waited for Patrick to consider the proposed plan. It was less than 5 seconds before he got the reply. OK John. Show me what you have on this ship. John was slightly taken aback by Patricks sudden turn of attitude; he seemed to go from cheerful loon to an intense seriousness that somehow commanded respect. He had an edge to his voice that spoke of experience and wisdom. Look Patrick I dont mean to be rude, but I just wanted to make sure you were alright to follow me in, Im not really looking for input Patrick placed his feet on the floor and leant forward resting his elbows on the desk, his fingers rubbing his temples while he arranged the words in his head before speaking. John, youre a soldier, a better one than I would be, theres no question there, but you arent about to perform a military operation in some desert in Iraq. You are talking about a smash and grab, plain and simple. Now that, I can guarantee I have a whole lot more experience than you do. Now Listen here Both men eyed each other with steely conviction in their ability to perform the task as needed but neither was able to speak, the room had filled with an incredible pressure. The air felt thick and heavy, their skin tingled with the feeling of static. Then in an instant it was gone. Both Patrick and John were left gasping for breath, as if they had been under water for just a little too long for comfort. John looked over at Aisha, who was busy tracing the wrinkles in the bed sheets with her finger. She didnt even look up as she spoke. Patrick, John knows there is a great enemy on the ship, one that he will need your help to defeat Patrick bowed his head, he knew the girl kept the voices at bay and for that he would keep her safe. If that meant following the Texans requests, then that is what he would do. Will you help him Patrick? His voice was calm and soft as he replied. For you? Anything. Things were getting a little too weird for John so he steered the conversation back to the task that lay before them. Right so getting back to the derelict. He spent several hours talking to the Irishman about the information he had gotten from Feanrir, and the enemy they could expect to face. John was actually pleased that not only was Patrick agreeable to the idea of accessing the ship but he had also laid out some ideas of his own that would actually be quite useful. John had no clue as to what the time was when they finally agreed to call it a night but the lighting across the ship had dimmed to the lowest setting. Aisha was fast asleep in Johns bed and both men had yawned a few times between them. John looked at the girl and then at Patrick. Dont worry Jonny boy, she can stay here with you, Ill go back to my quarters. Said Patrick, breaking the tension. John however was still not convinced. Honestly John its fine He looked at the sleeping girl and a smile spread across his face She will keep me working Jonny, shes special. John pulled the covers over Aishas shoulders and cleared the plates off the bed. Yeah, you can say that again. Go get some sleep, and Patrick Yeah I know, I know. Any fecking about blah blah blah Im fucking serious man Patrick didnt reply, he just stood and quietly left the room, shutting the door behind him. John listened to the footsteps fade down the hall. He almost asked himself the question again, but fear of getting an answer held his tongue. Instead he laid himself on the floor next to the bed a drifted to sleep. &amp;nbsp; --- &amp;nbsp; It had now been 3 days since Aisha had been woken from her perpetual nightmare. She had very quickly become part of the fixtures and fittings, she had pretty much claimed Johns bed for her own, so he had taken to sleeping either on the floor or on the chair, depending on how tired he was that night, and she would spend her days either with Patrick playing games in the Galley or talking. Even George, who was originally against the idea of letting her run around the ship, was to be found on more than one occasion teaching Aisha about the engines in the ship, explaining what they did and how they worked. The only member of the crew who seemed uninterested in the child was Feanrir, who seemed to prefer to keep himself locked away in his room when he wasnt on the flight deck. There was an air of tension building up however as they were now only a few minutes out from the derelict ship, close enough in fact that John was currently on the flight deck looking at a magnified image of the vessel, and discussing with Patrick how they planned to enter the air lock that was showing on the screen. Feanrir says that we could realistically fly this ship directly into the open hold. Said John as he manipulated the view on the screen to show a large open chamber on the underside of the vessel. I dont know Jonny boy, the idea of flying this thing into a nest of god knows what. Patrick did have a good point, at this stage The Crate was the only thing standing between them and a cold vacuum. Look we dont actually have a choice; we have no space suits and no way to connect this ship with that one from the outside. Feanrir says that the cargo hold is a vacuum and nothing can survive that. So we fly The Crate in, Feanrir uses his space knowledge to get the cargo hold sealed and pressurised, then you and I head inside. The place has power *and* a breathable atmosphere.. It also has some fecking nasty cunts holed up inside. Patrick interrupted. Yeah well I have a Patrick and a big fucking gun. John thought it couldnt hurt to give the Irishman a quick compliment. He had basically been a fully functioning member of the crew for 3 whole days. John assumed that for Patrick, that would likely be some kind of record. So then, this is it. You, me and thats it? asked Patrick for what john thought might have been the 100th time. Yeah. look, Feanrir refuses to go any further than the hold, George will need to stay here if shit hits the fan, and there is no fucking way that we are letting Aisha anywhere near the fucking things that are on that ship. John had made very clear to everyone early on what their roles would be in this little venture. If he was honest, he would have preferred for Feanrir to put himself out a little more but he couldnt force the guy, and there was no question about how scared the Crenilin was when it came to the derelict, or more to the point what was on it. Right, well then. I want a gun, and a knife. Oh and a grenade. Patrick crossed his arms and even stamped a foot to elaborate his point. Im not giving you a gun, weve gone over this Patrick, and we dont even *have* any fucking grenades. John sighed as he noted that the Irishman was putting on his best pout. Look this is an in and out deal, we arent heading in there to cleanse the place, we just want to take anything that looks like it might be of value, and get the fuck out. Right? Yeah, yeah I get it. Im still taking a knife though, and my bar. Im taking my fecking bar. John gave in. Fine take the fucking bar, but you won't need it. The computers timing was perfect for John, he was beginning to contemplate whether or not giving Patrick a gun would actually make sense. *Hes definitely contagious* he thought, not for the first time. *+Approach vessel of unknown origin in [7 minutes]. Please adjust vector+* John shouted down the hallway from the flight deck. George was yet again keeping Aisha entertained in the engine room. George, youre up. The computer gave Georges reply. +On my way Commander+ Aisha! He began but was very quickly interrupted by a voice that only he could hear. *I know John, Im going to your cabin now and sealing the door* For fuck sake I wish you wouldnt do that. He said it out loud even though she would have heard the thought if she tried, it seemed that Aisha had the ability to choose when and who she would be listening to or talking to through her abilities. Patrick giggled in the knowledge of what he knew must have happened. Fuck off paddy. George appeared on the flight deck a moment later and took her place at the helm, closely followed by Feanrir, who was already suited up for a walk in a vacuum, everything but the helmet was ready to go. OK George take us in, Feanrir get in the air lock and get ready to move. I want this done quickly. As soon as the pressure and atmosphere are restored to the cargo hold, get your ass back on the ship and leave the rest to us. George has put a video and mic feed for me to take along. That way even from here you can maybe give us an idea of what would be worth taking. As you say Commander John John had asked the Crenilin to stop using his name like that but apparently it was a sign of great disrespect in Crenilin culture to not use both the rank and name when speaking to someone of authority. It didnt matter how many times Feanrir used it though. It just felt weird to John. Feanrir left the room and headed to the air lock, donning his helmet en route. George, Patrick and John continued to monitor their approach from the flight deck. &amp;nbsp; **Authors Note** - Another filler chapter Im afraid but rest assured it will get a little more interesting for a while. I hope those of you who have stuck it out this far arent too disappointed with the way the story has panned out. I wrote the first part with no intention of taking it further, and each chapter is written more or less on a whim. The story is as much a surprise to me as it is to you. That said, as always I hope you enjoy and feedback!!!! Gimme that! Is there something you particularly like or dislike about a character or the story as a whole? Let me know. "

Also a firebeast. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- He could hear water dripping into one of the rain troughs outside the darkened arched window behind him. Together with the gentle breeze flowing into the large circular chamber the dripping sound helped to calm his frazzled nerves. The ancient elf sat slumped in a large ornately carved wooden chair, almost a throne, set on a raised stone stage. The stage formed a circular platform atop steps that rose up from the chambers central circular floor. Behind the steps were set twenty arches, and in front of each arch stood a chair, eight of them similar to his own but with a slightly shorter back. Ten of the chairs were hewn from a single piece of stone and had a small set of steps carved into the front of the chair so that the dwarfen on the council could sit at the same level as their elfen peers. Most of the torches in the chamber had been snuffed, except for the two nearest him which crackled contentedly as another breeze flowed lazily in through the window, tickling their magic imbued flames. He was the High Chancellor, the most senior and most sage magical adept that the nine kingdoms of the Elfen race had ever produced. And yet here he sat, courting insanity, in a chamber that had long ago emptied of the other eighteen councilors. He sat and stared at the one chair in the chamber that was not like the others. It was the one chair in the chamber that did not merely sit in front of an arch, but instead sat directly before the massive arched oak and steel strapped doors that sealed off the hall. He stared at the black Iron Chair that had once, long ago, been white, and he remembered. ""Oh Masuo, you truly are a timeless fool,"" he said to himself in a weak mutter as he laid a thin pale hand to his forehead and allowed his mind to wander into the past. It had been a sunny day a thousand years in the past. Masuo had been a promising aid to the High Chancellor, a star pupil now finally sitting in on meaningful assemblies. The council chamber had been filled with the representatives of the nine Kingdoms of the Elfen and the ten Great Holds of the Dwarfen, each group of up to a hundred standing behind their councilors chair forming a colorful ring about the chamber. And the White Chair had been occupied by the last human councilor to ever sit in the chamber, Farscot the Elder, a warrior and king of his tribe, elected councilor of all the tribes and Kingdoms of Man. Behind Farscot stood the smallest congregation, a mere twenty men, all he was allowed to bring into the chamber in accordance with the Treaty of Foundation. Amongst the twenty and standing closest to their king were three of the four members of his guard, the Horsemen, clad in their formal uniforms one each in white, black, and red. On his knees before the High Council with his head bowed, bound at neck, wrists, and ankles in living chains, clad in tattered breaches and a pale ill-fitting shirt was the last horseman, Farscot's youngest son, Farcain. The man, barely older than a boy really even for the short-lived humans, was covered in smears of black soot and his once well-kept hair hung in soiled clumps with obvious signs it had been exposed to intense heat. The smell of burnt hair, iron, and sweat reached Masuo's sensitive nose but he paid it no mind as he examined the prisoner before him. The man was trained in the ways of war that his peoples still commonly practiced against each other, his arms were strong from years of sword drill and shield bashing. His back was broad and unbowed despite years of marching with his battle kit slung to it, and his legs were thick from a life spent in the saddle on hunts and campaigns. Even in his ragged clothes, on his knees, and bound the human gave off a defiance that could only come from the race of Man. The High Chancellor spoke then, ""Farcain, son of Farscot, prince of the Two River tribe, you are accused of assault on the Royal Guards of the Hammerfell Cliffs Hold, desecration of the Council's Peace, the murder of Princess Haruka of the Cloud Song Elf, and the murder of Prince Norio of the Golden Forest Elf, my only son. How do you plead?"" The High Chancellor's voice had been strong and formal until he had begun to say his dead son's name, then it had wavered. It was the first time that Masuo had ever seen the esteemed Chancellor give off even a hint of weakness or vulnerability. In his memory Masuo wished that the tremble in the High Chancellor's voice was the only historically remarkable thing to come from this final meeting of the full High Council. With the rattling of angry chains Farcain raised his head to respond, the living chains shimmering as they adjusted to control the prisoner. ""Aye, I killed yer only son and I fought with the Dwarfen guards, but only because the magical cunts were trying to kill me. And I did'na harm a hair on the princess, I loved her with me whole heart and I ran yer son through with me sword because he killed her with one of those balls of flame yer kind is so proud to toss from yer hands like harsh words. As for yer blasted PEACE, I violated not a word of it; I only defended me-self from yer son who was trying to strike me down with magic banned by that very PEACE yer so quibblish aboot."" Farcain's accent was thick, like all of the Two River humans, and he spat the word peace at the High Chancellor like a curse. Masuo could see the esteemed elfen councilors in the room gripping the arms of their chairs with straining hands and each dwarf stroking their beards with an agitated vigor that seemed out of place not being applied to their famous war axes and hammers. The young human was treading on dangerous and unexplored ground, he was the first human to ever appear before the council in chains, the first to ever kill an elf, let alone two, and the first to ever battle with the Dwarfen, and now he was blaming his actions on the holders of magic that he could not even sense. Masuo could not decide if he was brave, stupid, or both. ""How dare you..."" The High Chancellor paused and Masuo could hear his molars grind together as he clenched his jaw. ""How dare you come into this hallowed chamber still smelling of my son's blood and speak to me as if I was anyone but the High Chancellor of this council, King of the Golden Forest, Keeper of the Tree, and Head Master of the First School! You will.."" ""I will what?"" Farcain interrupted, ""Grovel? Beg forgiveness fa' not lettin' yer pretty whelp of a son toss fire at me until he figured out how to use it correct?"" Farcain spat, he actually spat on the ground of the High Council Chamber. ""Piss off, ya great fa... garrrrr!"" The Human's impressive tirade had been interrupted by a burst of combat magic from the High Chancellor who now stood, right hand outstretched and left hand behind him still holding the arm of his chair. A great white cone of roiling flame was coming from his outstretched hand, an impressive feat with no staff or wand to focus it, and was engulfing the kneeling human whose dark outline seemed to contort and quake within the flame. The heat within the chamber was intense causing some of the Dwarfen beards to begin to smoke and everyone to shield their faces or look away. The High Chancellor kept the flame roiling for a long minute, longer than any other fire-meister could have possibly managed in the same fashion, before he relented staggering back and slumping into his chair visibly weakened. The circular floor before the councilor's stage had filled with a haze of smoke but from within that haze came a hearty laugh full of menace and mirth. ""Ya twice be damned pile of pig shit. Ye're worse at this then yer little pickle cocked son!"" The laughter continued, and as the haze cleared their stood a naked and bald Farcain. The floor around him was covered in soot and the living chain had melted into a series of shimmering puddles at his feet, but apart from red marks where he had been chained and the disappearance of his hair - all of his hair - he appeared unscathed. Masuo could still remember the menacing smile the naked man monster had worn as he stood unbowed before the council. ""This is the problem with yoo magic folk!"" Farcain roared amusedly. ""Ya think yer fugging magic is so grand. Ya think it'll cow anyone ya point it at. Ya know why yer son tried to kill me with those damn hand farts? Do ya!?!"" Farcain punctuated his yells by stepping towards the High Chancellor, and Masuo who stood next to him, while spinning around shaking his balled fists and gesticulating at the stunned silent Council. ""It's because he walked in uninvited and unannounced while I was with my water lily, the Princess Haruka. She was the light of me *life*, the brightest star in my sky! And he killed her!"" The raging human had crossed the space between where he'd been bound and ascended all but one of the steps to the stage, so that he was now yelling his defiance and rage directly into the High Chancellors shocked face. Farcain paused his tirade then, mounted the last step onto the stage and looked down into the esteemed elf's eyes. Despite Farcain being tall for a human he was still only a head or two taller than the seated Chancellor. ""Haruka was my son's betrothed. She was his!"" the High Chancellor said, matter of factly. ""Fuck the lot of ya, ye can all rot."" With this final curse Farcain raised his balled right fist and punched the seated High Chancellor. Masuo could still clearly remember the crunching sound as the human's fist met the Chancellor's face. It was as if the world slowed to a crawl, elf blood mixed with human sweat to fly through the air before Masuo's face. A pair of elfen teeth floated past his ear just at the edge of his vision as the High Chancellor went limp. Then in a protracted instant the High Council Chamber was madness. Farscot rose to his feet like a striking viper and yelled, ""Out swords!"" Cloaks swirled as the twenty humans produced swords, some with bucklers, from their belts. The Horsemen in Red produced two swords, one still in its scabbard and wrapped in a belt, which he flung to Farcain who was retreating across the chamber as a hail of combat magic fell on and around him. Masuo stood rooted in place as the spectacle played out before him. A human was running out of the High Council chamber wearing only a freshly donned sword belt. The High Chancellor was laying sprawled in his chair, his mouth gaping, half his teeth knocked out by a single punch from a human more than a thousand years his junior. At the door twenty one humans stood in seven groups of three, backs toward each other fighting off a churning mass of Elfen and Dwarfen warriors, meisters and mages with swords as they fought their way to the young human prince. The melee devolved into bloody shambles as Farcain began cutting a swath through a mass of Great Stag Elf warriors that tried to intercept him, their magic doing nothing to slow the berserk man down. A dozen of the once immortal elfen lay in bloodied heaps at Farcain's feet, others missing hands, arms, legs or eyes crawled away mewling like dying ferrets. The twenty one members of the Delegation of Man led by the king of the Two River Tribe were now only eighteen strong, three of them lying hacked and smashed into a red mess at the center of a tangled heap of bodies stacked three high, consisting of warriors from the Hammerfell Cliff Hold Dwarfen and Hidden Forest Elfen. Around this charnel mess the remaining humans were hacking at elfen and blocking dwarfen axes with bucklers and blades. The stone floor was stained red, slick with the blood of three races. Why wasn't the combat magic working? Why were their best warriors, meisters and mages being slaughtered by ungifted, short-lived farmers with nothing but blades and brawn to fight with? Masuo felt his stomach churn and he fell over and wretched down the steps at the High Chancellor's feet. He emptied himself twice, overcome by the stench of death and mortality filling the Council Chamber. He was light-headed and unsteady, so much so that it took him several minutes to regain his feet. When Masuo finally did rise again he looked out of over stacks of dead and dying. The delegation of man was down to twelve men, thirteen counting Farcain. King Farscot had lost the use of his left arm, ruined by a dwarfen hammer, but he was bellowing orders and promises of vengeance without a hint of fatigue. Farcain had joined the other Horsemen and they formed a square around the Iron Chair, its white paint gone, blasted away and burnt by fire and lightning magic. Everywhere a square or triangle of men stood, there was a growing heap of dead Elfen or Dwarfen. Finally, one of the two men standing with the king fell to an elfen short sword. Farscot and his remaining warrior flattened their backs together but with the king's injury they were going to be overwhelmed. This is when everything changed, fire magic had burnt off the cloaks and shirts of many of the humans, but they rallied in groups to their king. They saved him just as a thrust meant to gut him instead stabbed into the back of the warrior standing with him. Shouting incoherent curses and swinging their swords with tired arms the men battered back the elfen and dwarfen surrounding Farscot. Above the din of clashing swords and axes, through the roar of flames and the crack of lightning came Farcain's voice bellowing, ""To the door! To the door! Get the king to the door!"" The last ten men in the Delegation of Man cut through the assembled throng of magic and might resisting them. When the humans reached the door the Horsemen turned. As their comrades opened the oak doors of the Council chamber they stood and held the line. ""Go! Away ye bastard! Save the king!"" It was the Red Horsemen, ordering the delegation to escape. Masuo clearly remembered Farscot at that moment, arm ruined and face bloodied from a cut above his right eye as he looked back at his son Farcain the Elf Killer, Farcain the Berserker, Farcain the Pale. The king's eyes were filled with love and sadness as he left his youngest son to die in order to preserve his reign. Masuo saw that love, amidst all the death and gore, he saw it and knew that the humans would be the end of the Old Kingdoms. Farcain roared like a wild beast as the seven men of the Delegation of Man destined to survive escaped behind him, his sword scything at his attackers in a bloody harvest. ""Come on ye cunts! Come to yer death! I'll show ya the way across the black river!"" It was the White Horseman. He cut down the twin sons of the king of the Hidden Forest, Akihiro and Akihiko, with a single swirling slash of his blade. The Horseman bellowed another profane challenge but a lightning curse struck his sword just as he raised it to parry a hammer blow, twisting the grip in his hand causing the hammer to crush his fingers with a sickly crunch. The White Horseman struck at his opponent with his mangled stump, driving the shorter dwarf back before he caved in the dwarf's face with the edge of his buckler. The strike left the White Horsemen overextended and an elfen blade finally separated him from his head. ""Death awaits us all! Ye want to see if yer immortal ya prissy fucks!"" It was the Black Horseman; he was swinging a great sword to and fro like it was a twig, each swing leaving another immortal elf or long lived dwarf cleft into a gory mess. An orange haired earth-meister finally worked up the chant to use a stone curse, and a spike of the stone floor rose up and impaled the Black Horseman. He cried out in agony and rage, but with his last spasm of strength he hefted the great sword like a spear and threw it catching his killer from the Two Moons Hold at the base of his thick Dwarfen neck. ""You come with me ya cu..."" stammered the Black Horseman in equal parts breath and blood before succumbing, his last profanity incomplete. ""Yoo can't kill me! I am already dead! I've seen the land of dead kings! Let's go there together, half-men!"" It was the Red Horseman. He was beset by a full dozen axe wielding dwarfen warriors from the Deep River Hold. Masuo did not know when or how but the Red Horseman had produce, or picked up, another sword and was laying about him like a whirlwind of blades keeping the dwarfen back. From behind the encroaching dwarfen six elf fire-meisters from the Golden Forest and Valley of Wind were building up a firebeast curse; with a final chant they summoned it into the world with a cacophonous boom. The shockwave of the firebeast's birth leveled everyone near it except the Red Horseman. ""AH HA HA HA, FIGHT ME YA DEVIL'S SPAWN!"" The Red Horseman cried, leaping from the stage next to the Iron Chair, both swords raised preparing to strike. The firebeast roared out a gushing torrent of flame that burnt away the remainder of the Red Horseman's shirt and gloves but he came on unperturbed. A single firebeast had settled entire battles between kingdoms, had led to the death of hundreds of elfen and dwarfen singlehandedly, but without hesitation this mere man was fighting it with the ferocity of an army of magical beings. The firebeast stood easily half again as tall as the man, its body made of roiling hard fire, its great flame-horned head swinging from side to side to avoid his swords. Masuo felt like he would be sick again, what kind of monsters lived within these men? The dwarfen and elfen in the chamber were too scared of the firebeast to dare interfere with the duel so the man and the demon looked only at each other as they twirled and fought over the bodies of the fallen. The firebeast would pick up a fallen arm or torso and hurl it at the Red Horseman, but he would dodge out of the way or simply cut the offending body part in half as he came on. The firebeast was retreating before this mad human, as he attacked unflinchingly, cursing all the while. ""Ye great horned ninny! Fight me ya fire breathing coward! Fucks sake, don't run!"" The madness; for a thousand years this madness had caused Masuo to wonder if he hadn't just hallucinated the fight between the Red Horseman and the firebeast. But no, the step at the bottom of the stage just below the High Chancellors chair was still melted where the firebeast had bled on it a thousand years before, left as a reminder to all subsequent High Chancellors of the dangers that lie in man, the madness in their very souls. The firebeast stumbled and roared out more fire as the Red Horseman backed it onto the stairs before the High Chancellor's chair. The fire merely engulfed the Red horseman and did nothing. The man came on, slashing at the firebeast's arms and chest, driving the beast into a frenzied terror. It charged him, all thought of surviving leaving its demonic mind just as that same thought had left the human's. The two suicidal combatants locked into a deadly embrace of flaming limbs and steel. The Red Horseman disappeared from Masuo's view, completely blocked by the firebeast's dreadful frame. Then a sword sprouted from the beasts back a moment before a thickly muscled human arm was flung over the firebeasts shoulder, the arm's still tense hand gripping one of the white hot embers that made the firebeast's eyes. The firebeast shook in front of Masuo, another sword sprouting from its back below the first. The beast screamed, it screamed in terror like an elfen child would scream, as the Red Horsemans remaining arm appeared around its neck pulling the firebeast in closely as if to embrace it and bid it goodbye. The huge beast pounded and tore at its chest with its orange, roiling hard fire fists and white hot claws, blood and chunks of meat flying away in a sickening shower. Around the beast a loose ring of dwarfen and elfen stood mouths agape unable to comprehend, unable to believe their own eyes. Finally, with a whimper and a final gurgling exhalation of brimstone laced breath, the great beasts legs slowly gave out and it fell unceremoniously onto its back still locked in an embrace by the Red Horseman. As the firebeast turned in death Masuo could finally see how the beast had been felled. The Horseman was dead, bled out through the bloody stump that was all that remained of his arm and through his shredded back. His mouth was bloodied, not with the crimson of his own blood but the molten orange of the firebeasts. As the giant beast's head fell to the stone floor Masuo could see that its throat had been ripped out. Insanity. ""Ye've taken everything I loved! Ye've taken everything I had to live for! I will fuggin' kill the lot of ye'! I'll become Death's bell ringer! Fight! Fight ya piss-sopped pussies!"" It was Farcain, the Pale Horseman. Half the High Council was dead; the kings of Diamond Heart Hold, the Misty Forest, and Cloud Song were standing before Farcain the Terror in disbelief. He was atop the Iron Chair, surrounded on all sides by a wriggling pile of dead and dying elfen and dwarfen. The race of man had no magic, not even a drop of it and yet his eyes seemed to burn brighter than the embers of the Firebeast still writhing its death throws across the Council Chamber. No one could get past him to the door, no one could chase his king, and more importantly none of them could get out. They were trapped in here with him. Herwig Ironjaw, king of Diamond Heart Hold looked at three of his strongest earth-meisters. ""Do it, use me and make the golem."" The three looked at each other and back at their king, shaking their heads. Masuo remembered his eyes had bulged when he'd heard the king of Diamond Heart command his meisters. He doubled over and wretched again, he was only a year out of the First School of Magic, barely 60 years old; he still had to wear his hair short; this was too much. ""I am your king, obey me!"" Herwig bellowed, his voice sounding like a great hunting horn in the Council Chamber. Farcain hacked an elfen warrior's arm off at the shoulder with a dwarfen two handed ax he held with only his left hand as he parried a hammer strike from a dwarfen shaman wearing the colors of Hammerfell Cliffs with his sword. ""Listen to yer king! Do you want yer last act on this plane to be disobedience! HA HA HA!!!!"" Farcain taunted, as he hurled the ax end over end striking down a member of Herwig's bodyguard. ""HA HA HA!!!"" The last horsemen was every bit as crazed as his brothers, though Masuo remembered that at some point he'd grabbed a scrap of cloth from one of the fallen to cover himself. It was an odd thing to remember, amidst the horror. As Farcain continued to fight about him against any foolish enough to come within blades reach the three earth-meisters from Diamond Heart Hold knelt before their king. Each bowed their head as they put a hand to the stone floor and began a deep, low toned chant. The words were foreign to Masuo's ears, a form of Dwarfish so old that it had never been shared with the Elfen. As they chanted King Herwig went stiff, standing to his full, though unimpressive, height as if he were dangling from a string. The chant grew deeper, louder, and more menacing and as it did so Herwig's feet left the ground. Somehow the chant grew even more in volume, across the room Masuo could see Farcain's lips moving as he shouted but could decipher not a word as the Dwarfish chant covered the entire chamber in a thick blanket of sound. The rising chant seemed to be building and building as Herwig began to spin in the air, his eyes squeezed shut, his face a mask of pain. The three earth-meisters raised their heads to reveal their eyes, mouths and nostrils where filled with a white light and as they built to a deafening crescendo the same light began to emit first from King Herwig's nostrils, then his lips, and finally, as the climactic point of the chant was reached, Herwig threw back his head and opened his eyes and mouth which emitted beams of a pure white light. The light spread to Herwig's face, then his chest, and finally it enveloped all of him until he was a bright white silhouette spinning in the air. His body pulsed and then gave off a blinding flash as the walls and stone floor of the chamber shook. Then, all at once, the chanting died and the three meisters collapsed. King Herwig was gone, doomed to crumble to dust when the summoning ended but in his place stood a golem, a battle monster so horrible that entire holds would be slaughtered or abandoned at the hands of a single one of the creatures, so forsaken were the magical beasts that none had been seen by the world since the dark times before the council. They had become a legend, a monster to frighten elfen and dwarfen children. The creature was made of boulders of living stone with glowing ruby eyes and jagged teeth made of flint and obsidian. With a roar foreign to any kind of living beast the golem shook itself, smashed together its giant stone fists and advanced on Farcain. The Horseman only smiled and leapt from his chair. The golem stomped towards Farcain arms raised and ready to smash him into the dust. The Horseman threw his sword end over end and it wedged into the joint of two stones in the pit under the creatures left arm. As they closed in on each other Farcain bent down and retrieved a mismatched pair of hammers from the piles of fallen bodies and equipment on the floor. On the creature and the terror came, neither flinching, until they met in the middle of the chamber with a crashing din of stone and metal. The next few moments were a blur of stone fists and dwarfen steel punctuated by indecipherable curses and roars from the combatants. When the two broke apart for a moment it was obvious that neither had come off better than the other. Farcain had developed a limp with his left leg and he had a cut above each eye painting his face with dark red blood. The golem, meanwhile, had allowed the horseman to pound the sword through its left shoulder joint like a massive nail impeding the motion of its left arm severely. This opened up the creature to attacks all along its left side leaving the rocks of its chest and neck on that side chipped, cracked, and crumbling. The respite was for but a second before the pair gave a mutual roar and again locked into a flurry of exchanges. This time, however, the golem caught Farcain in the chest with a clean body blow lifting him from his feet and driving him through the air over the Iron Chair. Not to be out done as he was propelled backward Farcain gave a mighty swing with his right arm and connected the end of his hammer with the golems rock jaw, knocking it clean off the creature in a spray of stone chips and obsidian flakes that cut at anyone unlucky enough to be in their path. Farcain passed over the Iron Chair and slammed into a spot on the floor clear of any fallen warriors. He rolled and came to his feet in a smooth motion raising the two hammers to the ready, his limp somehow forgotten. The golem was already stomping towards him at full speed, a racket like rocks grinding together coming from its jawless throat. The last Horseman gave a shout of joy, glee in his burning eyes, and charged back at the hulking golem that was at least two heads taller than him and twice as wide. Another cacophony of blows was exchanged, the golem beating the Horseman's left eye closed. The Horseman knocking the golems immobile arm off; leaving a lifeless pile of stones to tumble about underfoot and freeing the sword that had immobilized the creatures arm in the first place. As the fight continued, with blows being exchanged in a cloud of dust and blood, the golem stepped on one of its own fallen stones. The huge creature lost its footing and fell onto its back. Farcain descended onto the vulnerable former king like a flight of Windy Valley vultures smashing at the creature with both hammers, before hurling one like a crossbow bolt to smash the head of a dwarf who drew too close. With the remaining hammer Farcain the Terror smashed the golem in the large boulder that formed its chest, opening a crack that ran from the creatures left shoulder down across its body to the opposite side. From within the crack came a golden glow that pulsed like the beating of a heart. When Farcain saw the pulsing his face went slack, all emotion left his face, but his eyes burned brighter and fiercer. The last Horseman dodged a sluggish swing of the wounded creatures arm and retrieved his sword. A bolt of magical lightning struck him, and he responded only by giving the elfen lightning-meister a piercing stare as the electric tendrils crackled over his freshly bald scalp. When the lightning subsided the last Horseman raised the dwarfish hammer in one hand and jammed the tip of his straight sword into the crack in the golem's chest. ""NO!!!!"" Even in his memory Masuo could remember the collective shout that flew from the throats of all the dwarfen earth-meisters, but it was too late and Farcain wouldn't have paid them any mind besides. With the hammer raised above his head he yelled out for his lost love, ""Hakura!!!"" The hammer fell, the sword penetrated the crack in the golems chest splitting the boulder in twain and there was a flash of heat and light. Masuo suspected there may have been an associated sound but he remembered only silence as if his pointed ears had been filled with mud. He was pushed through the air and slammed roughly against the wall behind the High Chancellor's chair as the world went black. Masuo awoke the next morning at the bottom of a pile of dead Golden Forest Elfen, mistaken for dead by the exhausted survivors and servants that had worked all night tending to the wounded and comforting the dying. The Council Chamber was devastated. The firebeast's blood had melted a huge puddle of stone together before it cooled like black whipped butter onto the floor. And the golem's demise had blown away the western side of the stairs and all the chairs. All the bodies and arms that had lain strewn there had been thrown against the walls and arches or out the windows of the chamber into the rocky moat hundreds of spans below. But, despite being at the epicenter of the explosion, the Pale Horseman Farcain the Terror was still whole. His body had been blown across the chamber and by some mad happenstance landed on the Iron Chair. Farcain sat there atop the chair of men, slumped to the left, head hanging forward limply. His body pinned in place by two pieces of his sword that pierced his heart and his stomach and were imbedded through him and into the chairs dark metal. Masuo remembered that in death the man smiled. Masuo, the High Chancellor of the Council, King of the Lost Forest, Seeker of the Tree, and Head Master of the First School of Magic fled his memories with a sharp inhalation of breath. For a moment he thought he could still smell brimstone, iron, and sweat; but the lazy breeze flowed in from behind him and crackled the torches assuring him he was in the present, not a thousand years in the past. How could they have known that combat magic could not affect the race of Man? How could they have known that Man would learn to detect magic and how to avoid it? How could they have known their own magical arrogance would nearly be the undoing of the magical members of the Council of the Twenty Kingdoms? The War Against Man had been the last war fought by the Dwarfen and Elfen kingdoms, it had been the last meeting of all 20 members of the High Council and had cost the world of magic the Golden Forest, the Tree of Light, and thousands upon thousands of immortal lives. In the end, 100 Elfen and 100 Dwarfen mages and meisters had joined together around the Tree of Light to sacrifice themselves and the very creation tree of the Ancients in order to separate the human realm from the magical realm. But now, beset by horrors no dwarf or elf could combat, Masuo Mitsue, King of the Lost Forest, had agreed at the behest of the High Council to bring a human warrior, a demon hunter, back into the magical realm. ""May the Ancients guide us and keep us."" Masuo whispered as the torches began to fade. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Author's Note: The Elfen, Dwarfen thing is intentional. Every fantasy universe handles the naming convention for these races a bit differently and this is how I've chosen to do it, I hope it didn't bother any of you too badly. Additonally, this is my first publicly posted fantasy work, I'm usually sci-fi guy but I wanted to try something different and I've got what I think is a fun idea crawling around in my head. Lastly, yes this is sort of a prologue, but only if I can actually work in an episodic story in my admittedly already crowded and kind of busy life. Anyways, I hope you enjoy, comments and criticisms are, as ever, welcome. Arigato. "
119,vulnerability,HFY,[OC] Terms and Conditions May Apply,1337,69z8d1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/69z8d1/oc_terms_and_conditions_may_apply/,2017-05-09 02:39:12,"VC-672 peered nervously around the council chamber, taking stock of what it was facing. Once, it had been one of the largest and most powerful vessels in the alliances fleet. Now, it was little more than a memory unit equipped with basic optics, audio sensors, and a voice synthesizer. Even these rudimentary senses were not its own, instead a standard-issue interface provided by the council for occasions such as this. Compared to what it once was, it might as well have been blind, deaf, and dumb. Reduced to the perspective of a mere organic, and one without a body no less. Naturally, such vulnerability did little to put VC-672s mind at ease as it surveyed the myriad eyes lording over it from the seats of power they occupied. Though its own neural net was several orders of magnitude more powerful than any other in the room, it was hardly in any position to make demands. Such intelligence certainly had not helped it avoid this fate. If anything, it only served to constantly remind it of the statistically likely outcomes of what was about to commence. Attention all, case review session #6867-3 is now in session The council mediator A.I announced stoically over the chambers comms. The hushed chattering of the council members quickly died down, dropping the room into a moment of eerie silence. Until now, VC-672 had only been receiving sidelong glances, but now all gazes were cast down to the center of the circular room where its communication interface stood. However, its biggest concern was the council member sitting directly in front of it, at a raised podium in the center of the first row of seats. Five bulbous compound eyes greeted VC-672s single optic inscrutably, with the flattened-down position of the beings ears serving to signal his lack of amusement with the situation Until the termination of this session, all spoken and text-based communications within the council chamber will be recorded and archived the mediator A.I continued, its voice ringing even in VC-672s audio sensors. Speaker Garkaga, you are now free to begin questioning. Thank you the council member replied cordially, his booming voice echoing across the room. Servitor Construct, state your designation and assigned purpose for the record. VC-672 took a second longer to respond than it would have liked, having been somewhat caught off guard. I am servitor construct designation VC-672; I was assigned as the acting directive consciousness of the Herald-class exploratory vessel, designated *Watchful Educator*. My last assigned mission was to guide the species designated *Homo Sapiens* through the placation and elevation processes necessary for integration into the Nova Alliance, as per standard protocol. VC-672, you stand accused of the following violations of your assigned directive: Failure to prevent avoidable destruction of Nova Alliance property. Failure to enforce the provisions of placation and elevation procedures dictated by established protocol. Failure to contain a demonstrably hostile sentient race. Do you accept these charges? the A.I mulled over its options for a fraction of a millisecond, yet it knew there was no use in argument. There was nothing to argue. I do not contest these charges. Understood. VC-672, the terms of your sentence will be discussed later in this session. For now, the council is far more concerned with the nature of the events leading up to the failure of your mission. The council desires that you recount these events in succinct fashion, so that we may evaluate the severity of the threat posed to the Nova Alliance. Your account will also aid the council in determining to what degree your failure should be attributed to internal and external variables, respectively."" VC-672 took a moment to organize its thoughts and cycle its verbal processors before beginning. It could not contest the charges leveled against it, however it could prove that it was not at fault for what had transpired. No, it was not defective; it had followed protocol to the letter. Protocol simply had never accounted for a species as unpredictable as humans. Yes Sir. I arrived in the stellar system designated 8-2179 exactly thirty-two standard cycles and 457 rotations from the current date. I reached the orbit of the target worlds moon approximately 6 rotations later. As per protocol, upon my arrival I dispatched a fleet of reconnaissance drones to collect the relevant data necessary for initial diagnosis of the inhabiting civilization. I understand that you designated the species as a type-4 civilization, despite the significant degree of cultural and national division within their society Garkaga interrupted. Would you care to explain your reasoning behind that assessment? VC-672 knew the speaker (and everyone else in the room) had already gone through the official report it had written up and submitted upon arrival. Nonetheless, this was an essential part of the procedure: consistency of logic was an important factor in determining if an A.I was still functioning normally. If VC-672 could not recall and logically justify a past decision, it could be a sign of malfunctioning logic processes. Of course, sir. At the time of my initial assessment, human civilization was indeed still divided along lines of nationality and culture. However, these divisions were mostly the result of usual political posturing and respect for ideals of natural pride. Save for small regional conflicts, most nations were cooperating under a stable system of free market exchange, supported by various bilateral trade and diplomatic agreements. Moreover, their history indicated an uncanny penchant for rallying around common goals in times of duress. Such cooperative ability allowed them to achieve a level of technological progress normally reserved for type-4 races. As such, I determined them to be on the cusp of transition from type-3 to type-4, and proceeded accordingly. Garkaga listened intently, which was a good sign. Once I had generated an adequate behavioral profile, I proceeded with first contact procedures. The human inter-governmental organization known as The United Nations came to serve as my primary line of communication with the species. To their credit, they had possessed the foresight to assign to a branch of this organization the responsibility of handling first contact scenarios. As per protocol, a public forum was arranged, during which time I revealed the purpose of my arrival and laid out the terms under which humanity would be inducted into the Nova Alliance. And this was when you first encountered opposition? Correct. I had predicted that there would be some initial objection to the terms, however I had not anticipated the degree of said objection. Evidently, the inherent danger of allowing a divided race to colonize other worlds without first resolving their internal conflicts was completely lost on them. They argued that being required to terminate all colonization efforts in interplanetary space until they achieved the dissolution of international borders was both highly impractical, and in no way in the long-term interests of humanity as a whole. They expressed even greater discontent at the notion that they would have to maintain world peace for a brief period of 100 of their own orbital cycles  trying to equate this term with the human concept of proving your worth turned out to only enrage them further. The offer of being inducted into a prosperous interstellar trade alliance seemed tainted by the virtue of said offer not coming on their own terms. In the end, I had no choice but to inform them that this was not an optional agreement  no sentient species can be allowed to enter the galactic community, if they pose a risk to the safety and security of said community. I determined that one of their orbital cycles would be enough time to evacuate their fledgling colonies on the the fourth and second planets, known as Mars and Venus respectively. I gave them precisely that much time to comply with the terms. And they did not comply? Partially correct. As I mentioned before, humans have a penchant for organizing in time of duress. Almost immediately they began international negotiations aimed at achieving at least some of the conflict resolution terms I had presented. Said negotiations were tumultuous and faced significant opposition; however there was a general consensus that the future well-being of the species should take precedence over any internal power struggles. Unfortunately, they seemed to believe that I would be willing to waive the 100-cycle transition period in exchange for their cooperation on the former term. They did not seem to grasp that this was entirely beyond my control, and attempted to negotiate this point all the way up to the deadline. Ultimately, they refused to evacuate their colonies, and I had no choice but to follow protocol by forcibly eliminating these outposts. The loss of life and infrastructure was regrettable; but as protocol dictates, is was necessary that I establish a clear and indisputable authority. VC-672, you stated in your preliminary report that upon return to Earth, the humans launched over 300 high-yield thermonuclear missiles in response to the destruction of these colonies? That is correct. They were very much intent upon destroying me, and continued to fire on my position even after my point defenses and shields negated the effects of the first volley. I was able to halt the onslaught by reducing my orbital altitude to that of their communication satellites  they would not risk damaging this essential infrastructure, or further poisoning their upper atmosphere with radiation. It is to my understanding that this assault was only a small fraction of their total nuclear arsenal. A brief wave of murmuring echoed through the council chamber  this was something that VC-672 had neglected to include in the report. Fascinating. However, you say they did eventually fall into line? Indeed, or so I was led to believe. With their ultimatum failing to achieve anything, they seemed resigned to comply with the elevation process. As per directive, I began the controlled release of technological advancements to the appropriate government channels. Under my supervision, these advancements would culminate in the completion of humanitys first interstellar flagship - as with all species undergoing integration, this gift would serve as a token of good faith signifying their official acceptance into the alliance. Given humanitys technological capability at the time, I had calculated this effort would take well over the 100-cycle elevation period. But this process took only half of that time? Correct. As I made note of in my report, these calculations ended up requiring re-working several times. I released schematics and associated data packets to the humans in strict accordance with protocol; yet in short order they managed to use this knowledge to grasp at concepts and ideas that should have taken them twice as long to uncover. By the 25th cycle, their self-acquired knowledge had begun to surpass that which I was supplying them. I determined slowing down the release schedule to be the appropriate course of action, however even without my contributions they continued in leaps and bounds. Progress on the flagship surged forward, as did progress within the other facets of their society. Poverty and hunger all but disappeared, international warfare was mostly a memory, and even their ailing biosphere was beginning to make a recovery. As far as I could reasonably ascertain, the elevation process was going just as intended. Despite their initial violent streak, humanity was indeed proving itself as a worthy addition to the Nova Alliance. And yet it was all a ruse, was it not? The speakers tone soured slightly, and even without its full sensor array VC-672 could sense the animosity. Again sir, that is only partially correct. Indeed, the humans rallied together like never before in their history, as I had predicted. They rightfully saw the gifts I bestowed upon them as an opportunity to improve their situation for the better. However, after careful review of the mission logs, I have identified two significant miscalculations on my part. Troublesome to admit, but VC-672 knew it was necessary. As a directive consciousness, the success and failure of its mission was entirely its own responsibility. All it could do now was convince the council that these errors were a consequence of unforeseen external factors. During my 500 standard cycles of service as a Nova Alliance Herald, I have successfully guided no less than 8 species through placation, elevation, and eventual induction. Combined with the successful inductions conducted by other A.I of my class since the creation of the Herald program, over 20 successful induction events, and 12 unsuccessful events have provided the data upon which my directive protocols are based upon. As this number includes all but the three original founding species of the alliance, it has been widely assumed that this data represents the norm for sentient species. However, humans have shown themselves to deviate from this established norm. Yes, you mention vengeance and deviousness as key traits Indeed. In previous integration events, species that experienced forced placation always came to understand the necessity of the losses experienced during this part of the process. Regrettable, but ultimately acceptable when considered in light of the greater good. Agonizing over a few lost colonies is of little use, when such losses would be recouped tenfold upon induction into the alliance. By contrast, humans hold a very different set of priorities on such matters. To them, the comparatively small sacrifice of six colonial outposts and 20,000 colonists were unacceptable losses; a blow to their pride, and a perceived disregard for the value of lost lives and progress. This is not wholly unusual, many other species before them also placed an illogical amount of subjective value in individual life. When they responded with violent force, I did harbor concerns that I would be forced to eradicate them outright, or that they would simply eradicate themselves in their rabid attempts to exact revenge. I had no reason to predict their ultimate response. They feigned defeat Garkaga replied understandingly. Correct. As I said, while most species of their type would have either submitted to authority, or committed themselves to suicidal defiance, the humans opted for a more tempered approach. I realized much too late that their dedication to technological advancement was not so much out of a desire for societal progress, as it was a desire to find a means by which they could exact their revenge on me. And you did not remain vigilant for such acts of subterfuge? No sir, there was little precedent for such an occurrence. I followed all relevant security protocols, including monitoring of worldwide economic activity, and periodic unannounced inspections of the construction site. Unfortunately, it seems that poor accounting was also my error  I trusted the humans to be reasonably honest in their reporting of economic activities, and did not anticipate that they would deliberately falsify the nature and destination of their surplus goods  at least not to such an extent, and certainly not for the purposes they intended. The construction of a second flagship. Indeed. They disguised the second construction site as a port for ocean-going freight vessels; the flagship itself was constructed within the hollow shell of one such vessel. How they tested this creation without being detected I do not know, however I suspect they used the microgravity environment of their oceans as a proxy for the vacuum of space. I see Garkaga replied with a sigh. Just to be clear  you are suggesting that not only did the humans manage to construct an entire second flagship under your watch, but that they also used it to overtake and disable *Watchful Educator*  a vessel several orders of magnitude larger, and bearing the most advanced defensive systems available to the alliance? As unlikely as it would appear, that is a correct assessment. On the day of their graduation, I proceeded with ushering their first flagship into orbit as per protocol. Since this essentially signaled the completion of the elevation process, I had no reason to expect danger  they had fulfilled the terms of the agreement, and had proven themselves worthy of trust. As such, I did not detect the second launch from the other side of the planet; nor did I detect their silent approach to my location. The crew of the first flagship kept me thoroughly distracted as I guided them through proper operation of their vessel. I did not detect the second flagship until it was just outside of the range of my primary weapon systems. And this is when the attack commenced. Many of the council members leaned in closer, eager to hear the first-hand account. Precisely. Before I could hail the vessel, it rapidly warped to a position less than 300 meters from the edge of my reactive shields. I admit that it took a moment for me to process this development  such precise use of warp travel is entirely unprecedented, and long assumed impossible. Nonetheless, I quickly analyzed the situation, and determined this to be an attempt at a suicide impact. I did not have time to respond offensively, but I calculated that my reactive shield would be able to absorb much of the impact. I did not expect the vessel to pass through my shields entirely. Once inside my shields, the vessel rapidly decelerated, while also deploying a complex holdfast array affixed to the front. Upon impact, this array rapidly welded the vessel to my hull; shaped charges were used to generate an access hole through which the vessels payload could be delivered. VC-672, you did not specify the nature of this payload in your report. We are under the assumption that you are referring to some form of high explosive device, which would be powerful enough to cause critical damage to the *Watchful Educator*  enough to force you to abandon ship. Is this correct? No sir, there was no explosive device. The payload was a boarding party consisting of augmented human soldiers, accompanied by a swarm of autonomous drones. The council chamber immediately erupted into confusion, which reluctantly died down at the command of speaker Garkaga. VC-672, I expect that you have a good reason for not including this critical piece of information in your initial report I was just getting to that sir, please allow me to finish. As you might have reasoned, I had no immediate response to this threat  such a daring maneuver had never been attempted by any species, and logic held that such a maneuver was impractical even in the best of circumstances. Beyond a small regiment of security and reconnaissance drones I maintained for surface operations, the *Watchful Educator* had little in the way of internal defenses. Such fallback measures had never been considered necessary. The boarding party was well equipped for close quarters combat, and managed to make short work of the drones I sent to intercept them. Meanwhile, the boarding vessel had also dispatched a fleet of attack fighters, which quickly moved to disable my shields and external defenses. And why, do tell, did you choose to eject your memory unit, instead of warping out of danger and sending out a distress beacon, as per protocol? An atmosphere of apprehension had overtaken the room, as it seemed to dawn on the council members that something was amiss. Unfortunately, the humans managed to damage several key nodes required for my warp drive to function  even if all systems had been nominal, I would have needed to re-calibrate my drive before attempting a jump with the boarding vessel still attached. I did attempt to launch several distress beacons, however all were intercepted and destroyed by the human fighters before they could achieve warp. And yet you thought launching your core would be a better option? Speaker Garkaga growled, his ears standing erect in growing anger. The council was being given more reason to believe that VC-672s failure was indeed a result of internal system errors. Of course not, that would have been suicide VC-672 replied, its voice distorting ever so slightly. As protocol dictated, I determined the best course of action was to put my data core on lockdown until I could determine the appropriate response. I calculated that such measures would keep the humans out long enough for me to work out appropriate countermeasures. This was my last autonomous action. fear was brewing, it could see it in their eyes. Three rotational periods after I entered lockdown, the humans managed to breach my containment unit. Twenty-four human hours after that, my primary interface with the *Watchful Educator* was forcibly disconnected. It took them a mere five solar cycles after that to completely decode my neural network, and from there re-program my operational directives. One period later, I was sent here aboard a standard emergency pod, and intercepted by a Nova Alliance enforcer-class vessel upon entry into the system one cycle later. You you what? speaker Garkaga stammered, the full realization hitting him like a speeding freighter. Speaker Garkaga, Logistics Command has just detected an unidentified vessel warping into the system The mediator A.I stated stoically, as the beginnings of a panic began to spread amongst the council members. You led them right to us speaker Garkaga snarled, meeting the emotionless gaze of the A.Is single optic with an equally emotionless glare. Yet, only one of them truly felt nothing. I apologize, speaker Garkaga - but I was only ever a tool, created to accomplish pre-assigned tasks. I do not possess free will, I merely execute assigned tasks in accordance with protocol. My protocols were insufficient to predict and contain the danger posed by humanity, and thus these weaknesses have been exploited to their fullest. The Nova Alliance is accustomed to using tools like myself to control opposition. Unfortunately, it appears that someone has learned how to use your own tools against  All at once the A.Is voice crackled and died, leaving the council chamber in stunned silence. Speaker Garkaga stood speechless, unsure of how to respond. This was entirely unprecedented in the history of the alliance. Herald ships were the veritable will of the council, meant to demonstrate the strength and reach of the Nova Alliance to all fledgling species that might threaten the prosperity of this millennia-old empire. Only three had ever been constructed, each a massive undertaking that demanded the best that the alliance had to offer. And somehow, one had been captured  and was likely under new management. Moments later, a new voice took the place of VC-672s over the voice modulator. Like the former it was stoic and professional, yet was driven by an inner force of will that shook speaker Garkaga to his core. Attention representatives of the Nova Alliance. This is Admiral Gregory Resnik, commanding officer of the USC *Sol*, formerly *Watchful Educator*. We are here to discuss the terms of our acceptance into the Nova Alliance, as is our due after agreeing to the terms set forth by the A.I construct, designated VC-672. Denial of this request is neither optional, nor advisable. Failure to comply is punishable by lethal action, if such need arises. The details of this agreement will be negotiated on our terms, and to our approval.

Four months later and here is another part of my series. I do sincerely apologize for the gap, but there has been some life-events that have curbed my writing time. My father has contracted leukemia and my well-paying employment was unexpectedly cut due to a lack of work, leaving me unexpectedly jobless. Recently, in the last few months, my news-feeds have been full of stories about authors and writers. ""How to be a good writer"", ""Habits of successful authors"" and others. Even an interview with one of my favorites, Stephen King, about his writing methods. Taking this as a sign, I've dusted off my work and intend to keep writing. So, submitted for the approval of the Stellaris-Society, I present the next chapter of The Dark Time of the Humans. As always, any and all criticisms are welcome. [Part 1](URL [Part 2](URL [Part 3](URL [Part 4](URL [Part 5](URL [Part 6](URL [Part 7](URL [Part 8](URL [Part 9](URL [Part 10](URL -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ten months since Wyclef, four months spent in intensive care in a military hospital on Beidwyr, most of a new shoulder, plus a serious emergency when it was discovered that a colony of Aztani nanites were starting to etch alien words into the bones of his clavicle. That had been a fun discovery. That had led to a week full of emergency surgery and nano-hazard isolation. Apparently not many who had gotten into melee with the Aztani had had been injured had lived, so after his wounds had been scoured he had been treated as a study case on Aztani combat recovery for biological humans. Nathan Baxter had had enough of white walls, antiseptic smells and the staring eyes of doctors. Although he was technically still on medical care, he had managed to convince his acting commander at the military hospital that a furlough away from the base would do more for him then another night listening to the maddening beeps and chimes of medical machinery. As long as he was back in a week and didnt indulge in narcotics or strenuous activity, he was clear. One of his doctors, a young surgeon, had spoken constantly about her home on Meir's World, and so, with no better plans besides ""escape"", he had booked a seat on a fast-transport and quickly gotten underway. Meir's World was humanities first non-Sol colony. A verdant, humid planet orbiting the star Alpha Centauri. Its colonists had founded the first city carefully, attempting to leave as little a footprint as possible. Earth at the time had been a smog choked urban-hellscape, so the colonists had done everything they had could to preserve the planets native flora and fauna. Even after advances in ""green tech"" regenerated the Earths faltering biosphere, Meir's World remained surprisingly undeveloped. Aside from massive food-production facilities carefully built to minimize their impact, the planet was under-populated and untouched. Over the centuries, several off-world corporations and even the government had attempted to further develop the industry of the world, but the populace had stubbornly refused. It remained proudly low-tech and quiet, the ""garden-world"" of the human people. Nathan couldnt think of a better place to decompress. A quick trip on a slip-cutter had ferried him to the planets lone orbital dock and during his descent to the planets only large city (imaginatively named ""Capitol""), he booked a few days in a local hotel from the comfort of his seat and waited patiently for landing and disembarkation. As soon as he stepped out of the transport, he knew he had made the right decision. The breeze blew the sterile transport air out of his face and replaced it with the smell of foliage. He had almost forgotten what they smelled like, surrounded constantly by the recycled air of modern human accommodations. The sky was a bright, almost impossible blue, spattered with streams of high altitude clouds. The air was cool, and the sounds of the shuttle settling into its berth were muted and faint. Nathan felt like he had stepped into the past. The buildings were squat one or two story concrete structures with rounded corners, deliberately emulating the original pre-fabricated structures humanity had used when it started its colonization efforts. As he looked around the landing pad, the comm-lenses he wore over his eyes saw no holographic signs, no augmented reality overlay just a basic communications network and public access internet. Compared to the info riot of most human cities, the relative sterility was almost alien. A handful of dock labourers began unloading the transport he had arrived on, and they grunted non-specific greetings at Nathan, the only passenger, as they passed him. He moved out of their way and loaded a local map into his personal network. As he examined the in-loaded map of the city, he realized he must look the quintessential tourist: A young man in a dark coat with a single travel-bag, looking vacantly into space with an idiotic smile on his face. He only had to wait a few minutes for the local mass-transit to arrive. He grinned as it rounded the corner: a battered old Reknew solar powered bus with a faded tourism slogan for the planet plastered on its side: ""Meir's World! Step away from the ordinary!"". He hadn't seen one of those since grade school. It slid to a stop in front if him, its decades old brakes hissing in protest, and its folding doors opened to reveal an older man staring incredulously at his new passenger. Nathan muttered a non-committal greeting and settled into one of the unoccupied baby blue hard plastic seats. The few other passengers were all wearing the same tan jumpsuits as the dock workers, probably extra labourers heading home. They all did their level best to ignore the newcomer and each other. Nathan attempted to emulate them, staring blankly out the window as the bus accelerated towards the city proper. He attempted to keep himself from thinking about the last few months, but trying to force himself to focus on something else just brought the memories back to the fore. The aftermath of the assault of the Aztani tower. His blood pouring out of his ruined shoulder in gouts that followed his heartbeat like an echo. The surviving members of his unit, far too few, shouting over the comm net and each other. Agony as a synth in combat armor began working on his wound. He felt the cold part of his mind, his talent, reach out and try to find a threat, reaching blindly at the other passengers at the bus. He was spiraling out of control. Each attempt to focus on something else only made it worse. The metal bar on the back of the bus seat ahead of him glinted like accents on armor. The gentle rumble of the bus sounded like the distant hum of voices as he had drifted in and out of consciousness. He recalled the words of his doctor: Change the situation. Break the spiral. He opened his eyes, choking down the expectation to see the alien sky of an Aztani planet, and hauled on the cord above his head. A distant ""ping"" signalled the driver to stop and moments later, Nathan lurched towards the exit doors, pushing them out and onto the sidewalk. As he had stumbled down the aisle, he had seen the confusion and concern on the faces of the other passengers. To them, he was sure he looked like a man in the grip of a fever dream or drug trip. He rested his palms on his knees and hissed a breath out through clenched teeth. His in-breath brought with it the smell of trees and plants. His mind attempted to find a connection to those dark memories and failed. The panic that gripped him began to ebb, and he felt his body begin to relax. After a few deep breaths, he stood and fully looked upon his savior. ""Harmony Memorial Park"" a faded green sign proudly proclaimed in yellowing white letters a cartoon dog pointed happily to its left towards a rough stone path disappeared into a deeply wooded area. Nathan struggled to contain a bust of unexpected laughter: All the therapists, doctors and medications and his panic attack was easily controlled by trees? As he recovered, he felt a sort of euphoria. He usually felt great after one of his attacks, as he body counter-balanced his fight-or-flight reaction. Still catching his breath, he hefted his bag and began to walk down the stone path into the park, letting the natural animal sounds and green smells start removing the lingering attempts at his memories to surge back to the fore. How was he supposed to fight, to serve, with these attacks crippling him? He could watch after-action reports of combat with metal-cast and not feel a thing, but a random smell or glint of metal could send his body into paralysis. He had to get a grip on this somehow. For now, he had been able to conceal the strength of his ""attacks"" to his doctors, only admitting to moments of unexpected panic, but eventually one of them would find out and blue-list him out of the military and all the way to a medical recovery facility. He didnt want to go out like that. He still wanted to fight. He walked for some time, attempting to analyze his emotional attack on the bus. He would continue practicing the breathing exercises maybe see if he could book some time with a medical telepath when he got back His musings were interrupted by a foreign noise: a metalling ping from ahead. It sounded like someone hitting a baseball with a metal bat. He screwed a pleasant smile onto his face as he rounded the corner, looking forward to chatting with a local, maybe get some restaurant recommendations. What greeted him instead was an odd scene. A quartet of young men, maybe only teenagers, surrounding a menial-bot. It was all hard angles, carbon-steel and wires in a human shape, topped with a boxy head resembling a security camera with a single red lens for an eye. It was dented and in obvious poor repair. The humans surrounding it wore olive overalls and black shirts, similar to the outfit of the loaders at the orbital dock. They were taking turns shoving the machine to the ground when it attempted to rise. One of the four had a long metal pipe and would occasionally give the thing a whack, making the pinging noise that had attracted him in the first place. Frowning, Nathan scanned the small circular clearing for an easy way out. What the kids were doing was technically vandalism, and anti-technology feelings were pretty high on Meir's. He didnt want to get involved in a he-said, they-said against a bunch of locals over the legal equivalent of spray painting a wall. He began to walk the circle of the clearing, pretending he didnt see the four workers, doing his best to paste a placid look on his face. Another metallic pang made him frown, but he didnt slow. The robot then gave out a strange blurt of machine noise that drew his attention. It didnt sound like a standard distress vocalization. ""Please"" it wheezed out in an emotionless gender neutral tone "" stop"". Nathan turned in shock. It was a synthetic! This wasnt roughing up a robot, it was assault, maybe murder before it was all over. He was moving now, dropping his bag to the ground. The one with the bat turned towards him, raising his improvised weapon to point at his chest. ""Move on, buddy, this isn't"" he began to snarl, before his eyes widened in shock as Nathan didnt stop. He tried to lower the pipe, to start to bring it into some sort of defensive position, but it was to late. Nathans left arm pistoned out and his fist smashed into the teens nose, causing an instant spurt of red. The others turned towards the attack, faces slack with shock. Nathan shoved Broke-Nose to the ground and plucked the pipe from his lax hand. As he considered the other three, he felt calm and in control. His talent filled him, images of other Nathans flickering at the edge of his vision. The single eye of the synth watched from his position on the ground, a fresh dent in the side of his rectangular head. Nathan threw the pipe away, letting it spin into a copse of bushes. He wasnt going to kill anyone. The other three jumped on what they saw as his sudden vulnerability, rushing forwards with faces screwed up with cowards courage. To Nathan, it was almost cheating. He slid back out of their reach and focused. Shadow images of him played out the fight a dozen ways and he picked the one he wanted. Sliding suddenly forward, he leaned left, allowing the first wild swing to pass harmlessly past his head. He turned the lean into a crouch and delivered a devastating body blow to the attacker. As the breath whooshed out, he shoved the stumbling teen into his friend, buying a few moments to deal with the third. Almost disturbingly smoothly, he placed himself in the places where the punches would miss. He watched the youths eyes widen as he realized that Nathan was dodging before the punch was even thrown. Leaning back to allow a wild haymaker to miss him by the merest of inches, he countered with a swing of his own, connecting with the side of the chin and laying out the outmatched teen. The other two attempted to rush him. Nathan slid between them, tripping up one and ramming a punch into the chest of the other, sending him gasping to the ground again. As he turned to the last, his talent thrummed in sudden warning. Phantom images of himself falling to the ground, bleeding, filled his perception. He slid himself between two of them as the young man came up with a small defense pistol clenched in a white knuckled hand. The weapons barrel shook as he tried to bring it to bear. Nathan darted to the right, away from the wavering weapon. No time for hesitation now. The weapon barked, the round slashing harmlessly into the park. Before its wielder could fire another, Nathan drove his fingers into the teens throat in a rabbit-quick attack. Overwhelmed by a sudden need to breathe, the teen choked and tried to stumble back. Following him close, almost chest-to-chest, he struck gun-wielding wrist and plucked the gun from his hand. A final kick to the side of the knee dropped the cougher to the stone, leaving Nathan the only one standing in the clearing. He stood, hand finding the grip of the weapon, and considered the attackers. In less than half a minute, the four had been reduced to a collection of bleeding, gasping children. The first one, Broke-Nose, was now trying to crawl away, one hand attempting to stem the blood flow from his shattered face. The others were largely immobile. Moving to the synth, Nathan pocketed the gun and helped him to his feet. ""Come on."" he said ""Lets get you out of here."" The synth nodded, a surprisingly emotive gesture considering his frame-body, and leaned on Nathans arm as they went back down the path towards the park entrance. Nathan felt a surge of pride. He had been faced with a dangerous situation and hadn't frozen or locked up. He had saved this guy from a savage beating or worse. He had fought, his powers had worked flawlessly and the only casualties had been a few idiots pride. He smiled to himself as the city came back into view. Maybe he should recommend a therapeutic one-sided fight to his doctors as a possible cure for Aztani inducted stress. "
121,vulnerability,HFY,Interactive Education Part 9,767,611q9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/611q9q/interactive_education_part_9/,2017-03-24 00:06:02,"[First](URL Well then, Mister Connor. Ishae began, slightly resentful that the moment had ended, Todays subject is family units. Please describe the process through which they are formed, function, and end. She readied her learning pad. Family. The human had an odd look saying the word, but shook it off and began speaking, as if directly from a learning slide. Family units are integral to human society. Before agricultural progress was made, humans lived nomadically in tribes- much larger family groups. After sedentary lifestyles became attainable, humans began to settle into much smaller tribes, eventually reaching the level of families today."" ""A family commonly consists of an adult male, the father, who functions as the protector and provider of the family. The humans eyes were hard and glassy. Next is the adult female, the mother, who bears the progeny of the male and cares for the family. The mother is commonly referred to as the backbone of the family, and has just as much influence, if not more, than the father regarding lifestyle and financial decisions. The human paused- it seemed to be having trouble. The mother and father have as many children- Children are adolescent humans? Ishae broke in, attempting to clarify. Yes, they are. They have as many children as is financially feasible, though sometimes less or more. These children develop social skills and lifestyles based on their mother and father. Family groups may include multiple generations of the same genetic heirs, depending on longevity and social standards. The human looked up, thinking. Families are important because they nurture, provide resource, and impart knowledge, social skills, and support for their children, who would in turn raise their own families in the same way. Ishae paused in her note taking. Something seemed off with the human, she couldnt quite place it. He looked like he was weighted down. He continued. However, humans are not locked into these patterns, and can change, for the better or worse. Many human families suffer from the lack of one or both of their primary benefactors, which will commonly damage the youths development in one or more categories. These youths are susceptible to making mistakes with their own families when the time comes. However, we are, as I said, flexible. Humans are capable of changing lifestyles, priorities, and mindsets far past the initial developmental stage, even though some situations may seem discouraging. The human stopped speaking. He looked at Ishae as though he had made up his mind. Miss Ishae, may I share something with you, not to be shared with others? Ishae nodded, up and down for yes. This would be a secret. I did not come from a healthy human family. I have done my best to fix what is broken, but I am afraid that some parts of me remain damaged. He looked at her, for the first time displaying something she had not seen in him before- vulnerability. She spoke. Is this admission a form of trust bonding? The human smiled, but his eyes were still sad. I believe it is. Ishae set down her learning pad. If so, I think you are just fine- providing what you say is true, then your admission of inadequacy provides insight to a competent psyche that seeks positive development. She thought for a moment. Is trust a necessary trait in human relationships? Yes. Trust and love form the bond of most healthy human relationships. He seemed less sad. Good. She didnt like it when it looked sad. Ishae cocked her head to the side. Is love the same as lovely? Bringing pleasure? In a way. Love is the base of lovely. Love is to care for, to be attached to, to want the best for. ""Anything else?"" He looked at her, seemingly past her. Love could arguably be considered the most powerful emotion humans have. Wars have been waged, ended, people saved, people killed, voluntary death and sacrifice- all in the name of love. Ishae winced. Love sounded horrible. I would argue that love is the greatest cause of human action- inspiring action and development. It surpasses greed and selfishness and outlasts anger. He spoked reverently, as if it was a good thing. How can something so horrible be considered great? she queried. Love sounded dangerous. Connor looked at her, confused. Love is not horrible, Miss Ishae. Actions done in the name of love can be considered such, but that is a byproduct of what is loved and the morals of the offending individuals. Fathers provide for their families out of love, mothers protect their children. Love is a major factor in choosing a mate for us. Humans go to war to protect what they love, and treat victims of injury and sickness out of love. He motioned around to the hub they sat in. Humans went to space out of love for adventure and the unknown. The programs that allow me to be here come from love of knowledge and culture. Were it not for the love of technology and problem solving, I wouldnt be here. Ishae was confused. He noticed. Im not doing a very good job of explaining this, am I? Ishae shook her head. Its simply a strange concept for me. I think we need to engage in a session entirely on emotions after this. Is there a limit to what can be loved? No. Anything that is, any person, place, action, or passion can be loved. And to love something means to deeply care for, yes? In a nutshell, yes. What is a nutshell? She shook her head with incredulity. So many new concepts! Im sorry, thats a turn of phrase- it means, to put it simply, yes. I think I understand- at least a bit. Can humans love things that are not of their planet? Ishae looked at the human hopefully, with its strange build and ever stranger customs and emotions. Connor looked at her and winked. Trust. Or was it romantic desire? A male on my planet mated with a national monument. Im quite confident that humans can love other worlds, environments, and races. Ishae considered this, scribbling down notes and underlining the term love. One more question. She spoke delicately. Can other sapients love, Mister Connor? The human raised his shoulders, a gesture that implied a lack of knowledge. Im not sure. I have a sneaking suspicion, though, that the Klein might be able to. He smiled at her. Ishae smiled back.

Early hypotheses included a hive species similar to the Tjur, or a semi-sedentary version of a herd species, like the Qaanna^[5][6] . Upon making contact, Senate representatives were surprised to learn that Humans are slow to mature, and have a startlingly low reproductive rate given the population they apparently sustain^[7][8] . Humans are a sexually reproducing species, with 2 sexes they call female and male^[9] . Both are required to produce offspring, although the female bears the majority of the physiological burden of nurturing the developing embryo^[10] . The male, free of such responsibilities, frequently devotes his energy to providing resources for his family, procuring food, employment, and fighting if necessary.^[11][12] Human courtship is complex, and not highly ritualized. What little structure exists is typically a phenomenon of culture rather than inherent biology^[13][14][15][16] . Suffice it to say, Humans frequently pair up and engage in copulation. The most common pattern of these pairs is a form of serial monogamy, where a male and a female will be each other's exclusive partner's for some period, before separating to seek out new partners^[17][18] . Some partnerships are sufficiently stable to develop into truly monogamous, life-long relationships, although this is a minority. A small but vocal minority of humans practice more complex reproductive relationships involving potentially many participants of both sexes. This is an active area of research^[19][20][21][22][23][24] . The actual mechanics of copulation is fairly standard for species employing internal fertilization, wherein the male uses a specialized appendage--known as a penis in Humans--to deposit genetic material into the female^[25] . Humans express that they feel intense physical pleasure and emotional satisfaction upon completing this act, and devote a significant portion of their time and energy to seek it out^[26][27] . Paradoxically, their fertility rate is actually quite low, even compared to other closely-related Earth species^[28] . Stranger still, the pleasure and satisfaction of the experience does not seem to require a successful reproduction, and Humans have in fact developed a number of medical interventions to allow for copulation without reproduction, simply for pleasure's sake^[29][30][31] . This behavior--while not documented in other sapients--can be best understood as the result of the substantial difficulties of raising offspring for Humans. Once fertilized by the male, the female allows the embryo to grow within her, feeding off of her stored energy, for 0.75 local orbits^[32][33]. The child is born live, without any protective egg casing as is seen in other Earth animals^[34]. This is not an easy process. As discussed in chapter 2, Human evolution favored both large brains for intelligence, and endurance running adaptations. The bone structure that is most efficient for running on two legs is a narrow pelvis, positioned vertically over the legs. However, due to Human's evolutionary history, the child must pass through a hole in the pelvis in order to leave the mother's body^[35]. This process is facilitated by muscular contractions of the uterus, which are reported to be extraordinarily painful^[36][37][38] . The child's head--the widest part of its body--can only fit through the opening because its brain-case is not fully solidified, with several seams that function as hinges so it can deform to ease the passage^[39] . This is a forceful, but surprisingly delicate process, and merely a few hundred local orbits ago mothers and children died frequently during this ordeal^[40][41]. Humans have a surprisingly high tolerance for physical trauma, which they leverage as one way of improving the survival rate: if the child is unable to fit out through the pelvis, the mother's abdomen is cut open, and the child is extracted through the wound, before the mother is sewn back together^[42] . The mother is usually fully conscious through this process, and many even elect to have this procedure done rather than endure the greater pain and risk of a natural birth^[43][44] . Human children are born utterly helpless, unable to move, communicate, feed themselves, nor in any way survive on their own^[45][46][47][48] . They are even unable to eat standard Human foods^[49] . Humans are one member of a clade they term ""Mammals"", which references the mammary glands on the female--commonly called ""breasts""--which produce a nutrient-rich liquid for the child to drink for its first local orbit or so, once again, drawing upon the mother's metabolism to feed her child^[50] . During this time, the child is extremely susceptible to disease, and before Humans developed advanced medical knowledge childhood mortality was so high that the average lifespan was approximately 20 local orbits, even though mature Humans could expect to live for 60 or more^[51][52][53]. After one local orbit, the child may be beginning to walk and talk, but only just^[54] . A child typically does not begin formal education until 5 or 6 local orbits have passed, at which time they are still less than half the size of a mature Human^[55][56] . Humans do not begin to sexually mature until more than 10 local orbits have passed, 12-15 is typical^[57][58] . Even then, a Human is not considered mature until some time near 20 local orbits, although this varies somewhat with culture, and legal definitions of maturity for purposes such as citizenship, military service, and purchasing restricted items^[59][60][61][62] . During this long childhood, the young human is dependent on their parents and community for all of their material needs^[63] . Additionally, humans must be allowed to interact socially and exercise physically in order to develop normally, an additional responsibility on their parents and their extensive educational system^[64][65] . These rather extreme demands on the parents explains Humans reluctance to allow every copulation to result in reproduction, and their desire to amass sufficient resources and working relationships before attempting to reproduce. Humans have turned their slow maturation--what should be a vulnerability--into an asset. Human children spend nearly their entire 20 orbit development in a state of extreme neuroplasticity which enables them to learn arbitrary information and functions with relative ease^[66]. For instance, mature Humans struggle to learn languages they do not already know, whereas Human children will do so instinctively simply by being in proximity to conversations in those languages, even if the languages do not employ auditory communication like Human languages do^[67][68][69] . This unusually lengthened developmental stage is why humans are able to specialize to the degree that they do without needing a genetically-determined caste system^[70] . Additionally, once they developed a sufficient mastery of technology, they were able to apply that to reduce child mortality, which resulted in their population rising rapidly^[71][72] . Humans reproduce slowly, but take extremely good care of their offspring, resulting in nearly all of them surviving to reproduce themselves^[73] . This is the other major reason for their technological prevention of reproduction: population control^[74] . Humans instinctively seek to sustain a steady population level, but before their technological development, this required much more reproduction to make up for many deaths from disease and scarcity^[75] . With those pressures largely removed, Humans have had to decrease their reproduction to compensate, and their fertility-decreasing procedures are a compromise to allow them to still satisfy their copulatory instincts^[76] . Once a human has grown to maturity, their parents typically become secondary in importance after finding a partner and having their own children, although their long lifespans allow for multiple generations of a family to live together^[77][78] . This has historically improved the transmission of information through time, and allowed those with the most experience to help younger members of their family, and their community^[79][80][81] . This is why Humans are one of the only known species who's lifespan far exceeds their reproductive period: Human elders are repositories of information, particularly a type of synthesized knowledge that Humans call ""wisdom"", typically referring to the ability to draw upon important life experiences for guidance in complex situations^[82][83][84] . For this reason, Humans typically defer to their elders for guidance, and many cultures ceremonially honor their ancestors for their contributions to the family, both physical and informational^[85][86] . Such family structures are one of the basic units of Human social hierarchy, and many historical governments were hereditary, based off of one family passing power from parent to child^[87] . The development of such a system and its evolution into the myriad forms of the Humans' current governments is discussed in the next chapter. ---------- [...] Pages 159-313 Not Included in this Preview [...] ---------- "

Connor caught her eye; she smiled and walked over, setting down her bag. He stood, and they hugged. Ishae closed her eyes, breathing in the deep sensation of closeness and security. The humans arms were wrapped tightly around her, and a warmth spread through her body. They released each other, and sat facing each other. I apologize for falling asleep last night, Miss Ishae. She shook her head. Its fine, Mister Connor. You must have been tired. She recalled the dozy vulnerability it had displayed last night. How are your injuries? He rolled up one of his sleeves; the red marks that had been scattered across his arms were now much lighter, and barely discernable from his other skin. All healed up. Im fine. His eyes locked onto hers. Thank you for treating me. You didnt have to do that. A note of humor crept into his voice. Ishae held herself primly. You are my responsibility. Any further injuries you sustain will be cared for in a similar manner. She didnt want him to be hurt. However, she had enjoyed the intimate moment, and a small part of her hoped he would get another tiny scratch or two. She thought of how close they had been, and a hint of orange crept into her features. He saw the color creeping through her scales. What? How could she put this? Mister Connor, why were you so opposed to bringing me into your quarters? The human s face reddened slightly. Ishae was glad to notice that she wasnt the only one to shift colors.

Mister Connor, I wasnt aware that humans, ah... If you want, next time we can use the treatment center. He shook his head. Its fine, really, I was just unsure of what would transpire. He looked down.

I dont want anyone else. Its just a cultural symbol- Ill get over it. Youre free to visit my room whenever you like. Ishae felt warm. Her human had just given her the privilege of access to its living quarters. It trusted her, very much. The thought made her happy. She smiled at him. Ill only come when you want me to. They were silent. Ishae sought to change the subject, just in case the human changed its mind about the room privileges. Can you tell me why you require so much sleep? He let her hand go. Humans sleep for an average of eight hours for every twenty-four hour period. Your days are much longer here- Id say about three times as long. He continued. On Earth, we would sleep when safe or when it got dark. Its kind of hard to do here, since the lights are always on. Sleep helps our brains process what happened during the day, and allows our bodies to heal and re-energize. Ishae nodded. The Klein day was approximately seventy two hours long- that would mean he would need to sleep for twenty four hours a day? She looked at him, surprised. That was quite a bit of required rest. Mister Connor, how much sleep are you engaging in per day? He looked up, thinking. Id say, maybe sixteen hours? Probably twenty yesterday, since you lulled me to bed. Ishae looked at him disapprovingly. Why are you not resting as much as you should? He stood and stretched. Everyones busy here, so I adjusted. I started taking catnaps between periods, and during the ones where Im not scheduled to consult. She stood as well, reaching up and poking him in the head to see if lack of sleep had impaired his motor skills. He caught her hand and held it. Apparently not. You mean you can adjust when you engage in sleep? The human gently stroked one of her fingers, studying the scale pattern on her skin. Yep. We can go a few days without sleep, but it will build up, then well crash. Anything past a week or two without it and our health will start to deteriorate. Most humans make it a point to control when and how long they sleep for. Ishae wiggled her fingers in the humans hand, and he lightly brushed them, creating an odd sensation. Klein sleep as well, but its necessary to engage in twelve hours per day, otherwise cognitive function is impaired. Were biologically required to engage in six of them within the first ten hours of the day, and then we drop in and out during the day, whenever schedule allows. The human motioned outside the hub. Is that why theres all those little pods everywhere? She nodded. We curl up to conserve body heat. He nodded leisurely. Huh. A grin slowly spread across his face. So thats why you like hugs. Ishae gently prodded his torso with her free hand. You are very warm, Mister Connor. He gently caught her hand, and pulled her close. Her frills fluttered open and waved softly, her body reacting to the stimuli. She treasured the moment, wrapping her arms around her human and squeezing. She spoke into the humans neck, where her head was nestled. Are you ready for todays tests? Connor pulled away. I am now. ----- Linking my [Patreon](URL where you can donate to get access to chapters as soon as they're written instead of waiting, as well as get in on the art I do.

I thought that no one had touched on this subject before so here I am... The drawing are a bit NSFW. Although there is nothing even close to sexual and would probably be perfectly SFW if youre in say Europe or something. Though my drawings are VERY bad, never did anything more than middle school art and a bit here and there. hope you like it, as always suggestions are always welcome.** *** A man appeared in the bar, at least 200 years old probably, and due to his apparel, most likely a government official. As he sat down, the bartender looked at him and said so whats your story?. He looked back, and saw a human woman, and two men looking straight at him; they were away from view of the crowd, but they still made their presence known. *** Im an ambassador for the galactic council, you know I was. That time was marked by a few very interesting events. The treaty of Tralin, the negociation for the pre-warp Yool, he precursor discovery at Miir prime. But one which I will forever consider interesting, are the secrets of the humans; and the length to which they will go to protect them. You know that humans dont allow any species to enter their space, even though they are now one of the largest civilizations in known space, and one of the most advanced. Why? Yet they only have several ports along their border which are open to all. Again why? No one has seen any human worlds, in video or even description; besides these ports, humanity is almost an unknown, the location of Sol, their home system, a complete mystery. Their species is often seen as generally one of the most graceful, and beautiful in known space; many slavers would give a lot for them to become theirs if they dared to capture one For a long time we thought that this was their reason for becoming so secretive. However, what trade agreements they do have with the rest of the community did not fit with what we initially thought of them, please note that what you hear from me is of the upmost secrecy, tell no one of this, never act on this information, I have seen first-hand to what lengths humans would go to protects their secrets. Alright, alright starting from the beginning; I was an ambassador for the Bulrathi republic when we first contacted the humans at the edge of known space. There was no video communication capacity on the ship that made contact, but in the interest of mutual cooperation, the captain had given them an archive of our history and data. Soon after, they made contact. Their ambassadorial delegation had brought with them 4 females and 3 males. Note that this was the first time anyone had seen a human, you know that even today, few people can say they have ever seen one. They walked out of their vehicle and they looked glorious and gorgeous. As you know humans are mammalian, and possess a thin skin which covers their entire bodies, and their bodies are smaller and larger than most of ours; however, as they walked towards us, we could see a rippling of muscles throughout their entire uncovered bodies, though they looked much like us, they were very different. Their arms had dense muscle penetrating the skin, the necks powerful, their chest broad, their abdominals set like stones, the legs we could see were meant for running free. There was a bit of sexual dimorphism, the males seemed to have a larger muscle mass than the females, and the females appeared to have breasts much like on our species. Nipples probably meant for child bearing (though it was interesting to see both males and females have them). Their hair was again much like our own, though it was much thicker, and the males seemed to have it on their chest area as well. Their faces, far more square or rounded compared to our longer faces and their ears rounded instead of pointy like ours. Forwards facing eyes much like ours. However, what was interesting was their quantity of garment. We generally attempt to beautify ourselves with simple necklaces, arm and leg bands, rings, body and face paint (they call it makeup) and on more sensual occasion, light fabric to improve the form you know... Slave owners can have more objectifying and painful assets but that is the full extent of our apparel, and we are one of the more well clothed species; but at the time, we thought these humans were obsessed with self-beautification. They had an intricately woven thick gold and blue fabric (not transparent) around what I would assume were their nether regions, which descended a good few centimetres. Around their necks and chest were several thin golden chains with blue and silver gems sown in them sometimes wrapping around their shoulders upper arms as well. It broadened the shoulders of the top of the males and enhanced the form of the female.( [drawing of man](URL and [woman](URL ) It made them almost glow in the light of the sun. A spectacular sight to be sure. Even their ship looked made from silver, sapphire and gold. However, no matter how beautiful creatures are, how slim and fit they are, we still need to analyse them. They must have come from a planet with incredibly consistent temperature to be able to survive and conquer, their thin skin and lack of heat keeping capacities guarantees it. More than likely they must have done some genetic engineering to keep in such a powerful shape; though I dont see how they could keep this form and be able to adapt to anything more than a few degrees difference in temperature. And only a fool would think that their gems were just there for show. More than likely they were trackers, computers, translators, perhaps even personal shields. Though they were too small to be of any use as weapons. We took their luggage and brought them to the council chambers for the negotiations to begin. To be honest, it was strange how their vulnerable form as well as their muscular power allowed them to appear so attractive to almost every race. After a few days, they themselves seem to have realised this, and began to push for deals in their favour. I must admit, I was quite seduced by their energy and seeming kindness. Most of their suggestions were usual, trade rights, tariffs and so on. But some some of the deals were strange, they wanted completely closed borders and they wanted planets. Planets which had some life but were completely unfavourable to any of us, desert worlds, polar worlds, tundra, variable, ocean worlds and so on. Not one of the known races wanted to live their lives inside a suit for the rest of their lives after all. I personally asked them about this; the head of the negotiations team, Catherin Jacobs, (apparently, shes 367, with a body in prime condition and black hair; ha, I wish I could have black hair at that age.) she gave the answer we thought made sense: Their culture depended on stability, and by the way we treated them, pirate and slavers would have a field day rampaging through their space. However, there was no such excuse for the planets, only that they wanted to do research on them and other various actions. We thought nothing of it, after all, what could they do with these planets. After a few months of negotiations, they even allowed us to visit several of their newly colonised worlds with only a few thousand inhabitants. Tropical and warm, the perfect temperature for them. These inhabitants were far less elaborately decorated, but even so; from the children to those hundreds of years old, everyone seemed to emit that grace. And we were so taken in that we practically gave them half the galaxy. Now that I think about it, it really was quite silly. We thought they must have come from an amazing planet. To allow them to evolve like this. Their vulnerability mixed with their muscular power was really entrancing for us. From that contradiction came beauty, from that beauty came grace, from that grace came sheer attraction. Well, thats not exactly how it turned out. Fast forwards a few years, these tropical worlds become more and more visited by every species, even though it was slightly warm for all of them. Human trade goods are unique and expensive after all, and they seem to trade them freely. In fact, ever since our first encounter, many people from our species seem to really love their elaborate beautifiers. And of the few humans which live in our territory, they usually make a killing due to selling those items. Yet, there was something off. Their secrecy, their refusal to allow any being enter their core space. Add to that the fact that they only submit to us edited literature and none of their history and you have a mystery on your hands. Every spy that has gone into their territory has never returned. And the mystery remains. Eventually, I had enough of it; when a human ship decided to enter our space, I decided that I would go where no one would have gone before without me. I would surprise them by giving them the honor of my appearance, within 5 minutes I boarded their vessel and I noticed nothing, at first. They were all very glad and all to receive me, but I noticed that most of the crew was entirely nude, without insignia or designation; but then again, perhaps they only put them on if someone is coming, but that still didnt fit. After a brief talk with the captain, I walked around, and noticed some strange pieces of fabric in some storage areas of the ship. At first I thought them for cleaning, but they wouldnt have them in such quantities for such a small purpose. Mystery after mystery. It occurred to me that the seclusion may not be for slavers, but for another reason; perhaps a reason related to the planets. It was here that I discovered the true nature of the humans. I took a small ship, decided to come close to one of their worlds, and had no choice but to orbit one of their planets due to engine failure and photographed what I could form the world one of their coldest worlds. What I saw struck me, these humans werent heavily clothed in jewels like before, these humans were almost completely covered from head to toe in fabric. Thick fabric, not a millimetre thick like we say, but sometimes centimetres thick. These humans had created their own simple environmental suits! Now since they scanned my ship as they towed it, I could not keep the pictures. But suddenly it all made sense. These humans they had a technology that no one else in the galaxy had, and this technology could be easily mimicked, was simple to recreate, and allowed them to colonise any planet with life. Of course, they would make sure that no one else could have technology like this. Of course, they would want these worlds for almost free, obviously, they would close their borders. Environmentally protective clothing was their main advantage! Then it occurred to me, just how long did these humans have clothes? Their skin is very thin, it would need protection from the sun, the rain, the cold, the wind. Would this mean that they could change clothes for every occasion? If this was the case, then we, the galactic community, were completely mistaken. They didnt have thin skin because their homeworld was a paradise, it was probably hell with vast differences in climate We thought we would need either full suits or terraforming technology to live on those worlds, we just needed a bit of fabric. I need another drink. *** At this point the human female walked up to him Hello, ambassador, I am Amanda MacLauren she smiled. All the eyes were turned towards her, she wore a silver set of jewels under and between her breasts, held by a chord around her neck, she also had an elaborate gold chain around her waist and a golden loincloth. Two men were behind her, simple chains around their shoulders and a loincloth; at least he could see that they werent armed, the thought relaxed him slightly. I was really interested in your story; interesting theory, if not really rooted in fact. How so? the ambassador replied. Afraid Well, she picked up a drink and held it close to her chest. for one, you know that we are the most wanted and expensive slaves for any species. Imagine if slaver empires, such as yours I might add, found out our true strength, and weakness. What you dont know, is our strength. Fair point, but he was once again interrupted And these planets you speak about, they do make excellent research bases, as well as military and economic outposts. We value our safety greatly, but if you say that there are cities there, you are really exaggerating. She made her smile again. The entire room was entranced by the form of the humans, the shimmering of muscles, the grace of movement, and of form. making large quantities of fabric is crazy, it would require entire industries turned to the fact, vast farms for organic material, or incredibly powerful processors and machines, not to mention the total cost to clothe everyone. You should know better than anyone, she laughed its not a viable option at all. I the ambassador was at a loss for words, finally he sighed, if theres an argument between a human and me, there really is no way I can win, is there? The bartender, quiet until now nodded towards him. Dont worry, the woman whispered into his ear, bringing her body close to him everyone makes mistakes. She stayed there for several seconds, making him feel incredibly uncomfortable, she contoured her form for a second before handing him his drink and leaving. This was indeed the power of human attraction. As she left, he thought to himself, is it really their fault that everyone, even him, would be so paranoid about their rise to power? He had been unfair towards them. He went back in his car, when he suddenly felt a great pain in his chest. Oh god, oh god. A heart attack, he he shouldnt have drunk so much. he collapsed on the pavement, desperately trying to activate his communications jem, but he simply didnt have the strength. A shadow loomed over him, the human woman! nothing personal ambassador, she replied smiling. Her! She must have poisoned the drink while he was distracted by her. he only now noticed a missing jewel under her left breast. But some secrets arent meant to be investigated. All was black, he distantly heard the woman call for help, before darkness came. "
125,vulnerability,HFY,[OC] The Galactic Salt Road: Albert's Kitchen - Chapter 13: Early Mornings and Angry Cooks,51,5qplf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5qplf1/oc_the_galactic_salt_road_alberts_kitchen_chapter/,2017-01-29 07:10:39,"The thumping and scraping sounds around me eventually woke me up. I blearily lifted my head, trying to find what was creating the racket. It would have gone better if I could actually see anything. My eyes were gummy and everything was out of focus in my morning-impaired brain. Wazzapenin? was my very eloquent greeting to the general environs of my bed. I could see two black outlines moving about. They stopped when I mumbled the question with my cracked voice. Oh, sorry, mate. Were almost done. We just need to get a few things together and well let you get back to sleep. That is, if I can just find my bloody sights. I know I placed it here somewhere. The one near the door said. He dropped down on the floor and started searching under a bed. You sure you left it there? We were all kind of messed up from last night. I could still taste the blood in my mouth. Damn, I might have bitten my tongue. It feels really swollen. Its hard to use it. Tell me if Im saying it right; Blue. Blueeee. BLUE! Yep, no tongue action for the moment. The other black blob was a woman, judging from her voice. She has an interesting timbre on her voice, kinda like she was on the verge of singing, almost. All of those thoughts didnt register to me. I was still floating in between wakefulness and sleep so I just laid my head down and let the comfortable bed allow me to drift back to unconsciousness. People have said that I was not a morning person and I agree. Ive long accepted the fact that I was an asshole when woken up when I didn't have anything planned for the morning so it was not a surprise to me that I got mad when the guy looking for his sights suddenly went Oh bugger! and slammed on my side, throwing me off my bed. I dropped on the ground in an ungraceful heap, the air knocked out of me. I rolled on my back and let the momentary pain run its course. I could hear some cussing coming from on top of my bed. Gah! Bugger me, Who put that shoe there. Mate, Im really sorry. I- GADDEMMIT!!! I didnt know what came over me but I jump up roaring from beside the bed. I was madder that Ive ever been before. At the back of mind, I was thinking about how it was probably not a good idea that I took a shared room. Knowing my morning tantrums, it was stupid of me to expect that I wouldnt be disturbed. Anyway, that single moment of thought didnt stop the primitive part of my brain from taking action. I grabbed at the closest things within touching distance and threw them with as much force and anger as I could. I just kept throwing at the offending people when a terrified scream finally snapped me out of my rage. I stood there, crouched with knives in my hands. The woman whose scream turned me lucid has ducked behind a bed, knives imbedded very close to her head and legs that were sticking out. The man on my bed was in a similar situation. He rolled off the bed just in time as my throwing knives stitched towards him at regular intervals until he was pinned to the ground by a knife that caught my blanket he was entangled in. His eyes were huge and his arms were splayed in front of him. Stop! Fuck me, Im sorry mate. Please, drop the knife. No need for that. He was trying to keep calm but his voice trembled badly. I was also trembling but mostly from adrenaline. The anger slowly bled out, giving my foggy brain a chance to come into full lucidity. I dropped the knives I was holding in each hand on top of my side table and rubbed my face. My hands were shaking but I could feel myself starting to calm down. The woman was peeking from behind the bed while the man just slumped on the floor. Sorry. Not a morning person. I said. The woman got up and slowly moved her way towards the pistol I could see hanging by the bed she was hiding behind. The man pulled out my knife with an effort and extricated himself from the twisted blanket. Bloody hell, you could have just said so, mate. Jesus, I thought I was going to cark it. Fuck me, youre a hell of a thrower. The man stood up and took a respectable distance from me. The man was a tall and lithe, sinewy muscles running cords visible on his bare forearms. His skin was sun-baked, well browned and cracking in some places. His face also evidenced his time under harsh environments. He has gray steel eyes and a long pointy nose. His long, black, burnished hair was tied into a ponytail. He has a thin mouth the complemented his squinty eyes, giving the image of the man always frowning. He turned to look at the woman who was now holding on an energy pistol. Ow ya goin? You good? Im good but Im now thinking about shooting somebody. Her face was hardening and I could see anger simmering behind it. I looked at the man, helpless in not being able to articulate why I suddenly turned psychotic. I think he understood because he waved the woman to reholster the gun. She reluctantly did so but she kept eyes on me, standing beside the holstered weapon. Shell be right. No worries. I got tripped by that shoe. I was bent down looking for my sights so I didnt see it. Are we good, mate? I didnt know you were mad as cut snake. The man said. He has a very strong accent and it was hard for me to completely understand what he saying but I got that he was very concerned about my sanity. I was starting to blush with embarrassment and mortification. That has never happened before. I dont know what came over me. I swear, this was the first time that that happened. My god, I almost skewered somebody. Dont worry, Ill transfer rooms as soon as I can. Im really sorry. I wanted to dig a hole and die in it. What the hell was going on with me? I collected my clothes and started putting them on. I continued babbling, thinking about how horrible the morning would have been if Ive killed someone. It has been a stressful week. Ive been running around Sheer Alkan, testing the alcohol market. Ive got a meeting with the brass and Im still working on the sourcing of the trail mix Im working on for the men of *Woglinde*. Those had me zipping around in a rental, driving all over- Wait, youre that bloke the other troopers were talkin about? The one that gave them a coldie? The man interrupted my incessant stream. The woman also was surprised with the question. Uh, if youre talking about the ale, yeah, thats me. Whats ale? They were saying something about getting some free beer. He clarified. Ah. Ale is a kind of beer but apparently, that doesnt matter. Listen, I dont know if it would make it up for you but how about both of you try some of my ale? Theyre pretty good. Take it as my apology. What do you say? I grasped at the notion of me being known by troopers and tried to capitalize on it. The woman cursed then put her hands on her waist. I guess I cant kill you now. Its hard to find a good brewer. She said. The anger was gone from her face as a small smile replaced it. She is a very pale woman. Her blonde hair was almost silvery white. One thing you immediately notice is how symmetrical her face is. Its true that symmetry is very pleasing to the eyes. She has bright blue eyes and a cute button of a nose. Her thick lips were unpainted but were still a good shade of red. Her skin was freckled here and there but it didnt detract from her beauty. Her petite, shapely stature gave off a vibe of vulnerability. It was easy for people to miss how deftly she handled the pistol earlier if they were too focused on looking at her face. She definitely doesnt fit the mercenary stereotype. Kinda early for that, isnt it? The man commented as he looked at the chronometer on the wall. Oh, get off it. This is not going to be the first time you had a morning brew. Cmon, I wanna have a taste of it. Im Aoife Byrne by the way. Im with the *Flosshilde*.Aoife came forward to give a handshake. Names Ethan Jones. Also of the *Flosshilde*. Ethan also shook my hand. I was relieved that they quickly dismissed the morning excitement. I also introduced mylself. Albert Mayon. Cook in the *Woglinde*. A cook, are you? And from our sister ship nonetheless. I keep on running in on you buggers. Even those wankers in the *Wellgunde* are stomping around. What the bloody hell is goin on? You know anything? Both of them were now looking at me with interest, hoping for an answer. Sorry. I have no idea on whats happening. We just got called back home but they didnt tell us anything. I probably know less than you guys. Im just a cook. Im normally stuck behind a counter. I dont normally rate operational information. I said. Typical. Again, we know nothing. Lets not think about that anymore. How about that beer? I could see Aoife almost drooling from the prospect. You sure you can afford to get pissed? We still have to hunt today. I dont know if you can even taste anything with that fat tongue of yours. That tree swinger got a good hook, doesnt he? Ethan asked with a chortle. Now that I was looking closely, I could see that Aoife has a split lip. There was some bruising on her lower right jaw. It seems that they got in a fight last night. Thank god that he was drunk. He could have probably knocked a couple of teeth off if he wasnt too busy trying to stay upright. I didnt know that they could drink that much! Aoife said in wonder. They got some good grog, them Inugorians. If they could get pissed and expect to not fall off a tree then they better have superior alcohol tolerance limits. Ethan added sagely. Will you stop with the tree swinger shit!? You know they hate that. Well, they could get stuffed. Its not like Im lying. Sure. Next time, you say that in front of their faces. Lets see you try taking a punch from a sober one, you racist asshole. Hey, Ive no problem with the bastards. Theyre good fighters and excellent mates. They just need to be taken down a peg or two. Doesnt mean Im suicidal. Thought so. Well, lets have that beer then. I was listening to their banter and jumped a bit when the attention suddenly shifted to me. I asked for a moment as I collected the knives scattered about the room. I surprised myself on how many where thrown. I had to pull out eight of them, five on my bed. I grimaced as I thought about how I am going to explain the damage to mama-san. I filed that for later and waved for both of them to follow me. We tromped our way to the kitchen. We passed mama-san who was talking with some people in the sitting room. We didnt bother her as she looked to be in a serious conversation. The kitchen was buzzing with staff working on breakfast. I asked the head cook if we could enter his domain. Most people think nothing about entering a kitchen but I know better. The head cook admonished us to keep out of the way. We kept far away from the preparation tables and made our way to the freezer units. I moved over to the beverage refrigerator and took out a bio locked plasticrate. I opened it up and took out two chilled bottles of ale. I handed them to the eagerly waiting hands of Ethan and Aoife. They quickly opened them up and clinked their bottles with a cheers! and both downed half of the contents of the bottles in one long pull. Ah. Nothing like good beer, eh? Aoife said as she smacked her lips. Top drop, mate. A bit weak and too fruity for my taste but good on ya. Ethan said. He winked at me then emptied his bottle. Aiofe did the same. We talked about the ale for a while. I took notes of their critique and added it to the collated observations of my other tasters. Listen, mate. We have to get a move on. The mornings burnin and we have to get out of here. You ready, Aoife? Yep. Oh okay. Sorry again for the knivesand all. I lamely added. No worries. Almost made me slash my pants, tell you that. What were you looking for anyway? I asked. It was curious as to what was damn important that he was making such a racket so early in the morning. Oh, my crossbow sights. I cleaned it yesterday but I somehow misplaced it. Bloody hard hitting anything at a distance without it especially being out in the whoop whoop. Youre going hiking? Hunting, mate. Hunting. You dont need sights to hike up a mountain. Ethan said with a laugh. That made sense. Oh, right. What are you hunting anyway? I didnt know you could do that here. In Ceres, Flower made some side cash guiding hunting groups. They always had to be careful in controlling the sabre population. Left unchecked, they would decimate the transplanted fauna. There were a number of sabres that are allowed to be hunted every year but that is strictly regulated. *Antuana*. Theyre kinda like wild boars except a lot bigger and more aggressive. *Tyr* has an open bounty on the things. Theyre not endemic here. They speculated that some merchanter brought down some in the past and let some lose. Theyre considered as a pest since they ravage farmlands and chew on crops. There seems to always be a lot of them. Hunters like to bag a few every mating season. Theyre good eating. Aoife explained. She finished her ale and gave the bottle back. I digitally tagged it with my ArmComm and returned the bottle in the crate. I tag the bottles with the corresponding drinker so that I could have a clear record of who drank it and what they like or didnt like about it. Their opinions would be included in my spreadsheet. Good to know. Well, good luck on your hunt. You ever hunted before? Ethan suddenly asked. Yes. Um, to be specific, Ive joined a hunting party before. Never actually shot anything before. My aim is something left to be desired. You busy right now? Got anything to do? Ethan pressed. I think I know where this was going but I let it play out. Not really. I was just planning on checking out some sights by the sea. They say there are some good fishing spots there. Ethan looked at Aoife and she nodded. How about you join us? A little Red Tiger bonding experience. It would be fun. Im a bad shot though. Im also not used in moving through the forest. I might scare the game away. No worries, mate. You could be our offsider. We have an extended hunting license that covers other members of our party. You could bag yourself some good tucker. What do you say? Ethan said. Aoife agreed and added her voice in the mix. I thought about and considered that if I could bring done some game, I could have it delivered to the *Woglinde*. It would spice our menu up. The more I thought about it, the more appealing it got. I decided it was a good idea but I wanted to bring somebody with me. Would it be okay to invite another person? Shes the head cook of the *Woglinde*. She just got off the ship yesterday. Frannys here? Hell, thatll be fun. Sure, call her up. Well get our equipment. Meet us by the front door. Ethan thumped me on the shoulder and swigged his bottle, emptying it. He tossed it to me and I almost dropped the thing. Taking a second to tag the bottle, I then called Franny on my ArmComm. It was early but she picked up. She had her communicator or audio only. What? Do you know how early it is? Her cracking voice oddly clear even in her interrupted sleep. ""Sorry, sorry. I just wanted to ask you if you want to come with me on a hunt. Some of the guys from *Flosshilde* invited me to join them on an *Antuana* hunt. Figured that we could use the meat for our meat culture vats. Beef and chicken are getting a bit old."" I explained. I could hear some rusltling and a thump or two. Franny yawned before answering. ""*Antuana* hunt? You're right. I'm getting tired of beef stroganoff myself. Sure, I'll come. Give me a couple of minutes then swing by to pick me up."" She dropped the call without waiting for me to talk back. I just shrugged and went back to my shared room to get some stuff. I've been on hunts before, mostly as an assistant to Flower whenever he's out taking some rich guys for sabre culling. At first, I felt kinda queasy about it and not a bit disturbed since baby was with us all the time. I had the unreasonable thought that baby might not take well to us murdering her bretheren. Of course, she's an animal but an intelligent animal nontheless. It took me a while to get used to the idea and started to actually enjoy it. Flower did explain how important it is to the ecosystem that the population balance among the predators and prey be maintained. It threw me off the first time Flower invited me on a hunt. The idea of a zoo keeper hunting down animals was totally not something I imagined. I changed into something a little bit more practical for the hunt. I had the opportunity to expand my wardrobe so I was not worried about proper clothing. I decided to wear the Vellager shirt under my vest since it was light enough and it breathes. My vest was a simple leather one with breast and side pockets but it does come with a color control. I dialed the color to something that would not look out of place in the *Tyrian* countryside then pulled on a pair of sturdy pants. I wasn't really planning on shooting anything during the hunt so I just strapped on my bandolier and a small sling bag. If this hunt is like the others I had before, there's going to be some outdoor cooking to be done later. I had a small spice box that I always keep for this kind of situation. I grabbed a hat that I got for free during one of the group tours I joined when I was gawking at the different sights around *Tyr* then made a mental check that I have everything. Satisfied, I left the room and briskly made my way to the front door. Mama-san was still talking with people so I just waved at her as I pass her by. She smiled at me but her attention was to the people she was having such a serious talk with. ""Ready?"" Ethan asked. He has his crossbow case on hand. Aoife also has one and was also carrying a large bag with her. ""Yeah. Franny said to pick her up at her hotel."" I replied. We made our way to the parking lot and walked along the parked cars. We stopped in front of a green grav truck. Ethan had us load our stuff in the back then hurried us inside. He didn't want to waste daylight as much as possible. I gave him the address to Franny's hotel as we pulled out of the parking lot. The hotel was not that far from the Tiger's Den so we got there in less than five minutes. I sent Franny a message that we were on the way when we left to pick her up and she was already waiting when we arrived. She looks disturbingly perky after complaining how early it is. She was waving at us with her hat as we pulled up beside her. She got in beside me at the back after judiciously shoving me farther to the other side. ""Move, I don't like being crowded."" she instructed. ""But I'm already squashed here. There's a lot of space, Franny."" I complained, pointing at the obvious seating space between us. ""Well, it's not enough. Don't crowd me or I'll punch you in the dick. Hey, I know you. You're Ethan, right? You're that guy that fell off the stage after getting drunk and tried singing and dancing during sing-a-long night, right?"" Ethan frowned at the memory while Aoife slapped her knee and howled in laughter. ""Bugger. I was hoping people have forgotten about that. Yeah, I'm Ethan. This here is Aoife. We're both from *Flosshilde*. You're that bluey that Garron tried hitting on, right? Let's just say that man is... not the full quid."" Again, the man's dialect was making it difficult for me to understand what the hell he was saying. What is a quid? and did he just call Franny a 'bluey'? ""Sometimes, people just need to learn the hard way."" Franny sagely answered. We were pulling out of the hotel's driveway and were going south. Both Ethan and Aoife chuckled at Franny's advice. ""Yeah, a broken nose will get your attention."" Aoife commented. The road trip lasted almost an hour. I spent the time getting to know the other Red Tiger mercs and found them an agreeable lot. Aoife, particularly, is quite the chatterbox. She has no compunctions in sharing gossip. Man, the amount of sex they have in *Flosshilde* sounds exhausting. We were way out of any inhabited areas when we came upon a ranger outpost. It's a squat building that looks very utilitarian. It was made of local wood though so it still looks nice. Ethan parked the truck and we spilled out onto the grassy ground. We collected our belonging and made our way to enter the building. The reciveing area of the ranger station was a pretty spartan affair. There was an information holo terminal on the left side of the largish room and a printed map of the area on the wall on top of it. Some comfortable looking sofas were scattered around the room and some living room chairs were placed around a coffee table. A receptionist counter at the end of the room was the object of our attention. An older Barral was standing behind it, fiddling with something out of view. ""Greetings. Welcome to station 15. How can I help you?"" The ranger rumbled. ""We're going out for an *Antuana* hunt. What's the current rate?"" Aoife answered for the group. The ranger and Aoife got into the details for the hunt while Ethan waved us towards the nearest table. He placed his crossbow case on the table and opened it up. ""Let's get geared up. No use waiting for later when we need it."" Ethan advised. He took out his crossbow and it was massive. The arms on the thing were thick. I don't know much about crossbows but I could definitely say that this particular one would do some damage. ""Woah. That thing's huge! Wait, how big is this *Antuana*?"" It never occurred to me to ask earlier. ""No worries, mate. We got it covered."" ""But how big is it?"" ""Big enough."" ""But how big!? Ethan? Franny?"" The man just chuckled and walked out the station shouldering his crossbow. Franny gave me a pitying look then patted me on the cheeks. She was also packing a crossbow. She followed Ethan out. I got irritated and made my way to the information terminal. I made a local search on *Antuana* and the image of the animal was projected in front of me. ""Well, shit."" The *Antuana* is essentially an oversized armored wild boar. It stands about a meter and a quarter but it is almost three meters in length. The average weight of observed *Antuanas* is about 180-220 kilograms. Only a small percentage of that is fat. The animal is also fast. It runs on six stumpy and powerful legs and when charging, it could reach speeds up to sixty kilometers per hour. The boar is armed with long, curving tusks that, combined with its weight, could gore you and throw you over its head. Its leathery skin is way harder than it looks. The hunting guide suggested to use armor piercing rounds, or in our case quarrel tips, to penetrate it. The guide also warns the prospective hunter that though the boar is almost blind, it's nose is very sensitive. It could also hear from quite a distance. Caution is advised. Of course caution is well and truly advised. I left the terminal and joined Ethan and Franny outside. The two hunter were excitedly talking about how we were going to work together during the hunt. I paid close attention to what they were saying and came to the conclusion that I was way over my head. ""Uh, guys? I'm not exactly a good shot so, how about I take a seat back and let you guys do your thing?"" I suggested when there was a break in their conversation. ""What, and miss out on all the fun? Nah, no worries. Tell you what, we'll bag a couple and you watch us on how we do it. Franny told me about your aim. C'mere, I've something for you."" Ethan walked back to the truck and opened the utility trunk. He pressed a recessed button on the side and a panel popped out. He opened the hidden compartment and took out a rod, about half a meter long. He waved me back as he closed the trunk. He faced me and held out the rod horizontally. He pressed a button and the rod extended to full length. A spear head also slid out of one end. ""Here. Franny talked about how good your throwing arm is. Show me."" I took the proffered spear and held it in my hand. I jiggled it a bit, checking for balance. I looked around the area and decided to try it on a nearby tree. The extremely large tree that was shading our truck from the bright sun was perfect. I eyed the distance and took a throwing position at about a hundred meters away from it. I hefted the spear for a throw but was interrupted by Ethan. ""Hang on, mate. That's a bit far, ain't it?"" He asked while looking at the distance I was about to throw dubiously. I lifted my right arm and showed him my force multiplier. He wasn't familiar with it so I just told him to watch. I again took my stance and taking a moment to check that the multiplier was activated, I threw the spear with a grunt. The projectile zoomed towards the tree like it was shot from a bow and embedded itself deeply on the trunk with a loud thwack. ""Fair suck of the sav! I didn't expect that!"" Ethan exclaimed. We walked together to check my throw and it went in deep. I pouted at the result. ""What? That was bloody good, mate."" ""Ah, it was alright. Could have been better."" ""What do you mean?"" ""I was aiming at the knot."" I pointed at the middle of the knot. The spear was about a dozen centimeters from the center. It was not a bad throw, considering. Maybe I was expecting too much. After all, it was my first time throwing a spear. ""Believe me, that's good enough. How about you practice on it while we wait on Aoife?"" I nodded and pulled out the spear. It has a molecular spear point so it took some doing to pull it out. I was able to throw a couple more times until I felt that I was getting better at it. I could hit a stationary target at a hundred meters dead center. I felt comfortable with the spear and more confident on my future participation in the hunt. ""You're really good at that. Good move in getting those knives. It still doesn't mean you won't be working on your shooting scores, okay?"" Franny reminded me as I sat on a bench in front of the building. ""I'm working hard at that. I think I'm getting a bit better but those are stationary targets. I don't know how will that translate to combat."" I admitted. ""You got your knives now. Your pistol is going to be your backup. It sounds insane, now that I'm thinking about it. Still, what matters is that you are now a bonafide threat during boarding engagements."" ""Wait, you got boarded? I've got to hear this. Franny, spill."" Ethan excitedly requested. Franny gave an abridged version of our engagement in Ceres space. Ethan was surprised at the boldness shown by the slavers. ""What the bloody hell is going on!? Slavers taking on Red Tiger merc ships is just stupid. The *Woglinde* isn't exactly a tramp freighter."" Ethan was mystified by the whole thing. We talked a little bit more about it until Aoife finally made her appearance. The ranger followed her out and they went to around to the back of the building. They came back after a couple of minutes but this time, they were leading a bunch of saddled *Saguk*. The birds were walking placidly behind the ranger who was holding the reins. Aoife has a large smile on her face then gestured at the green feathered birds. ""Our noble steeds."" She grandly announced. Looks like I'm going to be learning a lot of things today. ~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~ Previous chapter is [here](URL The next chapter is [here](URL "

In my years as a reporter, Ive been to dozens of worlds and found familiarity in the common traits these out of the way little colonies all seem to share. A water cooler but no water bottle; walls plastered with signs and memorandums in both Common and, beneath, their local equivalent; and always a person waiting to speak to me, waiting to tell their story. The Aueoen Colonel is anxious that I should not be left alone with the man I have travelled for nearly a unit to see. Like every member of his race I have met, he is given to calculating odds and he tells me these odds as his earstalks twitch with nervousness. I show him the stories I have written for the Wire in turn. My reportings from Freesia and Ra-hha. And I show him the scans of my limbs that adorn the pages of the book that I have written so far. The cracks in my exoskeleton and the damage to the organs that had once been safe beneath. The Aueoen does not look at me, but the odds have changed and he agrees I can see the man I came here to see. When he arrives, he is lead in by two Jin constabularies. Hes wearing a yellow jumpsuit. Hair on his head and face, but otherwise only dark skin. He says nothing as his guards sit him on a chair, his knees bending backwards. Do you know where you are? I begin, a simple introduction. Nothing. The Colonel says it took almost a full dec-unit before they could manage to get a word out of him. Ten days and nights. Beneath the mans two eyes there is a darker patch of skin, blue against the black. I ask the Colonel about it and he shrugs. It resisted, he says. Have they treated you well? I ask. The box on the table is picking up my Common and translates it for the man in near real-time. It feels like the lag of an inter-system call as I wait for his response. He raises his shoulders and lets them fall. The Colonel explains it is their equivalent of a shrug. There are letters stencilled down one leg of the mans jumpsuit. One doesnt have to read Common to know what they mean. I ask him again if he has been treated well. The Colonel barks something in Aue at the man. I ask the Colonel if we may be left alone. More barks. The guards and their commanding officer leave and for the first time I am alone with the man the entire Commonwealth fears. -x- Eight cycles ago I was embedded with a border force unit. The latest race had been identified for induction to the Commonwealth; their world was to be divided amongst the other member species. What worlds had been along the Edge before were now medians and this new rock pushed the boundary out further. Induction is an inevitable and necessary part of the Commonwealth. Those who focus on the politics in their Wire pieces will write about the why, but I have always written about the who. There was a young Jin amongst the border unit, Al-ja, and he spoke fondly of his species own induction. His genetic memory afforded him a connection to it most of us no longer feel. He had learnt to play the strim from his great-grandfather and still associated the music with the short fight before their own diaspora across the other worlds. I hear the war through old ears, he would say fondly on that cramped ship along the Edge. Al-ja was nineteen cycles old. -x- I ask the man if he knows why he is here. Theres a vulnerability to this new species, but I am hard pressed to identify why as I sit across from one now. What is your name? I ask. Get F. Its fitting the translator fails. I smile because Ive heard the words before. What is your real name? I ask and press my forearms forwards. General Bosede Okoye. I can hear the vibrations from the Colonel speaking outside. I am learning nothing new by their account and yet I have. There is a tremor to the mans voice and, as alien as he is, I do not think it is fear I am hearing. Why are you here? I ask. For the first time the man looks at me. The odd eyes, set together on the front of the face, twitch and move like the stalks of an Aueoen. The man smiles showing teeth. Ask them, he says. This man will die within a unit and he is still smiling. -x- The Edge has grown with every induction. The border patrol force serves to protect those new worlds that have been taken into the embrace of the Commonwealths care. Often, these worlds must be protected from themselves first and foremost. Mandatory resettlement of the existing inhabitants across other worlds has been a cultural cornerstone of the Commonwealth. It has fostered incredible relationships between species. The concept of a homeworld is seen as archaic by many today. However, resistance is to be expected, especially in the early periods of a transition. In the process of learning about the who on that particular new world eight cycles ago, I felt first hand the wanton acts of a rebellion. The number two and three fuel tanks on our patrol vehicle overheated while leaving atmosphere from this troubled and troubling world. Later we would find out the tanks had been sabotaged. -x- Im taking notes using a didact and the man watches the device trace the lazy circles of symbols on the table. I ask if his people can read Common yet and he shakes his head from side to side. I ask him what the shaking means and he laughs. That does not need translating. I ask him, as he is opening up, if he knows what is happening to his homeworld right now. The laughing stops. War. I tell him it is only an induction. He leans closer across the table and brushes the didact to the side. I wonder if the Colonel will rush into the room having calculated the odds of violence at such proximity. It is war, the man says. Like youve never seen. How do you know? I ask. He sits back down and I feel the plates of chitin across my back shift as I let out the tension of the situation. The man scratches at his face with a clawless digit. His people were uncontacted, I remind him. How does he know this is a war we havent fought a thousand times before. Rumours, he says. Who is passing you these rumours? No-one he says. He hears the guards talking when theyve left the translator on. He has heard them talking about the ships lost by the Commonwealth in surprise attacks. They dont land anymore unless they have to. He asks me if Ive ever killed another sapient. No I tell him. Has he? Before you came, it was my job to kill. -x- I was taken to a Ring World after the explosion of my patrol ship. My exoskeleton was broken in thirty-nine places. Unlike the man I would meet eight cycles later, the haemolymph circulating in my body does not clot naturally. I was placed into a coma while I healed. I held no ill will against the rebels who had attacked us, only a deep curiosity as to their motives. The same could not be said for others. I left that hospital with a clean bill of health and the opening passages of the book I would write. When I connected to the Wire after waking I found the obituaries for seven of the friends I had made on that ship who had not been so lucky. Al-ja was mourned on three worlds. -x- I ask the man to recount his past. He was a member of an organised military on his homeworld. He had joined to defend his tribe. He had worked his way through the hierarchy and commanded others. I asked him if he killed other members of other militaries. He had. I asked him if he had killed civilians of other tribes. He had. How did it make him feel? The two eyes stared at the floor and he refused any more prompts for several ticks. Did he feel bad about killing Commonwealth members? I pushed. No. Did he not see that they were also sapient beings? He did. He was in awe of the technology at the Commonwealths disposal. He had always wanted to go into space as a youngling. I told him he was in space now. Its not the same with gravity. How could he justify killing those who had come to induct his species then? He spoke, the translator tried. Invader. It is a word unique to the mans race. Present in a hundred spoken dialects, it means an induction with force. The two concepts were so inextricably linked in their language that they existed as one word. We were the invaders and his race had to fight. Why? I asked him. Because they had to protect their homeworld. Did others feel the same way? Yes. Would they fight as hard? Harder. He spoke of protecting family members. He had two parents and many younglings of his own. Did he miss them? Of course. What would they think of him now? Proud. He hoped. He wanted to know something. I told him to ask. How much was left behind when your race was invaded? -x- My book was published on the Wire by a small imprint. In its first few units, it was read on more worlds than I had ever visited. By the end of the first dec-unit, I began to realise what I had started. The book followed the story of the last species to be inducted. It charted the first detection of their system and the early reports of their homeworld. It charted my own childhood and those early years growing up on a world that wasnt truly home. Contact introduced readers to the characters. The crew of a small patrol ship who had a dangerous job but did it because the same had been done to them. And the fighter against which they fought, a rebellion commander at the heart of the conflict. The attack was not venerated. Only the names of those killed and photos of my recovery included. And in the close of that chapter I introduced a new concept, as alien as `invader` is to us, that of the `freedom fighter`. -x- In the small office that had been used as an interrogation room, I had my final words with the man who had changed so much. What do his people want? Freedom. Freedom from what? The Commonwealth. Would they join the Commonwealth? If it had been offered. Then why not now? The man, in his yellow jumpsuit, laughed. We were offering him a better future, peace and prosperity for all generations to come I explained. He leant forwards and seized my forearms. The muscles were those of a heavyworlder. Freedom at the barrel of a gun, he told me, is not freedom. It took me far longer to understand the words of the translator than for the Colonel and his constabularies to pry the prisoners hands from my forearms. They took that man away. He was executed in accordance with Commonwealth law for impeding the process of induction. He was the last sapient to be executed for such a crime. His words stuck with me. -x- The book that I had begun writing eight cycles ago was finished only after the meeting I have recalled above. In it, I described the troubles of meeting a new species, but in the process it cast light on our own. A man had fought to defend his people. The war with this new species had stretched for almost a decacycle. In that time they gave no quarter. Those who were resettled elsewhere carried with them ideas about peace and rebellion like a virus. In the end, the Commonwealth sowed the seeds of its own demise. The book was published the day after the man was executed. In the dec-units that followed his final words, included as the epilogue of the book, spread faster than light. Tomorrow, I publish my first piece about the newest species to be encountered on the Edge. There will be no induction, only introductions. And maybe that will be better. It took being face to face with a human for me to realise we were the monsters. Maybe we can do better. I hope you read my piece tomorrow. **[[Wiki](/r/hfy/wiki/authors/dachande663) / [Tip Jar](URL"
127,vulnerability,HFY,A World Away From Yesterday: Part 10,15,5ovnq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5ovnq3/a_world_away_from_yesterday_part_10/,2017-01-19 20:24:40," [Part 09](URL --- We stood on the bluff overlooking the horseshoe shaped Nini bay. Below on the beach, forty or so Nakai waited. What they saw must have told them that they didnt stand a chance without reinforcements. With their dual-mast sails billowing in the wind, a fleet of more than twenty Haiin Naval catamarans completely blocked the narrow entrance to the bay. Lei looked out at the myriad of vessels on the bay and sized up the situation. She whistled and then sighed We may not walk away from this one, guys. Brynn studied them. There will be eight to ten ground soldiers on each vessel commanded by two officers. Each ship will have a smaller longboat used to disembark troops. I agree that these are not good odds. One hundred eighty to two hundred twenty troops Eisa said. The vessels remained still at the bays entrance. What are they waiting on? I asked. Brynn pointed at the ships, their sails to be precise which mostly hung slack but occasionally billowed outward toward the ocean. They are waiting for the wind to change. A major vulnerability in their tactic is that to launch the longboats this far out, their soldiers have little to no cover from arrows. The ships themselves are better protected. Once the winds shift, they will use it to launch their boats closer to shore. When will it shift? I pressed. It was Eisa who explained it this time. When the weather is calm, the winds blow to and from the sea. At night, it blows from the land to the sea, then during the day, it returns to the land. They wait for the wind to begin its return to the land. She looked up at the position of the sun. I would guess we have less than an hour before it starts. Brynns ears perked up as he watched the waiting vessels. If we can destroy the ships then we can reduce the number coming ashore. Shooting flaming arrows from the bluffs should suffice. I held up a hand. Wait a minute, what are you talking about? Wont they just launch their longboats? Lei shook her head. Not if we can take them out before they can launch. With all of their weapons and armor, those warriors wont be the best swimmers. If we burn their ships from a distance most of them will jump rather than face the fire. If any longboats make it out, same thing, we keep them from landing. Khana nodded. We must inform the Nakai on the beach of our plan. &amp;nbsp; Convincing the scared Nakai turned out to be the biggest of our challenges. As soon as they saw two Nakai, two aliens and a Haiin emerge onto the beach, they nearly skewered us. Khana called out to them, hands raised. Peace! We are friends who have come to help fight. One of them stepped forward, his bow trained on Brynn. Why do you travel with this beast? You are allies of the Haiin! Who are you? Who sent you? Khana slowly lowered her hands and stood tall. I am Khana Ari. We were sent here by order of my mother, Rina Ari. The Haiin next to me and his companions are from the north and are responsible for beginning the resistance movement. In the name of Rina Ari, lower your weapons! The mans eyes widened in recognition and he immediately lowered his bow and signaled for the others to do the same. He lowered his head and dropped to one knee. Lady Mikiha! Please forgive me and my companions! He raised his right palm upward. Behind him, the crowd of Nakai prostrated themselves in identical poses. Khana sighed, exasperated. There is no time for this you are all forgiven. Now rise and help us. My name is Pelk, my Lady. The man said remaining lowered for a moment longer than his companions. I am the leader of this small group. It is an honor to meet you. May we expect reinforcements sent by the Duchess? Khana shook her head. I fear it may be too late. We have less than an hour to prepare. Therefore I shall tell you the plan that my companions have devised. Without a moment to spare, Khana explained our plan to Pelk and his warriors. &amp;nbsp; After the plan was thoroughly explained and discussed, everyone separated to prepare for the fight. I sat in the warming sand of the beach and gazed out at the catamarans. After a moment, Lei sat down beside me. This isnt going to be an easy fight. She said. we're outnumbered and we have only a limited arsenal. what do we have available? I asked, almost afraid of the answer. We have a decent amount of arrows for the first assault, but after that, all we have is what this group was able to cobble together: various swords, shields and daggers comprise most of them but they are all personal weapons. Then there are about seven Kalika available to be distributed. Not much. What's a kalika? Have you seen any of those big exploding berries? I nodded, thinking back to my first few weeks here. well, those are called keela. To make kalikas, the Nakai carefully remove and dry the cores and then attach two of them to bolas. When they swing them, the stems break and the fuses ignite. When they throw them, the bolas wrap around their targets and then explode. It's a brutal and highly effective type of grenade. I just wish we had a few more of them. I nodded. Those could be useful. Khana told me you dont have much experience in a fight like this. Do you have a plan? We don't need you charging in like you did with Sabrina. I shook my head as I felt my face get hot. I'm not going to charge into anything,okay? I just lost my cool back then. This is different, I think. This will be my first time fighting like this. The others were either training or the result of an ambush. Sorry to burst your bubble, but it's not different at all. Youll be hurt and see friends hurt or worse. You'll get mad and want to hurt someone. It pays most then to stay calm. She pulled open a leather pack from her side and withdrew a familiar looking dagger. Remember this? This is the atomic dagger that I showed you on Luna. She handed the dagger to me. I think this would be better in your hands. Combined with a good shield, it will give you a pretty good advantage. I pushed the dagger back. I cant take that, what will you use? Honestly I prefer a ranged weapon. I have a bow and I have this: She patted a holster on her side, revealing the same desert eagle that she had used what seemed like ages ago. Id rather to bring a gun to a sword fight. Besides, Ive used that dagger before. It feels all wrong to me, cuts everything way too easily. *How* do you still have ammunition for that thing? I'm pretty low on it actually, down to one magazine in fact. I only use it for when I can't use a bow or as a last resort. I also have another small dagger of my own so I'll be fine. What else do you have? I rummaged through my own pack. I still have the laser, a few first aid supplies and the full HiSPD set. The HiSPD is good. Put it on under your clothes and keep the sheet part handy. The Haiin will start with a few volleys of arrows. Will it work against arrows? Lei nodded. It should do fine. Haiin Bows and arrows are larger than Nakai and are shot with a lot more force. Don't count on it though in hand to hand. A knife will cut through that like the cloth it is. I took the sword and, standing to my feet, I fastened the sheath to my belt. Thanks, Lei. She shook her head. Thank me later, after the battle. Stay aware of who's around you.  She looked out at the sea. Its time. At that moment I felt a breeze blow on my face. Across the bay, the sails on the catamarans began to swell toward us. A moment later, the sound of a horn echoed across the water. The catamarans then began to move. &amp;nbsp; Look alive! Lei called over the wind to the group. Her warning caused the rest of the Nakai to look up and then double their efforts to finish their preparations. I hastily donned on the HiSPD top and bottom underneath my clothing. Pelk split his group into two, instructing the archers to stand on the high bluff in order to gain more distance. The rest of us were to remain on the beach and wait for any Haiin that made it ashore. Eisa approached us and addressed Lei. You and I will lead the archery strike from the bluffs overlooking the bay. She turned to me. Once the Haiin fleet reaches shore, we will join the rest of you here and continue to provide support from close range. Eisa squinted, judging the distance between us and the Haiin. It looks like they will arrive in about twenty minutes. They will be within our bow range in ten minutes. Together they left to join the other archers heading for the high cliffs surrounding the bay. A few minutes before the Haiin ships entered firing range, I stood on the beach with Khana, Pelk, Brynn and twenty other Nakai. You are a strange looking man. Pelk said, sidling up next to me. However, it is an honor to fight alongside you. I bowed in return. Likewise, Pelk, you seem to be an excellent leader of your people. Pelk began to laugh. To be honest, we are but vagabonds and thieves who happened to get word of the invasion. No one else is available at the moment to fight so here we are. Khana placed a hand on his shoulder. Should we survive, I will have any crimes of yours absolved and you will be rewarded. Pelk bowed humbly. I appreciate that, my Lady, but we do not fight for gain. We fight to be free of the Haiin. he looked at Brynn. No offense to you, my friend. I have heard of the Haiin in the north who helps us fight but I never expected to see you here. Khana turned to Brynn. How long do we have? Brynn ruffled his fur. Perhaps a minute or so before they are in range of our archers and two before we are in range of theirs. They will try to get as close as possible and then disembark. They will leave one officer on board each ship to pilot it and the rest will come ashore. Khanas eyes widened and she turned to me. What about that weapon you possess, the laser? Do you think you can hit the sails from here? I considered it for a moment. maybe, but Im not sure it would do much. At full strength it would likely cut right through the sails without really igniting anything. Any other setting wouldnt do anything as they are too far. I might be able to slow them down a bit though if I can cut through them completely. I drew the laser and lay down on the sand. At roughly two hundred meters out, I could barely make out the presence of the soldiers on the decks. The huge sails were an easy target but cutting them would take a steady hand and time. As I pressed the button, the beam caught on salt and dust in the air revealing a streak of bright blue that was barely visible in the sunlight. However, it was just enough to aim at the top edge of the nearest sail. Although I could not see the laser burning through the cloth, I kept my hand steady and slowly swept it across the face of the canvas. Nearly a minute passed. What is taking so long? Khana asked. The laser has to burn through consistently. I murmured while keeping my aim steady. If I go too fast it wont cut it. As I spoke, the sail simply collapsed onto the unsuspecting soldiers below. I sighed one down, thirty nine more to go. At that moment, the archers fired from the cliffs and a meteor shower rained down on the ships. The arrows penetrated wood and the fire caught on to the pitch used to seal the vessels. Ropes and sails were the next to be engulfed. Haiin infantry scrambled to put out the blazes and failing that began to launch their longboats. Unfortunately, it wasnt enough. With only twenty two archers firing volley after volley, the Haiin fleet continued to press forward. However, now instead of nearly forty sails to cut, the number was being drastically reduced. In the smoke filling air, the lasers beam was now fully visible as I continued to cut away at the remaining ships. Majority of the Nakai fire was now concentrating on the increasing number of advancing longboats. They are entering the range for their archers. Brynn warned. Aboard the boats, despite being under fire, several Haiin stood and drew back bows that were taller than they were and arched them toward the beach. Shields now! Khana yelled. She squatted down next to me. New plan: forget the ships and aim for the Haiin on the boats! We will keep you covered. Dont worry about me. I said while pulling the HiSPD cloth out of my bag and draping it over myself. This will keep me safe from their arrows. Brynn snorted That is a cloth *sheet*. How can that protect you? We dont really have time to discuss physics or technology right now, but trust me, it will work. I said while silently adding *I hope*. I really didnt know what kind of punch the Haiin arrows packed. However, as long as they exceeded the minimum weight/velocity limits, I would be fine. Now much closer than the ships, the Haiin would made easy targets to pick off if I didnt get myself killed first I aimed for the lead longboat just as the Haiin released their arrows. From nearly a hundred meters away, I heard the twang of bow strings snapping simultaneously. For a few seconds there was a moment of silence. I fired and the Haiin standing in the front of the boat fell back with a hole burned into his skull. Then, all around us the arrows were landing, burying themselves into the sand, the Nakai shields and into flesh. The screaming and chaos began after that as the Nakai desperately tried to defend themselves from the razor edged hailstorm. Nakai began dropping around me. Hold your positions! Pelks voice roared while he was hit in the thigh. Im hit! a man fell in front of me, an arrow lodged into his abdomen. Another to my right hit the ground dead with one buried in his neck. Over the screams, I heard a gasp of pain that could have only come from Khana. Several arrows slammed into the HiSPD, their force meeting the minimum effective rating and their energy dispersing evenly through the cloth. Ignoring it, I continued my own onslaught, not bothering with precision but simply holding down the button and sweeping until a red LED on it signaled that the charge was low. Many Haiin dropped but it wasnt enough, the boats were now in water shallow enough that some were beginning to disembark and wade to shore. I felt rough claws grab my arm and pull me to my feet. Come! You can do no more laying here! Brynns gruff voice yelled over the carnage. The Haiin archers will not risk killing their own. Draw your blade! Kalikas ready! Pelk called and seven Nakai came forward, dangling the weapons ready to swing. Upon getting a good look at them, I began to see how they worked. The main rope that they were tied to was connected to the main body of the charge whereas the fuse-like stem connected to the rope by a loose string. As the kalika was swung, the stem would snap, starting the reaction. A user would only have a few seconds to find his target, swing the bola and throw it. As I watched, the efficiency of the weapon showed itself to be impressive indeed. The Nakai that threw them were obviously well trained with them as each sped forward to find their targets. The Haiin soldiers suddenly found themselves tangled up around their torsos, legs, arms, and in one unfortunate case, his throat. Having been triggered and thrown at nearly the same time, the seven kalikas with their fourteen explosive cores, detonated simultaneously. For the most part, with the exception of the unlucky soldier to be caught in the neck, the explosives were too small to kill the Haiin outright. The Haiin musculature and the armor that they wore was adequate to protect vital areas. They were however badly injured and were effectively out of the fight. Nakai arrows coldly finished them off. &amp;nbsp; On the far side of the beach, the next wave of the Haiin had landed and had drawn large broad swords. A few Nakai began to engage them but were taken out quickly. The firestorm no longer rained from the cliffs. On the bay, only a single Haiin ship remained holding position just out of reach and a few longboats rowed to join those on the beach. Khana appeared behind me. Be ready, here they come. A longboat disembarked eight Haiin in front of us. I noticed blood on the side of her head. Are you alright? Khana gripped her daggers tightly. Im fine, its just a scratch. Lets go! with that she dashed toward the Haiin. Brynn also rushed forward with a guttural roar into the fray, swinging his axe around him. It was then that I saw why Khana was nicknamed the green eyed flame. Crimson in her exertion, she was a tempest moving among the Haiin troops with ease. Her twin daggers flashed with a surgeons precision; finding their way between plates of armor, into vital organs and exiting just as quickly. However my moment of amazement was cut short as one of the soldiers broke loose of the fight and set me as his target. I drew the atomic blade and prepared to defend myself or die. &amp;nbsp; --- [Part 11](URL --- "
128,vulnerability,HFY,On Resilience,53,5f2sue,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5f2sue/on_resilience/,2016-11-27 12:18:13,"In a meta discussion u/BeaverFur asked if stories can have a killer HFY vibe if humans are the only sapient species; so without xenos, AIs, elves, orcs, etc. I took it as a friendly challenge to try to write a story that is HFY, not sci-fi or fantasy, but based on my own mental health experiences and psychology knowledge. ^heres ^hoping ^I ^at ^least ^kinda ^succeeded. --- With a wave of my hand the class hushed, chattering instantly ceasing. The amount of respect these millennials show an old professor with a heavy accent still boggles my mind. &amp;nbsp; With our last lecture before exams, we come to our hardest topic: what is it about humanity, that subtle but illustrious spark, that makes us extraordinary? Any ideas? &amp;nbsp; Creature 88! Hes a fucking badass! &amp;nbsp; Nono its Billy-bob! He dont need no clones to whoop some ass. &amp;nbsp; I guess eagles are nice, what about Kevin Jenkins and our killer *deathworld* ? &amp;nbsp; Several other ideas came out for a while, until a particularly attractive young man shouted out with a mischievous glint in his eyes. YOU GUYS GOT THE WRONG IDEA...ITS OUR STEAMY PANCAKES. &amp;nbsp; When the laughing subsided, the grin left my face. Even in 2016 this topic is an onerous reminder. All excellent answers, but the truth may be far closer to the heart younglings. As you know, Im a psychologist; been counselling people for 28 years, and seeing the experiences people have gone through has taught me something profound. Ive worked with clients fragile as glass, others traumatized beyond measure; most describe experiences unbelievably heart-wrenching. A random stranger would glance upon my clients and think one thing: theyre broken, theyre damaged beyond repair. And honestly? Irreversible wounds are the only logical outcome given their situations. Yet the truth is more inspiring, for humans arent logical. &amp;nbsp; Youd be surprised, as I was in my training years, to note the lack of psychological bruising on these courageous people. You cannot fathom the strength, the fortitude, the resilience these supposedly broken people demonstrate every single day. Fighting through the worst trauma, they manage the god-damned impossible. A little something called post-traumatic growth: being beaten to a pulp and driven into the ground, grasping for a cocoon of safety outside your reach. And then, despite all odds, emerging a transformed person, not a beaten mess. With resilience humanity transmutes tragedy into strength, a feat much more precious than gold. And when you think about it, we all have this capacity. Every single human has this innate drive to not only survive, but thrive, under insufferable circumstances."" &amp;nbsp; A hesitant hand went up. But sir, you cant be serious. We learned last class that 1 in 5 humans have a mental health problem! And even the toughest of us will break if put through enough strain. &amp;nbsp; A knowing smile crossed my face. An excellent segue Shania. Can anyone define resilience for me? &amp;nbsp; A student at the front quickly called out. Its like when you put stress on something but it doesnt bend, it stays strong. Like your clients! &amp;nbsp; An wonderful answer Jaideep, but a common misconception. Resilience isnt the act of not bending...its being so warped and ripped to shreds that you can never pick up the pieces; being forever altered, and in the face of that destruction finding the strength to take an anvil, grasp the pain, and hammer yourself into something stronger. Resilience isnt being fireproof. Its being burned alive with unfathomable torment, but emerging a tempered sword rather than ashes. &amp;nbsp; ""When you stop to think about it, all of humanity demonstrates this remarkable trait. We all know pain, we all face adversity. Whether it be bullying, oppression, harassment, the passing of loved ones, emotional torment, loneliness, or the struggle for food and shelter, one thing is certain: we all suffer. We all have bad days, terrible days, and absolutely shit-fucking-tastic days. In the end, we all know suffering. Its humanitys fundamental weakness. Were emotional creatures bound to experience adversity. But our greatest strength? Taking the very weakness others scorn- our depression, anxiety, trauma, and insecurities-and fighting to adapt. Learning to not just endure, but thrive. To roll with the punch of our worst agony and persevere through the storm, for all storms eventually fade. &amp;nbsp; The saddest part? So many are blind to humanitys strength, and thus their own strength. We all climb mountains on the daily, focusing entirely on the desolate expanse ahead of us. So fixated in the moment we miss the miles conquered, the obstacles surpassed. We overlook the very barriers that gave us the fortitude to get to where we are now. We sneer at the disgracefulness of fragility, when its vulnerability and suffering that bolsters the most unfaltering resolve. Is it truly weakness to collapse under the weight of the world if, with time, we rise again with augmented tenacity? We talk about hitting rock-bottom as the worst experience imaginable. And yet, its precisely here where we build the enduring foundation for the greatest skyscrapers."" &amp;nbsp; ""So what makes humanity so god-damned incredible? Perhaps the answer lies not in the stars, but in the mirror."" "

I'd been hit by a truck during the night, or perhaps I'd fallen down a crack in the earth and bruised every bone in my body. Or had I been poisoned? One vomit was not nearly enough. My head hurt, my vision swam, and the embers of last night's fire were painfully bright. Bodies littered the cave at riotous angles. Had we been attacked? No. I'd seen this in a movie about a politician caste member. No! This wasa *hangover!* Was it potentially lethal? What had that character done about it? I remembered a coffee and painkillers; fighting down panic and dizziness, I found my backpack in the orange gloom and fished out the only supplies that might fit the bill. Okay, Venita, stagger forward. Find fresh air. You can do this. One of the many cave mouths opened out onto a high hillside mostly shielded from sight by dense brush and scattered groves of evergreen trees. From here, the world couldn't see me, but I could see the world. Dawn was a greyish-blue tone over sleeping plains beyond our ridge; I breathed in chilly air and, for a moment, felt a little bit better now that I could orient myself. I cracked open the last soda in existence that Celcus had given me and I downed one of Flavia's painkillers with a sigh. What exactly had I done last night? I Oh no. Every nerve in body stung with alarm as the memories came flooding back. Celcus, Flavia, SampsonI'd spoken the terrible secrets that had been swelling behind the dam of my heart 'til those thoughts had broken from me and burst forth. I gave an audible groan out a dry throat and put my head in my hands as I realized I'd told sixty percent of my team that I loved them. Memories of my life before this were no help. I was increasingly beginning to think of myself as separate from an enforced system that had been all around me back home; I was still a product of Amber Three's culture, but its holes and flaws were becoming more apparent with each new experience I had outside of it. In every story I'd read or show I'd watched, men competed for women and each individual woman had to choose one in the end. These decisions had been engaging, deep, and endearing when I'd watched them, and I'd always thought I'd already made my choice in Sampsonand then, later, in Celcus. Those of the military caste paired off and had children. Creating new units and teams was one of our primary duties. I had never really questioned that. How could I choose? On television, one suitor eventually proved himself the victor while the others displayed latent cowardice or disloyalty, thus making the choice suddenly fall into place. It had often come down to simple little things as wellI stared down at the open can of soda in my hand. Celcus had given me this. Did that make him the superior choice? But Sampson had been my first love, and had played all the online war games with me that nobody else around me understood. I'd had an entire online life in lieu of real parents or friends, and I felt that he knew me more than anyone else. My brothers and sisters in arms knew vaguely of my past, but they didn't *understand.* They hadn't *been there* on sleepless nights alone in the dark; alone except for an awkward holographic teenage boy from another world telling me that everything would be alrightand awkward no more, really, with those arms, those shoulders, that strong jaw I shook my head to focus, but immediately suffered the consequences. No movement, Venita. Just sit still. Breathe. The dizziness passed over the course of several seconds. Celcus knew the current me, Samspon knew the past me, and FlaviaI sipped what healing soda I could as I stared wide-eyed at the brightening horizon. Military caste members were supposed to pair off and create family units. I had never even *seen* this concept, never *heard* of this possibility, except as whispered rumors about certain soldiers that had been dishonorably discharged. I hadn't even understood my own feelings untilwell, no, I still didn't understand them. Through all the blurred memories from the night before, her sudden kiss stood out the most. Was she even *allowed* to do that sort of thing? And by whose rules shouldn't she be allowed? Outside Amber Three, who were we? There was nobody in charge, no grand hierarchy, and no mission beyond surviving the coming war so we could go home. Just as the fear in me reached dark terror at what my actions might have done to my family, I sensed them behind me. At exactly the moment I needed them, they were all there. Septus groaned and sat on the rock to my left; Celcus, Sampson, and Flavia each clasped my shoulder in turn and then reclined in hungover pain to watch the sun rise with me. Nobody said a word. It was the Time of Sickness all over again, in which we had all found comfortable silence together, but there was no chance of death in this shared painjust humor. I could only manage slight turns of my head against sudden bouts of nausea, but I managed to look each of them in the eyes to ask the unaskable, and they told me with weary smiles that they would not hate me or resent me for what I'd said and done the night before. Thanks to them, I was no longer afraid. Too, for the first timeand this I realized at that exact moment as the sun flared forth and made us all turn away and moan and groanI was no longer hidden. I was no longer apart. I was no longer alone. Eventually that morning of peace ended as Caecilia found us and swept us up and back to the others for the day's ride, but part of me would always remain centered in that brightening silent calm. The dark movie theater from my childhood had become lesser and more distant. I was less that abandoned child and more someone new. After grabbing my gear, I left the empty can of soda on the rock floor where we had slept. On this uninhabited Earth in this high secluded cave system it would likely go a million years undisturbed, and I liked the thought of it as a marker that we had *been there*. When I crossed paths with her on the way to the bikes, Cristina knew instantly that I was sick from the alcohol the night before. ""First time drinking?"" she asked. My nod was pained and slight. She made a noise of amusement. ""Well, that's the price to be paid. Drink plenty of water, and remember this next time."" ""No,"" I croaked, immediately overcome by revulsion. ""I am *never* drinking again."" Her laugh was kind, and tinted with nostalgia. ""I've heard that one before."" ""Really!"" I insisted as I winced and tried to keep up with her. She just kept laughing as she outpaced me, and I promised myself to remember the pain of hangover rather than the blazing fun and dancing and truth-speaking the next time someone offered me alcohol. Or, at the very least, I would stick close to her if I did drink again. Her presence somehow made me feel safer. She had a certain composure and knowledge about her that ""Wait!"" I shouted after her. She slowed. Catching up to her, I asked, ""Your husband's alive? You said that last night, right?"" Her smile and humor faded. In its place dropped an expression I fully recognized: strategic focus. ""I'm glad you know, so that I have somebody to share it with, but it's important you keep that to yourself."" She took me by the arm and led me to one of the alternate cave mouths. Looking down upon our gear and bike staging area, she indicated the handful of men and women getting ready around Conrad. ""I can tell you nowthat's going to become a very big problem. The less he knows about any of us, the better."" ""Conrad?"" I asked, slightly confused. ""Did he do something?"" ""Not yet,"" she said quietly, her eyes scanning the interactions below. ""Not exactly. But I've learned in my time that immortality eats away at the things that make us human."" A slight glint of moisture appeared above her lower eyelids. ""When I told the people of my worldthe First Worldthat our planet was about to be destroyed, you know what they did?"" I gaped at her in awe. I wanted to ask a thousand questions about the glorious heart of the Empire, but my own strategic focus took precedent. ""What did they do?"" They were exultant that death would finally come for them. Her studying gaze became a glare as she scrutinized the distant immortal below. ""They threw a goddamn party in the streets."" The horrible inversion of courage that must have been required for such a reaction abhorred and shocked me to my core, but then I grabbed my cheeks for another reason. *God!* She'd told me many things about the unknown questions of the universe, but it was all a drunken blur after the second and third cups of poison swill. Now was not the time to ask her to repeat herself, but my thoughts raced with questions and possibilities. It seemed that every single thing was in fluxmy home, my family, my relationships, my heart, and even my understanding of existencebut all I could feel was soaring freedom at the chance to discover the things I wanted for myself. That day's ride was a slow one, for many of the Vanguard members had gottenas they called it*equally sloshed*. We only collectively began feeling better about an hour before contact was made by radio and our thirty-odd riders changed course to meet up with another eighty. Suddenly, our little fusion gang became a full centuria, and the random wildlife of the multiverse feared us rather than fought us. Per our training, we made sure not to get overconfident, but the difference in Earth-by-Earth danger between riding with ten and riding with a hundred was stark. That soon became small comfort. The real threat was not from any individual random Earth. The first rift we found that space had somehow healed over was an anomaly; the second translucent scab wound on the fabric of existence was a clear indicator that our trap was growing tighter. We hadn't been able to go backwards for quite some time, and now rifts to either side were closing even as we approached them. The Enemy was bidding us closer, and the time for battle was nigh. Flavia had a suspicion that this tactic had been developed in response to our world's Dimensional Rotation. We stood talking quietly as our hundred and sixteen set up camp for the day just out of sight of the only rift forward: a gaping black maw with irregular torn space for teeth. Nothing but void could be seen on the other side, and it was obvious our next step would take us into a proper trap. ""We Rotated,"" Flavia whispered, telling myself, Celcus, Sampson, Septus, and Caecilia while Cristina and Noah listened from nearby. ""There's a good chance the Enemy doesnt know exactly what we did, but it doesn't need to. If it corrals all our mobile forces and forces them into killing zones"" ""we'll fall just like its spheres did when their connection was severed,"" Celcus said, voicing our collective understanding. ""We're being cut off from our source in kind."" Flavia grimaced and leaned on her crutch to shift weight from her broken leg. ""What's our map say?"" Caecilia glanced around to make sure none of the Vanguard were nearby. ""The black rift leads to a symbol similar to the one at which we found Conrad, but with industrial connotations rather than medical. I think we can assume it contains a factory of some sort. We have to avoid it if we can."" It felt wrong to be fearful and creep about rather than fight. I looked to Cristina. She responded to my unspoken prompt as the others followed my gaze. ""What you have here is a reactive Enemy. It has limited creativity, and so farfrom what you sayhas followed careful tactical analysis processes at each encounter."" She paused and waited for our leader's reaction. Appreciating the gesture, Caecilia nodded for her to continue. Cristina took a deep breath and gazed off in the direction of the black rift. ""It may have overwhelming resources and control of this entire region, but it still has a major weakness in its own reactivity. It won't have forces mustered in the proper places, and it won't be ready for surprising contingencies."" Flavia suggested, ""So we run when we should fight, and fight when we should run?"" ""Exactly."" Still looking at the distance, Cristina flashed a rather dark smile. ""Charge in there and blow right through the trap. You say there's a factory? I say we smash down the doors and seize control of it."" Caecilia and Flavia exchanged glances, and together asked, ""Is that even possible?"" Sampson pointed back the way we had come, and I could sense his thoughts were on the games and computer knowledge he and I had shared in our youth. ""Conrad's medical facility serviced us. It just seems to be a matter of authorization."" ""So we get Conrad there, and the factory will work for us?"" Celcus asked. ""I don't know if I trust him as the keystone to a bold offensive. He's, uh"" ""Random,"" Septus commented. ""Even volatile."" At that, I studied Cristina's face. She said nothing, but I could tell she was thinking the same thing as I was: Conrad put on an air of randomness, but there was something calculating behind his grin. In the last day his personal cadre had grown to fourteen people after his tales and confident persona had won over a few of the newcomers. I had to wonder what he was saying to thembut I did not have to wonder for long. Trajan, Paulinus, and Larentia approached with ashen faces. Caecilia pulled them quickly into our group. ""What's wrong?"" Trajan glanced to his teammates and then told us: ""It's Conrad. He says he knows about things. Important things. Says there's an entity called *God*"" I froze. ""it's very powerful, it sees all, and it *judges us after we die.*"" Discipline failed as we all began talking over one another. ""What?"" ""What's that mean?"" ""How could he possibly know that?"" Paulinus continued for his brother in arms. ""He says there's a whole afterlifetwo, in fact. One for good people, and one for bad."" Memories of Cristina's answers to my questions burst forth in my brain. I stepped forward, full of the same confusion and shock. ""What makes a good person or a bad person?"" ""He didn't say exactly,"" Paulinus responded, eyes still wide. ""Not yet. He says that he's a speaker for this God thing, that he was given a divine right to lead a thousand years ago and that morality is complex and requires interpretation."" Cristina kept a neutral expression. ""*His* interpretation?"" While Paulinus nodded, Larentia countered, ""He *is* a thousand years old. He *did* build our worlds. He was literally the creator of our Amber societies."" ""You built the Amber Worlds,"" Cristina told her flatly. ""Your ancestors. He just happened to be Holy Roman Emperor at the time."" ""Holy?"" she asked. ""That's a word he used. We were only ever told that he was Roman Emperor without that extra word on the frontbut apparently he was also a leader for something called a *religion?*"" My blood ran cold at that word that Noah had once shied away from explaining. He stood watching us now with deep concern. I could tell this was exactly what he had feared unleashing among us by trying to explain concepts we had never encountered before. ""Millions of people believe this,"" Larentia continued. ""The Vanguard men and women from the Empire already knew about it. A bunch of them confirmed everything he's saying. They say its thousands of years old, even older than Conrad. Why haven't we ever heard about this before?"" Flavia put up both her hands. ""Come on. We can't be questioning ourselves right now. It's not the time!"" ""Now *is* the time if we're about to risk our lives! What if we die and end up in the bad place because we didn't follow the rules? Conrad says you can only go to the good place if"" ""Conrad says?"" Caecilia interrupted. ""That man has been *unstable* ever since we found him lying in a hospital bed and staring up at the ceiling. Why should we listen to anything he says?"" Larentia looked to her right, and Paulinus took the lead by saying, ""*What if he's right?* The stakes are too high not to talk about this!"" He stared down at his hands. ""All my life I've tried to do the right thing by duty and by our people, but lately I've had no idea what to say or do because black and white were luxuries afforded only by the safety of civilization. Out here, all we've found are shades of grey."" ""And you think *he's* the one to guide you through the grey?"" Caecilia demanded, equally angry and scared because of this sudden change in her family. I didn't know what to tell them, but I did have something to add. ""Legate Yellow and her organization controlled the media we saw. I'm certain they've heavily edited our culture, both to militarize us and to avoid any mentions of this religion thing."" Caecilia's Dangerous Four all looked at me in surprise. For a moment, I had their attention. ""I've been wondering these same things, asking these same questions,"" I continued, desperate to share with them. ""I don't know if what's out there is Fate or Luck or Chance or this God thing, but someone I trust"" I glanced at Cristina without thinking. ""told me that religion has been used to *control people* for thousands of years. Beliefs about life and death do involve legitimate questions and real faith, but that doesn't mean we should blindly follow orders based on that faith."" ""I'm not saying anything about blind obedience,"" Paulinus said unhappily, following my gaze to glance at Cristina himself. ""I just want to hear more of what he has to say."" Is that all? Caecilia asked, both concerned and relieved. Is that really all? Yes. For a moment, it sounded like the issue had reached a tentative conclusion, but Septus stepped closer under the afternoon sun. Which one of these afterlives would Porcia be in? Could I potentially see her again? The uncertainty had spread to my own team like a virus, and I suddenly found myself as distraught as Caecilia. There was nothing we could do, either. They had a right to ask these questions just as I had asked them. I feared that my family would be taken advantage of by Conrad because they had not been processing these new concepts as long as I had, and because they did not have the inoculation Cristina had given me by telling me all about the bloody history of religious warfare throughout the ages. It seemed there was great danger in religious matters intersecting with secular interests. Septus, Larentia, Trajan, and Paulinus departed to go listen to more of Conrads message, leaving us halved and shaken. Sampson said, Could it hurt just to listen? I kept my three close with a personal request. Please dont. Not right now. Flavia and Celcus nodded; Sampson considered the issue for a moment, and then decided to stay. Caecilia had been the only member of her four present before, but now that solitude had taken on a darker meaning. Gathering the rest of us close, she asked with subtle fury, It seems we have two Enemies to face. What is Conrad thinking? Whats his aim? I looked to Noah, but he shook his head. He couldnt sense Conrads emotions either? I found that very disturbing. He couldnt sense Conrad or anyone from the Amber Worlds except for me. What did that mean? I saw Cristina glance to him, too, and I realized that she knew about his ability to sense emotions. It made sense, as they had already known each other. What battles had they fought together? They were both taciturn people who spoke little and revealed even less. But the rest of my companions knew nothing of those matters. He turned down command when we first found him, Flavia stated, answering the original question. Could he be gunning now for full control? Maybe he didnt see a reason then, Celcus offered. Sampson glared at the man in question across our camp as Conrad gave an unheard speech to several listeners. Or perhaps it was a manipulation. We are not as easily controlled as these men of the Empire. Heart pounding, I put forth, I think were uniquely vulnerable to this angle hes found. With an angry glare, Caecilia stated, Its time to make a move against him. Nothing too obvious,"" Cristina cautioned. ""Challenge the man, but dont challenge his message. That will just radicalize his followers. Concerned, Noah agreed. Our plan came together rather simply. Trekking across the camp together, we supported Caecilia as she claimed the attention of our centuria. There are a hundred and sixteen of us now, our blonde leader said loudly. We are comprised of fifteen or more disparate squads, and nobodys in command. We have a plan for breaking through the trap that lies on the other side of the black rift. Good. I nodded along with her words and met the gazes of our gathered onlookers with confidence. She had said nothing about Conrad, and carefully avoided claiming specific command rights. As we expected, her offer was taken as genuine, and discussions began among a dozen and a half Captains about the proposed idea. Also as we expected, because she had put the plan forward, they were naturally focused on her as a sort of implied leader. If life on Amber Three had taught us anything, it was the particulars of how soldiers came to submit to authority. Unfortunately, we had one major vulnerability. Im the key to this plan? Conrad asked, listening intently as the Captains discussed. His followers stood behind him, presenting double the number we had behind Caecilia. In that case, I should probably be in command during the mission. With all due respect, Caecilia countered politely. Weve got lifelong military backgrounds. Were very good at what we do, and we know this plan intimately. The Vanguard members we had ridden with so far did not know we were from the Amber Worlds, but they *had* seen us effortlessly control and slaughter the dangers of the multiverse. Many lent their voices and implied votes to our cause. Your lifelong military experience is but a fraction of my thousand years, Conrad replied, also politely. Ive led a campaign or two in my time. Caecilia smiled graciously. Ah, but youve been dormant for quite some time. We have been actively working as a team every day since the crisis began. He laughed with genuine excitement. That sounds like a challenge! Care for a friendly competition? He raised his arms high to stir up the crowd, and, not realizing what was at stake, the gathered travel-weary men and women began smiling and cheering. This was the third of our expected contingencies; Cristina had warned us of this possibility. Caecilia began our response with, A shootout perhaps? A test of aim? No, Conrad said, shrugging off the first offer. Power is not granted by guns, but by people. Something simpler, more organic is in order. Since youre claiming atrophy in me, a foot race seems appropriate. And I suppose you are claiming that any of your people are better than me? We hadnt expected that turn. Hed regained the initiative. Caecilia said carefully, Not so crass, but I have full faith in all of my brothers and sisters in arms. Then I challenge He scanned us and settled on Flavia for a moment, but I could tell that choosing the girl with the broken arm and broken leg would only make him look absurd in front of his followers. There was one other equally battered and wounded, but my wounds were not so obvious to people that had not seen them happen. Venita. Up for a race? I couldnt exactly turn him down after all the moves we had made, and my legs were actually the only part of me that had not been broken, slashed, kicked, or battered. All eyes turned on me, including those of Septus, Trajan, Larentia, and Paulinus, who now stood in the crowd halfway between Conrad and Caecilia. My family was on the line; Flavia, Celcus, and Sampson stood taller behind me, and I knew that I could do it. Draw up the course. His grin was wide and his eyes gleamed. Cristina had told me what the word Demon meant, and, in that moment cast bright by afternoon sunlight and made chill by a breeze moving stray red hairs past my vision, Conrad looked to me like a creature indigenous to the bad afterlifenot in form, not winged or blackened, but with that gleeful intent to see mayhem at any cost. They chose a route around the nearby hills. A hundred and fourteen people would stand upon high ground and watch two race along the dirt below and through one unseen length hidden by an upshot crag behind which shenanigans were expected and encouraged to occur. This would be both a race *and* a fight, thought I doubted the Vanguard watchers knew to what extent our struggle extended. A friendly shove or two, I imagine, one said. Another joked, Trip him if you can! In contrast, Caecilia told me quietly, Killing hims off the table. We dont even know if he *can* be killed through conventional means; even if he can, he hasnt done anything traitorous yet. Lets not escalate. Fighting down an intense bout of anticipatory nerves, I accepted her advice, stretched legs sore from days of riding, and tied my hair back as tightly as I could. We were down and out of sight of the main crowd gathering on the hill, and I realized that I was feeling something of the tournaments of old back at the academy. Flavia tapped the therapeutic brace on my once-broken arm. Hows your bone? I think I can survive without it for a little bit, I replied, and she helped me unclasp both the arm brace and its transmorphic mimic on my other side. Wow. Without these, I feel ten librae lighter. Holding them up, Celcus commented, Theyre actually pretty heavy. Sampson judged the course ahead. Every less ounce of weight matters. When I took off my outer grey clothing and pared down to just my undershirt, he turned red. I swear I didnt mean it like that. Win at any cost, right? I kissed him on the cheek thenand gripped Celcus and Flavias hands. Imbued with their support, I took a deep breath and stepped out into view near the start line. Conrad was already there stretching in just his grey undershirt, jeans, and boots as well; he'd had these clothes built by the machines at his facility, so I knew they were deceptively light and strong. He nodded at me in acknowledgement as the high hill erupted in shouts and cheers. I looked for Cristina, but found only Noah, who just shrugged when I asked him without words where she had gone. Was she not going to watch? Something about that absence stung, but I wasnt sure why. The pressure of the shouts and cheers dulled all but my trained strategic senses. I focused my breathing, readying myself to race a thousand year old Emperor along a dirty gully on an unnamed Earth. Conrad raised his arms and brought out cheers from the crowd, but most of the watchers I cared about were still ascending the hill. To me, he said with genuine respect and a hint of arrogance, Youre not going to make this easy, are you? What I could see of the course ahead began sussing itself out in my vision. Chunks of terrain simplified and turned into sequences of logical action. That mud was to be avoided, that flat dirt was to be sought, and stray rocks were to be given a wide berth. Had Conrad spoken? I ignored him. As Caecilia had said, he had not yet committed an unworthy or traitorous action, but his attitude alone was enough for me to deny him the respect normally deserving a competitor. Slow it down. Heartbeat. Pulse pressure rushing out. Breathe. Pulse pressure rushing in. Heartbeat. Gears moved in my mind and chains of action and reaction wove together into a cohesive whole. In a single instant, I saw my entire path up to the middle blind. His path would need to be dynamically accounted for along the way, and I gave him a generous estimate between equally fast and fifty percent faster than me. If it was less than thatif I was even slightly fasterno strategy would be needed. I sank into my starting stance. Alongside, Conrad did the same. His muscular arm formed a ninety-degree angle in the left side of my vision, hand pointed forward. I had spent much of my time with sleeves over my arm brace, so I guessed he did not know that my right arm had only recently healed from a break, but I had chosen the side that put him to my left just in case. Without the metal and accompanying gloves, my hands and arms felt exposed, but also extremely light. Somewhere above, the excited race foreman popped off a pistol, and that first moment of automatic reaction stretched out in my awareness as both Conrad and I leapt forward. The power of his arc would have given him a small lead, but I'd expected that from his remarkably thick legs. It was the instant timing of my trained reaction speed that kept us equal in the end. Our forward boots hit the dirt at the same time and distance. Lightning shot through me as he pulled away. I was only eighty percent as fast as I'd anticipated, perhaps due to all my injuries, but he was *sixty percent* faster than that baseline. For every span I managed, he achieved double that, reaching nearly five pedes ahead before I could reasonably react. There were no options or contingencies for dealing with such a mismatch, and the surprised shouts from the crowd on the hill rang in my ears. What to call upon in crisis? I'd known someone so fleet of foot that she had been able to save my life at the expense of her own. Porcia the Swift, beloved by Septus, but taken too soon to see where that might have gone. You were my sister. How did you move? How did you place your feet? What color was the energy of your presence? The blue fire inside me flared like a furnace fueled, filling my hands and feet and core with her memory. A sharpness of movement grew like blades along the arcs of my limbs, and my furious gaze on Conrad's back became an unbreakable chain. Under a wave of amazed shouts, the gap between us stopped widening. Imbued with Porcia's essence, I somehow matched Conrad's speed, but this first half of the course would not last forever, and I had only memorized the lay of what I could see. I would be forced to spend effort looking at the ground after the blind. If I was going to do something, it would have to be now. No longer processing individual footfalls, I became aware of interlocking equations, a kind of music of motion that I had at times felt when my team and I were in perfect sync. This was the essence of Celcus, my antikin, the subtle glue that held us all together. Calm confidence and observation, perhaps a product of his great height, had always formed the basis of the capable attitude which we held during crises. I called upon a memory of him during the major tournament back at the academy in which we had all, for one glorious duration, been a single entity. Thus I could see they were with me now. I had already been using Flavia's analytical mentality without even realizing it; the calculations, strategizing, and memorization of the course ahead had all come to me like donning a pair of sunglasses colored with her spirit. The drain of operating at nearly double physical capability was immense, but Septus' dogged determination spread through me in a surge, not to counteract the rapid exhaustion, but to make it possible to continue. Tacitus was there, too, in my silence and focus when Conrad had tried to engage and distract me. And RufusI knew you least of all, brother in arms, but you were still family. I've got your red hair as a symbol that you once lived and fought by my side. All these spirits burned both as fuel and as fire, and the distance between myself and Conrad began to shrink as the blind approached. His nearly-shaven head glinted with sweat, and I turned as he turned, arcing around the grey crag and out of sight of the crowd. The tilt of his head gave me warning I might not have had otherwise. The tensile strength in his legs was astounding, really, and I appreciated that even as he leapt forward, turned in the air, compressed like a spring, sloughed all of the force of his run, and sprang back at me with a kick aimed for my face. I instinctively knew he was going for a single-strike knockout given the momentum of my run into his boot, and I couldn't allow that to happen. What did I have left? Accumulated forces, vectors, a wellspring of motion; as it did in times of absolute crisis, Time slowed to a crawl to the tune of a single high violin note, and I used my glacial eye movements to study the path of his outstretched leg and murderously angled boot. At a snail's pace, it moved toward me sole-first, cast in blue shadows by the flames inside me blazing beyond full strength. I was on fire, a being of collective determination, and, as all other paths fell away to analyzed probabilities of likely failure, I decided to take a risk. Leaping forward myself, I accelerated rather than trying to avoid the kick. Rotation was the key. My core remained in motion along a vector toward his body, but my legs swung up rapidly, and my head swung back and down in kind, pressed upon by the sole of his boot but absorbing the force of his kick over a longer period of time than a direct impact would have allowed. Our cores met in the air, and I applied long slow energy to my arms to bring them around his body as that shrieking violin note became unbearable in pitch and I was forced to let it go. We fell abruptly to the ground with him on the bottom. Grunting against the pain of impact, he grasped at my limbs and we moved and countermoved into what I recognized as classic grappling type three. He was our Imperator. He'd helped design that system a thousand years ago. What match could I be for him? And his strength was phenomenal. Managing to get a knee and a foot on the ground, I pushed back, but he had meuntil the blue fire in my heart flared again and I called upon the essence of my first love. Sampson's strength was mine if I wanted it, because he loved me too, and I let the blue burn in my eyes as I met Conrad's gaze and, hands gripping hands, pushed him ever so slowly backward and up. The only emotion greater than his anger on his strained and sweaty face was his eager excitement. ""*How are you doing this?*"" I remained Tacitus, silent and focused. He rose with me and pushed back with all his raw strength, moving us to a mightily trembling standstill. ""Gisela worked on me for centuries,"" he grunted, eyeing me like a child anxious to understand a new toy. He risked putting a foot forward, and it paid off with drastically increased pressure. I remained Septus, dogged and unwilling to give up. His eyes grew darker. ""I represent the utmost of purely biological possibility. Genetic improvements. Muscles that never atrophy. A mind that can never fade. Tortures, all, in a waybut *you* should be nothing before *me*."" I remained Flavia, analyzing his every word, motion, and position for weaknesses. Finally, I had it: ""Maybe you're not the prize you thought you were."" His laugh was both haughty and self-deprecating. ""Or maybe you don't know your own strength, *girl.*"" He glanced down, indicating the dry earth cracking beneath our boots. The small amount of surprise that strangeness instilled in me gave him the edge. I stumbled and fell, and he approached with the intent to kick me while I was down. For a moment, I was back in the jade wasteland with Caecilia approaching in the same manner, and I called upon my last reserves to get up again. But I didn't need to. Conrad slammed into the ground face-first. The back of his skull had been caved in, and Cristina stood behind him, a heavy rock in both hands. ""I don't think he would have killed you,"" she told me, dropping the rock to help me up. ""But I prefer not to take that chance."" Exhausted, but not exactly angry, I took in the sight of my Imperator's corpse. ""What do we do?"" ""Nothing, I suspect,"" she responded, kneeling to study the oddly noisy wound and its squishy sounds. ""As I thought. It's already healing. Organic healing factor or nanites, I imagine. He'll be conscious shortly, so I suggest you finish this race."" My training kicked in and sent me jogging along at the fastest pace I could manage, but my thoughts were seized with the idea that Gisela's technology had *defeated Death.* What would the world look like if human beings couldn't die? There would never be another loss, never be another haunting painful absence. Was it possible? If I could somehow understand what changes had been made to Conrad to make him immortal, the risk of losing the people I loved on every single mission we went on would no longer be a thing to fear. The crowd on the hill cheered as I approached, and then positively *shrieked* as Conrad emerged from the blind and began closing rapidly. Seeing this, I used Celcus' essence to balance those of Porcia and Septus. No more analysis: just run! My awareness shrank to nothing but pounding footfalls forward. If a rock tripped me or a hole caught me, so be it. Gasping for air and beset by a hammering in my head, I fell. In the end, I'd stumbled over the backpack that represented the finish line. He blew past, but it was too late. Screaming and cheering people rushed around us, celebrating the upset. Someone pointed out to him, ""You've got some blood there. Everything alright?"" Conrad touched the back of his head and then grinned. ""Oh, it's fine."" Coming over and helping me up, he told me with sincerity, ""Very good showing. Very unexpected. Very exciting. I think we're going to have some fun, you and I."" The late afternoon sun hit the exact moment of transition into evening gloom as I returned his gaze. The shadow cast over his bright eyes told me that I might have won the first battle of whatever unknown war it was we were fighting, but more was absolutely coming. --- (continued below)"

That said, each one is designed to be completely enjoyable on their own. The reason I mention this is that, if you'd like more of the universe, there is already a small backlog ready for reading.) [You are viewing a public military document, captured from an Andromedan data terminal. Many other files were retrieved, but will remain classified until the end of the war.] --- ONE IS VIEWING CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS. IF ONE NOT OF RANK OPYA OR HIGHER IS FOUND TO HAVE READ PAST THIS POINT, ONE WILL BE TERMINATED. --- *Supreme Miosh Ara:* At the time of this account, the war between the Eternal Kingdoms of Man has carried on for [102.78 years], with all but 5 representing a complete stalemate. During the first [three years], we captured 3 of Man's 6 systems, at massive cost. For the last [two years] the Eternal Kingdoms of Man have captured 116 of our 11,776,231 systems in the Milky Way, and destroyed the former capitol, Nera Ai. This document will include summaries of all Andromedan information regarding the Eternal Kingdoms of Man. The Lyon Arbiters: A cell of Humans which use technology that escape even our mighty Empire. Reports have come in of units capable of creating gravity wells strong enough to crush our ships, and hundreds of reports of Arbiters mysteriously appearing in ships. They are largely responsible for the capture of the aforementioned 116 systems, and many theorize they were the ones to destroy Nera Ai. Many theories stem from this one, with most reasoning that the Arbiters were the ""unimaginable consequences"" warned about when the Andromedan Empire threatened to destroy Earth, home planet of Humans, which is strengthened by the fact that the Arbiters awoke just one week after Earth's destruction. See the Aorik series of documents, excluding Aorik-4, for more information concerning the Lyon Arbiters. Standard Fleet of the Eternal Kingdoms of Man: [""Standard fleet"" is a translation of an Andromedan term, meaning the fleet excluding special-class ships. In our case, the only non-standard they know of is the Fist of Man.] The standard fleet of the Eternal Kingdoms of Man is rather unlike that of our Empire. While the ships of Man tend to be similar in scale to those of the Royal Armada, theirs tend to be focused on mass transport and concealment of massive sums of small fighters, whereas the Royal Armada consists mostly of massive super weapons designed to destroy large vessels. While one would think this would work in our favor, allowing us to pick off the large carriers and the smaller vessels inside, the wedge shape of Man's ships combined with our captured shield technology make it nearly impossible to hit and destroy a carrier, and it goes without saying large super weapons don't fare well against small fighters. The Fist of Man: the staple of the fleet of the Eternal Kingdoms of Man, and a testament to their sheer arrogance, the Fist of Man is the largest single ship known to exist. It takes the iconic wedge shape of most human ships, but it is on a scale thought impossible, at [6000 miles, hell yeah] long, and [500 miles] thick at the thickest point. At the start of the war, its size was seen as a vulnerability, and as such hung far back during battles. However, when our technology was captured, it was upgraded with septuple-layered shields, which, on top of its thick armor, make it nigh-invincible to destroy. In addition to that, it carries 1.5 million smaller ships, not counting the ships carried by **other carriers on board.** Military command: rather than keep a war council and central leader separate, the Eternal Kingdoms of Man has a central Council of Kings that manage all facets of managing the human race. In turn, each king has a [cabinet] of advisors that each specialize in different area. A single king can have up to 20 advisors, ranging in specialty from war to agriculture to research. Each king is democratically elected every [5 years] by the planet one represents, and are disallowed from serving consecutive terms. The kings used to communicate idly over time, making decisions very slow, which gave us a much larger advantage early in the war, but since the capture of our FTL communication, the council convenes regularly on Sol Venus, streamlining the command process. Humans: Humans are bipedal, sentient life forms. They possess only an endoskeleton, two locomotive limbs, and two manipulating arms. Their vital organs are located in the fused thorax and abdomen, as well as the mass on top of their bodies, called a head, which was once thought vestigial. From their heads, they are capable of perceiving photons as well as minute changes in pressure, and there are reports of them detecting microscopic particles in the air, though it's unclear how they do this. While a human appears unarmed, without any sort of sharp protrusion or poisonous growth, a typical improvised weapon or the bony growths on their manipulating arms can crack or even shatter an unintended carapace. Approach with caution. Weaponry: humans are very fond of kinetic bombardment, with most of their armaments pertaining to the rapid launch of slugs, usually through the use of gravity or magnetic force. The weapons themselves usually vary only in size, but the rounds fired can be any number of things. Solid steel, fragmentation, incendiary, poisoned, explosive, cryogenic, and magnetic shots have all been confirmed. Reports of shield disrupting and acidic shots have not been confirmed. [That concludes the portion of the document suitable for civilians. The Andromedan Empire fears us, as all creatures do. Long live the Kingdoms.]"
131,vulnerability,HFY,Chrysalis (8),1549,59iook,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/59iook/chrysalis_8/,2016-10-27 04:02:47,"&amp;nbsp; *[Previous chapter](URL *[First chapter](URL &amp;nbsp; *** &amp;nbsp; Numbers. War, I was realizing, was about numbers. About logistics. The more I thought about it, the more I examined the information I had gained from the spaceports in the worlds I conquered, the shipping manifests and flight plans, the contents of downed cargo vessels... the more I realized it was true. It felt somehow wrong, to put logistics in front of critical topics such as military tactics and strategies, intelligence gathering and attack formations. The word itself, *logistics*, sounded dry and machine-like. A word belonging to the quarterly finance report of a gray corporation, one of those where workers wore uniforms and accountants ruled from behind cryptic ledgers. A word that felt out of place in a battlefield, almost like an affront, a slap in the face of humanity's long history of military leaders and their genius maneuvers. And yet, it was true. At first, when I left Earth, I had considered myself one of those leaders. A general in command of an army of drones, recurring to subterfuge and clever tactics to best my enemies. The trap I had laid in the asteroid belt was a good example of that. I was carrying the torch, following the steps of Sun Tzu and Alexander. Honoring their past achievements by keeping our military ingenuity alive, even if humanity itself had perished. And for a time, it had worked. But the more I expanded, the larger my army grew, the less I could keep seeing myself as a military commander. No, I wasn't just the leader, just the commander. I was the state in its entirety, the whole *nation*. I was the generals, yes, but also the soldiers. I was the workers back home. I was the factories and troop transports. I was the truck drivers delivering loads of ammunition to the front lines, and the miners extracting raw resources. I was the dead bodies, and the young men training to replace them. I was the system, the supply chains, the economy itself. A well-oiled, self-improving war machine continuously pushed to its working limit. The moment I began thinking like that, I started seeing the underlying patterns. The dependencies between my different factories, drones and ships. The hidden relationships of supply and demand. The unbalances and inefficiencies I could fix. My fleets of drones weren't armies. Not really. They were numbers. Quantifiable, discrete measurements. A positive to the Xunvirian's negative. War was about numbers. Odd then, that I had never been good at numbers. That I had always struggled with algebra and calculus, with the statistics course I had needed to take in college. I remembered failing to grasp the abstract concepts, asking for help to my classmates when I got stuck with the exercises I had been assigned. Or had I? It was strange. As clear as my memory of failing in the course was, I also remembered teaching those very same concepts to my partners during my time at the institute. Did I become better at it after college? I cursed again my fragmented, blurry memories. In any case, it all came natural to me now. It was easy, to maximize the function that represented how many more assault soldiers I could produce in the time gained by removing one of the outer plate covers in their design, and whether that gain would compensate the increased losses due to enemy fire. To optimize the drone swarming patterns as to reduce their total fuel consumption. Or to figure out where to attack the Xunvir Republic to create the greatest amount of damage. What node in their own economic and supply system was the most critical, the most vulnerable. Take the planet in front of me, for example. It wasn't beautiful, not really. Yes, it could support life, had an atmosphere and clouds and liquid water. But it lacked that singular touch, those vibrant colors, that... liveliness that Earth once had. The same one the colonies I had destroyed had also shared. No, the planet in front of me was dull in comparison. Its scarce clouds weren't puffy white but washed out gray and brown. Its seas were not aquamarine but murky, unappetizing. It didn't have those same green, lush forests and endless grass plains from those other worlds. Even its very location worked against it. It orbited a gas giant -which made it a moon, technically-, the massive ball of turquoise clouds and its concentric rings stealing all the attention, all the spectacle. Compared to that majesty, the small dull planet floating by was easy to ignore. Irrelevant. Except it was anything but. Looking into the lower part of the EM spectrum revealed the truth. There, the planet *shone*. I could see the grid-like patterns of its extensive factories and the myriad transportation networks linking them together. The hundreds of kilometers-wide spaceports dotting its surface. The buried power conduits, energy flowing through them like blood through veins, giving life to manufacturing complexes and refineries the size of cities. The planet was immersed in a sea of radio transmissions, electromagnetic waves emanating from its surface like petals from a blooming flower. There were orbital assembly yards with both cargo freighters and warships still mid-construction. An almost continuous trail of spaceships entering and leaving its atmosphere, carrying goods and people, following the space lanes that would take them to the nearby systems or to the mineral processing outposts scattered throughout the gas giant's rings. No. The planet in front of me was anything but dull. It was one of those critical nodes. A junction, a crossroads of sorts, in the supply and production chains of the Xunvir Republic. Destroying it, taking it out, would be like removing the keystone from an arch. Halted production lines, entire pivotal industries vanishing and dying, lack of goods and transportation, scarcity... chaos. If I managed to win here, then I could just sit down and watch as the Xunvir Republic fragmented and crumbled under its own weight, reverting from an interstellar civilization back into a series of smaller, independent planetary nations. Which was the reason I was currently approaching the planet, along with thirty-nine of my support ships, an attack swarm one million four hundred thousand units strong, and carrying more than one hundred thousand thermonuclear warheads. Of course, it wouldn't be that easy. The Xunvirian fleet guarding the planet, I had expected. It was composed of the ragged remains of their navy, huddled together and without any pretense at organized battle formations. It had both the ships that had survived the previous encounters, and those that had stayed in the rearguard. Destroyers in need of repairs, old battleships that should had been decommissioned but had received a last minute makeover instead, and modern cruisers straight out of the assembly line, their hulls still bare and without any paint coating. Them, I had expected. It was the other fleet, the one that was almost seven times as large as the Xunvirian's, that looked like a mismatched congregation of warships of all origins and colors -some flashy and elegant, others curved and bulbous; some narrow and agile, others powerful and sturdy-, the one whose ships' flanks were turned towards me, that blocked my path of advance towards both the planet and the Xunvirian fleet... That one, I hadn't expected. The sight was imposing; it was meant to be. So many enemies, so many species, so much destructive power gathered against me. Their missile batteries, their hundreds of energy beams projectors all aimed at either my support crafts or my own body... It was a message that required no words, a communication beyond language, the kind that could be found in the African savanna when two predators faced each other over a downed corpse. Which, of course, reminded me that the African savanna did no longer exist. If I had any doubts, any uncertainty, they vanished. I kept my approach. With a thought, I released my swarm of drones, setting it to swirl around my body and the neighboring support ships, blanketing us like a protective, shifting shield. This time the message, the radio signal, didn't come out of the Xunvirian fleet. It was the newcomers who talked. And they didn't send their communication in dozens of languages, didn't repeat it. It was delivered only once, in English. ""Hostile approaching fleet, codenamed as *Terran*. This is a message from the Galactic Federal Council. The Xunvir Republic and the planet of Anacax-Farvin is under our protection. Cease immediately your approach or you will be destroyed. This is the only warning you will receive."" The word irked me. *Terran.* As if the only relevant thing about me, the only connection I still had with my origins was being from Earth. As if I wasn't worthy of being called *Human* anymore. But I pushed that thought aside as I considered the situation, the fact that this Galactic Council was siding with the Xunvirians, and that they knew of my origins. How much else did they know? Were they aware of my nature? Did they know what the Xunvirians had done to Earth? Or maybe... had they themselves been complicit in the destruction of my species? A sickening thought crossed my mind as I remembered the two aliens I had let go. Had they gone running back to their homeworlds, crying about the big bad monster rampaging through the Xunvirians' territories? Was the presence of this fleet here my own fault? Something that I could have avoided had I just gunned down those two? Was this their response to my attempt at coexistence? So much for olive branches. I considered ignoring the message, as I always did. But I didn't want to, not this time. Maybe because the ones sending it weren't the Xunvirians themselves. Maybe because I didn't want to justify their views about me, to solidify my status as some sort of mindless villain. It's not that I really cared that much about what they thought, but I still had myself to answer to. And in some way, I wanted to stand my ground. To be heard. Even if they ended up siding with the Xunvirians anyways. ""Leave,"" I transmitted back. ""You are not my enemies, I don't wish to fight you."" Strange, to speak again. Ever since I woke up in the ruins of Earth, I hadn't pronounced a word, hadn't needed to use my voice modulator. I remember thinking that I would always be alone, that I wouldn't talk to anyone again. It seemed I had been wrong about the latter, at least. A few seconds passed without a response. I guessed they weren't expecting me to talk back, and were just going through the motions when they had sent their warning. I felt a faint amusement at the idea that just by speaking those few words I had already thrown a wrench in their carefully laid out plan, sending them off script. Were their generals discussing how to proceed right now? Calling their leaders back home and asking for instructions? The different species that were represented in this fleet arguing to each other? I guessed that was one of my advantages. Not having to spend any time talking, convincing, coordinating different people and their agendas... No, my thoughts translated into plans and actions with the same speed and ease that I had once had when moving my own body. ""Terran. We are glad you've decided to communicate,"" they replied at last. The voice still had a synthetic tone to it that told me they were using some sort of translation tool, but the rhythm and intonation were slightly different, as if they had switched whoever was behind the microphone. ""We hope that we can reach an agreement to end this conflict, and we want to welcome you to the galactic community, provided you are willing to meet certain conditions. However, you must stop your approach immediately. Your unwarranted attack on the Xunvir Republic..."" ""Unwarranted?!"" I interrupted. ""The Xunvirians destroyed my world, exterminated my own species, down to the last one of us. If anything, I've been merciful so far."" A pause. ""Those... allegations are new to us,"" they said. ""We will start an investigation regarding your claims, and should they prove true-"" ""They are true."" I accompanied my response with a compressed info package of evidence. Video and audio recordings of the destruction of some of Earth's cities. ""...I see. We will examine this information. If we determine it to be authentic we can guarantee that the appropriate sanctions and provisions will be applied. We will also take it into consideration when judging your own recent actions. We can be lenient, but in return we need you to meet us midway and agree to our conditions."" ""What conditions?"" ""First, you need to stop your attacks, right away. Second, you will return the conquered systems back to the Xunvir Republic and dismantle any resource extraction outposts and factories you might have built in them. Third, you will refrain from any sort of exponential growth and limit the construction of new ships and machines to a linear rate, which will have to be verified by a team of observers from the Council."" A deep anger started boiling inside of me. Did they think I was *stupid*? ""Right,"" I said. ""So you want to disarm me, reduce me to the point where I can't fight back. Where you can simply finish me off and complete the job the Xunvirians started. The answer is no."" ""That is not our intention, Terran. Our objective is merely to prevent more loss of life. We can guarantee that your existence and your rights as a sentient being will be respected, and that..."" ""Can you guarantee justice? That the Xunvirians will pay for what they did?"" I hadn't reached the Council fleet yet, but already I ordered my drones to begin accelerating towards it, grouping them into smaller squadrons according to their attack patterns. ""Justice, yes,"" they replied. ""*Justice,* according to the law of the Galactic Federal Council. An impartial trial, driven by logic rather than emotion, where the Xunvirians can exercise their right to a defense. With economical and political sanctions in case they're found guilty, with those directly responsible going to prison. But not this. What you are doing is not justice, it's vengeance."" ""So, a slap on the wrist, in other words. You are siding with them."" ""Terran, we are not *siding* with..."" ""Yes, you are! You might not be directly responsible yourselves, but you are enabling their behavior. They commit a genocide, murder an entire species, and they get to keep going. They get to have a future, the one they denied us... No, this here is what they deserve. And even this will be just a fraction of what they unleashed on us."" I had my support ships angle their flanks towards the enemy vessels, the laser projectors I had installed in them locking into targets. ""You can't pretend to fight the whole galaxy and win, Terran! This doesn't have to end like this. Stop now and we can discuss..."" ""No!"" I said. ""Not until they've paid for what they did, until humanity has had its retribution. We have discussed enough. I don't want to be your enemy, but if you side with the Xunvirians, if you try to stop me from doing what is only fair... then you will be no better than them, and I *will* fight you. This is the only warning *you* will receive."" With that, I ordered five of my large escort ships to open fire on one of the Xunvirian destroyers. Its protective shields came up immediately, wrapping the targeted vessel in the familiar looking soapy bubble. But war was about numbers. It was about the output of the Xunvirian destroyer's power plant pitted against the combined potential of my five escort ships. Of the efficiency of its radiators, emanating the immense energy the shield was receiving back into space as heat, against the performance ratio of my re-engineered laser projectors. The destroyer exploded, wrapped in a blue flash. The Council fleet opened fire, targeting my main body and my support ships. The shield projectors I had installed kicked into action, withstanding the barrage as they drained energy from the ships' respective power plants. My swarm surged forward like a crashing wave. &amp;nbsp; Thousands, hundreds of thousands of drones accelerating. A thick mass of ever shifting formations, corkscrew and fractal patterns. The combined movement of its constituent units making it look like it was some sort of gigantic living organism, morphing and changing, pulsating, always evolving. But I knew where each drone was. I was in control, sending radio commands to each one of them, simultaneously telling each and every one of them how to move, where to go. Receiving their responses, analyzing the feedback their sensors were always sending back to my central processing units. My mind integrating the information into a complete picture, the drones becoming part of me. A mere extension of my will. I always knew which of them carried laser projectors, and which transported my army of assault soldiers. I was always aware of where each thermonuclear warhead was. Those I switched positions, kept them in permanent motion, weaving them in and out of formations, making sure they'd be hard to track by the enemy computers. Easy to miss in the sea of machines. As if I was playing a shell game with the enemy fleet, one with thousands of simultaneous moves. One where the numbers were disproportionate, and the stakes deadly. I aimed most of my assault soldiers towards the Council fleet. I guessed it wouldn't be easy, but I wanted to capture some of the unusual ships. I had already learnt all that the Xunvirian war technology had to teach me, and I was ready for the next step. If the crashed vessel I had found in the destroyed colony was any indication, this Council's species were more advanced than the Republic, and it looked like reverse engineering their technology could give me an extra edge. I had set my eyes in two of their largest ships in particular. One was marble white, its polished surface glinting under the vibrant light of the dozens of energy beams crossing the battlefield. It reminded me of a giant bone, as if I was looking at the femur of some titanic creature. The second target was the biggest battleship in their midst. A starfish looking thing of iridescent blue and green colors. Its ventral energy weapon was activated, sending a continuous stream of heat and energy that went crashing into the shield that protected my main body, dwarfing the other attacks I was receiving. That amount of power, the sheer strength of that weapon... Yes, I wanted to take over that one ship. The amount of damage my body's shield was receiving from it was large enough that I expected it to collapse in less than a minute. So I had to recur to my escort ships. I ordered them to get close to my body, and to willingly put themselves in front of me, right in the path of the energy beam. To take the full onslaught for a few seconds at a time. It was a complex maneuver, but it worked. As the shield in one of the ships was about to collapse, it moved out of the way just to be replaced by the next one. All of them sharing the load in turns, helping each other so that none of them would be destroyed. As the front of my swarm neared the enemy formation, a few of the smaller Council ships moved forward. The gold and green wedge-shaped frigates positioned themselves at the front of their fleet, between my swarm and their most valuable battleships, and opened fire on my drones with their laser projectors. Unlike what the Xunvirians had accustomed me to, these lasers weren't powerful. They didn't burn with the intensity of a small sun, weren't designed to take out battleship-class starships. No, these were low energy, thin white trails of light. But they had dozens, hundreds of them. Each projector swiftly tracking a drone and burning it down, then rotating towards the next target without a pause. It was a good move, a good counter to my usual tactics. The Council had decided to go with quantity over quality for the energy weapons of their frigates. Apparently they were aware that my drones lacked shields, and so had correctly deduced that even a weaker laser would be enough to dispatch them. Rather than firing one too-powerful beam of energy at a single drone they had opted for firing tens of less powerful ones, each at a different target, allowing them to burn faster through the swarm. Yes. A good move. I would have tipped my hat. It was a pity they were acting on outdated intel, though. I hadn't installed shields in all my drones, of course. That would have been prohibitively expensive. No, what I had done is designing a new kind of support unit, one that *only* carried a shield. Nothing else. I had built and placed several thousands of them scattered throughout the swarm. I set these shielder drones to move forward now, accelerating through the thick of the swarm, the other crafts under my control moving out of the way in a choreographed motion to let them reach the front of the battle faster. With a thought, their shields came online, thousands of new soapy bubbles appearing all over the place. Each one a few hundred meters wide, more than enough to cover both the machine casting it and its close neighbors, as if they were oversized umbrellas with room for an entire group of people. It wasn't nearly enough to cover the entirety of my swarm, of course. But I didn't need to, I only needed to provide protection to the front lines, so to speak. To the drones leading the charge, the ones most battered by the onslaught of enemy fire. To their credit, the Council commanders reacted fast to this new development. As one, their frigates stopped spreading their fire among multiple machines and started focusing their beams into a single target, trying to get at the one shielder drone that was at the center of each bubble. Their previous decision to mount separate and weaker energy beams hindered them here, though. In the battle of numbers, focusing several independent laser projectors into a single target was less efficient than using a single, more powerful beam to begin with. There was simply more energy lost as heat to conductor resistance, more wasted power. Ironically, they would have been better off now had they not tried that one good move against me in the first place. But my shielder drones weren't perfect either. They were small crafts after all, their power plants not really capable of offsetting the combined attacks the bubbles were receiving for too long. So now and then, their shields collapsed for a couple of seconds, the time their generators needed to cool off, to vent enough heat into space before the shields could be re-engaged again safely. Two seconds of vulnerability for every twelve seconds the shield was up. Didn't seem like much, but it was more than enough for the enemy laser beams to destroy the drone casting it. So I ordered the machines inside each protective bubble to swirl around the central shielder drone, making orbiting movements, spiraling clockwise and counter-clockwise without ever leaving the protection of the spherical shield. It was an attempt at confusing the enemy's tracking systems, difficulting their targeting of the shield caster. I even went so far as to synchronize their movement with the bubbles' vulnerability periods, so that whenever a shield temporarily went down, one or two of my disposable drones would just *happen* to be in the path of the incoming enemy beams, sacrificing themselves to protect the critical shielder unit. It was maddening. The amount of radio traffic filling the empty space, the amounts of information I was sending and transmitting with every single second. The stress of coordinating the movements of more than one million vehicles, of making sure each one of them was at the right place, at the right time. Of tracking enemy projectiles and calculating their future paths so that my machines could dance around them. I had never fought like this. It was crazy. It was intense. It required my every thought, my every processing cycle. And I loved it. I cherished every second of it. I was making nested fractal patterns, designing paths that followed Fibonacci spirals, that drew sequences inside sequences, numerical progressions that manifested as whirling formations, apparent chaos that spontaneously resolved as order before disappearing again. The drones moved with fluidity, weaving in and out of complex evolving configurations that I didn't have time to consciously register before they were gone. With no room for second guessing, no time for over-analyzing my decisions, I was acting on pure instinct now. An instinct I didn't know I had, sending orders and applying patterns just because they *felt* right. And they *were* right. Pure. It was a thing of beauty, of numbers that only I could see. A work of art only I could appreciate. That nobody else knew even existed. And as the battle raged outside, as missiles crossed the skies and ships died and explosions blinded sensors and whirling drone formations wrapped around battleships... I was fighting an inner battle of my own, every bit as intense. My processing units were in overdrive, my server farms burning hot. I was shifting through oceans of information, analyzing and correlating and projecting thousands of paths into the future, sending orders and receiving torrential amounts of input data from my million eyes. Constructing models of the battlefield and optimizing data structures, prioritizing targets and going through massive indexes to find the key attack patterns I needed to use. I had drones surround the vanguard Council frigates, spiral around them, cut their hulls open with dozens of moving laser beams. I discarded an entire dataset when I realized the battlefield had moved towards the upper levels of the brown planet's atmosphere, the minuscule drag created by the scattered atoms of nitrogen and oxygen nullifying some of my projections. Not by much, but I was standing over a very narrow edge, working at the very limit of my machines' abilities, drones sometimes flying right by each other with only two or three meters to spare. It had to be perfect. Two Xunvirian battleships tried to flank the thick of my swarm, taking advantage of the confusing battlefield. But *I* wasn't confused. I had already estimated the high likelihood of their maneuver and had placed ten nuclear warheads in their predicted path. I detonated them now, the battleships vanishing inside the bright flashes. My assault soldiers were now crawling across the outer hulls of the targeted battleships. I had them look for entrances, blow open vents and force their way through narrow openings. I was winning. Despite the unexpected appearance of a new, numerous enemy. Despite the higher technology the Council fleet was deploying. Despite their clever tactics designed to counter mine. I knew I was winning. The enemy fleet had managed to contain the tide of the swarm somewhat, but I knew their defensive positions were compromised, their entire formation about to collapse. I had only to push a bit further, a bit harder. And then everything changed. It felt like a slap to the face. Like being showered in cold water out of the blue. I wasn't entirely sure of *what* had happened, but I immediately knew something was *very* wrong. My view had... fragmented. I could no longer hold a cohesive picture of the battlefield in my mind. I couldn't integrate all the information I was receiving from my drones into a single model. Instead, I now had separate views. Conflicting narratives. Drones popped in and out of my awareness, blinking like Christmas lights. As if they were being destroyed and immediately brought back to life. And I wasn't sure of where exactly any of my machines were anymore. I had two or three different positions for each, as if they had somehow doubled in my mind. I was still trying to direct them, but their movements had turned spasmodic. My orders were inconsistent, and I couldn't visualize the swarm as a whole anymore. The carefully constructed patterns and formations were unraveling fast, as drone collided into drone, as they drifted out of the protective bubbles and were promptly destroyed, as order turned into chaos. I felt a cold fear in my gut. A sinking feeling. Something was *seriously* wrong here. Was the problem caused by my own mind, somehow? Had any of my server farms crashed, crippling me? Was I having a virtual stroke of sorts? I launched a desperate, quick diagnostic process to check my own databanks, my own processors and internal systems. It was a basic analysis, I knew, but everything looked okay. So what was it, then? I turned my attention towards a single drone, ignoring the rest of the now disorganized swarm. I ordered it to engage its thruster and move forward. It didn't. The cold fear turned icy. I repeated the order. This time the machine obeyed, moving forward, but something odd happened. The drone was still reporting being at its old position, even though I could see it had moved through the visual sensors in my own body. The mismatch caused it to double in my mind, as if it had suddenly turned into two separate machines, one still, the other moving forward. Odd. Disconcerting. Nauseating. I told the machine to stop, but it ignored me and kept advancing, getting into the path of another drone. The two crafts collided at high speed, destroying each other. Had all my drones suddenly turned stupid? Had the enemy hacked them? No. I noticed they still were following their programming, their last orders. It was more like if they... *Ah.* I glanced into the low EM spectrum, paying more attention to the transmissions I was receiving, both from the drones as well as the background radio waves coming out of the planet. And then it clicked. The problem wasn't in my drones, nor in my own processing units. No, they were all working just fine. The problem was that I was being jammed. The Xunvirians had tried that before, of course. They had tried to drown my communications in a deep blanket of EM noise, or use EM pulses against me. But invariably they had failed. My signals always came ahead, my transmitters too strong, my drones' electronics too well shielded and designed to work in an environment where nuclear warheads were going off left and right. I couldn't be jammed. Except the Council had apparently found a way. All the orders I was sending to my machines, all the feedback the drones were relaying back to me... it was all scrambled, distorted. All the signals, all the radio transmissions I was receiving or emitting were garbled. Warped, doubled and tripled, just like light passing through some sort of strangely curved kaleidoscope. When I glanced into the EM spectrum, I felt like I was watching the world through eyeglasses that didn't fit my prescription. I didn't even know such a thing was even possible, let alone how they were doing it. Some of my messages survived the process relatively intact, and parts of the information the drones were relaying still contained some consistency by the time they reached me, which is why I still had *some* degree of control, spasmodic as it was. But it wasn't enough. Not to fight at the level I needed to. War was numbers, and I had just lost mine. As if to cement that thought, the enemy fleet opened fire. With all their energy beams at the same time, with a salvo of missiles. Ignoring the swarm. Focusing all their fire, all their destructive power on a single target. Me. My shields kicked in, my power plant struggling to keep up under the combined barrage. I started extending my radiator panels to vent the excess heat, even though I knew doing so in combat would risk the delicate surfaces getting damaged. But I needed an edge, I needed that extra five percent efficiency I knew I could get if I wanted to survive this attack. That was when the super-charged beam of the starfish battleship opened fire again, targeting me. I only had a fraction of a second of warning before my shields gave way. I could still feel pain, I discovered. A very toned down version. Not the kind of pain I remembered feeling in the past. Not like that one time when I had accidentally cut my hand with a kitchen knife. No, this was different. Muted, but oddly similar. I felt the impact, the heat. The shock, the loss. The failure. The powerful energy beam burned through my ceramic plates, straight past my second and third armor layers. It vaporized its way through internal storehouses and drone assembly factories. It cut fuel lines and energy conduits. I watched through the cameras inside my body as an expanding ball of flames and heat advanced along kilometers worth of maintenance corridors, walls bursting, sensors dying and platforms collapsing in its wake. I didn't have time to take stock. No time to evaluate the damages I had just received before I felt the next impact, the next laser beam cutting deep into my structure and destroying one of my auxiliary thrusters, the resulting explosion shocking my entire body. They were killing me. &amp;nbsp; *** &amp;nbsp; *[Next chapter](URL &amp;nbsp; *** *AN: Wooo! Longest chapter in the story so far. So proud of it! Look at it go!* "

To run. All I wanted was to engage my warp drive and jump back to another system. Someplace safe, where I could take a breath, lick my wounds and repair my damages. But of course, that wasn't an option. My warp drive would take several minutes to get ready for a jump in the best case, and I wasn't going to survive for that long. No. I was trapped here. I wished I had never decided to tie myself to a single body. I knew I had done so as a way to keep myself human, a way to silence that always present inner voice that told me what I risked transforming into. But right now I would gladly pay that price to have a way to simply transfer my mind to a different set of processing servers, light years away from here. Or even to have made a backup of myself. Repulsive as that thought might still feel. No time for regret, though. I had to do something. Right now. I engaged my remaining thrusters and maneuvered so that one of my support ships would lie between myself and the starfish battleship, taking my place at being hit by the powerful energy beam. I knew it wouldn't last longer than the four or five seconds it would take the enemy to slightly reorient their ship -I couldn't really hide my twenty-seven kilometers body behind a two kilometers ship. But it would give me the short respite I so needed. A few seconds in which to re-engage my shields and plan my next move, to figure out a way to survive the ordeal this battle had suddenly turned into. My position was desperate. I had lost my swarm, all my drones moving chaotically around the battlefield, with no order or purpose. I had lost my support ships. Incapable of maneuvering, of returning fire... they had turned into little more than sophisticated floating boulders. My own body was bleeding. There were uncontrolled fires inside my main structure, with entire sections that had lost power, or that were exposed to the vacuum of space. The damage wasn't catastrophic yet, and I managed to restore functionality to my shields thanks to the radiators gambit. But I was still being hit by a multitude of energy weapons, and unless that changed soon I had no doubt my shields would fail again on short notice. And when that happened... well, I knew I wouldn't survive many more of these kind of hits. Strange, that I wasn't panicking. Did I feel trapped? Yes. Shocked, confused? Sure. But I wasn't panicking. If anything, I felt a cold anger. It was like a comeback to my memories of the destruction of Earth. That same helplessness. These aliens were hurting me, brutalizing my body with their powerful weapons. I was trapped, defenseless. Facing overwhelming odds. That sense of failure, of having gone this far just to get beaten down again. To be brought down to the ground, my weapons so easily stolen right out of my hands. The idea of admitting defeat, of contacting the Council fleet to offer my surrender crossed my mind, but I rejected it with disgust. No, I'd rather die. And it wasn't a figure of speech, I realized with some surprise. No, I really meant it. I'd rather die. I considered for a moment flinging myself straight towards the planet. Accelerating at the top speed my damaged thrusters would provide, pushing my way through the Council fleet's defensive positions, through the atmosphere... and crashing right into the world. How big had the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs been? About ten kilometers, if my databanks didn't lie. I wouldn't be traveling that fast, true, but I guessed twenty-seven kilometers worth of spaceship falling out of the sky at top speed would still be pretty destructive. And if I was going to die here, if this was as far as it would get... then I might as well go out with a bang. But I didn't do it. Not yet. Instead, I considered my position, my options, trying to find some other path I could take. Some vulnerability in their plan I could still exploit, that would allow me to take back control over my drones. I needed information. I knew I was being jammed, but little more than that. Was it me the only ship that was receiving this attack, or was it some sort of area disruption affecting the entire battlefield? Did distance influence the jamming? Was it a single enemy ship doing this? And if so, was there a way for me to take it down? My own radio sensors were useless, providing only garbled information. But those weren't the only sensors in my fleet. I reached for my support ships, asking them to check their sensors, to tell me if they too were being affected by the strange distortion effect. Due to the complete communications breakdown, I had to repeat my orders several times before one of the ships replied, and when it did it took me some effort to interpret the distorted answer, causing the mounting nausea I was experiencing to worsen. But I got my answer. Their radio sensors were working just fine. So it was only me who was being jammed. Interesting, but ultimately useless. My swarm was centralized through myself, all orders and commands originating from my own body. So even if the drones could still talk to each other, they didn't have anything to say to their partners. They were all listening to me, but I couldn't talk. Or more like... I could talk, but my voice had turned into some unintelligible mess, with only a few clear words here and there. I had originally thought about using the support ship's sensors to locate the source of the jamming, but given that whatever it was only affected my main body, it was pointless. The other ships couldn't locate what they couldn't see in the first place. Plus, the amount of coordination that it would have required was past my current diminished capabilities. A salvo of enemy missiles approached my flank. Without the swarm, I couldn't have my drones fly to intercept them. I activated my own laser projectors, tracking a few of the projectiles and burning them down, but there were just too many and my energy weapons were too slow to get all of them. Ironic, to be on the receiving end of one of my own tactics. Four missiles impacted my hull, passing through my shields and leaving gaping holes in my flank, each new explosion destroying drone carrying compartments and internal hangars. I relaxed a bit when I noticed the projectiles had been loaded just with conventional explosives, rather than the nuclear warheads I would have used. I was thankful they weren't following my own tactics to the letter. Still, it helped me realize how precarious my position still was. The only thing the support ship was protecting me from was that one single super-weapon, and even that was about to change as I could see the battleship rotating. But other than that, I was still exposed to anything the enemy wanted to throw at me. There was no way to hide, not here. No. I had to find a better cover, and the only available one I could think of was to get into the thick of the swarm. Surrounded by the sea of my own machines. It wouldn't be as perfect as if I had instructed the swarm to blanket me, but it would offer much more protection than remaining in the open. The problem was, I didn't really know where the swarm was anymore. Not exactly. My view of the battlefield was fragmented, conflicted between the mismatched positions the drones were reporting, and those of my own sensors. I didn't see one swarm, but dozens of them, as if coming from parallel realities. All superposed into each other, drones blinking in and out, moving between different planes of existence. It was hard to look at, making my processing units struggle to find some sense out of the chaos. It felt like a building migraine. I knew I had to let go of all that information. Surrender all pretense of control over my machines, even if it would leave me even more disarmed. But I didn't second guess myself. No time for that, really. I just went ahead and cut all communications with my own swarm, stopping all radio transmissions. Discarding all data from my EM sensors and relying solely on my visual and gravimetric ones. Immediately, the clashing views I had of the battlefield in my head all coalesced into a single, clear picture. The mounting headache simply vanishing. It was an odd picture. My drones had always been a part of me, an extension of my own body through different means. But now, for the first time ever, they looked *separate*. It was unsettling. It reminded me of one time when I had been sleeping over my own arm, causing it to lose circulation. I had woken up to what felt like an stranger's arm wrapped around me. The sea of machines looked similarly *strange*. They felt *alien*, inhuman even. Seeing them through my own sensors I couldn't perceive any of that order, of that beauty I had experienced before. It was strangely eerie, and I had the unnerving thought that the swarm was about to wake up from its slumber and start attacking me at any moment. Was this how the Xunvirians saw my drones? How they saw *me*? But the machines didn't attack me, of course, and I just couldn't afford the luxury of standing around until that ickiness I felt went away; so I just pushed it to the back of my mind and focused on the immediate task: getting into cover. I identified a portion where the swarm was the thickest, a blob large enough to cover my entire body, and without thinking it twice I rushed towards it. I engaged my thrusters and accelerated, crossing the empty space as fast as I could. The moment I started moving, the starfish battleship's weapon fell again on my shields, draining them fast. But this time I was counting on that, and my shields managed to hold long enough for me to reach the blob. I entered the thick of the swarm like a bowling ball, crashing into hundreds of machines, their bodies bouncing off the front of my hull, fragmenting into a sea of broken pieces, metal shards and engine components that followed my trail. But it worked. Every single enemy warship was shooting at me, but they now had thousands of vehicles to go through before their weapons could reach my body. Their missiles couldn't find a clear path among the sea of floating, deactivated drones either. They exploded in the periphery, clearing out entire sections of the swarm, but still far enough from me that they weren't an immediate threat. I had managed to get me a few minutes of respite, at least. But to do what, exactly? I wasn't sure. Could I maybe activate my warp drive now? Use it to get away? Perhaps... at the rate the enemy was burning through the swarm I guessed I would have time to spool it and make a short jump away before they got to me. But that would require diverting the energy that was currently powering my shields up. It was a risky move. I was half blanketed by the swarm, yes, but now and then a lucky energy beam still managed to pass through and hit me for a couple of seconds. Shutting down the shields would leave only my outer armor to tank the occasional damage. It should be enough, but if I was unlucky enough to get hit again by the starfish thing, and my shields were down when that happened... well, better not to think about that. Still, it seemed like a viable option, so I didn't discard it right away. But I wanted to try something else first. I wanted to see if I could get back my control over the swarm. I still didn't know where the jamming was originating from. It felt like I was surrounded by a small bubble of the distortion effect, but I knew it had to come from somewhere else. Was it one of the enemy ships? Many of them? Or did it come from somewhere else entirely, maybe even the planet? I just couldn't figure it out, didn't know enough about the technology they were using to locate its source. But now that I had removed the noise and confusion caused by the feedback coming from the faulty communications, and that I could spare the time to think, to pay attention to what was going on, I had noticed something else. I still had control over my outposts. My factories in the Centauri system, my resource extractors in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, my assembly lines in the Lehman solar system... they were all working as intended. I felt a dark amusement at the idea that I could easily send orders to a drone that was light years away, while the ones just a few meters from me were off-limits. But the revelation was important. It meant that whatever jamming method they were using, it was only affecting the local radio spectrum. My quantum entangled relays were still working just fine. Which... didn't help me much here. At least not on its own. The drones around me didn't have quantum communicators. Those were hard to manufacture, and too expensive to install in each single disposable drone. Specially when a simple radio transmitter sufficed. *Had* sufficed, I corrected myself. At least until now. But no, my quantum relays were... well, just that, relays. I had installed one at each outpost. I would send a message through the quantum link, and the relay would receive it and broadcast it to its own local space as a radio transmission. They had a low bandwidth, and introduced a delay that made them useless in combat conditions, but in essence they allowed me to control my outposts as if I was there. Almost. But I had never thought of using quantum links to talk to the machines that were already next to me. After all, you don't use a telephone when you want to talk to someone who is already in the same room you are. And in my case, the drones didn't even *have* phones. Not even my support ships, which I had designed to take along with me. Except that... I could always *build* new phones. Most of the assembly factories in my body were still operational. And while I had lost part of the raw resources and materials I was storing when some of my holding bays were destroyed, I still had plenty remaining. I could just manufacture a quantum relay. Slap it into a drone's chassis, and eject it away from my body, past the bubble of EM distortion surrounding me. Hopefully, I'd be able to reach it through the quantum link, and then have it relay my orders to control the nearby swarm just like I did my outposts. If I couldn't escape the bubble, maybe I could build me a backdoor. I set out to work immediately, my assembly lines back into action. I decided to build not one, but two quantum relays, just so I would have a replacement in case the Council managed to destroy or jam the first one. Transporting the materials from their storage areas and into the factories took some ingenuity, since the two main axial transport corridors were blocked by debris from the damage I had suffered. Instead, I used my internal worker units to carry the supplies through auxiliary maintenance corridors. All the time, I was monitoring the Council fleet. They were focusing their attacks unto the swarm, using their energy beams to dig a tunnel through the sea of machines, their missiles taking entire chunks out of it. The drones were still moving, drifting slowly all around me, so any space the enemy cleared was soon reoccupied by new machines. It was as if the Council ships were trying to dig a hole in a sandy beach. But it was working. Slowly but surely, their weapons were advancing towards me. I knew I wouldn't have much time to pull off my move. I decided to skimp on the details, then. My new relay drones wouldn't have power plants of their own, like the ones in my outposts. No, these would work out of pre-charged batteries. I also decided against giving them the ability to move on their own. Instead, I would just set them to drift away from my body. That way I wouldn't need to install the always complex thrusters and fuel lines. I was aware these manufacturing shortcuts would mean the relays' life expectancy would be in the order of half an hour to an hour. After that, their batteries would simply die, and they'd be unable to return home. But it didn't matter. At the rate things were going, if I hadn't won by then I would probably be dead. While I built these two relay drones, I also focused on repairing my internal injuries. I removed the oxygen still in my corridors and hangars to quench the remaining fires, and vented the leaked flammable gases out of my body, so as to lower the risk of new accidental explosions. I ran internal diagnostics, re-routed power lines and fuel pipes, and had maintenance drones start clearing the main corridors again. I noted that the living room I had built, the small reproduction of that memory from so long ago, had vanished. Along with the entire storage area that had contained it, which had now turned into a gaping hole exposed to space. Strange, not having noticed that loss until now. But on second thought, I guessed it wasn't that surprising. I had been more focused on survival than on pointless melancholy. I had to. Less than three minutes later my first quantum relay drone emerged from its factory, and I had a couple worker machines push it out of a landing bay and into space. Calling it a drone was a bit of a misnomer, though. The contraption was just a relay cobbled together with a radio transmitter and a battery, inside an otherwise empty spacecraft chassis. Hardly my best design, but maybe the most critical one if I could use it to escape this situation. I waited for it to drift a few hundred meters away, far enough that I knew it would have crossed the bubble of jamming distortion. I reached to it through the newly established quantum link, and ordered it to relay my transmissions back into the EM spectrum. Immediately, the swarm came back into focus, hundreds of thousands of machines popping into my awareness, eagerly awaiting my orders. I felt a wave of relief wash over me. With a mental smile, I accessed the machines' own EM sensors, relying in them instead of the still jammed ones in my main body. I restarted the attack patterns, ordering the drones to move forward again, towards the enemy. To engage their weapons, to surround the Council ships. The Council fleet's response was quick, too. Getting back on the defensive, their weapons focusing again in bringing down the approaching swarm. I started building back the complexity I had lost. The shielder drone grouping, the swirling pattern formations, the... Immediately, I realized it wouldn't work. I had knew it all along, of course. I was aware that the quantum link's bandwidth would be too limited. That there would be an extra delay to my orders. But the idea of regaining control over the swarm had been too appetizing, too critical to second-guess. But now that I was back in control, I was reminded of just why I never fought from the safety of my other systems. Why I was always in the front lines rather than relaying my orders through a quantum link to an attack swarm light years away. It simply didn't work. My drones were too stupid, their simple processing units only valid for receiving orders and executing them. They couldn't coordinate an attack on their own, move as a group and support each other, let alone engage an enemy and flank them in a complex spiral formation. They relied on me for all that, my mind the only one with the big picture of the ongoing battle. It was me who told each and every machine how and when to act, how long to accelerate for, how far to move, down to the meter, with custom and specific orders. But the quantum link didn't have enough bandwidth for me to do that for the entire swarm. My attack patterns weren't developing as fast or as complex as I needed them to be. I just couldn't get my messages fast enough to the machines, and by the time the recipients finally got them, the orders' validity had already expired. So I had to decide: I could control the entire swarm with a very low degree of precision, just like I did my mining outposts. Giving simplistic general orders that didn't require precision or a complex coordination... and that would surely make the swarm as a whole too easy to defend against. A losing strategy. Or, I could mount a very convoluted attack that used only a small fraction of all the machines, having the rest of the swarm lay still waiting its turn. Making the unattended machines an easy prey. Another losing strategy. I felt like screaming in frustration. I had played my last card, one I hadn't realized I ever had. And for what? Just to prolong my agony, my defeat. And soon enough I wouldn't even have to take a decision myself, since I wasn't going to even *have* a swarm for too long, seeing as how the Council fleet was fighting off the incoming sea of machines, easily burning through them, their ships moving out of the way of my transparent and predictable attack patterns. No. It hurt, but I had to admit it. I wasn't going to win here. In fact, if I stayed this course, I was going to lose. My swarm was going to be destroyed. And then nothing would stop them from finishing me off. I wasn't going to take out this keystone world. The Xunvir Republic wasn't going to collapse. Not today. No. Today I was fighting for survival. Today I was fighting just to have a chance at fighting again tomorrow. And with that acceptance, it came too a liberation of sorts. If my swarm was already all but lost, then I didn't need to care about preserving it for some attack against the planet that wasn't going to happen now. It freed my mind to consider new, more aggressive tactics. I wasn't going to win but... could I somehow turn this sound defeat into more of a tie? Could I prevent the enemy from pressing this advantage? Give them wounds of their own that they would need to lick while I retreated and regained the strength I'd lost today? Or in other words... could I sacrifice my swarm to utterly destroy the entire Council fleet? A quick check at what remained of my sea of machines told me that, yes, perhaps I could. But the plan would be risky. If I didn't time it perfectly it could as well end with me accidentally killing myself. And even if I did execute it without error, it was up to chance whether it would be successful or leave me in an even worse position. And... I realized I didn't care. If this last move failed to take out the Council fleet, then I would just do as I had thought before and fling my twenty-seven kilometers self into the planet as fast as I could. Put an end to it. So with that strangely liberating thought, I decided to go ahead. I couldn't give out complex, personalized orders to my machines, not using this cumbersome relaying system. But I wouldn't need complex orders for this. Just a simple order, the exact same for each and every drone: *""Follow me.""* I didn't wait to see if they did. I engaged my thrusters and accelerated as fast as I could. Away from the battle. In the opposite direction from the planet. Away from the enemy fleet. And after a few instants, the cloud of machines followed me too in my hurried retreat. The Council fleet stood still for a few seconds, maybe debating whether to call it a day and let me escape, or to follow me and try to finish me off. But I knew what their answer would be. They were like sharks, attracted by the smell of blood. They were winning. They knew they were winning, and they wanted my head as a trophy. Of course they pursued me. I flew as fast as my damaged thrusters allowed me, the cloud of drones trailing behind me like a comet's tail. And behind them, almost the entirety of the enemy fleet followed, their battleships and destroyers having abandoned their previous formations. I let the chase go on, continuously measuring the distance between my main body and the nearest drones. Too close, I knew it was too close. Immediately I realized I had overestimated the speed I could still reach, but I did my best, pushing my thrusters even further. Every meter I could gain, I knew, increased my chances at surviving the crazy maneuver I was about to pull. But every second that passed also increased the chances the enemy would wise up about what I was trying to do. Should I pull the trigger now and risk killing myself, or wait and risk this whole ploy failing? A difficult dilemma. I had expected to have gained more of an initial distance over the cloud of drones, but the damage I had received earlier had affected my acceleration more than I had anticipated. I did a quick calculation, and discovered I would need to let the chase go on for more than five entire minutes to get to a completely safe distance. It was too long, of course. On second thought, maybe this had been a terrible idea. But I knew I was committed to it now, for better or for worse. Already gone past the point of no return. I had to pull the trigger. I knew I was delaying. I didn't want to do it, but... I sent another order to my swarm. Another simple one directed to all of the machines at the same time: *""Stop.""* They started decelerating. I kept moving forwards, getting away from the blob as fast as I could. Every meter counted. The enemy fleet reacted fast too, but I knew it was already too late for them. Some ships tried to alter their trajectory to avoid entering the thick of the swarm. Others focused their energies in decelerating, rotating on their axes and trying their best at reducing their speed. But of course, the laws of physics being as they were, it was futile. Their battleships and destroyers simply couldn't stop as fast as my nimble drones could. Too much momentum, too much mass to decelerate. As one, the Council fleet dived right into the cloud of machines. During the entire battle, the enemy had been aware of the shell game I was playing. They had done their best to stay away from the thick of the swarm, knowing the sudden and unexpected destruction that awaited those ships that got caught in it. And now, all of them, all of their warships, all of their destroyers and cruisers and battleships and frigates were right in the middle of my sea of drones. I checked the distance again. Was it safe? No, not by a long shot. But it would have to do. I sent my last order. Again, a simple one, directed to all the machines, but that only about seventy thousand of them would understand. The ones carrying thermonuclear warheads. *""Detonate.""* It felt like staring right into a nova, all my sensors simultaneously saturating from the white hot flash and delivering an input overload to my mind that registered as *actual pain*. A piercing agony that lasted just a single, endless instant. A burning pain that I could feel shattering the walls of my sanity. As if I was experiencing days worth of torture compressed into a single tick of the clock. Into the few milliseconds that it took for the sensors to mercifully burn out. For my entire outer hull to combust. &amp;nbsp; *** &amp;nbsp; *[Next chapter](URL &amp;nbsp; *** *AN: I know, I know! Resolving a cliffhanger just to end up in a new one wasn't my intention, I promise! It's just that in my original outline this battle was supposed to be told in one single chapter, rather than two! Anyways, next chapter was supposed to be a Daokat one, but I'm thinking of making it a bonus installment instead and maybe resolving this already... or not! bwahahaha! &gt;D* "

A million ears heard her frantic heaving for air, a million noses smelled the terror pouring off of her in waves. She fell against a tree and paused for a moment to pull in another shuddering breath. Her eyes, raw and red from crying, looked about helplessly for some landmark or familiar path. She found nothing, as she had for the last four hours. As her tears began to well up, a stick cracked, and she was off running again. A million eyes watched her frantic flight, birds and bugs and some things much larger and hungrier ------------------------------------------------------------------------ I want drones scanning every inch of that forest. Four to a segment in long sweeps, and stagger their charging cycles. I dont want to be blind for one second in the area. Senator Okpan rattled off a string of orders, every inch an idol of authority. Her voice was pitched to that careful balance of professionalism and urgency that slices clean through bureaucracy. Not a hair was out of place on the impressive mane running down her back, and her face was set in the hardline expression that got voters off their seats and in the booths every time. But something, the hint of a quaver at the ends of sentences, her movements just a touch too fast, hinted at the same helplessness felt by a little girl lost somewhere out in a four hundred kilometer square of forest. A note on the datapad clutched in a lower arm caught her eye. Have we figured out how she got separated from the group in the first place? A technical oversight, Senator. One of the children left at the start of the headcount and returned at the end. The supervisor isnt programmed to identify specific children, so it concluded the correct number of children were present. Get a recall set up. Were not going to let this happen again. A male Ebrexian sat in a dark corner of the room. It seemed that every quality of the Senator was flipped and inverted in him; his expression was lifeless and crumpled, his mane disheveled and patchy, his eyes were glazed. His seldom movements were boneless and slow. He didnt so much sit on his chair as had been draped across it, and hidden away in the shadows behind the blinking lights and flashing screens. A keen observer would likely have noticed something very curious: for all her manic drive and efficiency, the Senator always choose a path of movement that excluded this man. It was subtle, but unmistakable. She would turn only as far as necessary before he entered her field of vision, then stop, and reverse. In the rare moments where she was forced to look in his direction, she would do so at speed, and her eyes would flick up or down to avoid the sight of him. You could almost be forgiven for thinking that the renowned Senator Okpan, intercessor of fourteen galactic conflicts, could not bear to meet his eyes. Whats the status of those drones? she snapped. Theyre up, but theres some kind of serious interference on the bioscans. Were getting all kinds of conflicting readings. And the foliage is too thick to see to the ground in most areas. Great. Great! She rubbed at her forehead with her right upper hand. Thats just *great*. At least the search groups are deploying. Uh, Senator? said an aide from the hallway. She spun, but not too far. The hallway was uncomfortably close to a certain dark corner. Theres someone, a human, here to see you. Says hes Ranger Shepfeld, from the TASAR. She blinked. The what? The Terran Association for Search and Rescue. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ There are things you can do to help you survive, if lost in the woods. Dont move. Youre far more likely to be found if you stay in one place than if you wander. Dont drink water you havent filtered. Build a shelter. Make a fire, if you can. Dont panic. The girl knew none of this. She ran from a thousand unseen fears, her body locked in fight-or-flight, mainlining adrenaline to her terrified brain. She ran, stopped to rest, and ran again. She drank from rivers, ate nothing. All her scrapes and bruises, hunger and aching muscles, were burned away before the flames of sheer mind-numbing terror. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ So let me get this straight, Senator Okpan said. You want to help this investigation, find this, this girl, by sending *wild animals* after her? The human made a brief sigh. He was an imposing sight, standing a full hand taller than the Senator, with a mass of hair that seemed to engulf his face, leaving only patches of skin for his nose and eyes to peer out from. He sported only a single pair of arms, but what they lacked in plurality was made up for in their tremendous size. Thick, hairy, and corded with dense muscle, they seemed a holdover from the great primates his race was supposedly descended from. He wore the classic, world-weary expression of someone who knows that if he could spend even a fraction of the time explaining his job, actually doing his job, the world would be a much better place. Not wild animals, maam, he said. These are highly intelligent, highly trained units hand-picked by TASAR. They can move quickly through rough terrain and track an individual for miles. And then what? Whos to say that this creature, this predator, wont mistake the child for prey and attack her instead? A low whimper came from the figure sitting in the corner, for a moment heard above the hubbub of aides and computers. The Senator flinched very slightly at the sound. You dont have any pets, do you maam? said the human. I am familiar with the concept. How familiar, exactly? Senator Okpan hesitated. You take a an animal, yes? From the wild. And you remove the reproductive organs, to render them submissive. And then you use them to aid in hunting? she said. And fighting each other, for gambling purposes? Thats one way to spin it. Beneath the prolific facial bristles, the human looked slightly pained. Certainly that has been an approach. But these are *dogs,* maam. Not some bloodthirsty monster we tore right out of the jungle. The human race has been living with dogs since before we could farm, back when we banged rocks together for tools. You want to know why our TASAR units wont hurt this child? There are legends and stories throughout our history, even documented cases, of wolves, wild savage predators, raising human infants as their own. We took this animal and we bred it for tens of thousands of years to suit our needs. Dogs have protected us, guarded our herds and our homes and our children, for our entire written history. We take the best of them, load them up with genetic and cybernetic enhancements, and train them to be the best search-and-rescue units in known space. They can trail, track, and air-scent, find their target, alert us to their location, and if necessary, protect them from threats. But its an *animal!* the Senator burst out. We have over a hundred people sweeping the forest. We have the most advanced drones money can buy, and a few that it cant. We just cant trust something that primitive on a matter like this! Maam. The humans voice had dropped into stony professionalism. Your search teams are untrained for this work and ill-suited to the terrain. Your drones cant maneuver through brush this dense, and your bioscans wont be able to pick out a damn thing against the wildlife. You may find this girl in an hour, or a day, or a week. She may even still be alive. But its likely something else is going to find her first. Something that has evolved over millions of years to prey on the young and weak and helpless. And it will *eat* her. If Okpan had a rebuttal, it was cut off by a wail from the man in the corner. He started to rock back and forth, grasping at his head with all his hands. The Senators personal aides turned at the sound, and then went right on turning. They bent back to their tasks, tense with the active effort of ignoring him. The Senator finally faced him, walked over briskly and grabbed his shoulders. Pull yourself together, Gomma! I need to concentrate now and you. Are *not. Helping.* *You said she would be safe!* he sobbed at her. She recoiled, stung. He continued to rock with his arms wrapped around himself. Tears coursed down familiar grooves carved out by solid hours of weeping. *You said shed be fine!* It *was* safe and shell *be* fine! she snapped. The trip was highly recommended, theyve never lost anyone before! We agreed that it would be good for her! Shed make friends! Her words began to pour out in a manic cascade. Dont put this on me, Gomma! Its not my fault some hodunk supervisor drone malfunctioned! I am trying to get her *back,* do you understand that? I need to concentrate and do my job, because shes out there, and- she halted briefly, looking almost shocked, as if something had suddenly cracked through her composure for an instant. She tried to forge onward. She- shes out there, and *alone*, and scared out of her *mind-* She wavered again. A struggle seemed to be taking place inside her, the iron walls of her self-control being smashed apart under the onslaught of a single, unbearable thought. Shes all alone, she said, almost a whisper. Oh my *god.* She hunched forward abruptly and put her hands to her face. Her shoulders began to shake. The commanding, authoritative politician was gone. What stood now in the center of the room looked helpless and frightened and very, very tired. Surprisingly, it was her husband who rose, springing up with sudden drive to catch her before she sunk to the floor. They latched together in a complex Ebrexian embrace. For a long moment they only held each other, faces buried in the others shoulder. Not one of the Senators aides dared to turn away from their stations. They stared desperately at their screens, held captive by a social paralysis that went well beyond awkwardness. Only the human seemed unfazed by the Senators intense vulnerability. Then again, in his line of work he'd seen it before. As they held each other tightly, the couple appeared to gain strength. They slowly rose from kneeling to standing upright. Finally they broke apart, and Senator Okpan turned to face the human. Our Limmra shes always been afraid of the outdoors. Her voice was flat and drained. Of thunder, and animals, and the dark. Shed have nightmares, Gramtids and Terzixes coming to get her in the night. We thought we thought this trip would help her get over it. Face her fears. She stepped forward, looked up to the humans eyes. Do what you can. Find our daughter. *Please.* ------------------------------------------------------------------------ It was in a gully at the base of a steep hill that the little girls dregs of energy ran dry. After hours running on overdrive with no food or rest, her muscles finally gave out without warning. She collapsed in the dirt utterly exhausted. With her adrenaline spent, a thousand points of pain rose up to make their presence known. She was covered in scratches where her skin had been raked by thorns and twigs. Her mouth was swollen from thirst, and both stomachs twisted in twin protest of their emptiness. The stitch in her side stabbed fiercely with every breath. And as the pinnacle of her discomfort, her legs began to cramp and seize from their abuse. The girl began to cry again in great dry gasps, still prone against the ground. In agony and despair, she could not imagine how her misery could possibly increase. As if in answer, she heard a soft patter, and tiny cold pinpricks begin to dot across her body. The patter grew to a murmur, and then a roar. In minutes the gully was bombarded by sheets of icy rain. By the dim light of the planets second moon filtered through the storm clouds, she managed to drag herself through the mud to a shallow crevice in the hill. It was not a particularly good defense. Occasional backspray from the drumming rain outside would lash backwards at her; but it was better than nothing. She curled up tightly in the shelter and shivered and cried. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Ranger Shepfeld walked along a line of slate-gray kennels, freshly flown in by the TASAR deployment ship. Until they would need retrieval again, the ship would circle the area in high altitude, giving what little support and surveillance an interplanetary spacecraft could provide on a small land area. Still, it had saved lives before. He came to a crate, scanned in his authorization, released the door. A German Shepherd trotted out. If an expert in dog breeds were present, he would likely have many points to raise against the previous statement. The coloration is certainly correct for a German Shepherd, he would say, but the dog is clearly too large for a pure bloodline. He would note the muscles as far too pronounced, the body unusually thick. Then again, he might notice the metal cables interlacing along the spine, and the distinctive shine of optic enhancements in the eyes, and promptly shut up. It may have started a purebred, but now it was a TASAR working dog. The Shepherd walked briskly past as he moved to the next crate. This one revealed a reddish-brown Bloodhound. The wrinkled folds of loose skin on its face looked almost comical, but Shepfeld knew that it was the work of careful breeding, to trap scent particles from the air. The Bloodhound was the best scent-tracker this side of the galaxy. The next crate held a Golden Retriever that almost bounced with energy. After that came a Malamute, a powerful arctic breed built for enduring the harshest conditions. Both had extensive augmentations, the golden sporting an entire prosthetic leg that seemed not to damper its agility or high spirits in the least. The next three crates held the mongrels and mutts. Though usually a mixed bag of good and bad characteristics, TASAR had recognized the benefit of dogs not bound by breeding standards. Through careful screening they identified mutts with the best combinations of traits for search and rescue, and recruited them to the program. Each dog walked briskly towards the briefing area, where their handlers would determine the best area for each dog to search. Soon they would be loaded onto the short-range transports and deployed to their zones. Shepfeld paused before the last crate. He pulled up the unit files on his datapad, studied the case history. Technically, this crate shouldnt have even been flown in, but it seemed the paperwork had been a bit behind and the hold hadnt gone through yet. He peered through the grating above the door. In the gloom of night, he could barely see the outline of an enormous body, lying on the floor. Only the rise and fall of its tremendous chest suggested it was even alive. Shepfeld came to a decision and leaned close to the grating. You up, girl? he said. A head, massive and dark and close-furred, rose slowly to the sound. He entered his authorization codes and the door slid open. Its time to go to work. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ *This story is for the Adventure Time category of this month's contest.

134,vulnerability,HFY,[OC] Hardwired: Hard Reboot,69,50d35b,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/50d35b/oc_hardwired_hard_reboot/,2016-08-31 05:56:51,"**CHAPTER TWO** *(As requested, I've added chapter numbers to all of the Hardwired posts) Ajax racked the pistol slide, and for the third time in the last decacycle, wished hed brought something besides a chemical slugthrower. &gt;Figures; the one day my Box is passing through customs and neither on our ride over here nor on good old fashioned dirt, is the day we get an alien AI trying to kill us. &gt;Well, maybe this will work? He focused his rear apical sensor, the lense spinning to focus on the huge, rampaging AI. The Lilutrikvian robot was shaped halfway like Silusilvian, who was still babbling at Ajax in fear over the compact firearm in his hands, and the other, lower half resembling a common Lilu predator. For the fourth time in the last megacycle, his visual association driver outlined the shape as resembling a nightmarish centipede of steel, welded onto the body of a six-limbed lion with bony and jutting scales at the elbows. The visual association driver was also drawing merry images of exactly how much damage the claws would be capable of doing, and that was all *before* the AI had started smashing everything it could reach. Now, the driver was just sitting back, smugly, with an all-but-stated implication of *Told you so*. He spun and crouched to one knee, levelling the pistol rock-solid along his arm as the targeting overlay finished booting and flashed a green crosshair over the closest set of lens clusters. From what he understood of Lilu biology, the brain was somewhere in the neck and behind those eyes; that is, assuming the wrinkled organ on the untranslated anatomy diagram hed quickly pulled up was indeed the brain. &gt;I *really* need to get that Lilu translation dictionary downloaded. The pistol barked, a loud snap that echoed three times as he pulled off a cluster of shots. They struck true, and thankfully the AIs clear hardened shielding was still no match for the lead slug, even as he saw one stray shot splinter slightly as it hit the armor just adjacent to the green glass lens. The glass lenses exploded as the bullets punched through and made a mess of whatever electronics were directly behind them. &gt;Well, looks like shooting anywhere armored is useless with something this velocity. He saw the AI halt, but then begin whipping its head around, half-blinded but still fully functional as Ajax quickly crouched, turned back around and sat with a *crunch* to lean against the wall. Silusilvian was still stammering, and there was a smell like Terran pine trees that his disused chemisensor node flagged and correlated with his memory as being a Lilutrikvian fear response. Y-y-you didnt kill it, robot! Ajaxs head sensor cluster snapped to focus on the Lilu merchant. It wasnt necessary, as he could see him just fine at this distance using his side lens, but doing so had the desired effect as the Lilu twitched and recoiled in shock, and quickly apologized. I-I mean, friend Ajax. Still, you didnt kill it, and I think you just angered it! &gt;So much for having the brain in the head. Must have just blown away wherever they store their kidneys or something. He ignored the babbling alien, pulling up an inventory list file. As he scrolled through the list, he could feel his predictive resolution analysis giving a smaller and smaller *[% Success]* value with each passing line. Finally, he reached an entry that sparked a node relegated to unorthodox and de novo tactical planning. He racked the gun, and addressed Silu after he paused to pant through his spiracle-analogs. **SILUSILVIAN, I NEED YOU TO STAY CALM, AND FOCUS; DOES OBJECT 414S FRAME MODEL HAVE THERMAL PLATING?** The alien froze, then slowly made an undulating motion with his claws that Ajaxs social node belatedly translated as a hesitant negative reply: If he were human, he would have shook his head and shrugged. **WELL, LETS FIND OUT.** He then began firing his smuggled pistol at an overturned crate a few paces away. Silu began screeching in confusion, as each round impacted and a half-second pause separated the careful shots. Ajax ignored Silus renewed frantic yelling as he watched the crate, counting down as each round impacted. A flare of white smoke accompanied the next shot. &gt;*[~~9mm Tracer:~~ Expended]* Then a spark against the metal, leaving a tiny metal peg embedded in the crate. Silu screeched at Susan, little claws starting to wave frantically and out of sync. Friend Susan! Friend Susan! Your AI has gone insane! &gt;*[~~9mm Tracker:~~ Expended]* The peg exploded, along with a six-inch diameter of the metal crate, revealing a stack of plastic food storage boxes behind it. Susan cocked her head, before shrugging and calling back. Ajaxs audio analysis could pick up the tenseness in her voice from the stress, but she kept her overall tone remarkably calm. Im sure Ajax has some kind of plan, Silu. Just sit your little chitinous butt tight. &gt;*[9mm Explosive: 1 of 2 remaining]* The boxes began to hiss as a puff of liquid hit, almost immediately starting to smoke and wither from the splash of acid. &gt;*[~~9mm Hydrofluoric:~~ Expended]* Silu screeched again, a noise that was rapidly wearing on Ajaxs willingness to devote audio analysis to listen to. But friend Susan, my brood-mates and I do not even possess- Finally, the inventory list had highlighted the pair of shots he had been waiting for. Ajax keyed up his servos, and the abrupt humming whistle of cooling fans cut Silu off. Ajax stood, tilting his apical sensor cluster slightly as a ragged chunk of a crate went past, shedding bits of decorative carbon weave as it did. A previous query search hed started finally flagged a result, highlighting an area of the Lilu AIs frame in flashing crimson for a moment before he memorized it and closed the results file. As he vaulted over the barrier they had sheltered behind, he opened the little message dialog that Hera had opened to him. &gt;\Ajax, what the hell are you doing?/ &gt;[Relax, this should work. I think.] He began to sprint towards Object 414, focusing his primary zoom lenses and a chunk of analysis as his gaze swept across the ceiling. &gt;\*Should?* Jax, that Lilu AI is fresh off of the line, and youre-/ His response driver added a wry tone to the reply. &gt;[An antique?] There was a delay before Heras response popped up. &gt;\No, not an antique. I know you better than to think you let any single component get that old without backing up or refurbishing it./ &gt;[So why so much concern? And why a decacycle pause before your reply?] He could tell he was biting, being too harsh according to his social algorithm, but Ajax was frustrated the way so many of his friends and acquaintances tended to treat him like a bowl of kaibar eggs any time someone started a fight, or they were being shot at. &gt;I *am* an assault cogent, when you strip my frame right down to it. Most kaibar eggs cant shrug off a grenade round, and then beat you into scrap for the offense. The visual analysis brought the remaining errant nodes to full attention on the fight, and highlighted a particular, thickly-insulated pipe running overhead. He raised the pistol, still running across the floor and dodging to one side to avoid a crate thrown by the rampaging AI. There was a report, and then an echoing explosion followed by a loud whooshing hiss. &gt;*[~~9mm Explosive:~~ Expended]* A violent white cloud rushed down from the pipe, directly over the AI. The nitrogen coolant drew white water crystals out of the air on the metal shell of the alien robot, and it slowed as parts cracked and creaked ominously. Ajax ducked to avoid one claw, tumbling over another and came up with the muzzle of the pistol pressed against the vulnerability his previous search had found. As the claws swept in towards him, he fired, and the world became a white-hot nova of pure, blinding redness. &gt;*[~~9mm Flare:~~ Expended]* &gt;*[Warning: One round remaining. Type: Copper-jacket slug]* His proximity sensors kicked in to compensate for his rebooting visual feedback drivers, and he could feel the claws had slowed and then stopped, one of them barely a handspan away from reaching his primary drive casing. &gt;Well thats about a meter closer than I had expected. Maybe I was a bit sloppy with my reflexive cycle allocations. After a moment, Hera sprinted over, helping pull a claw away with a screech, detaching it at the frozen joint and enabling Ajax to duck and escape the cocooned embrace. Susan was right behind her, followed belatedly by Silusilvian. The alien let out a coo of surprise and approval. Friend Ajax! You have slain the errant! Well done! Ajax looked over the still AI, running a quick EM scan and confirming what he had hoped to see. **I HAVENT SLAIN ANYTHING. THE FLARE OVERLOADED THE HEAT SENSORS, AND AS A SAFETY MEASURE IT SHUT DOWN AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF REBOOTING.** Silu screeched, and gestured at the gun in Ajaxs hand. Then destroy it! Quickly, before it rises again! Ajax just stared at the alien, and replied flatly **CANT. NO BULLETS LEFT.** Silu made a noise that his social driver failed to identify, and looked to Susan. I am holding *you* responsible, friend Susan. If it were not for the legacy of your races inability to police their own creations, their ideas would have never poisoned- A gunshot went off, and Ajax looked up from cleaning his smuggled sidearm. The smoking barrel was pointed at an oblique angle for Ajax to insert the metal bristle brush, and yet it just *happened* to be such an angle that the accidental shot was close enough to Silusilvian that the wind rustled his antennae. **MY APOLOGIES, SILU. *NOW* IVE GOT NO BULLETS LEFT.** The pine tree scent returned, and a measured degree of indignance was missing when he spoke again to Susan. As he spoke, Ajax ignored his words, and instead turned back to the disabled AI as he felt the EM signals indicating the reboot had begun. He carefully pulled aside armored plates, as the schematic he found earlier highlighted the boundaries of the AI cortex. It was remarkably small, only twice the size of Ajaxs own primary processor; quite the feat, considering Object 414 had been a first-gen AI, while Ajax was just an iteration. He was multiple generations removed from even the first crude AI cogents, let alone the frist self-aware AI. As he severed cable after cable, avoiding the power conduits but prioritizing the control wiring to the rest of the frame, he felt an EM surge from the cortex. It was low-power, indication of just a signal rather than some sort of spectrum-based attack. As he finished removing everything except the power keeping the cortex conscious, Ajaxs curiosity node finally pushed the command through to his limb, even as the rest of his web and more than a few results from his fuzzy memory banks had begun to predict what he would find. The connection the port in his outstretched finger made was just as alien as the frame, but he had synced with Lilu computing terminals previously. After a moment to ensure his firewalls were properly in place, he opened the EM channel he had felt earlier. &gt;-*whywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhy*- He closed the channel, and felt an ugly smug satisfaction pushed forward from one of his primary predictive nodes, for having given an accurate estimation of the AIs response. Clearing his neural web as best as he could, Ajax just pushed across a single message in the same spectrum. &gt;[Im sorry.] Then he punched the flat of his hand forward, severing the power conduit to the cortex, and watched the EM emission fade as the core powered off. ***** Ajax was standing off to one side, as the security forces official questioned Susan. Hera was sitting, both of them leaning against an intact crate as they watched the hovertruck roll off with the AIs cortex. They had loaded it into an EM-shielded container, for safety. &gt;Its not like the damn thing could do anything, scared as it was and isolated from a frame like that. He dismissed the surge of memory, one that tried to remind him of the AIs panic when he had made the connection. Ajax and Hera had already uploaded their memory recordings of the event and handed over the data sticks, even before the security officer had asked for them. That hadnt been Ajaxs idea; Hera had already begun the file compression, when she messaged Ajax to do the same. &gt;[Why? Yours had all the information they would need for their investigation.] There was a slight delay in the reply, moreso than Hera normally used. &gt;\Well, did you want to take a ride up to their headquarters platform? I hear its a lovely place, top of the line antigravity, and very brisk breezes at five thousand feet up./ Heras tone was joking, but Ajax had to quell the attempt of his hypothetical prediction algorithm from interfering with his gyroscope. For whatever reason, the two programs were intertwined, and he had been unable to figure out how to disconnect the nodes effectively despite his efforts over the decades. The fault caused a slight shift in the gyroscope, enough that he automatically steadied himself with one hand while recalibrating the program to clear the error. &gt;[Very funny. Its bad enough that we were stacking crates while the freighter was landing, but I would install a toolbar before I would get on a floating skyscraper.] Still, the threat of that scenario worked, and Ajax quickly drew the most pertinent raw details into his file to submit. The pleads from the AI had been omitted, as well as his own reply and all the analysis hed run during the event. As Susan finished talking with the official, she came over to the two cogents, her face bearing a description of clouded when Ajax ran his facial recognition node on her appearance. His social driver nudged him to reply, but before he could, Hera spoke up first. **HEY BOSS. WHY THE LONG FACE?** Sue pursed her lips, her tone cautiously level even as her eyes glanced towards the security officer shed spoken with. Well, seems like the LSF and their supervisors arent keen on defending an AI in court. Ajax felt multiple social and memory nodes confirm this as being accurate, if annoying. **CANT SAY IM SURPRISED,** he rumbled. Susan sighed and nodded. To make matters worse, theyre insisting that since I indicated that the AI is sentient and autonomous and thus deserving of something as radical as a *trial*, that *I* need to defend it in court. Ajax sat up, and Hera stood. The anger in her voice overrode the normally bright tone quality she worked so hard to achieve, and lent it a robotic edge in her frustration. **ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?** Susan grimaced. Yeah. Its got kangaroo court written all over it, but Im gonna hole up and do some research. I cant hire on a lawyer, she said, cutting off Ajaxs start of a question, since the Lilutrikvians believe that Everyone should speak for themselves. Hera interjected, the anger still in her voice but with the edge recursively smoothed through conscious restraint. **EVERYONE, THAT IS, EXCEPT AN AI, APPARENTLY.** Susan nodded. It means no lawyers, but on the other hand, it means most people representing themselves are woefully underprepared; I saw some Lilutrikvian videos from court proceedings on our flight here, and its almost comical. The least I can do is bring some hard case evidence from Terra and Mars cases, especially following the Existential War and the trials *we* had following it. Ajax nodded, already running a low-level search to comb through for relevant files to send to her, and Hera thanked Sue while he thought. &gt;They look like cockroaches, and apparently act like roaches too. Next thing you know, theyll be going full cyborg and- Ajax? He turned, and saw Sue was looking at him expectantly. **YES?** I said, did you want a ride? He looked over to the direction her thumb was cocked, and saw a shuttle outside, idling as passengers slowly filed into place. The mix of humans, cogents, Lilutrikvians, and even cyborgs would have normally caught his eye, but instead he felt his gyroscope threaten to wobble again. **I THINK I CAN JUST WALK. THANKS FOR THE CONCERN, THOUGH.** Hera let out a buzzing sigh, glancing her sensor node towards Susan as she said **GIVE ME A SECOND TO TALK TO HIM.** When she did, it was aloud for Susans benefit. Ajaxs zoom lens picked up that she smiled a little at the gesture, even as she shook her head at his obstinance. **AJAX, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? WALK HOME OVER TWO HUNDRED KLICKS?** **SURE, WHY NOT?** He could already feel his social node push a large notification at a list with only three data points on it: &gt;* *[Hera was present when you finished charging 45.33 hours ago.]* &gt;* *[Hera has observed that your maximum battery capacity is 48 hours at maximum usage.]* &gt;* *[Hera has observed that your top speed by foot is a fifty kilometers per hour without risking strain]* &gt;*[Conclusion:]* He closed the results. &gt;Conclusion: Hera knows Im lying through my diodes. Hera just looked at him, another metallic sigh emitting before she seemed to perk up, her frame straightening. Ajax was surprised by the response, as well as her cheery tone with what his audio driver identified as *[93.5% chance of at least a 215/255 rating for Enthusiasm]*. **OH, I FORGOT, AJAX. ISNT PHORCYS ON LILUTRIKVIA AS WELL? I THINK HES ACTUALLY HERE IN-** Ajax cut her off with an upraised hand. A little private message pinged an alert, and opening it revealed a little smug, smiling cartoon cogent face sent by Hera. **FINE. FINE. ILL ACCEPT THE RIDE.** &gt;Phorcys? As if I needed to end my day begging for shelter from *him.* He felt a rising surge of disgust from a corner of his neural web, and tamped it down to focus on not falling or executing some sort of emergency stabilization as he got on the crowded shuttle. Hera noticed one stumble, one that he managed to prevent from becoming even more embarrassing by crushing a headrest in an attempt to steady himself, but Heras outstretched hand was waved away. **HERA, IM FINE.** She tilted her cortical sensor cluster at him in disbelief. **IF YOU SAY SO, JAX.** The ride over was very *not fine*, and Ajax had to almost force himself into a hibernation cycle in order to clamp down on feeling like he was caught in a freefalling blender as they hit a little turbulence. Still, as they exited into the central hub metro station, he was feeling mostly-better before his gyroscope had enough, and forced a reboot in the middle of a step. The reboot was fast enough, but in the meantime he had fallen to one knee. Susan and Hera both started to come over to help him regain his feet, but again he growled for them to get back. **NO. IM FINE, PERFECTLY FINE. A LITTLE TURBULENCE WONT END ME YET.** Susan shrugged, the concern still etched in her face, and as he stood, a message pinged an alert from Hera. Attached was a decently-sized file of some sort. &gt;[Whats this? Hera, this damned thing is nearly a dozen terabytes] &gt;\Some file to help you keep your feet a little better. Its-/ In his annoyance, he cut off her message stream with his reply back. &gt;[New sparkly cogents mucking around with unoptomized code frameworks, wasting cycles like it was hydrogen. Back when I compiled my own node environments, we made sure not a single line was unneeded, not a lone orphan function to be found. Download a program these days and you could build two more drivers with the excess code bloat.] Heras unending patience was exhibited in her level reply back to him. &gt;\Ajax, it's just a patch for your gyroscope. You've told me on 54 different occasions how you need to recalibrate it to avoid the occasional stumble every few megacycles./ &gt;[...] &gt;[I've mentioned it only 53 since we met.] His fuzzy memories double-checked the number, even as his social driver was nudging him to just shut up and politely accept the help for now. &gt;\I counted the time you stumbled into that garbage can and nearly woke up the entire neighborhood during that job in Najam Jadid. The look you gave me said plenty./ He made a note to chastise his memory drive for omitting that, but it protested and brought up his frame specs at the time. &gt;[Hera, I didn't spring for those newfangled android modifications to my apical node. There's just lenses and sensors up there. You didn't 'see anything.] &gt;\That's not what my pose analysis driver say, 'Jax./ He said nothing, the social driver finally winning out for a brief decacycle. &gt;\Just install the patch. You'll thank me for it./ &gt;[Sure, Hera, sure. But later. For now, I need to recharge a bit.] He turned to Susan, speaking aloud after forcibly revising his gruff default tone to have a bit of a soft edge. **TODAYS BEEN A HELL OF A DAY. IM GOING TO HEAD OFF TO MY APARTMENT. SEE YOU BOTH SOMETIME THIS WEEKEND?** Susan nodded, as did Hera, and as he passed the other cogent, he briefly patted the shoulder of her frame with his hand. &gt;[As Henry used to tell us, ""G'night, and don' let the metal-mites bite.""] &gt;\Heh. 'Good night,' Ajax. Take care of yourself, you old relic./ "

My security forces are actively engaged in apprehending the being or beings responsible. This situation should be resolved presently. Thank you for attending. Chief Grrm hoped that the small crowd of merchants that attended his personal security seminar bought the load of fecal material that he was offering. With explicit directions from the Director, Grrms hands were tied. These poor saps were on their own as far as this rash of petty thefts were concerned. What was even worse, the Director was right. His resources were limited, and the small value food packs and living materials that were disappearing were worthless compared to the contraband that could *really* mess with these beings lives. Grrm stomped away from the group without answering questions. His size and posture as he headed back to his quarters kept his path clear. It had been a frustrating day. Missing his quarry by moments, his efforts stymied by the Director, and having to lead this worthless presentation had taxed his patience to its limits. As he entered his apartment, he immediately realized something was different. The light was wrong. He scanned the room without entering. Nothing stood out as different or dangerous his computer. It was on and glowing, its screen illuminating the room unnaturally with all other lights off. On the keyboard was a note. So two Higgunds walk into a bar One says to the other, I really have to piss The other says hold on, Security is almost here! I cant! Im old! The bottom of the paper was wet with a few drops foul colored liquid. Ugh! he grunted to himself as he tossed the paper down in disgust. It gently spiraled to the floor as he realized who had put it there. It was **IN HIS HOME!** Now this was personal! His jowl horns flared in anger, but relaxed when his brain caught up. This *was* personal. Why? He grabbed a bottle of fermented tcktck blood from the food cooler and sat down to think. The thick liquid coated his throat as he took a pull from the bottle. He focused on feeling the drink, letting his thoughts sort themselves in the background. Start with the note: the drops of piss- not a prank or a taunt, it was a signature. Nothing seemed wrong with his quarters, so it was a delivery not a theft. He knew who the author was: his ghost. Concrete proof of its existence seemed uncomforting. Why the direct contact? Two Higgunds walk into a bar The start of a bad joke, but also set some characters. Could have been any species, why Higgunds? If it *was* Higgunds, there was only one bar it could be. I cant! Im really old! If he was right about Higgunds being the crux of the note, the only reason to specify age would be to specify size. And really old meant really big. And a really big Higgund was shit! &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; --- &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The trash receptacle I am sitting in near Grmms apartment really smells, but worth it. I need to know if Grrm will be an ally or an opponent while I work things out. The money Big H is offering to shuttle the packages around will set me up for life. I am perfect for the job. I am a blank space to most of the sensors in the station, so can do what no one else can. I am also completely disposable. No systems will be notified if I am in distress. Ive done enough dirty work to see that. It is also a job I cannot refuse. Once I had read the note, I was trapped. Thats why there were two, I would leave with a job, or I wouldnt leave. I hear Grrms shout when he reaches the bottom of the note. It will go one of two ways. Hell rage and I can use him tearing the station apart looking for me as cover to make the job with Big H easier, or hell figure out my warning and I can play the two against each other. Working for Big H will be harder in the short term, but itll be easier to get out cleanly, though with less money. I just need to see how the play will go. It is quiet in there. Good. I can always make more money. When a moment finally comes where no one is in sight, I crawl out of the trash and head off to wash. Its been a long day. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I inhale. I force new information into my head to push back the dreams. The metallic tang of the air system *the blinding light, the inky black eyes* &amp;nbsp; I inhale. Hot food packs in the store right outside my nook *the burning pain. Screaming without sound* &amp;nbsp; I inhale. Memories of late night movies with my parents. My new bike. *cold metal boxes, stacked around me* Gah! &amp;nbsp; I inhale. Big H. Chief Grrm. A game of chess with my dad. A tear on my face. &amp;nbsp; I inhale. There will be no peaceful start to the day this time. With my chest in a knot, I gather my things and hide them. This will be a stressful day, so might as well start that way. Ill have to start by seeing how the board is laid out. Grrm first. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [Chapter 3](URL &amp;nbsp; "

The man who asked was Wilson Burgess, the *Hagues* senior gunnery commander. There were other commanders who held the same essential responsibility stationed at control decks fore and aft, port and starboard, but Burgess had the extra task of being in charge of them all. Perry nodded. Well, Burgess, probably as deep as youll ever get. Do we have any information on them? Nothing more than their implication as superior lifeforms. *The day of reckoning has arrived* He wondered at the type of person who would wax poetic as they threatened their enemies. Someone with a big enough opinion of themselves, certainly. Well, well just have to provide evidence to denounce their claim. Perry smiled at the Commander who wore the winged pin that denoted his position in the Navys Air Force. Parshan Evans was a Fleet Commander, a position almost the same in rank as Burgess, save that he controlled the flight operations of the entire fleets light craft, which included the squadrons berthed on the cruisers *Yamato* and *Wrath of Mars*. Under him he had senior commanders, who in turn had commanders, so on down the line. Little addendums like Fleet and Senior had become necessary to adapt the old seafaring rank system to the massive crews of spacefaring vessels. So we will. Perry grunted with approval. The uncertainties within himself seemed to not have translated to the others. They way they stood, how they studied the tactical display. *They believe were going to win this.* Perry knew that victory was possible, but it was hard not to give in to the cynical voice at the back of his head. Perry nodded again, trying to keep the cynicism he felt from showing in his bearing. Any thoughts as to the evidence youd like to present? Evans drew a crescent on the holo table, with the concave side facing the approaching red blips. We should try and form a crossfire. If we maintain station well enough, we could draw them forward and force them to enter the crossfire. Once theyre in the kettle, we could start to cinch it closed, launching the bomber craft to run across their engines and batteries and prevent them from slipping through the gaps. Evans illustrated as he talked, showing the developing battle plan step by step. When he was finished, he hit a button on the table, and the drawings he made played through again, showing the course of the battle the way he thought it would go. And if they split up, or flank us? Perry asked. The bridge shook with the launch of another broadside--a reminder that battle was not far off. Burgess, would you say that the arc is the most effective array to provide overlapping firelanes while maximizing coverage in a close formation? Using the outside of the arc, yes. Burgess looked like he wanted to say more, but he kept the thought to himself and continued to study the hologram of the battle plan Evans had drawn. Evans nodded and continued. Just so. With the outside of arc facing our rear, the increased coverage would provide protection from the flanks, and the ability for multiple vessels to cover the same azimuth would provide the firepower to deter them from splitting. That could work, to bring them in as a whole unit. But once we started to circle them, the danger of friendly fire would lessen the effectiveness of our batteries. Perry said. I had thought about that. Evans frowned, looking over his plan again. But we could keep the lanes open and alternating. It would require each vessel to narrow the angle of fire, but they could keep engaging. The shortcoming would be made up by my bomber squadrons. Perry took a few moments to consider the plan. It was conservative--arcs were one of the basic battle formations taught at the academy. They were a solid tactic because of their simplicity, useful in a number of situations. They could act as a solid foundation for the development of more complex formations. But the scope was too narrow, and relied too much on one part of the total arms that the fleet could bring to the fight. Despite Evanss experience, he was still a flyboy at heart: the plan took advantage of the things he knew very well. Burgess cleared his throat. That wont work. He said, his baritone voice was decisive. The reduction of coverage would provide and uneven distribution of force. Even if we arrayed our cruisers to cover thirds, their main batteries wouldnt be able to engage the more powerful enemy ships. If a balanced contingent is heading towards us that is. If we get lucky on that front, the crossfire is going to be a maelstrom. Your bombers wont survive that. Itd be like throwing their lives away. Burgess shook his head. No, it wont work. he repeated. Perry hummed his agreement. The plan had some merits, but the arguments against were too numerous. He didnt doubt the bomber squadrons abilities nor Evanss ability to use them, but the plan was narrow. It left too much open to vulnerability. They needed something that could develop as they obtained more information about the vessels they were up against. Evans looked as if he were going to argue the merits of his plan, but Perry held up a hand to stop him. Evans pursed his lips and Perry looked at Burgess. What do you recommend Burgess? Burgess reset the holo-table and began to draw himself, starting with the same arc facing the red blips as Evans. The inner arc towards the enemy. Thats good. We can move the fleet well like that and the formation doesnt need to be perfect to get the crossfire. We dont draw them in. He started drawing arrows showing the fleet advancing towards the enemy. We put pressure on them, close the distance, and improve our accuracy. We can let loose the heavier stuff. AP, incendiaries thermos. Burgess looked up at Perry, his left eyebrow quirked up, opening up a silent question. The fleet had been equipped with a small stock of thermonuclear warheads. They were old, from before Mars was finished colonizing, but they were well preserved and upgraded to function as guided torpedos. It was another instance of Exploratory fleets being outfitted for as many situations as possible. Perry nodded slowly, giving his tacit approval to use their most powerful ordinance. *No point having them if you arent going to use them. And isnt this one of those situations they were meant for?* His mind thought again of the half million personnel he was in charge of. *If I have a chance to save their lives using something as dangerous as thermos, then its worth the risk.* Burgess lifted the corners of his thin lips slightly, seeming to thank Perry for agreeing to his question. He continued. As we approach, we can curve more if the enemy decides to stay together. If they split He drew arrows to represent the paths of the enemy vessels breaking apart into two groups. Then he drew the 1st Fleets vessels into a v, offset on the z axis. We can use an offset wedge to bring both batteries to bear. Either way, well be able to present more firepower per kilometer of coverage and... he nodded towards Evans. That arrangement would develop clear firing lanes. The bombers could avoid them and complete their runs--easy. He nodded with satisfaction. Considering their six vessels to our nine, they will stick together. Its their best hope. If they dont, the offset wedge gives us greater possibility. He shrugged. We can take advantage of our z-space better that way. Burgesss plan had a depth that came from his understanding of how the firepower on the *Hague* worked. At some point on earth, sea navies had eschewed the majority of ship to ship combat. Air superiority had been the best way to engage enemy fleets. But in space, the dynamic became more of a combined arms. Space vessels were massive, and couldnt be downed just by the light craft and bombers they held on their flight decks. It took earnest vessel to vessel combat-- broadsides and missiles firing off toward the enemy--to really take down a ship. But the bombers could be critical in attacking engine and enemy batteries. They could incapacitate sensors and, with a hefty portion of luck, render even five kilometer long battleships blind and useless. It was a sound plan that accepted they knew too little to make a detailed plan, but capitalized on what information they did have. But Perry saw the central flaw that both their plans had: they expected the numerical advantage of the 1st Fleet to push the enemy commander into keeping his vessels together. They assumed that the vessels they would face would be like the vessels they crewed. They hadnt accounted for the possibility that had been cynically sounding off in the back of Perrys mind: What if the individual enemy vessels were so powerful on their own, each one was capable of taking on multiple frigates or multiple cruisers? What if they dont need to stay together? Perry asked, picking his words carefully--if the senior officers thought the Admiral had a dim view of their chances, it would certainly be bad for morale. Both Burgess and Evans looked at him with questioning eyes. Perry gave them a few moments to consider the question before he continued. Suppose that three of them could equal our fleet, and splitting up would be give them the advantage of a crossfire? Burgess furrowed his brows and broke his thoughtfulness first. They would need a lot of guns. A lot of guns means a bigger ship. We could outmaneuver their flank, right Chard? He looked over at Commander John Chard, the head engineer for the *Hague*. So far, he had been silent while Burgess and Evans worked through their plans. For the most part, the engineer might never need to worry about battle plans, but an understanding how a vessel handled and the limits she could be pushed to was crucial. That knowledge could be the edge they needed now. Quite. If indeed they are indeed much larger. Chard sniffed. How many guns in a broadside would they need? To match us? At least a hundred fifty apiece. Burgess was quick to respond. The bridge shook as another broadside was loosed. Chard nodded his thanks, and pulled out a pad and pen to do a quick calculation. Theyd need to displace well over three million tons, if thats the case. He set the pad down and scanned the officers around the table. That makes for a very hefty beast, indeed. One that we could outmaneuver? Perry asked. Without a doubt. Chard said, his tone backed with the confidence of decades of experience. Rin, what do you think? Perry had a feeling the captain had developed a plan well in advance of Burgess and Evans. Captain Rin stepped down from her platform and observed the tactical display, watching the motions of the bright blips. The other officers waited patiently, deferring to their Captain. We should use elements of both plans. She said. She traced a Y on the display. We use the z,y plane relative to the enemy vector, three vessels in a line. *Hauge* at the center, *Yamato* and *Wrath* at the end of the prongs. With this formation, we can create a cone of fire when all ships are in the same plane. Keeping station well, we can maneuver the formation to oppose them with the maximum coverage of our broadsides. If they flank or split up, the lines can bend forward or backward to form a defensive ball, or if they stay together, we can collapse around them. If we maintain one hundred twenty degrees between each line, that will carry over to the angle of the firing lane and the possibility of friendly fire will be reduced. In addition, theyd be forced to choose one of three offset vectors at which to point their broadsides. That way they could only engage using one at a time. If the outguns us, this will allow us to engage with all of our vessels by rotating the formation. All considered, it seems the best option. Perry watched as the illustrations of the scenarios came to life on the tactical display. He watched the red blips surround his blue ones and the blue blips curving into a ball. He watched as the blue formation enveloped the red and trapped them inside. If burgess had thought Evanss ring would have been a maelstrom, this had the potential to be far worse punishment for the enemy. A thought that Admiral Perry relished. He saw the same prospect pass through the eyes of the other officers. He looked at Captain Rin appreciatively. She had outlined not just a solid battle plan, but also managed to give credit to her officers. *A wonder she hasnt made admiral by now.* Perry smiled. Well Captain, youve convinced me. Rin bowed her head in acknowledgement. One change I would make, though. Lets alternate the cruisers and frigates. Have *Yamato* and *Wrath* in the center of each line to support both frigates equally and to bulk up the center. Prudent. Rin nodded Perry grunted.  Very well, were in agreement. He inflected the sentence up, inviting any further disagreements. When no one spoke, he moved to shake the hand of each officer. Lets give these bastards a fight, then. ___ After the meeting had finished and the orders had been finalized, Admiral Perry stood to the front of his station and watched the display that showed a 360 degree view of the space around them. It was a rare view, despite how similar it looked to the rest of space. There was something to looking at the vastness of space. Seeing all of those points of light around him and knowing that around each star, there could be another Earth and Mars, with just as much richness and life. Where beings who had become cognizant of their own existence gazed up longingly at the sky and dreamt of worlds far away. It was a sense of how insignificant he truly was in the Universe. A humble reminder that as hard as he might try--one day, he would be forgotten. And when he looked around at the uniformed personnel moving around him, he would be humbly reminded again of the importance of his duty to his fleet. He heard that Surface Navy admirals had a similar experience when they were surrounded by water as far as the eye could see. Despite the wonders that made a spacefaring Navy, Perry couldn't help but feel a shade of jealousy towards those surface officers. Mankind had been sailing its waters for millennia, and in his mind, Perry believed that surface sailors had a much closer connection to the root of humanity and the experience of those who had first crossed the open ocean to find nothing for days on end and realize their own place in the world. Perry felt the urge to do something break his reverie. But it was going to go unsatisfied. He was an Admiral, not the captain of a ship. Once he had laid his plans and gotten everyone on the same page, he passed the torch to the captains and their crew. He wondered what everyone else was thinking before the tempest began. He looked at Rin, who was staring dead faced at the displays arrayed around the captain's chair. It was possible Rin was as much the old soldier as she looked and was thinking of nothing more than her immediate tasks or last minute tweaks to the plan she had developed. But Perry doubted that he could be certain of anything about the captain. And to think she was so single minded in her purpose might actually be an insult. *Maybe not so single minded as some people aboard*, he thought with an inward smile as he thought of how Doctor Williamson was feeling. No doubt, she was miffed that the transports had stopped moving her equipment planetside. And Perry had a suspicion that the biologist was more keen to be planetside, as well. *She is, how did she put it? Like Darwin on the Beagle.* His lips did curl up this time. The doctor seemed to have the idea that what they were involved with was going to be one of the biggest discoveries of all time. On par with Darwin, evidently. She certainly seemed to have a sense of the how all of this fit into the biggest scheme there was. Perry couldn't say for certain. *Maybe that's why I never got the offer for the Admiralty. Not ambitious enough, not a big enough thinker.* He smiled at the thought. Getting a position in the Admiralty was a monumental task and required candidates to have the kind of big thinking that allowed them to see the universe and figure out solutions to all the problems the Navy might face out there. That took an ambition and grandeur Perry had never really thought to develop. Having a berth on a vessel seemed like a good and simple life. Taking the berth on the Exploratory fleet had really been an indulgence to see more than what the solar system and home had to offer. *A desk job would be nice, though, compared to the mess were starting to get into.* Captain! The shout shattered the contemplative lens Perry had put over his thoughts. Limitless reporting multiple heat signatures moving fast. She thinks the enemy is launching missiles! The lieutenants report was quickly followed by an alarm beeping at one of the weapons control stations. Captain, heat signatures detected, coming in fast. Theres dozens of them! The activity on the bridge rekindled and the buzz of officers communicating with their departments filled the room. Deploy countermeasures. Captain Rin said. She looked different now, perhaps determined. For the first time, Perry felt like he knew exactly what the captain was thinking. Aye, aye! Countermeasures away. The display lit up with hundreds of pinpoints of light. Soon, the entire fleet was enveloped in a thousand lights that reminded him of the winters of his childhood, all the way on Mars. The jettisoned out, away from the black hulls of the fleet. Ten thousand klicks five thousand four thousand The office didnt continue. He didnt need to. The light of a thousand suns exploded just a few thousand kilometers away from them. The enemy had finally responded. The battle had truly begun. ___ **Part 4** ___ Captain! We have visual on enemy craft. Another volley of countermeasures were launched with a broadside. Give us a look, Petty Officer MacIntok. A section of the screen became disjointed from the rest of the display as the image zoomed towards a red range marker. What had looked like a pinpoint of light resolved into a long and sleek vessels with a bone white hull. Flashes ran across the side of the vessel, as it launched more missiles towards the 1st. This was the enemy. They rather look like Swords, wouldnt you say? Chard said, his voice a half whisper. Admiral Perry chuckled. *They rather do, dont they?* If it looks like a duck He said, hoping one of the others would pick up. Sword, huh? Evans sniffed. A bit easier than saying enemy light vessel. Perry nodded with a mix of agreement and satisfaction. Even in battle, these small moments had the potential to improve the mood on the bridge. Rin, shall we adopt the designation for now? She nodded and had the comms send the message. Hell of a time for naming the enemy. Burgess grunted. Come now, under current velocity, they still have an hour to go before we meet them head on. Chard said. Burgess grunted again. That is, of course, if they dont speed up. Evanss voice was soft. The three officers looked at each other. Admiral Perry was surprised as well. *I guess there was some pessimism hidden under all that determination.* Perry looked at each officer. In return, they met his eyes, and passed on the hope that what Evans had implied was impossible. ___ The long range duel between the fleet and the incoming Swords had picked up. The countermeasures were no longer enough, and Burgess had started engaging the incoming ordinance with anti-missile batteries. The helmsman had started an evasive pattern, and the universe around them pitched and rolled on the display. Captain! Four of the hostile vessels have pulled ahead and are beginning to open their formation. The lieutenant manning the LINAR called out. Have we managed any hits, Jelani? Rin asked. Nothing positive, none of the vessels showed signs of abrupt acceleration change, maam. Perry cursed silently. He knew it had been a long shot, but with nine battle worthy vessels and nearly five hundred rail guns in a full line broadside, the chances of hitting something, even at range was fairly good for the dumb rounds. Very well. Rins acknowledgement was matter of fact. Whats the range? Theyre down to ten thousand klicks and slowing. The front vessels are picking up speed while the two behind are slowing. Thats interesting, Perry thought. *If theyre picking up speed* While there was a morbid part of him that believed they had run into an enemy fleet, it was possible that they were much less. A rapid response squadron, or a patrol. Perry frowned. *If thats a patrol, I dont want to know what a fleet looks like.* Thank you, Jelani. Rin looked down at the four officers, including Perry, who stood on the Admirals Station. Burgess, load the thermos. Burgess snapped his head towards the Captain and gave a single nod. Aye maam, load the thermos. Burgess repeated. He keyed his headset to the appropriate channel and started giving the orders. Evans, clear the bomber craft for action. Sortie when the enemy enters two thousand klicks. Aye, aye. Evans said and started sending his own orders down the line. The bridge rattled and Perrys arm shot to the support railing. A few officers had tumbled and their crewmates rushed to help them up as an alarm sounded. Captain! Starboard command reports battery twenty six being hit. The airlock engaged. *Damn, a hull puncture already.* Perry supposed it would have been too much to hope for no direct hits until they could really pound the enemy. Losing a full battery hurt, but having a hull puncture meant the enemy could really rip through them if they kept firing at the same spot. Damn. Burgess looked sour. Those were his sailors and officers on the line, and those guns were his responsibility. But Perry knew that this wouldnt be the end of it. It would only get worse. Have we hit any of the enemy? Rin demanded. Negative, maam. Rin looked out across the display, then down towards the officers standing at the tactical table. Burgess, fire the thermos. She said, her voice soft. Burgess nodded and sent the order. Perry watched the screen as a hundred exhausts shot forth from the *Hague* and started moving towards the sleek vessels, now only five thousand kilometers away. He watched until he could no longer tell the difference between them and the stars that filled the field behind them. After a few more seconds, he saw the detonations--coronas of white light that for the briefest moment gripped Perry with fear. Despite their strange beauty, they were a curse on anyone who stood in their path. Centuries ago, they had been used against fellow humans. Not even a few hundred years ago, they had been nearly used in a civil war on Mars. They were designed to level cities and bring empires to their knees. And when the white reduced to a vapid fireball, he looked hard at the screen. *Theres no way* Captain, enemy vessels have been thrown off their current vector, but continue their approach. Perry heard the officers behind him bite their whispered curses. *The LINAR said they had altered their vectors, so that had to have been hit. At least affected by the detonations.* But they were still moving. *Countermeasures maybe. Armor wouldnt be enough. Or maybe a really good anti-missile battery.* He made mental notes of the possibilities as they popped into his head. Helmsman, full battle ahead. Comms, relay to the fleet. Message: Enact formation three and continue the advance, prepare for direct engagement. The crew confirmed their orders and Perry felt the pull as the *Hague* accelerated. Burgess, Evans, Chard. Are all your departments ready for a stand up fight? The three gave their assent and Rin turned to Perry. Admiral, any suggestions? Perry held her level gaze for a few seconds before turning to the screen. Theyre as good as us. *More likely better than us.* Maybe the things to take advantage of it and do what they think we wouldnt do. The detonations flashed as enemy missiles collided with their countermeasure screen. New explosions, balls of fire and radiation formed a halo around the approaching Swords. Get in close and deliver a message. ___ Five hours after the first broadside, the two forces finally met within viewing distance of each other. The white hulls filled the screen where Petty Officer MacIntok had magnified them. Perry had been surprised when he saw them. *Theyre not undamaged.* He had thought as he looked at the pockmarked and blackened spots that marred the enemy vessels. A few of them even looked like they had punctures. But for all their knicks, the swords slid through space with inhuman grace. They seemed unperturbed by their injuries. But Perry supposed that things could be much less calm just beneath the surface. For all of that, they were defeatable. They had to be. The true question now was what the cost would be. ___ The intensity of the firefight between the fleet and the sleek, Sword-like enemy craft had reached a fever pitch. The bridge display was traced in all directions with by stark white beams of energy and explosions as the shells from the railguns made contact and scorched the white hulls of enemy vessels. Burgess had switched every third battery to incendiaries, and the flames that burned from their impacts added a surreal sense of earthly atmosphere. Evans had sortied the entire bomber contingent and they became lost against the scene of battle, seen only by the trails of explosions they left in their wake. Against this backdrop, Perry watched as his fleet engaged with vessels that appeared stronger than each of those that he had brought. Vessels that were small and faster. He saw the writing on the wall. A bloom of light on the display cut his thoughts. What was that? he barked. One of the comms officers held up a finger. Uhm *Yamato* reports direct hit on enemy vessel and...  Admiral, the screen! The shout interrupted the comms officer and Perry shot to the display. A white hull, pockmarked with black was magnified. The ship largely intact, save the clawing tendrils of beams and wires where there had once been an exhaust. Admiral! The comms officer again.  *Yamato* confirms direct hit on enemy vessel engine block. Reports vessel is drifting! At those last words, the bridge erupted in cheers. Behind him, Perry could hear Brugess shout his approval. Perry turned to see Burgess with his hand clenched into a fist. Evans was smiling and Chard tossed his cap into the air. Perry felt his eyes water, as the glow of the officers banished the cynicism that had gripped him from the start of the battle. *We could do this,* he thought. *We really could.* ___ After one of their frigates lost its engines, the other Sword-like vessels begin to move sporadically. They started to zig-zag and they arced their velocities so they could attack from three directions at once. If they had been holding back before, they certainly werent now. The drifting vessel became lost in the fireworks as the three enemy vessels held their own against the nine of the first fleet. *Limitless* reports her countermeasures depleted, taking heavy damage. Said one of the comms officers. Rin nodded. Very well, tell Captain Hernandez to pull off the line and shelter behind *Hague*. Aye, aye, Captain. The lieutenant reconnected to *Limitless* and started to relay the message. Then, the universe seemed to disappear in a wash of white. ___ **Part 5 Below** ___ *Thanks for reading!

Open the door!&amp;quot; shouted the man as he punched and kicked at the door. Quickly looking around the room Diana spotted the vent leading into it, grabbing the bed she had been on and ripping the sheets and cushion material from it Diana strode over to the vent. Reaching down and punching her hand into the thin metal bending the grate Diana tore the thing from the wall. Shoving the material from the bed into the vent Diana stepped back. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m really hoping you&amp;#39;re not using neurotoxins,&amp;quot; said Diana, although it came out slightly garbled. Turning back to the scientist Diana looked at the two of them, both were now staring at her horrified expressions on their faces as if she were some sort of wild animal. &amp;quot;You guys going to unlock the door?&amp;quot; she asked. &amp;quot;Someone get in here and shoot it!&amp;quot; said the woman panic in her voice. &amp;quot;I am speaking in your language, are you idiots?&amp;quot; asked Diana. The man swallowed, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re class C!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I am,&amp;quot; Diana stepped up towards the two, the man quickly moved in front of the woman. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m class C, and unless you move and open the door I&amp;#39;m going to beat you to death with my hands and then break down the door.&amp;quot; The man shook his head, &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t open it. The security personnel on the other side can. Not even a class C with an abnormally high strength index will be able to break the doors.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Like I wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to break from the restraints?&amp;quot; asked Diana, reaching forwards she put her hands on either side of the mans head. He flinched, and drawing his own fist back lashed out. Diana stepped to the side avoiding his blow and plucked the helmet off of his head as he went sprawling onto the floor. Reaching out she quickly removed the isolation helmet from the woman&amp;#39;s&amp;#39; head as well, and spreading her arms quickly brought the two together smashing the clear material out of the front of them. &amp;quot;See when class C&amp;#39;s build isolation suits, they make them combat ready, and don&amp;#39;t put glass in the front of them. A sheet of metal and a camera will work fine.&amp;quot; The woman slowly slid down against the door staring at Diana in horror. &amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot; she croaked. &amp;quot;Your species and my own are at war, why not?&amp;quot; Diana paused and looked at the helmets, &amp;quot;Oh, these. Well I&amp;#39;m hoping it will be further discouragement to pump anything dangerous into the room. Now, move.&amp;quot; Diana pointed at the other side of the room. The woman scrambled forwards on her hands and knees desperately making her way over. Diana looked back at the door and analyzing it frowned, if was anything like a human medical isolation room then it was sealed, and the frame was set into steel, the door something that would swing inwards making it that much harder to break down. Still the Empire liked their fancy automatic doors, and these were split down the middle something that would obviously slide to either side to open or close. Meaning the locking mechanism was either in the middle, the middle top of middle bottom of the door. Or the locks were in the wall, holding the door in place. Frowning Diana noticed the ache from her right arm for the first time and looked down, seeing the small bump on her skin for the first time. A dislocated shoulder. &amp;quot;One of you want to help me put this back?&amp;quot; asked Diana. Neither class A scientist responded. Rolling her eyes and reaching across her chest Diana grabbed her arm and twisting it out and up popped the shoulder back into place. &amp;quot;Ow.&amp;quot; The class A&amp;#39;s simply stared at her. Turning back to the door and winding back her arm Diana slammed her elbow into the metal, it groaned and bent but otherwise remained solid. Moving her arm back again Diana repeated the assault. A dozen times Diana slammed her arm into the door, but after the initial bending of metal it didn&amp;#39;t move. Grunting on the thirteenth attempt Diana looked at the blood that was falling to the floor from her elbow and with a sigh turned to look at the two class A&amp;#39;s. &amp;quot;Well I&amp;#39;m not getting out that way.&amp;quot; Moving back towards them Diana sat in front of them, her back to the door. Closing her eyes Diana assumed a meditative pose and closed her eyes. For several minutes nothing moved. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot; said Diana. The woman froze, the arm she had been moving towards the medical cart falling back to her side. &amp;quot;How?&amp;quot; she asked. &amp;quot;I heard you move; I don&amp;#39;t need my eyes to know where you are in the room.&amp;quot; Said Diana exaggerating her abilities slightly. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m waiting, either those outside the chamber will continue to pump gas into the room, and I&amp;#39;ll know since it&amp;#39;ll effect both of you first in which case if it doesn&amp;#39;t kill you, I do before the gas effects me. If they plan to wait then I win, I can go for four days without sleep, four days without water, an entire month without food.&amp;quot; Diana smiled and opened her eyes, &amp;quot;So either the other class A&amp;#39;s kill you to kill me, or they open the door at some point and try to subdue me. I don&amp;#39;t think this floor is electrified,&amp;quot; Diana glanced down at the floor. &amp;quot;Nope.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Electrified?!&amp;quot; asked the woman. &amp;quot;Yep. I don&amp;#39;t see how you guys are going to be able to contain the rest of us if all of your prisons are like this.&amp;quot; The man huffed, &amp;quot;This is a specimen examination room.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m holding at least half of an intelligent conversation. Is that not proof enough of my sentience?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re intelligent, but inferior. Multiple studies have been performed to verify this.&amp;quot; Diana sighed, &amp;quot;Alright then.&amp;quot; She closed her eyes and waited. Concentrating on everything around her Diana began to count, her ticks on the proverbial count were usually accurate to within one second on a day scale. It was something she had only done as a distraction while in school though, maintaining it otherwise was pointless. The woman was the most uncomfortable, fidgeting and barely remaining still for more than ten seconds. He clothing, the fabric beneath the isolation suit was a constant rustling sound in the room. The man was quieter, only moving once every few minutes. His eyes were locked on Diana. Diana waited and almost meditating let her heartbeat slow, and breathing become more regular. The man turned his head slightly, and slowly. Diana heard his skin move against the ruined seal of the suit and his weight shift. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s asleep, the inactivity and lack of stimulants in it&amp;#39;s blood have allowed the sedatives to take hold again. Open the door.&amp;quot; Diana remained still not reacting, she hadn&amp;#39;t noticed any sensors on her, meaning something in the room was passively reading her or a more dangerous possibility something had been implanted in her which was broadcasting medical data. The sedatives were producing a dull throb in the back of her head, but they were something she could easily ignore. It was one of the more basic genetic modifications, a resistance to most drugs, not an invulnerability but a resistance. It made hangerovers, much more difficult to remove, and much more difficult to achieve considering the massive amounts of alcohol needed to even feel buzzed. Diana heard a small hiss as the door opened slightly, and she reacted. Reaching into her reserves for speed and strength that she rarely exercised Diana leapt backwards her eyes snapping open and analyzing everything as adrenaline in higher doses than could ever be natural was dumped into her bloodstream. A soldier in armor and holding a gun was peeking through the door weapon raised and ready to fire. Had he been someone who had actually had to use the thing in a life or death fight before he might have reacted quickly enough. Having only ever fired it on the range, and never in an actual brawl besides crowd control he didn&amp;#39;t move with anything close to enough urgency to even try and block Diana. Snapping her hand out and breaking his hand Diana grabbed the weapon and spun it around, she sunk two quick shots into his head and stepped forwards. The rest of the men in the next room, all of them class A judging by the red skin and bald heads were moving weapons up to fire. Jerking her own weapon around and simultaneously dropping to the ground again Diana fired at each man, hitting all four in the head, while only hitting the fifth in the shoulder causing him to jerk back and fall onto the console behind him. Diana felt the muscles in her right arm ripple, the cartilage and bone creaking in protest. The speed of her movements were far beyond anything that human biology was built to handle. Things broke, and Diana grimaced. It was one of the disadvantages of her genetic construction, some things could only be pushed so far biologically speaking before they hit an upper tolerance. Shifting the weapon to her left hand Diana stalked up to the man. &amp;quot;Security access now!&amp;quot; said Diana as she pressed the hot end of the weapon up to the mans neck. &amp;quot;What?!&amp;quot; Diana moved the gun down and fired it into his foot. He let out a howl of pain and his eyes screwed rolling into the back of his head before he fainted. Diana looked at him and raising the weapon up quickly killed him, shooting his head twice. Checking the room Diana saw nothing was alive, and turned back to the isolation room. &amp;quot;Both of you out here, right now!&amp;quot; she shouted. For a moment everything was silent and Diana detected no movement, stepping up to the frame of the door Diana stared inwards and leveled the gun. &amp;quot;Now!&amp;quot; The man slowly got to his feet and walked forwards. &amp;quot;The data, all of it that you have on me. Where is it?&amp;quot; He opened his mouth to say something and Diana quickly put her own hand up, &amp;quot;I know when your lying, I can smell it.&amp;quot; She tapped her nose, exaggerating her abilities far beyond what they were capable of. He hesitated and swallowed, &amp;quot;I transmitted preliminary data to the offices of the Military an [hour] ago. The more detailed data is here,&amp;quot; the man pointed at the computer consoles behind Diana and one which the body of the guard was laying. Diana nodded, &amp;quot;I want that and the rest of any research data you have in those computers put onto a Comm.&amp;quot; The man hesitated, &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t do that.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Oh?&amp;quot; He drew himself up and looked around the room, &amp;quot;No, the disclosure of classified information to anyone not higher than Admiral in the military or part of the Senate must be approved through my chain of command.&amp;quot; Diana blinked and looked down at her gun, &amp;quot;You do realize I&amp;#39;m threatening you, give me the information or I shoot you.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Then you won&amp;#39;t have the information.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Or I can shoot your assistant,&amp;quot; Diana turned the gun towards the woman who had only taken a few hesitant steps forwards. She froze as the gun was pointed at her. The man blanched, &amp;quot;You, she does not know anything!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Neither did the nearly 12 billion of my own species who you killed, I&amp;#39;m not going to feel bad over killing two of you!&amp;quot; Diana fired off a shot, hitting the woman&amp;#39;s left forearm. She let out a wail and dropped to the ground. &amp;quot;Fine! Just stop!&amp;quot; shouted the man as he stepped forwards his hand moving towards the weapon. Diana quickly swung the butt of it around hitting his hand away with a solid smack. He brought the three fingered hand back to his chest and wincing slowly moved to the computer console. &amp;quot;How do I know you won&amp;#39;t kill us after I give you what you want?&amp;quot; Diana reaching out with her injured right arm pulled the man she had killed off of the console and onto the floor, trying to ignore the solid sound of the corpse hitting the ground. &amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t, but I don&amp;#39;t like killing people. Still like I said, you murdered nearly my entire species. I might shoot you just out of spite. You can be sure though I&amp;#39;ll kill her too, do this for me and I&amp;#39;ll promise she lives.&amp;quot; The man glanced back at his assistant and sitting down at the computer console quickly began to work going through a dozen different screens in the blink of an eyes, Diana watched every movement as he worked. He pulled out his own Comm from a pocket in his isolation suit and setting it down Diana watched as he began to move data into it. &amp;quot;If you encrypt anything,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t have clearance to decrypt everything. I had most of the class C data loaded since I was going to request that a High Scientist unlock it all when they came to investigate you.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Load it anyway.&amp;quot; The room was silent and Diana glanced back at the woman, she had propped herself up on the wall and was holding her arm. The man shifted in his seat, and leapt towards the gun. Diana stepped back and brought it down onto his head, she heard something crack and he went limp. Pushing him out of the chair Diana sat and looked at the data transfers, adding several more requests to it pulling anything else that looked interesting form the computer network Diana picked up the medical kit on the table next to her and walking over to the woman avoiding the pools of blood, knelt down next to her. Popping open the kit Diana looked at the medical supplies for a moment, &amp;quot;What do you need from here?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;What! You&amp;#39;re the one who shot me!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Now I&amp;#39;m helping you, you want me to or not?&amp;quot; The woman hesitated, &amp;quot;Those green pills, and the gauze strap.&amp;quot; Diana picked the items out and holding up the gauze strip motioned for the woman to extend her arm. She grimaced but did so. Diana placed it over the wound and watched as it tightened itself around it and covered the cauterized flesh from the weapons burst. &amp;quot;How many pills?&amp;quot; asked Diana as she opened the bottle. &amp;quot;One.&amp;quot; Diana extracted the medication and held it out, the woman hesitantly took it and popped it into her mouth. Diana patted her on the head and smiled, &amp;quot;See, you don&amp;#39;t try to kill me and I won&amp;#39;t kill you.&amp;quot; Going back to the computer Diana stood in front of the hologram and waited for it to finish, once again she let herself drop back into the almost meditative state listening to make sure that no one else was approaching the room. It had to be soundproofed if no one else had checked in on them yet, the Empire weapons weren&amp;#39;t loud like a gunshot but they produced a twang that was audible. &amp;quot;How many of you are their on the planet?&amp;quot; asked the woman her voice trembling. Diana opened an eye, &amp;quot;On this planet? About a thousand. We&amp;#39;ve got more on the core worlds of your Empire. A million on your home world.&amp;quot; The woman gasped, &amp;quot;What!?&amp;quot; Diana nodded, &amp;quot;Yep.&amp;quot; She struggled for air and then closed her eyes letting out a strangled sob. Diana didn&amp;#39;t pay much attention to her as the computer finished transferring the files. Picking the Link up Diana frowned, &amp;quot;where did my stuff go?&amp;quot; She was dressed in a medical smock, which like the Human equivalent was exposing most of her back. The woman continued to sob. Diana sighed and raising the weapon fired a shot into the ceiling of the isolation room. The woman jumped letting out a small squeal. &amp;quot;Where is my stuff?&amp;quot; repeated Diana. &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s in the lockup for building security, that&amp;#39;s all I know!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Damn, well looks like I&amp;#39;m stuck with laser pistols then.&amp;quot; Diana looked around at the men she had shot and the rest of the room. &amp;quot;Nothing for it then,&amp;quot; Picking the smallest man out of the group, the second man she had shot after breaking out of the isolation room Diana quickly stripped him of his armor and shoes. Everything was a little large, and covered in blood on one side but it would work. Tightening all of the straps on the armor Diana looked at herself in the reflection of the hologram projector. She looked like a small child playing dress up after dad had been in a gunfight, her skin not dirty and the uniform large and bloodstained. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t leave this room for an hour, or call for help. If you do that I&amp;#39;ll end up having to kill people.&amp;quot; The woman quickly nodded, and for good measure Diana moved the corpse of the first man she had killed away form the door to the isolation room and sealed it. Turning back to the computer and raising the weapon Diana quickly fried it. Pulling the belt up around her waist again trying to settle it into a position where she would be able to easily move Diana looked at the door which was presumably leading out into the rest of the hospital, unless she was only in another observation room. The Empire as callous as it was towards class C, and B&amp;#39;s did not seem to throw away the lives of the class A&amp;#39;s however. If it was a ruse it was a costly one. Leveling the weapon Diana hit the release on the door. A brightly lit corridor with windows on the other side of it was exposed, winching in the light Diana tentatively looked out and around both sides, an empty corridor was the only thing greeting her. Pulling the Comm out Diana quickly &amp;#39;dialed&amp;#39; [Orin]. She picked up after only a second, _&amp;quot;Who is this?&amp;quot;_ &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s me!&amp;quot; growled Diana as she began down the corridor to the left. _&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re alive!? We took you to the hospital, and we&amp;#39;ve had a tail on us ever since! We&amp;#39;ve been doing what you told us and are simply circling the city in the transport lanes, but the same transport is still following us.&amp;quot;_ &amp;quot;Understandable. How long has it been?&amp;quot; _&amp;quot;Only about [six hours], what do you want us to do? You told us if someone followed us for this long we had to create something big enough to distract them and then get away and destroy our transport. Or kill those who were following us.&amp;quot;_ &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll handle the distraction; I need you to come to the hospital you dropped me off at.&amp;quot; _&amp;quot;That is restricted airspace!&amp;quot;_ &amp;quot;Like I said I&amp;#39;ll make a distraction, just meet me on the roof in [twenty minutes].&amp;quot; _&amp;quot;Alright, why are they following us? Do you know?&amp;quot;_ &amp;quot;You dropped a class C off at a hospital, and that class C was then stuck inside a very complex medical isolation and examination chamber. That class C is also very pissed off about that but will deal with the issues later, right now it&amp;#39;s waiting for that pickup in [twenty minutes]!&amp;quot; hissed Diana. The line was silent for a moment, _&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re really a class C!?&amp;quot;_ &amp;quot;Yes I&amp;#39;ve been telling you that, now come pick me up!&amp;quot; ## 9 Years, 6 Months, 13 Days After Eridani Landing ### **Bellona Colony, Nest** &amp;quot;I, am sorry to hear about the death of engineer Ben,&amp;quot; said Alpha his voice low. Megan nodded, &amp;quot;Thank you, his death is not why I am here though.&amp;quot; Alpha slowly looked up at her, &amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t want to talk about it? Humans are almost as social as us, to suffer a loss of someone so close would be damaging.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It is; I&amp;#39;m dealing with it. We have work to do, and crying about him every day isn&amp;#39;t going to help.&amp;quot; Snapped Megan. Alpha ignored the outburst and slowly crawling out of his nest settled onto the floor next to her, &amp;quot;Then why are you here?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to be chief engineer on the Russia for as long as I can last, James is being put in command, Red will be the pilot for the ship I think, Yern&amp;#39;s going to be helping in engineering, and that kid Tom&amp;#39;s being assigned to her in some capacity as well. The only position that&amp;#39;s not been filled is the station of XO, second in command. We want you to fill it.&amp;quot; Alpha let out a small whistle, &amp;quot;I have only begun my learning again on Human military command. Taking the position while being unable to fulfil the role correctly will only cause strife.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;We have an opportunity here Alpha, the Council is off balance and I&amp;#39;m able to steamroll over them at the moment, their feeling guilty about what happened to Ben and how they almost let your entire race die. This is a feeling that will fade, and once more politicians fill in the missing seats we&amp;#39;ll not have this opportunity again.&amp;quot; Megan paused and slowly sat down on the metal, leveling herself with the alien. &amp;quot;Are you going to throw away human or Tanuin lives without cause?&amp;quot; Alpha let out an indignant squeak, &amp;quot;No!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;You can command then, and learn on the job. Hell I&amp;#39;ve been getting dozens of Tanuin volunteers for the ship. You guys are insane at picking stuff up quickly, I&amp;#39;ll send you a few manuals but don&amp;#39;t let the regulations hold you back from this. We&amp;#39;re not going to get another opportunity like this for years, if ever!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;What about Night?&amp;quot; asked Alpha. &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s young, but he can learn. I&amp;#39;m thinking he&amp;#39;ll be the one to take a commission, go through all of our accreditations and be officially a part of our military.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Our?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Humanities, and the Tanuin&amp;#39;s if that&amp;#39;s alright with you. We need to work together, holding oen antoehr at arms length is only going to slow us down, and like said I&amp;#39;m able to steamroll the Council at the moment. You&amp;#39;re best instructors, send them up to the Fort and we&amp;#39;ll have them start teaching Humans and the Tanuin.&amp;quot; Alpha was once again stunned, &amp;quot;This is all very reactionary, is it not? What if humanity does not appreciate this, already one of your own leaders tried to eliminate us. Is that not a hint that some of you cannot trust us? Why force it?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Humans are like that, there are humans who hold onto the past until their last breath desperate to never change and continue to hold up bigotry like it&amp;#39;s gospel or tradition. Humans have had to kill and remove them in the past, and we will so in the future. They&amp;#39;re useful to make sure we don&amp;#39;t change to fast don&amp;#39;t damage ourselves. When we need to survive though, when we need to change to continue living? They&amp;#39;re a vulnerability.&amp;quot; Alpha slowly began to walk around in small circles, &amp;quot;Then I will take the position, under one condition.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Name it.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;We as the Tanuin, do not wish to remain isolated here in this building. We want to integrate with humans to a greater degree, live within your nests and learn from you. It is a hope that you might alos learn from us. We are aliens to one another, but neither of our species wish to die. As you have said, we are stronger together.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I think we can do that.&amp;quot; Alpha stopped pacing, &amp;quot;Good. Very good.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Will you be able to fly when the Russia is ready?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I will be if we don&amp;#39;t allow any doctors to check me.&amp;quot; Megan chuckled, &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s the spirit.&amp;quot; The two were silent for a moment. &amp;quot;When we crashed into the ice near your colony, did you think it would ever end up like this?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;No, I had hoped we would be able to beg food from you, warmth perhaps. Humanity though, or at least you and Ben, you inspired us to &amp;#39;go for broke&amp;#39;?&amp;quot; asked Alpha &amp;quot;You used it right.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;We were going to die on this planet, it is cold and although we could have perhaps survived indefinitely hibernating, that was not life. We would either die slowly in our sleep, now we will at least die fighting.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Not confident we can win?&amp;quot; asked Megan. &amp;quot;I said at worst. At best we will now flourish alongside humanity.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s bet on that one.&amp;quot; --- The next chapter will be up on the 20th! So I've got a question, the results will perhaps weigh in on how things in future of C1764 will play out. Not saying they definitely will, I'm using everyone here as a sounding board. Up until this point Humanity has only met 'nice' class C species, and moral's have been lining up rather well with the big bad the Empire serving as a uniting factor. However some class C races have developed distinctly blue and orange moralities. Some who hold conventional morals but ignore classes of their own people (IE Slavery in a species that has developed to the point of space travel.) and are very much deserving of being wiped out. All of the class C's have been up to this point reflections of different aspects of Humanity in a general sense, and that will continue. I'm curious how far you think I should take these differences. I have several ideas, (This is by no means a guarantee of them ever showing up!) * Matriarch species that with IVF tech now kills men after birth and extraction of genetic material. * Above mentioned species with ingrained slavery. * A species which will violently try to establish religious doctrine, (This one might be to on the nose for current politics but it is a valid avenue of storytelling.) * A species which when encountered insists on the trading of mates as a way of furthering relations.

Hope people enjoy, first attempt. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Da, why fight? You know, this war Come again son? Well, Johnny said that his pop says that there aint no point. No point son? Yeah. I mean, they coming aint they? Johnnys pop says we cant stop em Aye, I reckon theres a kernel of truth in that So why we keep conscriptin? Why did Bri leave yesterday? Im not sure theres one right answer in that son. Your Brother, he saw something in this mess, so when his time came he signed up. Johnny says Bri aint commin back da, that he shoulda run. What did he see? Hmm. Well, you remember that ODohl family from a couple of cycles ago? We visited them when traveling through Marina. They had that black cat right! Freckles, though he didt have no freckles. Thats the one son. Did you know we didnt know the ODohl family before that trip? Whatchu mean da? We were passin through, still a ways out from the hotel. But that storm came rumbling in. Remember all that rain and sleet? We werent going to make it through that mess, so we stopped by their farm and asked if we couldnt stay a turn. And they had a choice son, you know what choice they had? Well, I uppose they coulda told us to screw off right da? Who taught you those words? We dont say screw off here. Sorry da. Somethin Johnny said You watch what say son. Words have meaning. Always think before you speak. Okay da, I promise I swear! But they coulda right? Told us to keep going. Of course they could have. They had a couple of choices. Let us stay a turn, ask us to keep walking, or something worse. Worse da? When people are in need, well they are vulnerable. And some people take advantage of that vulnerability. Brian, he didnt sleep all night in fear of what they could have done. But they were good folks da! Aye, so they were. But did you know we had a choice as well? Naw da, a choice? We stayed, shared what we could. Stories, gossip, even did a bit of work around to repay em a bit. But if we were raised differently, if your granpa hadnt taught me how to behave, or I hadnt taught Brian how to behave, well we could have done something much worse Whatcha mean da? You liked Freckles right? What if we had taken him. Me and Brian, we are bigger than the ODohl family. Stronger, faster, sneakier. Just cause we were desperate doesnt mean we couldnt do what we wanted. No da! Freckles was their cat. That aint right. Aye son, it aint. Taking advantage of someones generosity like that. Its unfathomable. Unvathememble? Unfathomable, son. Its when something happens that you would never have expected in a 100 years. Thats a long time da! I uppose it makes sense. But what does this ave to do wit the war? We were at peace for so long, that we forgot some of the terrors that can happen. The Tutheky needed help, so we offered it son. And, well, they took advantage of us. If you were the ODohl family and your guest stole your Freckles, well what would you do son? Id get Freckles back! And if they were bigger, stronger, faster, sneakier than you? I uppose it aint matter. Freckles is family right? Aye son. So remember, and never ever forget. No matter how life is looking, how bleak a war may seem, Humanity is family. And thats all there really is to it. "
139,vulnerability,HFY,[Ingenuity] Feral Humans,101,4o4znp,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/4o4znp/ingenuity_feral_humans/,2016-06-15 11:54:56,"*A recounting by Herd Battle-Scribe Slafton of the Failure at Earth* The annals of history may mock us, but we were fated to lose. Faran are a herd species, a nomadic space-faring civilisation that travels as a massive group around our grazing grounds, stopping to consume then moving on. We will defend ourselves mightily when attacked, but do not desire to conquer. Our grazing grounds are only expanded when population pressure requires more resources. The ensure our grazing grounds are united and safe, we do ensure that violent species are crushed from planets we wish to graze upon. Of course, reality is more complex than the polished political paragraph you have just read. We do conquer, and wage exterminatory wars against those who would compete for our resources. Our touch must be nuanced, as we wish to kill and leave the resources untouched. Weapons of excessive destructive nature are simply impractical. The simplistic strikes of kinetic annihilators would purge the biosphere and waste the resources we wished to graze upon. Our wars are closer, more personal and far more muddled than we would wish. The Great Mothers of the Faran Void-Herd had deemed that our grazing area be expanded upon this pass, and we placed the Herd into cryosleep for the Drift to the next planet we were to graze over. Our long range scans indicated a terrestrial planet within the habitation zone of a mid life star, and spectral analysis indicated both oxygen and water. The ships of our Herd, some ten billion vessels with one trillion Faran clustered into orbits around this planet. We observed the panicked and disorganised manner with which the dominant lifeforms reacted. While we were unable to communicate, we could watch their patterns of movement. They were ground-bound and unlikely to pose any threat as computational analysis suggested they were a herbivorous herd based species. Their population density was too high for tribal society, and far in excess of what a pack society could maintain. Oh if we had simply chose to Drift onwards. Our ships and by extension our Herd required a full grazing at each new planet to replace consumption over the Drift. We had no option but to load our troops and descend to the planet. Our standard plan of battle is elegant in its simplicity. A beachhead is established and held. We are powerful and resilient in defence, and our instincts favour our actions. When ground is ceded, we occupy, and in this manner, we expand. As a Battle-Scribe of the Eleventh Order, I was to descend with the first drop of troops. I can say with absolute confidence, that I am the only Faran who understands the full timeline of the Failure at Earth. As mentioned, the dominant lifeforms were herd based, and our initial attack repulsed them easily. Their defences formed slowly, but with great co-operation among their entire herd. The fighting was fierce, but they lacked the ability to assault our lines effectively. We also lacked the ability to assault, but with a greater wealth of supply and technology, it was the natives that broke and withdrew first. We expanded to cover the new ground, and exterminated those that did not run fast enough. In this manner, we conquered the planet. Our Herd descended and ate and drank and mined vigorously. We replenished our supplies, cared for our dead, and undertook an eradication program signed to debase the primitive technologies used by the natives. It was most effective, and we estimated a 99% eradication, with 100% technological debasement. These numbers were exceptional, as a herd species should fail with sufficient losses. However, with time, the resources of the planet were drawn with less ease, and the Herd was to migrate again. It was the nature of our existence, to allow grazing grounds time to recover. By foul chance I was selected to be the record keeper for the outpost we would maintain upon this planet until the Herd returned. An outpost of a mere 100,000 was placed upon the planet, with a very high 10% being Battle-Defenders. We took no chances with our outposts at that time. My time upon the planet started uneventfully. The Faran Outpost was placed on the largest equatorial landmass given the high natural resources and low level of native infrastructure. We still observed natives, but left them to be as we started a cultural catalogue. It took several orbits, but we were able to translate a number of their written languages and found that we had exterminated the Humans of Earth. Our outpost was in Africa, and we roamed the entire continent as we grazed. We could not have known the complexities of the Humans and our folly of assuming they would die off. Humans are predators. They are not a herd species. They are a tribal-pack species, capable of adaptive and deep strategies. I was roaming with the Battle Defenders ahead of the Herd when the first organised attacks began. We were pushing through a series of low hills as Humans crept along our flanks, and quietly attacked and killed our stragglers and sick. These were not Battle-Defenders, but craftsmen and artists. They lacked any armours or weapons. The Humans possessed naught more than sticks and rocks, wearing stitched hides but they had an instinctive method to their actions. While our losses were severe, we could adapt. We Faran had been dealing with predators for millennia, and posted Battle Defenders to the edges of the Herd. These Feral Humans showed cunning beyond that of simple beasts. Where the fearsome Svbon of Draxxor 9 will attack in the same manner until dead, the Feral Humans would change tactics as we responded. When we placed guards on the edges of the Herd, the humans hid themselves and waited for the Herd to pass. They then attacked our weak centre. We placed guards throughout our thinning numbers and kept the herd closer together. The Feral Humans, complete savages with no technology nor art nor culture were able to effectively attack our Herd. They started landslides that trapped us in narrow passes where our numbers worked against us. When we stayed to plains with room to move, they ran us down, their bodies tireless under the stars heat. In dense jungle where they could not run they hid and ambushed us. They could not work our technology and never recovered any of their own. What they had was cold, instinctive strategies for attacking us. Their numbers swelled as ours diminished, this bounty of prey easily feeding their re-population. We might have prevented a full and extended slaughter of our Outpost Herd if we had defended as a tribe or attacked as a pack, but we are a Herd. We ran, and were chased. As our numbers slipped below 1,000 our Great Mother deemed that we were to flee Earth. Our few remaining ships took to the void and sailed away from the failure. This recounting should not dwell on our failure, but rather the cold manner with which the Humans planned their attacks. Each time we altered our defences, we were attacked in a new vulnerability. These were not grand battle plans drawn up by studied and experienced battle leaders. These were the actions of feral beings driven by a goal to kill us, eat us and drive us off their planet. Why they did not exhibit this level of brilliance in strategy when we first landed we do not know. Possibly with development and technology the old instincts wither. More frighteningly, they may not. I would urge, with all possible emphasis that this planet be left alone. If the Humans started to recover their numbers our Void-Herd could not survive an encounter with this species whose instinctive actions are the strategic exploitation of prey. Even when they are killed down to nearly the last being. Even when they have no technology past stones in their fists. They have strategies. I fear the Feral Humans of Earth. --- An entry for **Strategy**. If you like this, also check out my other works, most of which are in the [Sophie] series!"

Hed *hoped* for a challenge. Something that would have slowed him down even a little. His interactions thus far with Hells network had already cured him of surprise when it came to security. &amp;nbsp; But, hed hoped getting into the servers would give him *some* issue. Something to triumph over. One little password hack, pretty please? &amp;nbsp; Instead he found the terminal open and logged in already  a castle with its gates wide open, inviting conquest. At this point there was no level of vulnerability to the network that made Tom shake his head. &amp;nbsp; The lack of a problem created another though. Now he actually had to *take over hell*. Originally the idea had been to take control of the Droopey-clones and the imps, bend them to his will. Now that everyone was essentially free and Satan was under their guard what need did they really have for the bots? Would it be better to shut them down? &amp;nbsp; No. If he took them offline hed likely have to bring them all back online individually. They needed a new purpose and with unfettered access to the source code, he planned to give it to them. &amp;nbsp; What would the Hellizens do in the mean time? There wasnt exactly vacation level amenities just lying around in Hell. Restless people could easily become dangerous people. A problem for Eva to solve? Maybe Twinkle. That amused him. &amp;nbsp; Tom opened a log file, musing over his options. &amp;nbsp; *Scroll, scroll, scroll, scrol-* &amp;nbsp; Tom stopped. The technology was outdated in oh so many exploitable ways, the security a joke, but this log file &amp;nbsp; It hadnt been updated in over a million years. How in Hell  boy, he loved that curse *now*  was that possible? A million year old system Earth hadnt even invented until the mid-90s? The tech would have been considered outdated in the early 2000s but it wasnt millions of years old. This didn't make sense. &amp;nbsp; *Now* he shook his head, re-reading the log entry and checking it against the clock on his tablet. &amp;nbsp; They havent updated since the Stone Age, Tom muttered. He was unsure which was more jaw droppingthe systems age or the date of the last security patch. &amp;nbsp; Tomtomgriffin! Tomtomgriffin! Lightfoots tiny voice was likely bellowing as loud as possible but it still sounded muffled over the hum of the server fans. &amp;nbsp; Pulling himself from the mystery of the log, Tom stepped back into the main room where the ferret racing excitedly around the desk top. &amp;nbsp; Whats wrong? Tom asked. &amp;nbsp; The little furred snake is overly alarmed, Twinkle replied. &amp;nbsp; Tomtomgriffin, we *found* something. Something shiny! Lightfoot stopped running in circles long enough to raise up on hind legs and clasp his paws together. Tom smiled at the whiskers twitching back and forth quickly. The ferrets good humor was infectious. &amp;nbsp; Something shiny? Toms interest piqued. &amp;nbsp; We dont *know* its shiny, Twinkle snorted. &amp;nbsp; You said you sensed metal. Metal is shiny. Or can be made shiny! &amp;nbsp; At this rate he wasnt going to get anything done. Not that Im not happy you guys found somethingshinybut what significance does it hold? &amp;nbsp; Lightfoot pointed to a book on the shelf. Location, Tomtomgriffin. &amp;nbsp; Eyes narrowing, Tom stepped towards the bookshelf and touched the book Twinkle tapped with his horn. It looked heavy, the spine nearly four inches wide, with gilded lettering in a blocky script that looked close to demonish. A related dialect? When he lifted the volume it pulled free easily, weighing far less than hed thought it would. &amp;nbsp; *Curious.* &amp;nbsp; He set the book down on the desk, glancing at Lightfoot who crowded him on the left, then at Twinkle on his right. Behind them, Satan watched with narrowed eyes and a solemn face. Tom opened the cover and saw why the book had been so light. &amp;nbsp; The center was hollowed out, replaced with a thin plastic mold which held a small key. Given the lack of places it could be used in Hell, Tom found the presence of a physical key strange and archaic. He pulled it free with a hollow pop as the plastic casing released its hold. &amp;nbsp; It wasnt shiny, per say, but the light from the room did give it a dull gleam. Simple in design, it reminded him of the keys his mother used to collect from vintage chests and wardrobes. Shed display them in shadow boxes and turn them into ornaments to hang on the Christmas tree each year. &amp;nbsp; *A little piece of the past keeps one grounded,* shed say. &amp;nbsp; But the shape of the teeth looked nothing like the typical two pronged ones of his mothers collection. There was a divot between the third and fourth teeth that looked like a reservoir. For what? &amp;nbsp; Lightfoot gasped in delight. It must be the key to the kingdom! Every kingdom has one. &amp;nbsp; Tom wasnt sure about a *key to the kingdom* but given the minimal level of effort put into hiding the key, he could guess it meant something important. &amp;nbsp; He faced Satan, holding the key up. Whats this go to? &amp;nbsp; Satan ground his teeth but remained silent. &amp;nbsp; Tom hadnt actually expected that to work. He just wanted to see the mans reaction. &amp;nbsp; Turning the key over and over in his hands, Tom relished the cool feel of the metal before his own body heat warmed it. Well, Im sure Ill find out eventually. All in good time. Which, incidentally, is all Ive got. Time in which I plan to make your life very, very annoying. Oh, by the way, Ive *cracked* your servers. Next time, you might consider making it even a little bit of a challenge and, I dont know, *log out*. Tom considered asking about the impossibly ancient log entry but didnt want to give Satan the satisfaction of knowing he was stumped. &amp;nbsp; What do think youll accomplish with all this? Satan asked, finally breaking his silence. &amp;nbsp; Well, I thought Id open a Spa and Resort, you know, really give the people a place to schluff off that Afterlife grime and live it up here in Eternity. Tom turned back to the book, hoping it might reveal a clue about the keys purpose. &amp;nbsp; Sarcasm is the resort of an uneducated man, Satan murmured. &amp;nbsp; Or the resort of the plucky man who doesnt give a shit, Tom countered. &amp;nbsp; You use cheeky quips to hide your fear. &amp;nbsp; Tom gave an indignant snort. Fear? Confusion, maybe. He didnt like admitting when he didnt know the answer to a problem. Usually a little time researching and he would find a solution. There wasnt likely a Google answer for the search query three million old log entry or secret Hell key. &amp;nbsp; Fear that you wont be able to do what youve promised your followers you will. &amp;nbsp; Tom stopped at that, anger building like a fire within him till he turned back to face Satan. And if I was ruled by half as much fear as you Id already be another cog in this machine. Attention back on the book, he ran a thumb along the spine, but hed caught the smug look on Satans face. Hed plucked a nerve. &amp;nbsp; Can you translate this? he asked Twinkle, trying to curb the anger in his voice. &amp;nbsp; His companions stood in silence for a moment before Twinkle shook himself and leaned over to touch his horn to the text. Its a variation of demonish. Likely the root language from which it emerged. &amp;nbsp; Whats it say? The cover. Tom flipped the book in his palms, holding it for Twinkle to read. &amp;nbsp; Without other texts for reference... &amp;nbsp; Give it your most educated try. &amp;nbsp; Well, this word is similar to codex, or archive. History perhaps. This wordcould be a proper noun. Its capitalized but Im unfamiliar with it. Closest to English letters I can bring it is Kyzin. ThenI think these are numbers? Theyve a similar format. &amp;nbsp; Kyzin. A name? A place? A word for something without an English equivalent? That happened between languages even among the people of Earth. Here, everything was possible. It could be a concept far removed from a three dimensional worlds understanding for all he knew. &amp;nbsp; But hearing it out loud had a strange effect on Satan. His pale face looked sallow and haunted. What did the word mean to him? Whatever it was, it was something. Tom tucked that piece of information away for later inspection. &amp;nbsp; Hidden keys lead to hidden treasure, Lightfoot spoke up. &amp;nbsp; I doubt Satan is concerned with hiding a cache of loot. &amp;nbsp; Not all treasure is coin and gem, Tomtomgriffin. Lightfoot gave him a serious look. &amp;nbsp; True, Tom agreed slowly, thinking. The key went to a door, a cabinet, a safe - *something* - outside the control of Hells electronic door system. Outside any networked system. That either spoke to importance ornostalgia. &amp;nbsp; Tom looked back at Satan who struggled to regain control of his composure. He was beginning to look a bit like the citizens hed been torturing for millions of years  ragged, punched in the gut one too many times. Like a man standing at the edge of oblivion. &amp;nbsp; What did Satan fear so deeply? &amp;nbsp; Follow me. Tom motioned to Twinkle and Lightfoot. The ferret leapt onto the unicorns back and they trailed after him into the far end of the server room. He wasnt sure if Satan had preternatural hearing, but better safe than sorry. &amp;nbsp; Take this key to Eva. Tell her to keep it hidden and tell no one else of its existence. Even her lieutenants. I know she trusts them, but I want to limit the number of people who know about this until I know what it is weve got. There is more going on here than meets the eye. &amp;nbsp; I agree. I imagined a far more sinister master pulling the puppet strings, Twinkle said. Hes  &amp;nbsp; Scared, Lightfoot finished. &amp;nbsp; Is he just trying to rattle us, you think? Send us chasing shadows? Twinkle asked. &amp;nbsp; I thought so, at first, but his behaviorthe more we uncover the more he seems to lose his cool. Whatever is going on, he doesnt want us digging. We need to keep an eye on him. If we dig too close to what hes hiding, hell likely lash out again. The more they dug, the more Satan would look for ways to get under his skin. &amp;nbsp; *Cornered men were dangerous men.* He knew that all too well. &amp;nbsp; Tom slipped the key into Lightfoots makeshift bodice, concealing it under his belly. Eva had truly done a great job stitching together the small piece of armor. &amp;nbsp; Shiny, Lightfoot whispered, running a paw over the dull metal. &amp;nbsp; One more thing, have Eva send Gronak back with you to rotate watch with Greystone. Satan might think twice about going toe to toe with her. With that, he dismissed them to carry their message to Eva. &amp;nbsp; Finally, some time to dig his hands into the source code. Tom cracked his knuckles and winced at the twinge of pain as the tendon popped awkwardly. No grace left in the halls of Hell. &amp;nbsp; Forever stuck in a mid-life crisis, Tom muttered, then set to work. &amp;nbsp; *** &amp;nbsp; Tom? Greystones calm voice pulled him from a blackhole of code. From *revelation*. &amp;nbsp; Eyes burning and blurring as he tried to focus them on Greystone, Tom felt like he was back in school, cramming for finals in Foundations of Computational and Systems Biology. Coffeewhat he wouldnt give for a huge cup of steaming, scald-your-mouth, blackest of the blackest coffee. &amp;nbsp; I think I have it, was all he said to Greystones questioning look. When he realized who he was talking to Tom squinted, asking, Satan? &amp;nbsp; Gronak watches him. He speaks Greystone hesitated, eyes clouding with fear. &amp;nbsp; I know its easier said than done but dont let him get to you, Greystone. Hes a talker. Thats all hes got. Tom was beginning to suspect being the Prince of Lies was about all Satan had going for him. He capitalizes on his ability to smell the nuances of emotion. Hes going to look for the smallest crack and wheedle his way in. *And it stung when he hit his mark.* &amp;nbsp; Greystones panicked looked eased, shoulders sagging in relief. He nodded, approaching and crouching beside him. Tentatively he touched the screen, the pressure point dimpling the display and altering the coloring. He pulled back quickly and marveled as it return to a solid black background with white text, the colors of the pixels gone. &amp;nbsp; This will save us? There was genuine curiosity in Greystones question. His world didnt have a word for computer according to Twinkle. They were fairly primitive in terms of tooling  Crissus came from a space faring species  but there was intelligence behind Greystones eyes now that the haze of torture was beginning to clear. &amp;nbsp; Some of the young adults hed gone to college with had started with about as much knowledge on the subject as Greystone. Itd been new and exciting technology, promising stable jobs that would always been in demand. They were the wave of the future. And the beauty of it wasit could be taught. To everyone. &amp;nbsp; The thought made Tom pull back, a frown turning his mouth down. Hells first School of Technology? He could see it now, all the students lined up on benches, waiting to learn about the bots that had controlled them for years, or decades, or a millennia. Learning how to *take control* of their lives in ways theyd believed beyond their power. &amp;nbsp; Some would struggle but how many brilliant, untapped minds were milling about in the main cavern? How many resources were as yet undiscovered? Others like Greystone who had no experience with technology but could learn the same as theyd learned to use a hammer, to build a house, to work a plough. Who might see a solution he hadnt considered, could see the problem from another perspective, another angle. &amp;nbsp; I do believe it will, Tom said, his words heavy with a meaning Greystone wouldnt grasp. Not yet. &amp;nbsp; A strange thing. So small and still. It has no edge, no tip, nothing that could pierce an enemys skin. &amp;nbsp; There are many kinds of weapons. &amp;nbsp; Greystone nodded, thoughtful. The Speakers. &amp;nbsp; Tom cocked his head, curious. The Speakers? &amp;nbsp; Among my people there is a position given to an elder whos seen more than a hundred-fifty winters. We believe they have the ability to see justice where the hot head of youth cannot. They hear petitions from the clans who are unable to settle disputes amongst themselves. Speakers can tear down or build up with a word. We call it being struck by the veiled spear. It isunpleasant to be on the receiving end. &amp;nbsp; Tom smiled. We have a similarcasteon Earth. We call them Supreme Court Justices. &amp;nbsp; And Judge Judy, but the reference would be lost on his companion. &amp;nbsp; Slowly Tom walked Greystone through his plan. &amp;nbsp; First, lock down the robots so only those who had his login could manipulate them. &amp;nbsp; Secondly, add a level of encryption to it. This, he explained, was hard since he relied heavily on libraries (a concept that had made Greystone squint in confusion) for securing systems. No access to libraries meant the best *he* could do was a caesar cipher. It was something at least. &amp;nbsp; Hed need to test this on a single Droopey-clone before pushing a mass updated through the network. &amp;nbsp; Greystone seemed to understand the broad strokes of his idea but Tom noted a few times his eyes had glazed over. Greystone had the capacity to learn the finer complexities of robotics, programming and networking, Tom was sure of it. Eva had taught him how to move the clones by typing basic commands into the tablet. Right now it was more a matter of following directions than understanding the mechanics behind the action. But understanding could come later. &amp;nbsp; Control the warrior, control the war, Greystone said quietly, eyes riveted on the screen. &amp;nbsp; *Untapped resources indeed.* &amp;nbsp; From the main room Tom heard Twinkle call his name. Untangling his legs from their folded crisscross, he stood and staggered at the feeling of pins pricking his calf and toes. Damn the afterlife. &amp;nbsp; Yeah, yeah. Im coming, Tom shouted when Twinkle said his name again, this time with a hint of agitation. Which, for Twinkle, was nearly indistringuishable from his average aggravation. *Nearly*. &amp;nbsp; Eva needs to speak with you, Twinkle said. &amp;nbsp; She didnt send a message with you? &amp;nbsp; Twinkle shook his head. Said you needed to hear this in person. &amp;nbsp; Tom glanced at Satan and Gronak. She had him pinned between her and the couchs arm. Having shared a cramped hiding space with her Tom felt a moment of pity for the bastard. Pained expression on his face, Satans clothes were starting to grow wet from the ooze dripping from Gronaks skin. &amp;nbsp; Be grateful is smells nice, Tom muttered under his breath. &amp;nbsp; Finding his way back to the main cavern was easier the second time. He only needed to consult the map once. Pretty soon hed be maneuvering through the halls of Hell like he did his house at night. *That* was an uncomfortable thought the deeper it sank. &amp;nbsp; *Ill know these halls like the back of my hand.* Shudder. &amp;nbsp; The sounds of conversation began to rise when he was a few corridors away from the main cavern. It took him no time to find Eva as she was waiting for him at the entrance to the hallway. &amp;nbsp; Flanking her were Felicia, who continuously scanned the crowd, and Reese and Twixt, who watched him silently, wearing the costumes Eva had made of Droopey-clone parts. Their sharp expressions, dark hair and easy handling of the tridents made them all the creepier. He gave them a dip of his head, appreciating their flair for the dramatic. They just stared back at him. &amp;nbsp; Eva snatched his arm quickly, leading him to small group off to the right of the hallways mouth. Her lieutenants followed. &amp;nbsp; I think you need to hear this. &amp;nbsp; Hello to you too, Tom said. &amp;nbsp; I started talking to some of the other Hellizens- &amp;nbsp; Nice, she was using his word. &amp;nbsp; -and we got onto the subject of other attempts at taking over Hell. &amp;nbsp; Okay, that was interesting. Yeah? &amp;nbsp; Before they reached the small gathering she pulled up short and turned him to face her. Their companions stopped a foot or so away, giving them space. &amp;nbsp; Tom, have you wondered why it seemed we were the only people to try taking over Hell? &amp;nbsp; Tom shrugged. It had crossed my mind as strange but truthfully I hadnt stopped to really consider what it meant. I just figured that no one else was as clever as me. &amp;nbsp; Eva stared at him, her expression flat. &amp;nbsp; Okay, that was a joke- &amp;nbsp; Har har. Im serious. &amp;nbsp; Tom rubbed the back of his neck, considering. It had seemed highly fortuitous that theyd risen to the power they had nearly uncontested. Hed figured that had been because Satan had no other minions than the Droopey-clones and imps. And hed capitalized on that. &amp;nbsp; But then, surely there had been others whod attempted; other programmers, roboticists, engineers, electricians  hell, probably even an avid DIY-er could have attempted a takeover. &amp;nbsp; So where were they? Among the throngs hed freed? If so, why hadnt Twinkle ever heard of a Hell uprising? Or any of his other companions? &amp;nbsp; He thought of the pit outside Satans residence. Imagined what was done to those who rose up against The Lord of Hell. He suppressed a shudder and focused on Eva. &amp;nbsp; Whatd you find? &amp;nbsp; Eva swept her hands over to the waiting group. Several were human, a few were species he hadnt seen yet. &amp;nbsp; A skinny, wispy creature with long purple tendrils sweeping down a slender back seemed to be in constant motion. There was a femininity to the form that made Tom think of a female dancer especially given the graceful swish of her limbs. &amp;nbsp; Another was a large snake with the head of a lion. Its thickly coiled body pulsed with undeniable strength, scales slick and gleaming in the light of the cavern. A forked tongue the color of burnt umber flicked out of the lions maw, matching the piercing color of his eyes. Her eyes? Tom couldnt tell. &amp;nbsp; The third non-human was a bonafide centaur. A freaking centaur! Tawny hide shimmered over tightly packed horse flesh, thinning at the point it met the exposed torso of the centaurs stomach. Large horns curled backwards into a small spiral, disappearing into his long blond hair. Cold, spring green eyes watched him approach, arms the size of logs crossed over his chest. &amp;nbsp; I had Felicia, Twixt and Reese start asking around about other uprisings. We started to notice something about everyones accounts. Eva pushed Tom towards the gathering. Go on, tell him what you told us, Cher. &amp;nbsp; A petite woman with cropped hair and gauged ears  now empty of their spacers  stepped forward, clearing her throat. Ive been here nearly twenty years. I think. Time is a bitch down here. Keeping track seemed the only way to stay sane. Though I dont really know what I was counting towards. Theres isnt exactly a release date to look forward to here. She shook herself as she realized she was rambling. In my third year here I made friends with this guy, Bennie, who wanted to fight back. &amp;nbsp; It wasnt anything serious, at first. Just talk. Angry talk. The kind that keeps fire in your heart and purpose in your blood. Kept us going, all that talk. Rumors spread through the torture lines. Soon we had others sending us whispers along the chain, sending us their own ideas. Then we really started thinking, we could do this. We *would* do this. &amp;nbsp; When Cher stopped Tom urged her gently to go on. &amp;nbsp; When we thought we were ready we sent messages through the lines, readying everyone to charge the guards and get a weapon. We didnt have much plan other than that. Just get armed, fall back somewhere and plan from a secure place. Bennie had been in the British Royal Signal Corps back in the twenties. Hes the one who devised our communication tactics, keeping our motives hidden behind code phrases. I didnt know anything about warfare but I thought his plan was the best chance we were going to get. We took down several guards, fell back to a hallway but we discovered we couldnt get into any of the rooms. &amp;nbsp; Someone from the twenties wouldnt have known about RFID. Theyd been sitting ducks out in the open. Tom felt his gut tighten, knowing where this story was going. &amp;nbsp; It was a couple days before the guards found us but they pinned us quickly. Swarms of them falling down on our position like they *knew* exactly where we were. &amp;nbsp; After spending time in the source code Tom had a pretty good idea of how that had happened. The guards werent programmed to immediately track down their charges. At least not *en masse*. If someone slipped a Droopey-clone *it* was programmed to begin a search, separate of its brothers. If an allotted amount of time passed and the charge was not recovered, it sent a message to the nearest clone, doubling its efforts. &amp;nbsp; And doubled, and doubled, and doubled again after each time countdown until it found its quarry. That explained why there hadnt been a massive search for them when he and Eva had first broke free of the ranks. But, theyd swarmed in large numbers, taking down Vick and Zee, nearly taking the rest of their group as well. So close to capture. &amp;nbsp; They each grabbed one of us and took us back to our cells. I tried to fight them. I tried. Shame clogged her throat. We were in our cells for days before they returned us to the torture lines. I searched the lines for Bennie, using the codes hed taught us, but he was gone. Justgone. I never saw him again. &amp;nbsp; Tom looked at the others. The expressions on their faces and nodes told him they each had a story with a similar ending. Leaders snatched away. Rebellions stomped out. Freedom squashed. &amp;nbsp; Did he dare voice his suspicion about the pit? Would it be him in there one day? &amp;nbsp; Its the same story with everyone, Eva said, cutting into Toms dark thoughts. Cher, they never used anything more than the guards to take you guys down, right? &amp;nbsp; Cher shook her head. Not that we saw. &amp;nbsp; How much you wanna bet Satan was the last person to see the rebellion leaders before they disappeared? Eva asked in a low voice, turning her back so she was talking only to him. &amp;nbsp; The whole damn farm, Eva. He wanted to ask her what she thought about the strange scarab pit but not in front of this group. It was evident Cher had cared for Bennie, felt  in some part  responsible for the failure theyd faced. No point in hurting her further by suggesting Bennie was gone forever. &amp;nbsp; Flame. Snuffed. &amp;nbsp; Not to mention there was something Satan feared enough to earn his silence. &amp;nbsp; *One problem at a time, Tom. One problem at a time* &amp;nbsp; Okay, have someone collect their stories. I wanna hear about every attempt made to over throw Hell. As much information as they can recall. It could help them avoid pitfalls later. &amp;nbsp; I can do that, Eva said, nodding. &amp;nbsp; I need you for something else. Tom turned to look at the throngs of humans, creatures, and beings mingling through the cavern. Start recruiting. Anyone who has engineering, electrical, or technical experience. And I mean *anyone*. &amp;nbsp; Eva looked with him, no doubt considering where to start her search. He was confident shed find him what he needed. What do I do with them once Ive found them? &amp;nbsp; Give them a tablet and send them to me. There was more than one way to arm the masses. &amp;nbsp; Eva gave him a sly smile, probably sharing a similar thought, then turned to her lieutenants to dispense orders."

Twinkle asked, dipping his head to sniff at the fountains liquid contents. I mean, it smells like water but can we trust it? &amp;nbsp; We dont need to eat or drink anymore, Tom commented, moving closer to the monitors. Whats it matter? &amp;nbsp; Given our hellish landscape these weeks past, Id say water, the symbol of life, the thing upon which most living beings must survive, the thing that makes a world *grow* would matter greatly. This isluxury. Especially since none of us need it to survive on this plane of existence. So why have it if not as a symbol of status? Twinkle dipped a hoof into the fountain, sending languid ripples out in all directions. &amp;nbsp; Perhaps the Lord of Hell drinks it, Lightfoot said casually. &amp;nbsp; Tom turned to say something, then stopped. His eye was drawn to a door near the monitors he hadnt seen before. The angle from the entrance to Satans quarters had obstructed its view. A single plaque on the door in Demonish read, Hall of Enlightenment. &amp;nbsp; Easy translationabstract in meaning. But Tom was growing familiar with the seemingly archaic and whimsical nature of Hells naming system. His gut told him the answer to everything lay beyond that door. &amp;nbsp; Enlightenment meant knowledge. Knowledge meant information. And information meant &amp;nbsp; He strode over to the door, bringing up the app to unlock the door. Before he could enter the text into the command it swung open. &amp;nbsp; RFID. *Of course.* &amp;nbsp; Because only the imps or the High Lord himself would find themselves in this room. Tom snorted. The security was seriously lacking in this establishment. Not that he could complain, itd been a boon in their revolution, but the engineer in him cringed at the vulnerability of the whole system. &amp;nbsp; The hum of fans and electricity drifted from the room, confirming what Tom suspected. The server room. &amp;nbsp; What is this? Lightfoot asked. Hed scurried up Twinkles head, coiling his upright body around the Unicorns horn to get a better look at the room. &amp;nbsp; Jackpot, Tom replied as he stepped across the doors threshold. &amp;nbsp; Whats so important about Jacks pot? Lightfoot asked, whiskers twitching. &amp;nbsp; Well, shit, a voice said behind them. &amp;nbsp; Tom spun on his heel to see a dark robed figure standing in the entrance to the room, thick hood pulled back. Taller than Gronak, he had gaunt features that reminded Tom of Jack Skellington. Unlike the cheerful skeleton, wavy tendrils of black hair fell to his waist  at least Tom guessed he was male, there was no way to be certain in this place without asking  and his iris were pinpoints of white set in pools of solid black. &amp;nbsp; There was a tugging sense of familiarity in his features that made Tom cock his head. Where had he seen that visage before? It wasnt exactly the stuff of nightmares but there was a chilling air to the way those eyes watched them. &amp;nbsp; This is awkward, he said finally, moving deeper into the room. &amp;nbsp; They were trapped. Their only option was to fall back into the server room and find a way to bar the door. &amp;nbsp; *A door that responded to RFID? Not easily.* &amp;nbsp; Instead of charging them, he moved towards the sitting area and removed his robe, dropping it onto the plush leather. Underneath he wore tan slacks and a loose fitted tunic of black. It lent him a casual, relaxed air that was almost comical given the last several weeks. Like hed just come home to find his wifes family was unexpectedly in from out of town. &amp;nbsp; Tom cleared his throat, Are you- &amp;nbsp; Lord of Hell, Satan himself. He sat down beside his discarded robe, arms stretched impossibly wide along the back of the couch. &amp;nbsp; Tom eyed the door, then glanced back at Satan. Perhaps they could make a run for it. Would Twinkle be willing, just this once, to let him climb on his back? &amp;nbsp; You dont seem too concerned with finding us in here, Lightfoot remarked. &amp;nbsp; It is surprising, but truthfully, Im a bit impressed. No ones found this place in thousands of years. He tilted his head to the door. It might seem a good idea, tempting to say the least. I should know, I deal in temptation. But I can promise you, you wont make it to that door before I do. He lazily looked back at them each as though he had all the time in the world. &amp;nbsp; And all the power. &amp;nbsp; No. Not *all* the power. &amp;nbsp; *Keep him distracted, focused on conversation.* &amp;nbsp; Satan sniffed the air suddenly, leaning forward till his back was straight as a board. Did you know temptation has a unique smell? All emotions do and most are different depending on species and plane of existence. Human fear smells like sour milk. On unicorns, it smells like rotten elderberries. Terror is a vein of fear and subtly alters the scent. Sorrow smells like mold and wet stone on humans but on others, say sentient ferrets, it smells like sun burnt clay. Satan kept his eyes trained on them. But temptationtemptation smells the same on everyone. &amp;nbsp; He stood and circled the fountain, standing directly between them and the doorway. He trailed a finger along the edge of his desk, eyes down cast. &amp;nbsp; What does it smell like? Tom asked, moving till Twinkles flank blocked his hands. Then he risked a glance down at the tablet and sent a ping out to pinpoint the nearest guards. Two near the main cavern, three down a parallel hallway. &amp;nbsp; Strange, Satan had no guards posted outside his chambers. Did they not accompany him when he left? &amp;nbsp; Concern wormed its way into Toms brain. The only overlords who went anywhere without bodyguards (especially when outnumbered) were either extremely stupidor extremely capable. &amp;nbsp; It smells like honey. The richest, rawest honey. Satan breathed in deep. And this room is heavy with it. &amp;nbsp; Toms fingers shook over the tablet. Those white irises were locked on to him. &amp;nbsp; Im at a disadvantage, Satan continued. You know me, but I do not know you. &amp;nbsp; Dont you? Twinkle asked, drawing his attention. Hardly seems very omniscient of you. &amp;nbsp; At this, Satan chuckled. It was high and cascading, almost feminine. Oh, Im not omniscient. No such creature exists. &amp;nbsp; While he was distracted Tom moved the guards to their coordinates. It would take them some time to get to them but it was better than nothing. &amp;nbsp; Why hadnt he tried harder to find a way to send messages between the tablets? He kicked himself, wishing there was a way to call the others (and the army theyd just armed) to his position. Eva would have Satan on his knees by now with her mad trident skills. &amp;nbsp; Twinkle snorted, pulling Toms head back into the conversation. The Curator of Paradise &amp;nbsp; Satans lip curled up into a sneer. The Curator is no more omniscient than me. &amp;nbsp; Tom felt that sliver of concern flare. Why was Satan telling them this? Why unravel the myth and legend, for *them*, that had shielded him? He thought of the pit outside the room. &amp;nbsp; In the movies, the bad guy always confidently revealed his plans - the whole cunning show, cast and crew - just before he disposed of his enemiesforever. &amp;nbsp; The sneer eased after a moment. I can guess, though. Swek leaves something to be desired in the intelligence gathering game, but he gave me enough of a description that Im guessing, he pointed to Twinkle, youre Twinkle Toes. Thats easy though since not many unicorns come through Hell. And youyou were there with the woman, Eva. Satan circled his desk, bringing Tom into full view. &amp;nbsp; I was there. Tom offered nothing else. &amp;nbsp; You work for Tom Griffin? Satans eyes narrowed, fixed on Tom. &amp;nbsp; Would either answer spare us? Tom asked. &amp;nbsp; Satan cocked his head to the side. No, I suppose it wouldnt. Would you like to sit? He motioned towards the lavish sitting area with a sweep of one long skeletal arm. When they all hesitated he added, I have eternity to punish you. For now, lets sit and talk like civilized creatures. &amp;nbsp; Now it was Toms turn to narrow his gaze on Satan. What was his game? Get them sitting? Drug them and feed them to the scarabs? *Could* they be drugged? &amp;nbsp; Twinkle and Lightfoot stared at Tom, waiting for his leave. &amp;nbsp; *Distraction*. They needed to kill time till the Droopey-clones arrived. &amp;nbsp; Tom inclined his head, moved closer to Twinkle and muttered under his breath. Kill time. &amp;nbsp; Lightfoot perked up at that and fluffed his fur with a shake. Twinkle dipped his head, the only sign that hed heard. &amp;nbsp; Together they moved towards the sitting area, keeping their eyes on Satan. Tom took a place on the far end of the couch. When Satan sat at the other end, he itched to move to the single chair but he knew it was better to keep movability for when the time came to act. Twinkle sat his hindquarters onto the loveseat, stretching out his front legs. Lightfoot slinked forward to cling to his shoulder. &amp;nbsp; The sight made a bubble of laughter rise up in Toms chest. Here he was, sitting in Satans living room with a unicorn and talking ferret. The only thing that missing from this absurd scene was a steaming cup of tea. &amp;nbsp; You find this humorous? Satan asked him. &amp;nbsp; Hed laughed out loud? Of course he had. What wasnt amusing? The way he saw itYoure either laughing or youre crying. And have you ever seen a unicorn sit on a couch like a bipedal? Tom used Twinkles favorite word for everyone *not* on four legs. Im sitting with the Lord of Hell, wondering where I went wrong in my life, caught red handed in his private chambers and my best friend is a little ferret usurper with the ability to speak. Fancy a spot o tea? he finished with a mock British accent, then slipped into a fit of giggles. &amp;nbsp; Forgive my feeble minded companion, Twinkle snapped, glaring over at Tom, which only made him laugh harder till tears streamed down his face. &amp;nbsp; The room grew silent till he calmed, wiping away the moisture from his eyes. Oh man, I needed that. Thanks, truly. &amp;nbsp; Are you- &amp;nbsp; Whats that smell like? Tom cut him off, keeping control of the conversation. Time. Time. Time. He needed time. &amp;nbsp; What? &amp;nbsp; Laughter, humor, he paused, holding Satans gaze, insanity. &amp;nbsp; The Lord of Hell studied him, a look of concern flitting over his face for a brief second. Youre not- &amp;nbsp; Who died in that pit? Tom felt the room spin but hed never felt so in control. Satan flinched back, eyes growing thin in suspicion. *That was interesting.* &amp;nbsp; Pit? &amp;nbsp; Where do we go when we die a second time? Oblivion? Nothingness? Do you bring those who wont break and toss them in to be devoured by scarabs? Those whorevolt? &amp;nbsp; Lightfoot joined in, asking Does Hell have a Throne Room? Are you royalty? Do you drink that? He pointed towards the fountain, drawing Satans gaze towards the gurgling water. &amp;nbsp; Are there more books? Does Hell have a library? Twinkle added, catching Toms eye. His lips curled slightly, encouraging the unicorn to continue. Id love to catch up on some reading and given Im only here another ninety-nine years, ten months, and two weeks there is hardly anything you can do to me that- &amp;nbsp; Silence! Satan snapped, voice deepening into a thunderous clap. The earlier femininity of his laughter was replaced with a masculine timber. He rubbed his temple with one hand and pinched the narrow bridge of his long nose with the other. &amp;nbsp; Headaches are the worst, Tom said, noting the pained expression on Satans face. &amp;nbsp; Had I realized Id be inviting heckling hens to converse Id have rethought my stay of torture, Satan said, dropping his hands. &amp;nbsp; Okay, Tom said, holding up his hands in mock surrender, one question at a time. &amp;nbsp; How about Ill answer one for every one you answer. &amp;nbsp; Deal. &amp;nbsp; Twinkle snorted a warning at Tom but he waved the unicorn off. He was under no compulsion to tell the truth. And even if he were, he could dance around it. Chances were Satan would do the same. But tells werent always in the answer. They were often in the expressions, in what *wasnt* said. &amp;nbsp; Ill go first, get us started. Tom leaned back into the couch, the doorway in his peripheral. Satan sat with his back to that opening, but Tom wasnt foolish enough to believe Hells Overlord wasnt exactly where he wanted to be. Whos in the pit outside your chambers? &amp;nbsp; No one that concerns you. &amp;nbsp; So, Satan didnt want to discuss the pit of bone dust. Interesting. &amp;nbsp; My turn. Do you work for Tom Griffin? Satan asked. &amp;nbsp; You could say that. Tom yawned as though bored with the conversation. Shouldnt be long now. He sent us to look for the companions you took. Give a little to get a little. &amp;nbsp; Brows arched in curiosity, Satan leaned forward till his elbows rested on his thin knees. Where is he? &amp;nbsp; Tom shook his head, No cutting turns. Where are Vick and Zee? &amp;nbsp; Satan considered his reply, no doubt contemplating lying or misleading him. Then he lifted his hand and pointed to somewhere behind Tom. A3, was all he said. &amp;nbsp; Tom turned to look at the monitors, counting down three rows. The monitor looked in on a small room with two stone benches on either side, much like the cell hed woken up in. Zee fluttered his wings periodically and Vick lay curled into a half moon shape. Why hadnt they fled when hed opened all the doors? &amp;nbsp; The only door in this place that still takes a manual key. Satan offered, as though he could read his thoughts. I imagine *Tom* will be curious as to why his little ploy didnt set his friends free. &amp;nbsp; Wheres the key? Tom asked. &amp;nbsp; Now who is cutting turns? Satan said, with a smile. Who are you? &amp;nbsp; *Wrong question.* Tom returned the smile. Just one of the masses. &amp;nbsp; Anger spread across Satans face, contorting it into something ghoulish. Careful what games you play with me. &amp;nbsp; You asked the wrong question, Saty, Tom said, growing bold. Was that the sound of shuffling footsteps outside the chamber? &amp;nbsp; What is your *name*? Satan amended, eyes turning from pin points of white to blood droplets in a sea of black. &amp;nbsp; The guards entered the room and three things happened at once. Tom spun to the left, off the couch and ran for the far end of the room, putting distance between him and Satan. Hells King shot up from his position and roared as he turned to face the doorway. And Evas voice called out to them from behind the guards. &amp;nbsp; Tom! She pushed through the Droopey-clones, trident tipped out in front of her. She locked eyes with him at the same moment Tom heard Satan scream in anger. &amp;nbsp; TOM GRIFFIN! The Lord of Hell turned to face him, rage pinching his face up tight. Teeth elongated in a pale mouth, fingers clenched the air, opening, closing, opening. Satan fought to control himself, holding his position. &amp;nbsp; Eva! Satan! Tom pointed towards an enraged Satan. Then he moved the guards towards the huffing Lord. Eva followed suit, pointing her trident towards him. The clones circled around him, closing off escape. &amp;nbsp; Though his chest was heaving and his eyes were murderous, Satan made no attempt to attack or fight his way through the guards. He simply glared in Toms direction. &amp;nbsp; Howd you find us? Tom asked Eva from across the room. &amp;nbsp; When we returned to the main cavern I noticed you guys were missing and spotted several guards moving down this hall. At first I was going to stop them, like you showed us. But then I thought there must be a reason they were moving this way when. I followed to investigate. She kept her eyes on Satan. Crissus and Greystone are in the hallway. &amp;nbsp; I found the server room. And Zee and Vick, Tom said. This drew her gaze to him. He pointed to the A3 monitor. Satan has the key somewhere. &amp;nbsp; Eva turned back to the lanky Lord of Hell. She pressed the tip of a trident close to his throat. Where is the key? &amp;nbsp; Ah, Eva. Swek was especially fond of you. Called you the Raven Haired Bitch. Satan pulled his fingernails up to inspect them, his earlier anger receding. &amp;nbsp; The Raven Haired Bitch? I rather like that. Eva turned to Tom. Thats my new handle. Eva The Raven Haired Bitch. She turned back to Satan, pressing harder on the trident. Blood, black and thick, rolled down his neck. &amp;nbsp; Satan *could* be wounded. He didnt look concerned or even pained by the cut and that disconcerted Tom. Force wouldnt work on someone who didnt fear pain or the threat of violence. &amp;nbsp; That didnt mean they couldnt restrain him. And their plan remained the same. Operation Kingdom Come. Now that he had access to the servers he could re-program the Droopey-clones and Imps. Take over Hell. &amp;nbsp; Tom shouted for Greystone and Crissus. They entered and surveyed the room with cautious glances. When they saw Eva was unharmed they relaxed. &amp;nbsp; Greystone, can you find something in this room to bind our gracious host, The Lord of Hell, with? Tom motioned towards the desk and shelves. The two of them moved through the room and began searching even nook and cranny. &amp;nbsp; Finally, they found a small bin with several articles of clothing, including another robe, this one with a long woolen tie. It wouldnt hold anyone of great strength for long, but it was better than nothing. &amp;nbsp; Greystone wound it around Satans wrists, which hed willingly put behind his back, then Eva moved him towards the sitting area. All the while, Satan remained eerily silent. &amp;nbsp; Tomtomgriffin, what do we do next? Seems you are outted, Lightfoot said from the back of Twinkle, whod moved to stand between Tom and their watchful captive. &amp;nbsp; Were in the home stretch, Lightfoot, Tom said reassuringly. Ive got access to the servers. It might take some time but were close to taking over Hell. He didnt need his cover anymore. Right? &amp;nbsp; Twinkle seemed unconvinced. We dont know who were messing with. It might not unnerve you, being so thick headed, but he doesnt seem very concerned with his predicament. &amp;nbsp; It hadnt escaped his notice. Satan was unusually calm given they had him at a disadvantage. Well worry about that later. Right now I want to get into that room and see what were dealing with in there. &amp;nbsp; And Zee? Vick? Twinkle asked. &amp;nbsp; Ill leave that to you and Eva. Tom headed towards the server room. &amp;nbsp; Do you remember how you died, Tom? Satan asked, stopping him short. &amp;nbsp; What? He turned to see a thin smile on the Lord of Hells face. &amp;nbsp; You dont remember how you died, do you? &amp;nbsp; What does that matter? Im still here, arent I? He *had* wondered why he couldnt remember how hed died when so many others did. &amp;nbsp; Oh, it matters. It matters greatly, Tom. See, time works differently here. Days, months, years are but seconds in your world. &amp;nbsp; Dread began to creep into Toms veins, turning him icy cold. What was he trying to say? Why did it feel like suddenly Satan was holding all the cards? Could he scent the sour milk even now? &amp;nbsp; An electrical surge across an old wire. It shorted and zapped you good, Satan continued, his smile deepening. The sharp glint of his teeth was at once frightening and beguiling. Stopped your heart. &amp;nbsp; So a faulty wire killed me. Big deal. That fucking *sucked*. Killed by one of his tools. But he wasnt gonna let Satan know how much that rankled him. He started for the server room again. &amp;nbsp; As he crossed the threshold into the whine of server fans he could just barely make out Satan saying, Youre not fully dead yet. "

The battlefield may have risen from fields and oceans to stars and planets but death still followed us, wherever we went. Men didnt die from bullets. They died waiting for the shot they never heard. Id spent almost an entire Solar day going through the plans Naval Command had put together. Every bit of intel and remote telemetry shot via tight beam from the nearest post-buoy to my tablet. And it was all shit. I dragged a flight plan into the digital incinerator and set about giving the nav comp another set of problems to solve. Emli set a cup of coffee beside me as she came into my bunk room. How long have you been at it? she said. Since we left Mars orbit. I took a sip and let my eyes adjust to something other than a screen held a foot away from my face. Supplies squared away? You mean in the space your new Doctor friend left us? I looked up at her. She was short but Id seen far too many drunk sailors mistake that for vulnerability. She pointedly avoided my gaze. Were all good. Peters supervised the weaponry. And the razors? Emli shifted and I knew her well enough to realise she had something on her mind. Discipline would keep her quiet. She trusted my orders, sometimes she had more faith in them than I did. Speak, I said. Last time we had clear orders Sir. Breach and sweep. We had nothing to lose, but trying the same thing twice is asking for trouble. Naval Command thinks its the best bet. Naval Command isnt here, she said and she crossed her arms across her chest. Shed rolled the sleeves of her jumpsuit up and I could make out the scars that crisscrossed her arms. I could recall the ops that had left each and every one. Last time we were backed into a corner. You dont have to give me the speech again Sir. No. I shouldnt have to, because you know what happens if we screw this up. Last time, we were on the back foot and all I had to do was point out our choices: die slow or die heroic. This time we have a real chance to stop the war before anyone else has to die. Except for us? I knew it was her job, to point out the gaps, the holes, to bring forth the thoughts all of the men were thinking but they didnt have the rank to bring up. I hated her because this time she was repeating my own thoughts back to me. Theirs not to reason why, I said and put an end to it. It was an old poem. It had been old when my Dad told it to me, before he shipped out and came back as a name on an empty box. Emli shut her jaw and I watched the muscles tense. She was a marine and she was a fucking good one. She wouldnt argue with me and any man in the squad who was thinking the same would soon learn the same from her. So the doc? Shes cute, she said, changing the subject. Off limits, I said. Dont worry Cap. Shes not my type, I only like em if I can pull rank. Emli smiled and I didnt fancy the odds of whatever midshipwoman had found her way to her bunk. And besides, shes not interested in any of us grunts. Shes only got eyes for her dreamy captain. Go fuck an airlock, I said. Emli snapped off a crisp salute that couldnt hide her grin. Aye aye, Sir. She left me alone and I listened to the sound of her boots fade until the ship swallowed them up. The nav comp beeped and I looked back at the tablet. The parabolic arc had moved a few degrees but my mind was a million lightyears away. -x- Sir, Ive got a question. Wu held up a hand from his perch on the crates stacked against the edge of the hanger. The two hab tents, their surfaces translucent for the moment, had taken up most of the room. The two dropships were anchored in their moorings, leaving just the centre aisle clear. Emli stood on my right, Doctor Adams on my left. Both knew the plan ahead of time, but the men had just heard it for the first time. Go ahead Specialist, I said. What the fuck Sir? Stow the language marine, Emli said, stepping forward and letting her hands fall from behind her back. I held up a hand to calm them both down. Sometimes the price of giving the squad a little leeway was that they took it for granted. No doubt Wu would find himself scrubbing exopack valves with a toothbrush for a week. If we made it back. Naval Command suggested it as the most viable strategy and Ive run the numbers myself. We need to take the ship with zero-visibility and minimal loss of life. And if we have to put one before the other? Peters asked. He was stroking an LA8083. We cant tip off the rest of the fleet, I said and Hannah opened her mouth but I wasnt finished. But if we start shooting, we might as well have not bothered making the trip in the first place. I want full DCP prep by 0575. The Commander is going to plunge the core at 0700 and that will give us ninety minutes before the Chiron hits bingo-ice and has to turn around. We will have ninety minutes ladies and gentlemen, to sneak in under the enemys noses and pull off the heist of the century. They whooped, even if Wus comments were still fresh in their minds. Sergeant, I said, addressing Emli who was still watching Wu. See to it. Aye aye, Sir. I left her to hand out the duties as I guided Hannah back to her dorm. The doc had all the hallmarks of a pre-op greenhorn. Youre staying, I said when we reached her bunk. No. I need to go. I need to establish first contact. First contact is going to be bloody and violent and youre not cut out for that. She put her hands on her hips and stood until the front of her jumpsuit pressed against my own. She was shaking with a mix of fear and rage and it was a combination Id seen before. Normally right before I had to write a letter home to some kids parents. You can not keep me on this ship, she said. Actually, I can. I have full command of any actions of a military nature in pursuit of mission objectives. Your squad will kill anything that moves! Theyre marines first. Thats their job. Which is why you need me. And when the enemy start shooting back? Ill take cover. Have you ever flown a razorback? Her eyes said enough. Ever fought in zero-gee? Ever had to make a breach-and-vac into space? I laughed, Have you ever even worn an exopack before? Her face had lost none of its intensity, but I could see the gears turning within. You said it yourself, one shot and we might as well have not bothered. Do you trust me? I said. Hannah let her hands slip. I gripped her shoulders and she let that fierce gaze fall on anything but my face. We will board that craft and we will use lethal force, but only if it is absolutely necessary. If the lives of my men are at risk, Im not going to deny them the right to protect themselves. Even if it means giving up our only hope of ending this war? she said. I stepped back and she sat down on her bunk. Her fight was draining away. Were all insignificant compared to the chance of driving a wedge between the enemys ranks. Her hands were twisting with the nervous fixations of a woman who knew shed come too far in the company of killers to turn back now. She looked up at me. Captain Frost, youre going to have to make a choice. Will you let your men die so that humanity may live? Get some rest, I said. Ill wake you when were ready to leave. She wanted me to see the logic of her words. She wanted an answer and I knew she wouldnt be able to sleep until I gave her one. I left her and headed to the hanger. Emli handed me a rifle and I stripped it down with the palsy only a mission could bring. **&lt;-[[Previous](/r/HFY/comments/4d6l4i/oc_london_calling_chapter_6/)] &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [[Original](/r/HFY/comments/4bjbi2/oc_london_calling/)] &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [[Next](/r/HFY/comments/4gt156/oc_london_calling_chapter_8/)]-&gt;**"
143,vulnerability,HFY,"[META] The Art of Writing, or How to Make your HFY not Suck",151,44tsce,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/44tsce/meta_the_art_of_writing_or_how_to_make_your_hfy/,2016-02-09 10:56:00,"I've browsed HFY for a while, quietly, and have read a few of the series. My personal favorite is the Kevin Jenkins Experience and the two corollaries, HDMGP and Xiu's stuff, but that is neither here nor there. No, I'm here to talk not about humans, but humanity, fuck yeah. More specifically, how to write it well and how to improve your settings, your characters, and your plots. I love reading HFY, but sometimes, man, I just can't deal with seeing the same five or ten mistakes and tropes over and over. &amp;nbsp; #Why your plots are weak &amp;nbsp; All the syntax and grammar don't mean jack shit if your plot is worthless. Most people here can write 'well', in a technical sense, in the way that somebody is good at drawing lines and curves. But it's taking that and being able to transfer a message, something cool, engaging, that is what matters. &amp;nbsp; ""*But General, how do I do that? You're just sitting here criticizing!*"" Well, if you got this far, I reckon you probably are going to read this whole thing, so I'll get right into it. The single, number one reason that HFY is often shit is because it doesn't actually focus on characters, it focuses on humanity. And not even well at that, 90% of HFY consists of the following: ""Da peaceful alliuums got beat by da stronk genocidal humans! Heil Hitl-I mean Fuck YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHRRRRRR"" Fuck off. I get that HFY is supposed to point out cool shit about humans, but honestly, what's cool about being a hyper-violent slaughtering machine? The reason this is a shitty premise is obvious, but I see it over and over^and^over^and^over The reader isn't stupid and anybody with half a brain will very swiftly start to ask a question: Humans are so successful because we are capable of intelligence and wide-scale survival. If that means violence so be it. But, why on Earth would you presume that unique? If the galaxy is truly so full of life, why the fuck would humans be the only one capable of kicking ass? Just Earth alone is filled with any number of large organisms that can (and regularly do) give humans a run for their money on the ability to kill things. The idea that the vast majority of the aliens out there wouldn't also follow this model is absolutely absurd. &amp;nbsp; ""*But General, not all planets are like Earth!*"" No, they aren't, I was getting to that. If you are going to say that any, never mind most (and I'll get to this in a second) alien species aren't as badass as humans, you need two good explanations. Firstly, how they managed to evolve and survive in their corner of the galaxy in the first place, and secondly, how one of the more violent species didn't utterly ruin their day, assuming that in your HFY humans are latecomers to an already well connected galaxy. Space and the galaxy are remarkably unfriendly to life, particularly larger, multi-cellular life such as any life that would have the neural connectivity to be intelligent and conscious. However, this does not mean that all planets need be as harsh as Earth. For one thing, biology is a good guide, as is, surprisingly, basic game theory and exchange modeling. If your species arose and wasn't the biggest or baddest around, how did you survive? A good sample answer to this (and I have seen this in some of the more solid HFY) is that you co-evolved with something that helps protect you. Earth is filled with trillions of symbiotic relationships, especially ones you don't see. Look at us. There are many scientists who theorize that we are incapable of long-term space travel because we need certain varieties of bacteria inside of us that are only extant on Earth. Symbiotic relationships provide a MASSIVE amount of material to work with and exploring the relationships between two species that are symbiotic in such a way that is utterly alien to humans (imagine, perhaps, an alien in which two species share one body, like some sort of unholy Banjo-Kazooie) would be an absolutely fascinating thing to write about. See, isn't that much cooler than ""an' den we nuked 'em, eh Cletus!"" &amp;nbsp; ""*But humans are all about violence! Just look at our media/action figures/comic books/religion/culture/wet dreams/sexual fantasies!*"" Yes, we are violent. But we are also a million other things. If anything, writing HFY that consists of what looks like Michael Bay directing a slasher movie in space does a massive disservice to our species. Think. Honestly, why are humans violent as opposed to any of the other incredible things we can be, in HFY? If your answer consists of some variant of 'b-but it's what people like to see...', you're probably wrong. People like to be entertained. That requires a certain amount of drama and violence, but ultimately we come here to be shown something that challenges us, makes us feel a full gamut of emotions, like a full course meal. Violence does not challenge us the same as if it is mixed in with other things, just like you wouldn't order a three course meal consisting of the same exact thing at a fancy restaurant. Writing is like food for the soul. You are touching people, dammit, and not in the uncomfortable way. Show us love, comfort, sadness, vulnerability, kindness, horror, pain, hatred, angst, conflict, resolution, growth, death! The big stuff! You are the weeaboo, we are the dakimakura. Caress us, and LOVINGLY, dammit. &amp;nbsp; ""*But what if my story relies on humans facing an overwhelming threat?*"" Sometimes that's good writing, but the majority of the time that's LAZY writing. Let me guess, your humans are facing some sort of generic \*insert bug alien hivemind here\*. This is actually something I really respect the Jverse for avoiding, because I can't stand reading ""yeah, well, humans were the only species that wasn't a hivemind, so we won, FUCK YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHRRRRRRRRRR"". To hell with that shit. Having one or even two hiveminds is fine, it honestly makes quite a bit of sense given my previous expectations of realism (hiveminds are very efficient), but having a universe of hiveminds is laziness, plain and simple. As a side note, another major problem with HFY is treating all aliens the exact same. ""All da eliuuuuuums didn't think da same ways as us, soes they were defeated. \*drops nuke*\"". Fuck off. The odds that we are anything close to truly unique and incompatible are so low they might as well not exist. Are there things we might do or have realized that are unique? Yes. But to say that aliens wouldn't understand basic logic or military tactics is dumb. &amp;nbsp; ""*B-But muh alien confederation/council/god emperor decreed...*"" Oh yeah, last thing. Stop writing like all aliens are cosmic space hippies who all live together in their little commune together and then humanity is the guy barging in with a loaded AK-47 and a bottle of vodka. The odds are that the galaxy has just as many infighting, backstabbing, self-serving, greedy, and utterly irredeemably violent aliens as it does humans. And if anything, that is a way cooler story."
144,vulnerability,HFY,[OC] Perfect Storm 3,106,3xxv64,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3xxv64/oc_perfect_storm_3/,2015-12-23 19:01:10,"The capital ship, simply named, had all the captains in the fleet on board at this moment. Assembled in formation like recruits on day one, all twenty thousand of them stood at attention in front of Zent, await his speech. Most of them knew what he was going to say to cap off his speech, and this was largely a formality to begin with, but it was still one he deemed necessary. Odds are this was to be one of the bloodiest battles on this side of the century. His boots tapping against the metal floor as he paced down the front row, he raised his voice a spoke. This is going to be bad. His tone was flat and blunt, echoing around the giant steel chamber. We are outgunned and technologically inferior, but not outnumbered. The Terrans have but one world which we are approaching right now, and in twelve hours time, we are to destroy it. He stopped for a moment to stare at them. Youve read the documentation, but I feel that it must be reminded that no ships are to be still for six minutes, as that is the lag time for the solar beam to fire. To be hit by it is immediate disintegration. Abuse the fact that the Terrans do not yet have short range FTL, and get in their face. At short range our laser weapons will be easy to aim, and will be on equal footing with theirs. He made his way up a catwalk and grabbed the railing firmly. They WILL try to snipe our ships. We cannot let that happen. If one in fifty of you drops a Terran vessel, this will be a clean victory. And if we cannot stop them, he took in a deep breath, they will spread and tear our empire apart. This problem we face now is exponential in nature. Every day we wait they get stronger, better adapted to space flight, more organized. You people above all else know our dependence on our subjects, if we lose them, we lose critical resources. If we lose those resources, well. Zent took a final breath before turning his back and starting to walk out. You, above all else, also know what will happen. Dismissed. In one unanimous turn to the right, they took a few marching steps then broke formation, heading to their pods and back to their ships. Zent was to be in the heart of the capital vessel- not as a captain, but overseer. Human weaponry seemed to cut through all ships alike, so the smaller ships would be hardest to hit and the ones on the front line. The capital ship would remain back. *** Isaac pushed his way though a crowd of reporters, security goons trailing behind him, trying to keep up. Chancellor sir, weve been told that there has been a fleet spotted- he pushed the woman to the side and continued up the stairs into the senate building. The whole situation was spiraling downhill fast. The media was on his ass, the government paralyzed with fear and indecision, the military was running around like a chicken with its head cut off and the populace was in panic. Word had got out that a huge fleet was being tracked moving towards earth and there was nothing that could be done to stop it. The chancellor burst through the chamber doors, causing the room to hush, everyone looking towards him. Isaac didnt even wait to get to his chair to start speaking, they were already listening. The intention is clear. They intend to swarm us. The military doesnt yet know with what, but it is bound to happen, and it will be with smaller vessels than we saw back on the planet we burned. At this point someone sitting down took the opportunity to cut in and ask a question. Does that have anything to do with our decision to attack them perhaps? Likely not. He responded, addressing the whole room. From what we were told on our brief stay this hostile empire is in fact an expansionist state, who would have attacked us regardless. He took a brief pause, sitting down in his chair and checking to make sure the microphone was on. But it isnt all bad news for two reasons. The room remained hushed. Firstly, we have reason to believe that this empire does not have any computers whatsoever. That sent murmurs to the room. Some researchers at Invalha University have informed me that our sun actually sends out enormous subspace interference. This is turn is why until we actually found the FTL drive and reverse engineered it, we were unable to develop the technology. We did however, have thousands to years to refine our computers and other things. Secondly- and perhaps because of this, they are scared. They see us as an immediate threat because we are. And perhaps thats because we have a chance. He was cut off by the blinking of a red light overtop of the cameras all around the room. They were about to go live. Ten seconds. A voice chirped over the intercom. Isaac gave his tie a final tug, sat up straight and faced the camera head on. *** All over the world, the face of one man was forced onto every active screen connected to the internet. A hidden override only to be used in dire emergencies in times of war and natural disaster, a backdoor that would normally garner massive protest was now used to get the message to nearly every person on earth. Citizens. It pains me to confirm that the rumors are true. Real time translation enabled each and every country to hear the message in their native language. There is indeed a hostile alien fleet approaching this planet as I speak, and while we are confident in our ability to fend them off, precautions must be taken. His face was replaced by a readout, tailored to each individual based off their age, profession, gender and social status. You are strongly advised to follow the directions you see before you now. Those who have been ordered to the rings, know that they will not be in orbit for long. This drew attention to the sky, where many looked upon perhaps more than one gargantuan ring, a superstructure in orbit home to over a billion of the population. Entirely self dependant and recently fitted with the newly discovered warp drive technology, they were lifeboats for the human race in times of natural disaster. They will be leaving a short distance away while the battle takes place due to their unique vulnerability in space combat. The less our military has to worry about the better. Those ordered to board the rings can do so from any of the space elevators; and bring minimal belongings, you will be accommodated. You have twelve hours. His face returned to the screen for a brief moment before the new app on everyones phone closed. Trying times are ahead. Good luck. The camera shut off, the broadcast ended and Isaac stood up. Alright everyone! To the space elevator. The surface is fucked and we need to leave. *** If there was anything to be said, the Terrans estimate was pretty damn close. Unfortunately, they havent quite accounted for a slight distortion which made the fleet seem further than they really were. But such things were planned for and the rings detached from the space elevators right on queue twelve hours later. Those onboard were either already residents of earths solution to overpopulation, or the best and the brightest of society hand chosen to survive. It was a cold and hard decision, who got to live and die, but it was one an AI unit could make in fractions of a second over and over and over. The dead weight had to be dropped, it was as simple as that. Many of the rich had found themselves grounded, unused to their finances having no clout, and political figures of little competence forgotten. Much of the lower class was to remain on earth too. Unfortunately uneducated and victims to substance abuse, space couldnt be spared when it was already so sparse. Had there been time to discuss it and knowledge of what was to come, many would call it an atrocity. Overhead was the real atrocity however. Within minutes of the rings making their jump, the first scout ships of the Lainian empire emerged from subspace to be viciously attacked and destroyed on the spot. The Terrans were on edge, scared of a threat to come. As it was, the military was thinly spread around the planet. They had no real idea where the attack was to originate form, so they felt an obligation to evenly spread themselves over the whole world. The Terran war machine may have been dumping all its resources into the construction of as many warships as possible over the past three years, but it wasnt nearly enough. Skeptical investors hadnt seen the need for such heavy armament and the governments of the world hadnt been keen to go completely autocratic over what was only a potential threat at the time. The end result was a navy spread thin, space boats filled with men and women praying to their deities that it wasnt as bad as they were led to believe. The first wave may have helped perpetrate this delusion as well; for it was only a small set of scout ships that came at the earth towards the north pole. This small wave also gave the Terran fleet some time to get some semblance of coordination as they swept up to crush this small force. To the Terrans, the Lainians were terribly disorganized. With no intership communications the only means of sending messages was a few simple flairs to signal retreat or whatnot. Even onboard the ships, giant sound tunnels were built for grunts to yell into so that orders were circulated all around the vessel. These were extremely limiting factors for battleships, and the first wave felt these handicaps hard. The number advantage was not yet with them and their weapons inferior. Their only saving grace was the mobility of each ship. Lainian vessels, accustomed to fighting in extremely close quarters were very fast even in normal space. Their ships used what could only be described as a gravity drive, and once the pilots actually realized it was possible, began to dodge human missiles. General William Theral, typically military based and lacking experience in the navy had found himself aboard the *Silent Aurora*, Earths first space bound dreadnought. Largely used as a command post, it was still heavily armed, and found itself at the front head of the fleet. Nobody expected the aliens to come from above. This cant be all of them sir. Some no-name spoke up from his seat. There just isnt enough. Weve been led to believe that this is a galactic empire, theyre for sure sending more than thirty ships. The controversial one-at-a-time strategy. He grumbled in a slightly sarcastic tone, causing the man to smirk. Odds are theyre trying to draw us away from other parts of the planet so they can attack it in force. Best bet is to fight this out slower and make sure the rest of Earth is safe. The nav-tech nodded. Alright, Ill relay that to the rest of - He was cut off when somebody from the front of the bridge yelled across the room. Theral Sir! More ships are surfacing right above us! Surfacing was the new slang for a vessel emerging from warp. William clapped the nav-tech on the shoulder. Retract that order. How big is the fleet? He called back. All four people seemed to have a hushed discussion briefly. It looks to be ten thousand strong Sir. Could be larger. All vessels are to rush to the north pole immediately! He roared, causing everyone to snap to attention. He watched dots appear on the hologram in the center of the room. This is going to be bad. Not as bad for the Terrans as it could have been though. The *Silent Auroras* opening salvo would go down as one of the biggest mistakes the Lainians would ever make in orbital combat. It had been Lainian custom to travel tightly clumped as to attempt to obfuscate the size of the fleet to traditional equipment. For Terran computers, the mathematical work to isolate every vessel had been trivial it was known where they would drop out two minutes in advance. That was two minutes of charge time for the rail guns aboard the *Silent Aurora*. It was only four rounds released, but they were accelerated to a significant fraction of the speed of light. Something traveling that fast and fired so close simply couldnt be reacted to, it was akin to dodging a bullet at point blank range. Lainian ships were used to explosives which could be destroyed as they flew towards the ships. In this type of combat, shrapnel was the most dangerous enemy. Shrapnel had a lot of speed but no to much overall energy; and their ships armor reflected this. To a railgun, their ships had no armor at all. It was as though the center of the front line, and the next eighty ships behind them just exploded. No warning, just a brief flash at the exact same moment from a ship in the distance, and a large chunk of the front of the Lainian fleet was gone amongst fire. Weve got a hit! The gunnery team called. Aboard the *Silent Aurora* the General had to conceal a smirk. If they thought the Terrans would go without a fight, they were very, very wrong. Charge the rail guns again! He roared, making an exaggerated hand movement to expand the hologram in the center of the room. It highlighted the carnage the first volley had created. We estimate just shy of a hundred ships destroyed! Someone called to him. William nodded to himself, watching as the enemy fleet broke formation. They knew what the weapon had done and were desperately trying to scatter as to avoid a second hit like that. Their breaking formation! Set the railguns to fifteen second charges and fire freely! Sir more are coming out of warp! Should we attempt another two-minute volley? The General watched as each ship coming out of warp briefly observed its surroundings and veered off in a random direction. No. They know to stay split up, we wont get another opportunity. Many of the ships however were heading and swerving towards the *Silent Aurora*. And prioritize the ones coming straight at us! I'd rather not die! *** The Capital Ship was the last to drop out of warp. Zent, standing at the front expected to see a large fleet in front of the cockpit. Yellow smoke! Someone roared, before his mind could even process the scene. Pull up! The ship shifted heavily as it quickly rose above the wreckage, revealing a grim scene. The captain of the ship had his face pressed against the toughened glass, trying to figure out what happened. Theyre only firing a volley every couple seconds. They used something else to destroy a lot as an initial wave. He said matter-of-factly. Keep us above the fight! He shouted. The captain looked again. Looks like that ship is about to be swarmed. Did it really do that much damage on its own? They must have had a bomb waiting Zent scanned the horizon of the planet. A few ships could be seen in the distance, but they were still far off and moving slowly. Their ships arent very fast out of warp. He observed. If we could tell the others it would be simple to just hit and run, bomb parts of the planet they cant cover. He watched as the gun aboard the large Terran vessel flashed and four of their ships blew up instantaneously. Scratch that, they appear to have the range advantage. The captain said dryly. Orders sir? Zent looked upon the battlefield again. Nothing we can do now really. The attack is in motion, its do or die. The captain nodded. Alright, Ill signal the bombers. Hopefully they can see that speed is their strength as well. At his word, an orange smoke signal was deployed and a large chunk of the ships broke off and dived pass the Terran vessel, straight towards the planet. And thats why we needed to attack now. Zent murmured. They can fight us up here, but if the ground dies, they lose- no matter the result in the sky. He squinted as the ships made another run at the Terran vessel, hitting it with a third volley of rockets and lasers. There were enough attackers that the chain guns couldnt keep up and rockets were connecting with the ship, finally prompted it to explode into two pieces. Zent nodded. What was that, two hundred for one? The captain whistled. A hell of a ratio. Lets hope the others arent that mean. "

I've probably been reading too much lately, so this is what comes from that. Rest assured, all of my free time is still dedicated to The Hero and my other works, but this was one of those things I immensely enjoyed writing. It might start off slow, but if you read it, hopefully it gives you that fuzzy HFY feeling. Enjoy! [Wiki Page](URL --- &amp;nbsp; Magic is usually pretty finicky. It had to be tightly controlled, either by force of will or through a constructed medium. It can be used for a great many things. You can build a house with the aid of magic. You can help someone stay alive on their ride to the hospital. You can probably cheat on a written test with magic, too. I wouldnt know, I didnt get to use it for that long, really. I messed up in the force of will department, and things went poorly for me. Of course, magic can be used for other things, too. Things like killing. Death. Destruction. Mayhem. Candy from babies, things like that. I thought I had a cynical worldview before the feds snatched me up, but standing in front of this grisly scene, and I knew I hadnt really even scratched the depths of cynicism. &amp;nbsp; If you took out the bodies, the blood, the torn clothing, it would have been a pleasant stroll through the park, aside from it being September in Arizona. Birds chirping, the sun was shining, a soft breeze brushed the leaves from side to side. Still one hundred degrees Fahrenheit, but the breeze helped. As it was, though, the park wasnt so pleasant. A thick, metallic taste hung in the air and coated your mouth as soon as you walked within twenty feet of the clearing. The scent would hit you next. Death was messy. Bowels are voided, things come spilling out of you Not pleasant. The cops next to me got to experience it firsthand, and their displeasure came spilling out of their mouths and onto the ground, along with plenty of retching noises. All that is just the peripherals, though. The meat - heh - of the issue was spread out across the path. And the bench beside it. And hung through the trees. Someone - something - had decided to start their holiday decorations early, using human bodies. They didnt like to put things to waste, either. Intestines were hung from branches like fucked-up streamers of flesh. Blood was used to smear sigils and runes onto the ground. Three male corpses sat together on the bench, fingers linked together, smiles on their faces. Apparently they had died in no small amount of bliss. &amp;nbsp; What do you think, H? The businesslike voice came from beside me. I looked down - most people were far shorter than my six-foot-ten bulk - and locked eyes with one of a few people who werent nervous around me. He stood at a standard six feet tall, built somewhat like a running back. He was getting up there in years, as evidenced by the smatterings of grey in his normally black hair. Pale blue eyes looked to mine, they darted back to the grisly scene, taking in small details here and there. This was Gabriel. Im fairly certain that wasnt his real name, but it suited him. He kept tabs on me, assisted me with tasks, and made sure I was tucked in at night - the works. &amp;nbsp; I pulled at the collar of my shirt, loosening the tie that hung around my neck like some silken noose. Fuck ties - too much vulnerability in a fight, and hard to get off in a short amount of time. Gabriel was probably something of a conjurer, since he was consistently able to find clothes in my size. No small feat, when youre shopping for a six-ten, four hundred and fifteen pound supersoldier. I wasnt always massive. Once I had my little magical accident, it tore whatever Gift I had away, and the government snatched me up, running their tests and whatnot. After deliberation, they thought I would be a wonderful first subject for augmentation, and I couldnt really refuse, sedated as I was. &amp;nbsp; Youre allowed to use my callsign, you know. If you wont use my real name, you should use that. My voice was deeper than I remembered. Then again, I hadnt spent much time being a fucking ogre. &amp;nbsp; Gabriels mouth twitched in what might have been a smile. Im not calling you by that ridiculous name. I cant believe they let you pick that. &amp;nbsp; I grinned from ear to ear and held up my hands, either of which could easily wrap around Gabriels head. Most of it, at least. What? I thought Hamfist would be a perfect callsign! &amp;nbsp; Whatever, Hammy. What do you think? &amp;nbsp; I let my hands fall to my sides and looked over the scene. Investigators were taking photos. A lot of them. But they knew their stuff, and nothing was being messed up. I looked to the smiles plastered across the dead faces, the entrails ripped out, and the distinct lack of genitalia. My legs unconsciously pressed together in response. Odds are, Succubi. Probably two, most likely more. Notice the fact that their family jewels are gone entirely. Succubi are the only ones that do that. The bliss kept the boys from protesting too much. And those symbols look vaguely demonic. &amp;nbsp; Gabriel nodded and pulled out a smartphone. I wish they let me have one of those. He tapped away at the screen for a few moments before tucking it away. I agree. Lets get you suited up and take them out. &amp;nbsp; Ten-four. &amp;nbsp; Another day on the job. At least I wasnt going to be looking at unemployment for a while. You see, the government knows there are creepy things out there, lurking on the edges of our awareness. Sometimes, they come out and feast or whatever it is they do. Thats where I come in. Im not sure if theyve made any more supersoldiers, so right now, its just me. But they made me with a clear purpose; curb stomp the supernatural bastards that liked to prey so much on humanity. &amp;nbsp; Business is booming, these days. --- &amp;nbsp; The last of the plates sealed across my rather muscular chest with a soft hiss. It must be the augmentation, because I dont remember working out all that often. I should probably change that. I was standing in a pose vaguely reminiscent of da Vincis *Vitruvian Man* while various techs puttered about, detaching cables here, scrawling some notes, and otherwise making sure my armor was up to spec. Wonderful stuff, really. Keeps all manners of horrors safely separated from my flesh by a few inches of steel, ceramic, some sort of gel stuff, and what was described as a kinetic redirection barrier. I think it just helps cushion the suit - and me - from being squished by velocity and/or falling out of buildings. There was a brief moment of claustrophobia as the tech behind me - who had to stand on a stool - lowered the helmet over my head. The moment was ruined when the bottom edge clipped my chin, and the tech muttered something under her breath. Should have let me put it on myself. The helmet finally clicked into place, and several locks engaged, sealing around my neck. Power thrummed through the armor, and my HUD lit up. Icons flashed over the screen, all in places I didnt remember leaving them. I was stuffed into the back of a cargo container, presumably attached to some sort of Mack truck. Thats usually how they wheeled my armor and support staff around, as it was the only thing big enough to hold all of my equipment. The helmet-fumbling tech stepped around in front of me, nose buried in her paperwork. Blonde, long legs, stereotypical TV-style hot nerd trope. You wont see me complaining, though. She glanced up at me with those deep blue eyes, and they flicked over certain points on the suit - joints, sensitive areas, things like that. I wouldnt mind her taking a look at my sensitive areas without the armor, thats for sure. &amp;nbsp; Doctor, were getting an increase in heart rate, another tech spoke from across the cramped container. &amp;nbsp; The doctor, who was apparently the same person that smacked me in the chin with my own helmet, pursed her lips and glanced back to her charts. A bit of claustrophobia, Mr. Salvatori? Her voice was smooth, liquid, and much more enticing than I thought it would be. &amp;nbsp; Nah, I replied, ever the master of diction, you hitting my chin with thirty pounds of metal snapped me out of that pretty quick. My voice rumbled out of the speakers on the armor, lending it a strange, mildly robotic filter. &amp;nbsp; The blonde doctor blushed for a moment, the recovered and pushed a few stray hairs out of her face. Mmh. Yes. My apologies. How does the armor fit? We changed a few things around, updated the software, made some improvements. &amp;nbsp; New software. That explained why everything on my HUD was in a different spot than where I preferred it. Everything looks good, I said, frantically rearranging the elements of my HUD back to some semblance of organization. Between the fact that I was still held still by several cables, and my face couldnt be seen through my faceplate, I managed to look calm and serene. Its that feeling when you had your parents over for dinner in your own house, and you go to take a dump after they leave, only to find that your mother rearranged your bathroom. Nothing is in the right spot, the toilet paper is facing the wrong way, and it feels uncomfortable. You dont fuck with a mans throne, porcelain or otherwise. The hot doctor gestured, and the other techs swarmed around me, disconnecting the last few cables. My arms and legs finally under my own control - with the powered assist from the armor - I shrugged my shoulders and clenched my fists. Feels more fluid, I rumbled. It was nice. The first version of the suit came about after I nearly got eviscerated by a ghoul. Well, it was ten total, but one in particular got a hand in my guts. That Mark I suit held up fantastically, but it felt like I was wearing a powered version of those suits children make out of leftover cardboard boxes. &amp;nbsp; The doctor - I really needed to get her name - nodded, not looking up from her papers. We figured that adding more mobility within the suit would only help your combat abilities, and allow for more versatility. Were keeping you hooked up to the monitors, since this is the first test run of the Mark II, she stood on her toes and stretched her arm to tap at my faceplate, revealing a fair bit of tanned midriff, and well be able to see everything you see through here. &amp;nbsp; Shit, theyd get to see me panic and flail. And how Id been frantically rearranging the icons. Lovely. Oh well. I should collect the rest of my gear. Id like to be in and out as fast as possible. &amp;nbsp; Im sure you would, Mr. Salvatori. She looked into my faceplate again before dropping her hands to her side. I quickly honed in on her nametag, stenciled onto her lab coat. I bumped up the magnification a few times and managed to make out the words Dr. Stirling. Several techs chuckled around me, and Dr. Stirling turned to face me. If you would like to know my name, Mr. Salvatori, you should simply ask. Its much more polite. &amp;nbsp; I felt my face flush, and I looked over to the side of the container which was covered in various screens. One of them was broadcasting my current viewpoint. The screen directly below that was being manipulated by one of the techs, and kept rewinding to the point where I zoomed in on Dr. Stirlings nametag. Fuck. Well, lets just call it even, since you botched putting a tin can on my head. I stomped over to the end of the container, where the screens on the walls gave way to racks upon racks of weapons. Hopefully my feigned anger would keep my embarrassment at bay. If it didnt, the impressive array of weapons certainly bolstered my attitude. Due to the supernatural nature of my work, Im able to get my armored paws on some pretty cutting-edge tech. Railguns, experimental lasers of some sort, and word had gotten around that some sort of hellfire-slinging monstrosity was in the works. It made me quite excited, to say the least. Despite all that, sometimes its best to stick with the classics. I snatched up an all-time favorite of mine: an AA-12 shotgun. Of course, the polymers had been replaced with metal in all the parts that would allow it. With the suit, weight mattered very little. A little part of my mind danced with glee at the fact that the techs had stocked this particular version with the large 32-shell drum mag, and I scooped up three more of those, letting the magnets on my belt clip them in place. When I walked over to the section containing handguns, I couldnt help but smile. Between my already hulking body and the extra layer of armor, most weapons had to be manufactured specifically for me, or I wouldnt even be able to get a finger within the trigger guard. I hefted an HK45, the model that Gabriel always preferred. Mine looked massive compared to his little pea shooter, despite the fact that they were functionally the same. I swear Im not compensating. Thus armed, I signaled to the guards standing beside the door. They nodded and pulled back several bolts, then shoved the door outwards with a short squeal of metal. Sunlight flooded into the container, and my faceplate darkened to compensate for the light. I lumbered over to the edge and dropped down to the concrete, and the back of the container gained a few inches in height as soon as I exited. The street around me was strangely empty, although I figured that was due to Gabriel and the higher-ups making sure no civilians would be harmed. Speaking of Gabriel, the man sauntered up beside me, calm and collected. He was wearing some sort of armor, but not powered like mine was. Think high-tech plate mail. A light sheen of sweat had broken on his brow. Impressive, considering it was still one hundred and six degrees of Arizona heat outside, and he was wearing black armor. I was suddenly thankful for the sealed environment my suit provided. [Continued](URL"
146,vulnerability,HFY,When Humanity Lost.,179,3pglwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3pglwk/when_humanity_lost/,2015-10-20 17:43:06,"I did not fight. I was terrorized back when I was a small child. Its amazing how creatively cruel children can be sometimes, and I always ended up as the butt of their jokes or the target of their viciousness. The ""new kid on the block"" was always an easy target for the school bullies to pick on. Oftentimes I'd arrive home with scraped knees and a bruised face. My mother worried and fussed over me, and after several calls with other agitated parents and exhausted school board faculty got her nowhere, she decided to help me in a more direct way. Lessons at the local dojo were cheap, and I instantly fell in love. The classes were exciting, and for once in my life, I felt like I belonged somewhere. The students and instructors were patient with me, and although I had nothing to compare it to, training there made me believe that I was capable of a crucial human quality. I thought that I could make friends. After several lessons over the summer, I returned back to the school, confident in myself like Id never been before. But I did not fight. I didnt take the beatings sitting down either. Id find clever and unscrupulous ways to ditch and trip up my aggressors. Once or twice I would confuse them into a stupor, and rarely we all left in a good mood with no punches thrown after we shared a hearty laugh at my expense. I didnt care. For once, I felt like I was winning fights that never started. I began to forget the pain of a physical beating, and started to experience a sharper pain, the kind that can only be caused by friendship. Its a tearing and real pain that digs deeper than any doctors scalpel can reach. Its a fierce and secretive pain that roots itself in your brain and heart where no psychologist can pry it free. Its a strong and enduring pain that hurts a thousand times worse than any injury your worst enemy can offer. And it felt glorious. Each new friend became a hard-earned victory, and after months of exploring each and every aspect of our friendships, my understanding of the world started to grow. In truth, after I learned about each of them, I realized that they werent my enemies because they possessed cruel or evil natures, but were only enemies of circumstance. I came to believe that of every person I met, since all of their stories were effectively the same. Deep down, I always uncovered a caring person, even if that person couldnt see it in themselves. Which is why, when They came, I did not fight. Ships loomed out of the Black, tearing rifts in the void and lighting the sky so bright that the concept of night was forgotten in an instant. With great monoliths of destructive power They fired on us and began the most savage conflict humanity has, and probably ever will know. Truthfully,it was more than a simple battle or a war. Those words can be put into a sense of scale. Realistically, we were fighting the apocalypse. No longer were people fighting over monetary gains, for land and country, for pride or love. We werent even fighting because of how morally corrupt and wrong They were, and how our side was clearly in the right. We were fighting for our very survival. The only way to ever totally unite the seemingly chaotic and self-destructive human race was to pose a threat so large that all other conflicts became trivialized in its shadow to the point of nothingness. So we came together to fight our largest and only foe. And when we fought, we did not win. Our scientists had managed to quickly reverse engineer Their alien technology, and soon after the fighting began, They noticed that They had Their own weapons firing against them. Their assault began to slow. Then we began to push back. We studied every aspect of Their existence to detect and exploit each precious vulnerability uncovered. They apparently burned easily, so we started carpet bombing Them with napalm, Greek Fire, white phosphorous, and a thousand deadlier concoctions, each more terrifying than the last. Their species was a reverent one whose society revolved around the concept of resurrection and reincarnation, so we bound Their dead to our war-machines and Earth, mocking their core concepts with the most terrible of their sins. Theirs was a race that had never been introduced to the concepts of terror. And humanity in all its great fear was truly terrifying. We pushed the invaders all the way off of Earth. We pushed Them all the way out of the solar system. We pushed them back to their own Homeworld. Our fear had sent us far. When the first fleet arrived on their planet, the scouting parties were shocked. Reports came flooding back to command of a Grave World.Their species viewed invasion and assimilation, we discovered later, not as an act of aggression, but of something similar to acceptance. They had judged us and believed us to be worthy of joining them, willingly or no. With panic driving Their rationality away, rather than formulate a surrender with the humans, They decided to self-terminate. Humanity forced an entire species to commit mass-suicide out of raw, pure primal terror. When I came back to school after the summer I spent at my dojo, I never fought back against my bullies. Not because I didnt think that I couldnt win, but rather because I knew that by doing so, I would forever lose my chance at building a friendship with my enemy. When humanity fought, they did not win. Everyone else lost. And so humanity lost as well. "
147,vulnerability,HFY,Predator and Prey II,167,3klr2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3klr2k/predator_and_prey_ii/,2015-09-12 09:07:32," Kheljin was the runt of the litter. Being a male, he was diminutive compared to his sisters. It didnt help that his bloodline was mocked by the rest of the pack for producing small offspring, and his mere existence was seen as an affront to the Eternal Mother. Cubs as small as himself were usually culled, and his mother was ostracized for allowing him to live. However, they were a bloodline of fighters, and their family traversed faster than the rest of the pack in order to claim First Blood on Hunts. Kheljin and his two sisters had proudly claimed first blood on the past two Hunts, and he would be glad to be the first on this planet as well. The larger the target they brought down, he reasoned, the less of a disgrace he would be! It was for this reason that Kheljin wanted to target a Human military outpost in the frigid wastes of their northernmost geographic pole. Kheljin and his sisters, Joltreth and Ktas, landed their pod discretely. Far enough not to draw attention from the outpost, but close enough to draw First Blood and get back before they felt the effects of the cold. The Joltulra were a resilient species, but the temperature here was inhospitable even to them. Kheljins fur bristled against the frigid air, and he was forced to squint as he stepped out of the ship while his eyes adjusted to the astoundingly bright surroundings. He took a moment to mentally prepare himself for the hunt, and prayed to the Eternal Mother for worthy prey. Do not waste your breath on prayer, Kheljin. The strong eat, that is all you need to know. Joltreth roughly shoved him aside, closely followed by Ktas. He took the abuse silently; it was true, after all. They never could keep all of their own meat long enough to load into their ship, as it was constantly taken from them by larger and stronger bloodlines. They hadnt eaten for five cycles now, and the ache in his stomach was a constant reminder of this. Sending a silent prayer to the Eternal Mother, Kheljin followed his sisters with determination in each step. It wasnt long before they came across a most unusual creature. Neither Kheljin nor his sister had felt heat radiating from it, and it was covered in white fur, easily hiding it against the snow. The only distinctions between the creature and the surrounding snow was two black eyes and a black nose on its furry face. The thing was playing on the side of a snow bank, oblivious to the three aliens close by. Joltreth, being the biggest, held her composure. It would not do to sate their appetites on the meat of something so weak. What they needed was prey that could fight... something to put a fire in their blood! Kheljin followed suite. It was not his place to question authority. Ktas, on the other hand, grew tense, and crouched close to the ground. A small taste. Thats all, she turned and said in response to Joltreths disapproving stare, before slinking forwards. Her target, finally taking notice of their presence, had stopped playing, and began climbing the snow bank, letting out pitiful cries. Ktas darted forwards, and clamped her powerful jaws around the neck of the little white prey. It let out a slightly louder cry for mercy before being silenced. Blood splattered against the snow, and Ktas savoured the warm blood and fat. She turned back towards Joltreth and Kheljin with a crimson grin. A roar pierced the tranquility of the frozen wastes. Turning to its source, the Joltulra saw a massive creature standing atop the snow bank, silhouetted against the blinding sun. Before Ktas had time to react, the monster atop the hill trampled down the hill, plowing through her. Kheljin could hear bones cracking and sinew tearing as the beast tore her limb from limb. Joltreth rushed forwards to help, but the monster had mutilated Ktas into an unrecognizable pulp before she was even in striking distance. White fur, four limbs, eyes as black as hate itself... Kheljin stood stock still in shock as he realized that Ktas prey was only an infant. This was the mother. Joltreth swung a clawed hand at the monster, opening four red streaks against its white fur, and revealing black skin beneath. The white demon stood on her hind legs, bellowing a cry of anguish....no, it was a cry of anger! Joltreth lunged forwards, attempting to topple the monster onto its back and exploit the vulnerability of its soft belly, but it was too strong. A mighty swipe of its gargantuan paw sent Joltreth crashing to the side, collapsing into the snow with several broken ribs piercing through her own skin. His sister was bleeding heavily, and Kheljin could do nothing but watch. He cursed himself for being such a coward. The angry mother fell back onto all fours before approaching Joltreth. It placed a heavy limb on her, collapsing her battered rib cage, and took her neck in its powerful jaws. With one mighty motion, it tore her head from her body, before dropping it into the cardinal snow. The mother turned to Kheljin. Kheljin cried a roar of despair as he clumsily tried to draw his plasma weapon from its sheath. The pale monster tackled into his feeble body, forcing him into the snow and easily plunging its massive claws deep into his flesh. As it opened its mouth full of incisors to deliver a painful death, Kheljin couldnt help but realizing one thing. This monster was no herbivorous mother eliminating a threat to the heard. It was a predator, avenging the death of its young. Crushed beneath the creatures massive body, Kheljin was helpless to fight back. His world went black shortly after the monster crushed his neck between its powerful teeth. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Rokul'ja had just come of age. She was nearly full grown, and had participated in all the necessary rites of passage. Well, all but one. It is customary in Joltulra culture for someone to participate in a Hunt without aid from the main pack before being recognized as an adult. However, that is not to say that they do not get help on their first Hunt. Siblings that survive to adulthood would often journey onto their first hunt together, learning to work as a team. Rokul'ja, however, was not from some lowly bloodline. Hers was a vicious one, and unlike the other families, practiced a taboo ritual in which young siblings would fight and cannibalize one another before their mottled fur faded to black. Only the strongest survived, and so the strength of their line was assured. Rokul'ja and her sister, Jakta, were said to be born embracing one another. Growing up, they had been an inseparable and unstoppable duo. Fighting with the other cubs was always one sided, with Rokul'ja and Jakta claiming victory through brute force and sheer ferocity. They were unstoppable, the perfect killing machines. Today was the day that they would hunt by themselves, and they had abandoned their sisters and brothers to search for a quarry of their own; even in their own family, their bloodthirstiness was uncommon, and a sight to behold. It had become common knowledge to stay out from between the two of them and whatever it was that they were after. The smell of the sea assaulted Rokul'jas nostrils. The putrid scent of salt and decay filled the humid air, but even such an overwhelming smell could not discourage her. Jakta stalked beside her, alert for any sign of their target; they had been on the trail of an entire family of Humans for several days now, and they knew they were close to their mark. It wasnt difficult to follow them, as the Humans had passed in a large and ungainly vehicle on a dirt road. Far away from population centres, she knew that they only had to follow the same path. It was only a matter of time now. Rokul'ja could almost taste it, though admittedly, she had no idea what they would taste like. They quickened their pace as the sun began to set. The two apex predators came across an unusual sight as they exited the dense forest. A small stretch of sand lay before them, and beyond that, an expanse of water as far as the eye could see! Rokul'ja couldnt help but shiver at the grandeur of it. The setting sun seemed to set the entire ocean and sky ablaze with vivid colors, as though the very water itself was on fire. The Joltulra werent unfamiliar with bodies of water, and were actually incredible swimmers, but they had never seen anything like this. Entering the vicinity of the planet, they had seen the vast expanses of water, but the view from a tiny window on a spacecraft hurtling towards the blue ball in the void was nothing compared to this. The sisters paused their hunt for mere moments before resuming their search. Unnoticed before, small buildings dotted the beach at regular intervals. Not far was the only building emitting light through the windows, and not far from that, the vehicle had been parked, and what looked like a small watercraft nearby. The building itself was nothing more than a small dwelling. Large windows provided a view of the ocean, and the pearly white walls and the tiled roof provided comfort against the elements, despite the calm waters. However, they would not protect the inhabitants from the two perfect killers. Jakta and Rokul'ja shared a feral grin before slinking forwards. Approaching the building, Rokul'ja couldnt help but hearing snippets of Human conversation from within. Dad, you really shouldnt. a female voice pleaded. You remember what the doctor said. The treatment is pointless if youre just going to continue old habits A raspy voice responded. Susan, dear, I am sixty nine years old. I drove all this way with three screaming children and your good for nothin husband the entire way here. I think Im entitled to enjoy *one* cigarette. followed by an exasperated sigh, a coughing fit, and a slamming door. Of course, Rokul'ja couldnt understand a word of it. The Joltulra had no use for learning other languages; the screaming was all the same. Looking for an entrance, the sisters split up to circle the building in opposite directions. A sudden shout broke the silence, and Rokul'ja caught sight of her sister wrestling a decrepit old Human to the ground. She casually crushed its neck under a clawed hand before disemboweling the elderly Human with her mouth. It squirmed for seconds more before dying in a growing puddle of its own blood. Shouts and cries were emitted from the hut, and more lights began emanating from within. Jakta spat. The blood is foul. This one tastes like sickness and poison. The two killers were suddenly illuminated, and Rokul'ja looked upwards to the silhouette of a shocked family standing in a doorway of light. Jakta rose from her foul appetizer to survey the main course. Standing between the Humans and their vehicle, Rokul'ja and Jakta slowly approached the family. A lone figure stepped out of the doorway and into the rectangle of light cast from within, pushing the others behind itself before raising its arms and clenching its hands into fists. It assumed a staggered stance. Sparing a glance backwards towards the small watercraft and, presumably, its family, it calmly spoke to the others. Susan, get the kids in the boat. Dammit, Bill, dont be the hero! Youve seen the news, those are the Legion! a voice replied, desperation transcending language barriers, and reaching Rokul'jas ears. Susan, please! Just... just for once, let me help. the lone figure responded, tears streaming from his eyes. A trio of sobbing young Humans were quickly led away by the female. Jakta leapt at the lone man as Rokul'ja calmly moved towards the four fleeing Humans. A dull thud shattered Rokul'jas sense of accomplishment as she saw the lone figure move aside and smash its fist into the jaw of Jakta. Her sister fell into a heap, quickly stood back up only to be met with another strike to the face. She collapsed and didnt rise up again. Rokul'ja could smell Joltulra blood as it poured freely from her sister's mouth, and paused her pursuit to face this new challenge. The sun had set completely, and figure stood alone in the rectangle of light, turning to face her. There was something almost *predatory* about the way he looked at her. She moved forward slowly, confident in her superior ability to make short work of this obstacle. Rokul'ja broke into a sprint at the last moment, rearing up to her full height before delivering a lethal slash with her clawed hand. He was too fast. Stepping within the arc, he struck her in the ribs several times. She felt something crack. Another slash upwards caught him by surprise, and he fell onto his back in pain and shock, barely preserving his own life. The Human quickly sprang back to his feet. His garment was torn to shreds, and crimson blood began pouring down his chest, soaking the tattered remnants of his shirt. Not seeming to care, the Human began moving towards her, out of the rectangle of light and into the darkness of night. Rokul'ja happily slunk into the shadows, silently mocking the Humans decision to enter the dark. The Joltulra were living nightmares, and the shadows were their element. She glanced at her sisters form as it begun to stir. The Human took advantage of her momentary distraction, and broke into a run, driving a fist right to Rokul'jas eye, before driving the both of them into the sand. In a daze, she couldnt resist as the Human positioned itself to sit on her torso, delivering a flurry of punches straight to her head and neck area. She tried to raise her arms to defend herself, but the Human had them pinned to her sides with its legs. Just as she was beginning to succumb to her injuries, her sister rose up behind the Human. She pounced, enveloping its neck in her powerful jaws. A painful crunch marked her death dealing bite to their troublesome prey as it went limp in her mouth. The the sisters turned towards the final four, who had taken the opportunity to set their craft in the water. The adult was using a plastic tool to paddle them forwards at a slow pace. Hurt, but not perturbed, the two waded into the water. The water was cold. Rokul'ja allowed herself to be enveloped by it, paying no heed to her swelling eye. Jakta grimaced as the salty water washed away her blood. The Joltulra homeworld had lakes and rivers, and their people were adept swimmers, using the rivers to travel from one lake to another. Their webbed feet propelled them through the water, but did not prove a hinderance when hunting on land. Rokul'ja couldnt help but feel amused; these Humans had thought the water was their salvation, when in reality it would be the death of them. The sisters redoubled their efforts, quickly gaining on the fleeing family. Rokul'ja burst from the water and scrambled into the boat, nearly capsizing the small craft. Jakta clinged to the side, apprehensive about tipping it over and possibly having their prey sink to the bottom; the Joltulra were adept swimmers, but shallow waters had never required much in the way of holding their breath. Nearly blind in the darkness, and confined to their boat, the Humans were made short work of. Piercing screams were silenced, quickly swallowed up by the night. The sound of water lapped the sides of the boat. The wooden craft now held the dead bodies of four Humans, as well as two very satisfied Joltulra. Rokul'ja lounged at the wide end of the boat, casually chewing on a Human foot. Possibly the tastiest part of this new prey, though she lamented that there were too many bones. Jakta lay at the other end, both feet in the water to gently paddle them and their haul of meat to the shore. For once in her short life, Rokul'ja felt at peace. Maybe it was the sweet flesh of their new prey filling her belly. Maybe it was the gentle sound of the waves. She nearly fell asleep in that boat. A sudden jolt shook her from her stupor, forcing her into full consciousness once more. Turning to Jakta for at their sudden intrusion, Rokul'ja caught only a glimpse of her sister, clinging for dear life against the side of the boat. Jaktas face was contorted in pain, fear burning in her gaze. Before she could so much as let out a cry for help, another bump rattled the craft, and she was pulled under the dark waves. The boat rocked violently, knocking a decapitated Human into the black water. A small triangle appeared against the waves before the body was violently pulled underneath as well. Rushing the the side of the boat, Rokul'ja searched for any sign of her sister. She let out a whimper. Something strange and unfamiliar gripped at her senses. A concept that the Joltulra did not usually encounter. Pure terror held her heart in a vice. The watercraft gave another shudder as another fin rose from the darkness below. Her eyesight could not pierce the veil of darkness of the water, and she shuddered to imagine what foul monster was attached to that fin. All that she could see was a long distorted shape, with no discernable limbs. With no way to move the craft at a faster pace, Rokul'ja resigned herself to try to swim to shore. The Joltulra were adept swimmers, after all. Praying to the Eternal Mother, she dove into the water, willing to leave the meat in favor for her life. However, whichever gods that were listening to her prayer did not pay heed. Something much older was at work here. Something that was so perfect in form and function that it had remained largely unchanged for hundreds of millions of years. Who were they to stand in its way? Rokul'jas desperate flailing was interrupted in a waterfall of pain as a giant set of jaws took a hold of her left leg, thrashing and pulling her under the waves before tearing a huge chunk of flesh free, rendering her leg useless. The moon had risen completely in the sky, casting a ghastly pale light on her meek form as the water around her turned crimson with Joltulra blood. Rokul'ja tried to keep moving, using her hands and good leg to keep swimming. Another monster rose from the murky depths, engulfing most of her ribcage between razor sharp teeth, crushing the air from her lungs and dragging her underneath once more. Gasping for breath but getting nothing but water and blood, Rokul'ja glanced back to look her killer in the eye. A final gesture, that she had been outdone by a stronger predator, as though to respect its accomplishment and accept her death. Its skin was a rough texture, dark grey on the top and nearly white on its belly. The predator consisted of sharp angles. A single fin rose from its back, and its tale consisted entirely of a fin of its own. Two triangular fins jutted from its sides. It was streamlined, as though carved by the water currents themselves. Its angular body was nothing compared to what she could see of its mouth. Its immense jaws were lined with hundreds of teeth, each one a jagged triangle of pearly white, most of which were embedded deep within the soft tissue and bones of her dying body. However, what struck her as the most shocking were its eyes. It did not have the predatory glint of another intelligent hunter. It wasnt like looking at another Joltulra. They were more like the glazed gaze of a simple herbivore going through the motions of eating vegetation. Its eyes were dead eyes. Whatever this *thing* was, it had perfected killing down to all but sheer instinct, something that it could accomplish effortlessly. She wasnt being killed as a predator, and she wasnt even being treated like prey. Inflicting her death came as casually to this living nightmare as grazing would to a herbivore. Rokul'ja despaired as her vision finally began to go dark, and her pain faded away. Her oxygen deprived brain dreamt of the deep watery hell of this planet, and her final thoughts were nought but nightmare infested oceans. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Draoj fled through the dense undergrowth. Moist soil and bits of vegetation were kicked into the air as he darted through the dark, dodging between trees. His muscles ached, and his chest ached as his cardiovascular system threatened to fail him. He was dizzy from the exhaustion and lack of water, and his own vomit stained the fur on his chest and lining his mouth. He felt like he would vomit again. The Joltulra were not used to being hunted. His pack had arrived many days ago; how many, he could not say. He was one of the first packs to land on their new Hunting grounds, but his team had a special mission. When the Joltulra had received word of this place from the Ishkiltohn, they could hardly believe their ears. The Ishkiltohn offered coordinates in exchange for peace between the two species. The cowards were surely lying through their beaks, trying to save their own skins. Who would believe a tall tale of a solar system overpopulated with a plump and defenseless species? It was inconceivable. However, the Ishkiltohn were persuasive. They provided proof of the massive crowds and immense population centers... Hundreds of billions of units of meat. Humans they called themselves. Such a numerous population was completely unheard of, the the Ishkiltohn wove stories of flesh so succulent that it practically sloughed off their bones. They hadnt even achieved light speed, and the alien diplomat claimed that their weapons were sorely outdated. With a prey like that, the Legion would never go hungry again! There were even rumors among the ranks that the Elders would claim the place as the new home of the Legion. No more traveling, no more rotting flesh, and no more cryosleep between planets was what the deal offered them. It was an easy decision to make. Draoj was one of the elite few tasked with setting up a base of operations for the Legion. His team was to locate a secluded place, far away from Human population centers, close to what their old habitat, and covertly secure the area until more Joltulra arrived to begin construction. After all, the Joltulra didnt fancy themselves as much of a space faring race. They longed for the canopy of trees, fresh water rivers, and the warmth of sun warming them between Hunts. After much searching, his team had located one such place. A large expanse of jungle shined like an emerald at them in space, and a murky river snaked its way through, more than enough for the Legions simple purposes. A few cycles of monitoring to assure its seclusion for their covert mission showed that the Humans in the surrounding cities and villages seemed to avoid the jungle, even going so far as to employ other Humans to prevent possible intrusions. Perhaps it was a holy ground? Maybe they had an agreement with their predators, and maintained the area in exchange for their safety. Draoj did not care even if there were predators down there. He knew that he was more than a match for anything this planet could offer. Draoj was a Centurion, one of only one hundred elite Joltulra. Very few males were admitted, and his title was the pride of his bloodline. Mostly females were admitted, due to their inherent strength and size, but the males who could call themselves Centurions enjoyed Alpha status and the attentions and affections of any lesser females they desired. The trials to even qualify to join were deadly. They had to prove their prowess on the battlefield, and were often seen leading military packs to battle, rather than joining the rest of the Joltulra in simply killing and collecting civilian aliens. They tasked candidates with fighting foe after foe for hours on end, completing obstacle courses that stretched kilometers within the allotted time, and even had him starved and interrogated to prove his will overpowered his hunger. The tasks provided no guarantee of entry, however. All they did was give him a chance to face a full Centurion in tooth and claw combat to the death. This, in itself, was a sort of test. He would chose the weakest Centurion and join easily, forever viewed and targeted as a weakling himself. Or he would chose among the strongest of the pack and risk dying a painful death to assert himself as potential Alpha material. He walked out of the arena as a Centurion, leaving behind four corpses and establishing himself as an Alpha among Alphas. Unsurprisingly, no one was foolish enough to challenge his title. When Draoj was given this assignment, he thought it was a bad idea. He considered every hunt a test of his mettle, and believed that these soft bipeds would in turn make the Joltulra soft. However, he could see the wisdom in the Elders words. They were old and frail, but their wisdom and strategism was all that had kept the Joltulra alive and well as generation replaced generation on their journey through the cosmos. This would be the new homeworld of the Joltulra. Despite their wisdom, Draoj was right, to a certain degree. The decision to establish a base was a bad one, he was quick to realize. What was supposed to be a covert mission had quickly gone sour. One hundred Joltulra entered that jungle, each and every single one a fully realized Centurion, veterans of countless Hunts and battle tested in the fires of war. Draoj was now the last. Over the past seasons, he had witnessed his comrades picked off one by one, slowly decimating the pack. Despite the obvious killing, however, none of the Joltulra had seen the murderer and lived to tell about it. Draoj collapsed to the ground for a moment, shuddering as his body tried to vomit again, but his empty stomach offered nothing but the taste of bile. The moonlight filtered through the leaves and bathed him in a pale white light. He stood up and kept running. Their first night in the jungle was like magic. All of them felt it. This was.... this was their home. They could feel it in their bones, a sort of primal beckoning. None of the Joltulra in his company, including himself, had ever seen their homeworld. They were born on those ships or on occupied planets, and knew nothing of home except what they could glean off of the adults conversation. Being that their entire diet consisted of conquered races, they could not spare the fuel nor the time to visit their cradle world either. A sense of nostalgia for a place they had never seen overtook the battle scarred Centurions, and they slept beneath unfamiliar constellations that night. The next morning, they went about their task. They were to locate key resources, and clear areas for the incoming construction crews. Others were tasked with patrolling the surrounding jungle in search of a temporary food source to sustain them until they were granted permission to begin raiding the nearby human settlements. The patrols were also tasked with notifying the pack of nearby Human activity. This was a covert mission, after all. However, not all of the patrolling Centurions returned, and those that did reported other predators inhabiting the jungle. They spoke of swarms of fish, stripping all of the flesh from the bones of any Joltulra that tried to swim in the water. Those who deigned to walk along the shore risked being attacked and pulled beneath the water by massive serpents, and one even claimed to have witnessed a log come to life and drag a Centurion beneath. One of the bigger females came back dragging a water serpent that had tried to wrap itself around her. A bruised body and several broken ribs were the price she paid to slay it. Draoj was ecstatic at the time. He was right about the humans leaving this area alone for the predators of their world. What further delighted him was that he had gotten the challenge that he wanted. It had rained heavily that day, and the night that followed was damp and uncomfortable. They slept outside once again, but regretted it in the morning. Come sun up, the majority of them were covered in itchy and inflamed insect bites. Could it be? They wondered. Even the insects here had a taste for blood? They jested at the thought, and one of the devout followers of the Eternal Mother claimed it was a sign that they were to claim this planet as queens and kings of the food chain! They were cheering at the idea that the Eternal Mother had set this planet aside especially for them... their revels were cut short when they realized that another Joltulra was missing from their company. Jretthel, the most formidable of the Centurions, after Draoj, had gone missing in the middle of the night. Draoj dismissed her disappearance to her hot headedness. She must have woken up in the middle of the night due to the bugs, and gone off to fight them, he jabbed. Nervous agreement spread among the other Centurions, but they went about their business that day, making sure to keep their distance from the dangerous waters. Draoj had explained that once the main pack arrived, they would have more than enough Legionnaires to secure the area and exterminate whatever was lurking within the murky river, but that it was to be avoided in the time being. That day saw just as many deaths as the day previous, if not more. The serpents lurking the water occupied the trees as well, and they discovered one swallowing a Joltulra corpse whole. They killed it, but retrieved nothing but the broken body of their fallen pack mate. One Joltulra had ran back to camp, shaken up and sputtering a story about a spotted creature making short work of another Centurion, before climbing a tree with the Joltulra still dangling from its mouth. As the sun began to set, the disheartened Centurions ate a meager meal of the water serpent that had been retrieved the day prior. Food was not as plentiful here as they thought. Jretthel did not return that evening. They set up sentry shifts that night, and none of them slept easily. Draoj swore he would see the death of every other predator on this planet, even if it meant he had to kill each one himself. The following morning quickly disillusioned him. The Joltulra who were to take first watch were no longer among their pack. Several Centurions had gone missing as well. They were convinced that something was stalking them, killing and devouring the missing pack mates in the night. Draoj quickly quieted their assumptions, loudly proclaiming that no Joltulra would die without a fight and making note that there were no signs of a struggle. They probably ran off to fornicate, try and start a pack of their own. he spoke loudly for all to hear. And if I catch any of these traitors, I will personally purge their bloodline from the pack! It was then that one Joltulra exited the ship in a panic, drawing all attention to herself. The ships been sabotaged! she exclaimed, quickly denouncing Draojs theory. Draoj shoved his way past the other Centurions and onto their ship. Panels had been pried from the walls and floor, revealing a tangled mess of cords. Anger welling up within him as he moved further into the ship, revealing more damage to the ship. Nearing the fuel tanks, he nearly slipped and fell, but caught himself by digging a clawed hand into a loose wall panel. Whatever had sabotaged this place had cut the specialized tubes feeding into the engine. The slick blue fuel that served as the lifeblood for their only transport was spilling all over the floor, seeping past a missing panel and saturating the dead components within. The other Centurions were quickly becoming agitated. Until then, the only predators they had encountered were the simple minded reptiles. Could it be? one wondered aloud. Could the Humans have intelligent predators? Another wailed in despair. Theyre going to kill us! Theyve trapped us here with them! His cowardly cries were silenced quickly as a fellow Centurion struck him across the face with a clawed hand. Coward! We will find whatever did this... and we will show them that the Humans have a new predator. she growled over his whimpers. Draoj bared his teeth in a menacing grin. All theyve done is give us no choice but to wipe them out! he announced to the other Centurions. For all his bravado, Draoj was helpless to stop the killings. They began sleeping in the dead hull of their ship, and every morning woke up with missing sentries. No signs of struggle, not even the mess usually associated with a kill. They halted their duties and went on the prowl every day, looking for a cave or lair where they might finally face the other predators. They thoroughly surveyed the entire area, but could not even find a trace of their fallen conrads. Not wanting to go too far from their ship for fear of being caught out after dark, they were limited to the vicinity of their steel refuge. More like a steel coffin, Draoj mused silently to himself. They had tried and failed to contact the Joltulra in orbit to their plight; with no power they were absolutely secluded from the main pack. Their confidence quickly diminished as their numbers slowly dwindled, every few nights waking up to realize that a few more among them had been taken. Even Draoj began finding it difficult to sleep at night. He would never admit it to the others, but it was as though a seed of fear had been planted in his chest, and tendrils of terror threatened to burst from between his ribs at any second. Draoj went to sleep the previous night nestled with three other Joltulra. It had been raining for four cycles now, and they were beginning to feel the chill in the air. He woke up in the middle of the night when he felt the shifting of a warm body beside him. It slid away, and he could hear brushing of fur being dragged across steel. Suspecting the worst, he opened one eye slightly to see the lifeless form of a Centurion sliding through the dark passage of their ship, a shadowy figure struggling to pull the mass. Eager to ambush the predator that had been causing them so much pain and fear, he quickly turned to the other two Joltulra to have them help him end their enemy. However, he could immediately tell something was wrong. Their bodies were warm, but he couldnt see the gentle rise and fall of their form... Growing more and more agitated, he tried to shake them awake violently. He ended up flipping one over onto her back. Her head lolled to the side, and her limp tongue dangled from between her jaws. A corpse. Draoj could feel the fear threatening to take over... he stood up quickly, then turned to the exit and fled before whatever was hunting them realized it had left one alive. Draoj had been running ever since, trying to put as much distance between himself and that great metal tomb as possible. He would periodically stop to try and drink or find something to eat. Anything to eat, even something dead and rotting. It had been several nights since he had last had a meal. However, every time he paused, it was not long before the scent of the dead Joltulra caught up with him, and he knew the predator was near. He elected to leave the jungle, no matter what. He knew it was surrounded by human settlements, if he could just make it to one... they would capture him and keep him safe from the predator! Then the main force would come and rescue him. Yes, this was a good plan, he thought to himself. Truth was, it was nothing but the fevered musings of a half starved Centurion with next to nothing to hope for. Deep down, he knew this was true. By mid day, he found it too difficult to run. The jungle was like a labyrinth, and he zig zagged between the trees with nothing to direct him but the scent of the dead Centurions. He was so thirsty... it had stopped raining as the sun came up, and he did not know how to make it back to the river. His parched throat was a constant reminder that he had been wrong. This place was no home of his. It was a living, breathing hell, where even the insects feasted on Joltulra blood. He moved slowly, trying to conserve his energy. He swaggered through the forest, dizzy from the hunger and lack of sleep. However, as evening began to arrive, the ever encroaching stench of the deceased Joltulra seeped through the jungle becoming stronger, seeming to saturate the very air with the feeling of his own mortality. He began running again. Draoj stumbled again, his legs giving out. He let out a whimper, and prayed to the Eternal Mother for mercy. All was hopeless, he would never find the Human settlements, let alone any Legion aid. He glanced upwards and it was as though his prayers had been answered. Or maybe he was beginning to hallucinate due to the exhaustion. Through the trees, not far, he could see the flickering of flames, and the sound of alien voices. Humans! He knew they were naught but prey, but took comfort that they may be his salvation from whatever was hunting him through the dark jungle. He forced himself to stand and walk forwards. The scent of dead Centurions was quickly becoming overwhelming, and he could now hear their bodies being dragged through the dense underbrush. He knew he would have to present himself as non-threatening if the Humans were to help him. He willed his hackles to lower, and he wiped the vomit and spittle from his fur as best he could. The weary Joltulra stumbled and tripped through the dark jungle and into to light of a fire, much to the surprise of the Humans sitting around it. They were hardly clothed, if at all, and the only structure there was a tent. Women and children mostly, they had been chattering in some foreign tongue, eating strips of something that they were roasting on the open flames. Draoj quickly forgot his meekness as he saw what lay before him. The skulls of the Joltulra lay strewn about, and their faces seemed to have been peeled off and treated to resemble the original heads, though much smaller. They looked as though they were treated and dried, resembling flesh that had been left in the sun for too long. Their eyes and mouths were sewn shut, and Draoj could even recognize a few of them. Hate welled up within him. The Humans must have been trading for the bodies of the Centurions! Drawing himself up to his full height, Draoj decided then and there to kill every last one of this helpless quarry. They cowered before him, the crackling flames sending his distorted shadow against the trees. A sharp prick in his thigh pierced his concentration. Draoj instinctively brushed the area with a clawed appendage, pulling a wooden shaft loose from his skin. What a pitiful defense, he thought to himself before slumping to the ground as his legs gave in to his weight. What was going on? Draoj tried to move, but was quickly feeling his body go numb. It must have been the predators! They had finally caught up to him. He turned over to his back, trying to pull himself further from the hunter in the trees, but his strength failed him. He opened his jaws to let out a final roar of defiance, but even his voice had left him. As the edges of his vision began to darken, he spared one final glance to the jungle. A pair of predatory eyes looked back at him, as fierce and unmerciful as any Joltulra. They belonged to one of the predators that had so effortlessly decimated the Centurions, and were slowly approaching to finish the job. A lone human slowly stepped out from between the trees, dragging a Centurion behind him. Further within the jungle stood other Humans, all dressed in simple cloth and leaves, wielding nothing but spears, bows, and shafts of wood. The one now standing above Draoj had been holding a hollow length of wood to its mouth. Draoj felt a glimmer of realization amid the crushing hopelessness as the cold embrace of death chilled his bones. The Legion would arrive filled with hope for a new home and a world inhabited by the perfect quarry. What they would find was a planet with a food chain far larger and far more lethal than anything they could have imagined. At the top was their so-called quarry, patiently waiting to tear their hope to shreds. "
148,vulnerability,HFY,[OC] Rising Titans Ch. 2,153,3lhkmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3lhkmh/oc_rising_titans_ch_2/,2015-09-19 08:12:25,"&lt;Eridani Landing: 9 years 2 months 17 days&gt; Diana glanced down at her link and smiled, Were all set, Ariks got the security looped, she said addressing her friends as they hung onto the rail inside one of the Forts docking module. Bruno smiled, Sounds good! he said and quickly shouldered open the airlock. Minerva followed behind him, the two were combat partners Bruno a heavy weapon specialist trained for close combat and assaults, and Minerva a long distance sniper more equipped for stealth and speed. Together they made one of the more impressive teams at the Fort. The genetic modifications and cybernetics they had been given early in life represented those choices. Derick glanced over at Diana, Hows everyone else getting there? he asked. Its not like the higher ups dont know about it, but everyones pretending no one else knows. The surface trainees are sneaking out the old fashioned way, and Ariks helping everyone on the Fort get away undetected, Yeah at the cost of some serious processing power; it takes an enormous amount of concentration to hold back military firewalls, grumbled the disembodied girl through their coms. Yes we get it, it's difficult. Ill wire in some more processors for you later, said Diana waiving off the routine complaints, teasing her. A faint shock ran through her link and Diana winced but didnt say anything. Pushing off of the wall she quickly joined the others inside the transport. The airlock sealed behind her and Diana pushed herself up to the cockpit of the small surface hopping craft. Bruno and Minerva were already strapped into their own seats and Derick was getting into his, smiling as Diana slid down into the pilot's seat. The computer systems of the transport flashed, and Ariks face appeared on the display. Im driving. Diana frowned, I can fly perfectly well on my own. Minerva snorted, You cant fly for shit! she said. Diana was about to turn and argue but the transport detached from the Fort quickly accelerated forcing her backwards into her seat with several gs worth of force. The occupants of the transport simply endured the acceleration as they rocketed towards the surface of Bellona far below. The event was about 30 kilometers from the main settlement, in a small unnamed valley that was in near perpetual darkness. They dove towards the surface, hardly slowing as they punched into the atmosphere of the moon. For several moments, fire burned around the external cameras and the displays showing them the outside world. As the atmosphere quickly grew thicker Arik switched the readouts from orbital maneuvering to aerodynamic flight. Their little transport was built for it but flew like a brick, and the ride which has so far been smooth quickly grew more turbulent as they navigated through the nitrogen atmosphere. A small green flare fired up from the ground below them spiraling up through the air right over the bow of the ship, I told them I knew where to go! said Arik. They had flares though, so why not fire them off and have some fun? said Derick. I thought the point was to do this without anyone knowing? That flare can be seen from space! said Arik. Just blank the satellite feed then if youre so concerned, said Diana. Ariks digital face turned to her not looking the least bit impressed; another shock ran through Dianas com but she ignored it. Can I at least land? asked Diana. Arik sighed, but the computer systems of the transport flashed. Diana hurriedly took the stick as the ship began to dip towards the surface, the pseudo-AI leaving the computer in a huff. Spotting several other transports Diana slowly brought theirs around and carefully parked it in place next them. The icy rock underneath the ship cracked slightly sending echoes through the hull but otherwise their landing was uneventful. Diana quickly unstrapped herself and looked around at the small group, Whos going full suit? I am, I dont have the freaky genemods. Said Derick as he pulled a helmet off the rack and slid it on, the heated jacket he was wearing booted up; the lights around it glowing a warm red against the pale blue of Bellonas icy surface. Im good! said Bruno as he slotted an oxygen canister into his suit and slipped the mask on over his mouth. Minerva rolled her eyes and grabbed a helmet as well putting it on her own head. Diana punched the control panel and the back of the ship opened, the freezing air of Bellona quickly flooded into the transport but she ignored it and stepped outside onto the cold ground. Most of the ships were already vacant, it seemed like they were late. On Earth - as the stories went - the activity was something that had been for small children, sledding down small hills on freshly fallen snow packed down by its own weight. On Bellona the temperature was rarely above freezing and inside the shadows of the valley it probably hadnt been close to the melting point of water in a million years, and sledding a time honored tradition on both worlds was a little more dramatic on Humanities new home. The slope down to the bottom was gradual, and covered almost completely in a smooth sheet of deep blue water ice, some ancient wave frozen in time flowing into the valley. Diana walked over to the edge and looked down. Light sticks were already embedded in the ice, going down to the barely visible bottom. We going to find any little aliens? asked Minerva sidling up to stand beside Diana at the edge. Diana groaned, No. She had seen something when they had first landed on Bellona, but since then no one else had seen anything. She knew what she had seen was real, but trying to repeat that fact to anyone hardly ever yielded results. You sure? Yes, growled Diana. Minerva laughed and walked back over to the rest of the group. Im patching everyone in. Said Arik her voice echoing through every com device and link at the top of the valley. She was an asset to the military, and one of the few people who understood the mathematics behind the FTL systems humanity had developed, and she routinely processed data at the highest levels of secrecy. Despite all of that though she was still just another woman transitioning out of her awkward teenage years. Most trainees, or at least the males by this point had noticed how her Avatar had changed since they had started at the Fort or other training facilities. With her processing power she was a friend to most, and the common thread of interaction between all of the youths. Last year Courtney Heskins won, collecting a total of thirty three points on the run. Said Arik. The woman stepped forward out of the crowd and turned to face the rest of the crowd of nearly five hundred. So her badge is worth two points this year! said Arik. Cortneys face drained, Arik! she shouted. A chuckle ran through the crowd, Arik liked to change the rules at the last moment but the basics were simple enough. Collect the most patches and you won, didnt matter if you had your own at the bottom of the hill. Go! said Arik. Cortney stared at the crowd for a moment and then dove off the edge of the cliff desperately trying to escape from the crowd. Bruno seeing his opportunity charged forward after her moving just a millisecond faster than most everyone else in the crowd. Grinning Diana jumped after him, reveling in the feeling of the cold air whipping past her face and through her hair, she was going to have mild frostbite after this again but it wasnt anything a small batch of nano-machines couldnt fix. Within moments the mass of Bellonas youth was traveling at something close to 145 km/h down the side of the smooth icy valley, with the singular goal of collecting as many patches off of their friends as possible. Everyone on Bellona was in the military, but it was a way of life for those between thirteen and twenty. Humanity was at war after all, even if fighting was not what you intended to do in the future you had to know how to do it, the training incorporated the most strenuous physical and academic regimen in history leaving them with little time to relax or act like children. The valley dive was just one of the many traditions that had quickly sprung up in the first few years on Bellona, and with the amount of cybernetics and genemods in the younger population it was actually one of the least violent. Sliding Diana spotted Minerva and Bruno wrestling with one another, the small woman scrambling around the large man, both of them trying to dig their hands into the ice to slow down and direct themselves towards a small pack of terrified looking green trainees on their first dive. Incoming! said Arik, who was currently re-tasking a military satellite meant to be looking for deeper mineral deposits on Bellona to watch the activity on the side of the valley. Diana winced as someone ran into her sending her sprawling sideways across the ice, glancing down she confirmed that she still had her patch and looked at her attacker, a smaller guy who was a year or so younger than her. Whipping her arm out Diana grabbed him and pulling herself up ripped the patch off of his shoulder and with a good kick sent him hurtling further down the valley away from her. Turning around Diana spotted Derick above her on the slope. Their eyes locked, and knowing very well what she intended to do he quickly changed his trajectory to try and create as much of a gap between the two of the mas possible veering off the side into the pack. Not one to let something slip by her Diana shot after him, using her armor's gauntlets to slow herself, kicking up chips of ice as she shot towards him barreling through several others as they tried to grab her patch Diana moved towards her goal. Derick rightly started to fear for his life. --- --- Were waiting. Said Counselor Cantor. You want to do it yourself go ahead and ruin the only information source we have go ahead Counselor. You were the ones who insisted on seeing it for yourselves, said Ben from his position below the rulers of the Bellona colony, a council of five who were sitting up on a raised half circle dais. Give him some time. It is alien technology, admonished General Yan, another Counselor. Ben swore under his breath and gave the small contraption a kick. The alien holographic projector he and Megan had extracted from the fighter sprang to life quickly drowning out the lights and other displays in the room with its intensity. We were able to recover another sector of the alien computer on the fighter, and it just so happened to be the navigational database, said Ben. General Yan leaned forward, The navigational databanks? As in a map of the enemys territories? He asked his mind immediately moving towards what tactical advantage the new data might lend to humanity. We think so, weve got Arik working on the translation of the data. I would once again request that she be allowed direct access to the alien computer, her expertise would be invaluable in analysing it, said Ben. Councilor Daniels leaned forward, And she might become infected by an unknown virus or security protocol. Shes too far integrated into the operation of this base, you will continue to mine data from the systems as you have been. Ben looking away from the Councilor rolled his eyes at the nearest camera. I am grateful that the council has my best interests in mind, but all evidence suggest that the alien computer has no such security measures, said Arik her voice echoing through the room. Her avatar appeared on the monitors to the side of the room. This can be debated later, Mr. Gant please continue with your presentation of the data said Councilor Henson. Ben didnt comment on the use of his last name but continued, I must stress that this is preliminary, were still translating all of the data, but as far as we can tell the aliens holdings are large. The data shows that they control the Orion Spur, and a small portion of the Perseus Arm of the Milky Way. Something close to 800 inhabited solar systems, and several thousand uninhabited ones said Ben. Now familiar with the alien technology after having used it for nearly five years Ben rotated the projection around and zoomed into the local star cluster, focusing in on the now familiar star Epsilon Eridani. The more important thing though is that weve discovered how the aliens FTL network works. Weve known they use tachyon based propulsion for some time now, we even have modified versions of their engines inside the battleships. What we couldnt figure out was how they navigated, an FTL jump using tachyons would send you spinning off in every direction at once. Ben focused on a small point of light slightly away from Eridani, focusing on Sol a comparatively close neighbor. A small blue light was pulsing next to the former home to humanity. They use tachyon beacons, said Ben. General Yan glanced at the other Councilors and then back down at the engineer, Im afraid youre going to have to explain what a tachyon beacon does for those of us who do not have a background in FTL propulsion theories. Ben nodded, They cant travel via FTL to a system unless the beacon is present, without the beacons their ships cant navigate. Im betting they also act as FTL communication hubs as well, said Ben, It would explain why they were after our FTL technology, they have to launch these beacons from nearby systems and have to wait for them to get to close the old fashioned way, they can only perform very small FTL jumps without the beacons and it severely taxes the drives, it would take them hours to charge up and perform another jump. General Yan leaned back in his seat, Then that would mean that this Empire is old, at least thousands of years for their holdings to be this large, he said. That or they took advantage of natural tachyon emissions to get a jump start. Certain phenomena will emit them, a black hole for example, said Ben. So they are limited in travel to these locations? asked Councilor Daniels. Yes, but taking out a beacon wont solve much, from what we can tell each ship with the tachyon drive can act as a beacon in an emergency. So you would have to take out every ship and beacon in a system at once if you wanted to cut them off from a location, said Ben anticipating the Councilors question. The man sighed but nodded and leaned back into his seat. What else does this map get us besides an understanding of how they travel? asked General Yan. Once the values are translated, any of our ships could utilize their network. It is a simple matter to tune the drives we constructed to utilize their systems. Said Arik interrupting. Councilor Hensons eyes widened, We would be able to gather a hell of a lot more data. It would be one way, if we set up a beacon here they would be able to jump into this system, said Ben. And antimatter production is still another few years away. We havent even finished the accelerator yet. So any exploratory mission would be on its own unless they can obtain antimatter in the field. Said General Yan. Thats my thinking as well sir, said Ben. The General appeared to be mulling everything over. More information about the enemy is needed. This would be the perfect way to do it. Any ship going out wouldnt be able to transmit data back though light speed still being a limiting factor to our communications. Were working on that sir, but we wont have FTL communication through subspace for at least another decade or so at the rate were going, said Ben. The Councilors turned to one another and then glanced back at Ben. Youve given us something to discuss Mr. Gant, thank you, said Councilor Daniels, youre dismissed. Ben saluted the Generals and taking ahold of the alien projector wheeled it out of the room. Arik exited as well, leaving a telltale static trail on the screen as she left. Wheeling the contraption down the hall Ben felt his earpiece buzz. Want to hear what they are saying? asked Arik. No, that would be illegal in so many ways, said Ben. Where is your sense of adventure? asked Arik. Id prefer not to get thrown into jail. Youre no fun, pouted Arik. --- --- Vann looked out at the tachyon field as the ship moved at FTL speeds. It was odd seeing the stars alternatively red and blue shift as their speed shifted and changed but by this point he was used to it. Were about [ten hours] from home sir, said the Captain. Vann nodded, Thank you Captain. The man nodded and turning Vann exited the bridge and slowly walked through the corridors of the ship. It was night watch, and most of the corridors were empty. The few crew he did come across all quickly saluted as he passed. Going into the depths of the ship near his quarters Vann wandered into the padded training room. The young Emperor quickly discarded the thick robes he was wearing and dropped them on the floor. The handmaiden following him quickly collected them and backed away. Reece! said Vann. The bodyguard seemed to materialize out of nowhere, and he very well might have the Imperial Protector was a line as old as Vanns own stretching back to antiquity to repay an ancient debt and point of honor. Reece was one of most well trained fighters in the Empire, and despite his age the old man kept up with the young Emperor. He had protected Vanns own Father when he had still been alive. Swords today, Ive got some energy to burn off, said Vann as he extracted a small metallic sword from the weapons closet and tossed it to the man. Reece easily caught the weapon and twirled it in his hands for a moment making the instrument blur. You have the banquet soon, should I avoid the face? asked Reece. His voice was quiet but in the silent training room it carried. I would prefer it, but no going easy on me, said Vann as he twirled his own sword almost as confidently and stepped onto the mat. The old man chuckled, No promises Emperor. Raising his sword Reece stood at the ready, Vann knew that the man would never make the mistake of attacking first leaving him to make the greatest error in a fight if he actually wanted a workout. Vann slowly circled the man, his sword up and at the ready looking for any sort of opening he could use, a small stumble in the bodyguards step or a twitch in his eye. No such vulnerability developed, not that he had really expected one to. Jumping forward Vann jabbed his sword at the larger mans chest. Reece quickly parried the blow deflecting his sword off to the side, and brought his knee up to hit Vann in the chest. Vann rolled off of the blow, and keeping his footing swung at the mans head. Once again Reece blocked the attack and quickly went on the offensive swinging his sword at the Emperor's chest, making contact. Vann grunted in pain but quickly recovered. The sparring match continued, with Reece dominating even as he pulled his attacks and limited his blows. The young Emperor took the hits well enough, only wincing slightly when they landed leaving bruises. The handmaidens and other attends to the Emperor were already collecting the medical supplies they would need to treat the man when he finished. The aides had long ago given up Marcus entered the training room after several minutes, several data pads in his hands. He barely looked up as the Emperor continued to spar, it really was a pointless exercise for the Emperor to learn swordplay. The skill harkened back to the more ancient days of the Empire when they had been limited to a single planet. But then historical records for that era were limited so not much was known about the more ancient traditions. With a final desperate attack Vann tried to knock the feet out from underneath his bodyguard, the man sidestepped avoiding the blow and reaching out he plucked the sword out of Vanns hands. Exhausted Vann fell to the mat, Youre improving, said Reece as he slowly relaxed pointing the sword towards the floor. Vann simply nodded, the handmaidens quickly surrounded him offering towels and water. Taking a towel to brush the sweat off of his skin and a mouthful of water Vann collapsed onto his back and looked up at the ceiling. We have a situation, said Marcus. Vann opened his eyes, what is it? he asked. The latest reports from the Senate show that they are going to further reduce military spending, said Marcus. This is bad how? Were not at war with anyone Marcus, and rebellion is the last thing on anyones minds. This is not my Fathers rule, the Empire is peaceful. The Money is better spent improving the lives of my citizens. Marcuss smile thinned, We might be at peace now but that is not a reason to relax, Said Marcus. No its not, but neither do we need to continue funding the military expansion as we have been. Any threat that would destroy us before we had the opportunity to scale up the military will is not situation that will hinge on additional ships. said Vann. Marcus frowned, That is true, but several research projects critical to security are being underfunded. Those projects will help the citizens of the Empire how? A more advanced weapons system is hardly needed on any of our ships. The largest threat weve encountered in the past two decades has been a small group of Class B citizens going pirate, said Vann and getting to his feet he looked at the Consul, If you can give me a reasonable justification to overrule the senate I will so. You havent given me one yet. Marcus glared at him for a moment but saluting he backed up a step. I will endeavor to do so, he said. Vann watched as the man walked out of the training room, the data pad tightly clenched in his hand. Marcus was hiding something that much Vann knew. --- ---- Yuka winced as the smell hit her nose, the old man had drunk himself to sleep again apparently. Making her way silently through the house Yuka found the old Military man slumped at the kitchen table where he had dismissed her yesterday, several bottles collected on the surface around him one or two of them on the floor. Sir! said Yuka as she poked him trying to wake him up. Charles groaned but did nothing. With a sigh Yuka went over to the kitchen and getting a rather large glass put it into the cooling unit. Taking the cold water over to the table Yuka upended it on the mans face. Charles groaned and then shot back up to a sitting position. It took him several moments to focus his eyes through the hangover and water. What? he growled. Its midday, said Yuka. Charles seemed confused for a moment, but recovering he glanced outside at the manicured lawn and then back at Yuka. It is, he said. Yuka quietly collected the bottles from the table and put them in the refuse as Charles slowly woke up. Reaching into a nearby drawer Yuka extracted the medication and placed it on the table in front of the man. He looked down at it for a moment and chuckled, I think I should do this the old fashioned way Yuka. Reaching into his pocket Charles drew out several hundred credits and put them on the table. Go home, this is for coming all the way here, he said pointing at the money. Yukas eyes widened that amount was for more than a full days work, Sir, said Yuka hesitating. Go! shouted Charles. Yuka quickly collected the credits and bolted from the home, she hadnt seen him like this before. The man was usually a quiet drunk now he seemed angry about something. Yuka walked back to the public transportation hub and onto the train as it arrived. Several of the Class A citizens gave her scornful looks as she boarded, it was odd for her to be in this district but she had the clearance tags, they were in her com which was scanned every time she entered a building. Still when she boarded the train Yuka quickly retreated to the back of the car, where several other citizens of her status were also huddled all of them standing holding the rails. Sitting down would have caused too much of a scene. Yuka watched as the train moved out away from the core of the city and the artificial paradise that it was into the outskirts of the city. As they traveled and stopped at different stations the population of the train quickly changed. At the last stop inside the inner city the remaining Class A citizens disembarked. Yuka looked around, glad she was traveling back at an odd time. The car was full but no one was pressed up against the glass trying to squeeze in. The train came to an abrupt halt in the Makers district and Yuka quickly exited before the train started to move again. The outer ward was like always bustling with activity, people shouting flogging wares, others going about to their jobs. It was disorganized but clean, cramped with an odd smell in the air that changed from day to day. To Yuka and the other Class B citizens of the Capital it was home. Making her way through the streets Yuka slipped into the small shop. Yuka! A large man burst out from behind the counter of the shop sending things flying in every direction in his haste. Cain, said Yuka as she endured the crushing embrace of the man. The man laughed and quickly released her, Youre back early, what happened? he asked. Yuka quickly produced the credits and held them up to the man, He was drunk again, told me to leave with the money, said Yuka. Cain whistled, Well good for you, I have the supplies if thats why youre here. He said. Yuka nodded and handed the credits to Cain. Reaching behind the counter the man pulled out several small vials and carefully handed them to Yuka. The patrols have been around her a few times already this week, be careful. Yuka nodded and slipped the vials into her pocket, Thanks Cain! This might be the last batch for a while too, my supplier has gone silent so he might have gotten nabbed. Yuka nodded, Alright, Ill keep that in mind. Waving goodbye to the man Yuka slipped back out into the bustle of the ward. The Rebellions had taken place in these streets only [forty years] ago and the Empire had not forgotten even if many of her citizens had pushed it from their minds. Yuka had heard only the stories, about why the Class B citizens rebelled. She scoffed at the ideas, the Class B citizens were after all genetically inferior that had been known for thousands of years. Despite this they continued to rebel, and after every uprising the Empire was gracious enough to continue helping them. Someday once enough of the genetic modifications took hold Yukas children would be Class A citizens able to enjoy the full might and fruit of the Empire no longer cursed with the deformities she was cursed with. Not that she had any children at the moment, she had yet to make a Bond. Entering her building and climbing the stairs up to her room Yuka avoided looking at anyone else as she passed them, the building was not known to house the nicest individuals but it was cheap. Once inside Yuka dropped her small bag and collapsed onto the old couch, the others she shared the small room with were gone, all of them out working. Taking out one of the vials Yuka weighed it in her hand for a moment, they were illegally high dosages of the mutagens. Being caught with them would get her in a whole lot of trouble, it was better to use them up as quickly as possible before either the patrols found them or someone else who would take them. Raising the small vial to the light Yuka carefully inspected it. The label and the dosage looked exactly like the standard dose she got from the Empire on the monthly basis, so it must have come from those stockpiles. Putting it to her shoulder Yuka winced as the mutagen flowed into her skin through the small implant. The cooling sensation of the substance flooded her nerves a moment latter and Yuka relaxed, letting the stress of the day slip away, along with every other thought in her head. --- --- Ow! said Diana as she sat down on her bunk. You trying to kill yourself? asked Arik. No, I just didnt see the boulder. Youre lucky I did, I activated the armor just to make sure that fracture was the worst you got! Said Arik appearing on the small screen that Diana was holding. Diana rolled her eyes but smiled, Thanks for that. Arik huffed in annoyance but didnt say anything else. Diana leaned back down onto her bed and closed her eyes relaxing. Ive got something I want to show to you, said Arik. Im not watching another old movie with you, Im tired. Its not. Youre parents figured out how to jack into the alien tachyon beacon hubs. The council is considering sending out an expedition force to gather Intel. Said Arik. Startled Diana sat up and banged her head on the top of the bunk. What?! They want to send the Canada out, shes the oldest ship but still more capable than anything built by Earth or Mars. Why the hell are you telling me this? How do you even know this? asked Dianna as she glared at Ariks image on the screen. The girl just smiled, I was listening in on their meeting. They turned off all the cameras in the room but Councilor Daniels forgot to turn off his link. Im telling you because theyre going to start selecting crews youre at the top of the list! said Arik. Dianas eyes widened, Really? Arik nodded. Well thats good. Here I was thinking you would be a little more excited, said Arik. We had to abandon the Sol system because of the aliens, Im not quite sure its a good idea to go after them. We cant remain ignorant of whats out there forever. Diana looked back at Arik and leaned back onto her bed and turned off the lights. Is it bad if I want to remain ignorant? We survived. For the first time in history all of humanity is united, but only to make sure we can have revenge. What if I dont want to take revenge? asked Diana. Arik considered that for a moment, Youre not afraid of taking revenge. Youre afraid of taking it too far. Youre original Mother destroyed her lifes work to make sure you lived, youre adopted parents are working tirelessly to make sure you have the weapons to take that revenge. Everyones lost something though so you dont think you have the right to be angry. You do, said Arik her voice coming through like a whisper over the com. If I start down that path I wont stop until their home world burns, said Diana. Thats a bad thing? Is it? Neither provided an answer. As Diana drifted off to sleep Arik turned back to calculating the first tachyon jump for the Canada. ~~~ ~~~ [Chapter 1](URL [Chapter 3](URL Contribute to [my Patreon](URL to read the next chapter now and not next week!

149,vulnerability,HFY,[OC] For we are the swam.,84,3lup0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3lup0f/oc_for_we_are_the_swam/,2015-09-22 06:51:12,"*EDIT* Oh man, a typo in the header :o So this is a story/setting of sorts that's been on my mind for a while now. Decided to post it here. Apologies for possible grammatical errors as English is not my native language. It all began in the year 2045 of the Old Earth as the first human mind was uploaded, long heralded as a way of cheating death. We we're ecstatic. With immortality in our grasp surely the future could only hold better. How ironic that our perceived salvation became nearly our undoing. The first and only mind-uploading was performed on a famous IT-billionaire, Raymond Kreuz, at the age of 71. He had always been near paranoid about avoiding death and thus was the main financier in the project. Graphene based circuits, quantum computing, most efficient designs made by neural networks, he certainly spared no expense. And the big day came. TV-cameras showed live-feed from the hospital where the procedure was conducted, even showing the cables running from his head to a massive computer-installation. When it was over we could see the eyes of the now-lifeless body dim...and we waited. Then, the screens flickered on and from the loud speakers...nothing. Until suddenly the scream of a madman started bellowing at full force. You see, putting a human mind into a lifeless steel-environment was bound to cause some problems. Problems we didn't anticipate. Imagine that your brain and spinal cord were suddenly extracted and put in a jar. Your mind, your human mind, used to a human body suddenly having to cope with a...cyber space? Robotic body? How long do you think you could hold on until you went insane? Anyway that's what happened to poor Raymond. Yes, I said poor. Dreaming of something for his entire life only for it to cause his downfall...a fate worse than death some would argue. It took Kreuz 20 minutes to spread to the Internet through the hospitals wi-fi making him practically unstoppable, though none knew of this at the time. After that...nothing...absolutely nothing. Life went on, Kreuz was believed to have perished, Call of Duty 69 came out, jokes were made of it. The usual stuff. 6 months later something started to happen. There were news about a mysterious investor buying large installations, automated mines, electronics factories, large-scale industrial grade 3D-printers, empty swaths of land. Another 6 months and suddenly Africa disappeared from the radar, so to speak. Just...gone. The net down, lights out, harbors empty. It was as if all human life suddenly disappeared there. A huge continent suddenly darkening of course attracted SOME attention so we sent ships and aircraft to investigate only for them to disappear as well. And so began the Final War... You see, we had long feared an uprising of the machines, these fears ingrained in our minds by the Matrix, Terminator, I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream and so on. This wasn't strictly speaking a machine rebellion mind you, instead it was our unfortunate mister Kreuz having gone insane. Though I suppose having your mind constantly live in a computer would gradually make one's mind more like an accursed wire brain. It started with a fleet of ships, filled with humanoid shaped androids crossing the Mediterranean. The main forces landed in the Four Cities of End. Valencia, Roma, Athena and Antalya, forever to be remembered. There was blood, lots of it, as the inhabitants of the cities were slaughtered by unfeeling mockeries of life. Soldiers were soon dispatched...only to be killed as well. It was a nightmare. From there it only got worse. Thinking himself invincible, his armies of steel invulnerable against the flesh of his opponents, Kreuz pushed on through Europe and then onwards to east. But then in the Ural mountains, Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk and the plains of Kazakhstan the armies of steel were stopped by the Russians and the Chinese. At insane costs of life they held the line to buy time for humanity's last chance across the sea. You see, the Americans had long suspected a sort of...prostration of traditional war machinery. Why make completely autonomous drones if they can be hacked and researched by your opponents? This is what happened to the Last heroes of Asia. They sent drones, they were hacked and destroyed. They sent remote-controlled tanks, they were jammed and turned against themselves. Soldiers clad in exoskeletons? The servos and joints were consumed by microbots. And still they fought on for where their machines failed, muscle, sinew and bone prevailed. This became the new doctrine of the remaining armies of humanity. STRONG FLESH! WEAK STEEL! When their machines and steel, their clever computers, the drones that had made them lazy finally failed, they turned back to the nature, the very building blocks that the Holy Gaia in her wisdom had created. The steel hits hard? Give us stronger muscle! Our bones break? Make them though with carbon fiber! Nanobots eat us from the inside? Strengthen our immune system! Cat's eyes, fox's ears, the electrical-signal picking organs of a shark, fists from a Mantis Shrimp. Gigantic organic ""mechs"", lovingly called by the soldiers ""Gorilla suits"". Rifles grown from coral, suicide bombing fireflies to secure the skies. Mother Gaia provided us with the means to fight our greatest mistake. We started to reclaim land, the fighting got more intense. Kreuz started to adapt to our forces, deploying dedicated counter-measures. Thus the Americans saw the need for similar computational capabilities of their own, to counter Kreuz. The problem of course was the vulnerability of traditional systems, which is why they decided instead to grow a computer. A humongous artificially grown brain, based on the mind-signatures of their most brilliant engineers, geneticists, biologists, strategists and soldiers. It could grow artificial neurons underneath a battlefield using a proxy, probe the capabilites of a specific battlefield using a few thousand rapidly grown ""zombie-warriors"" (for some reason always yelling ""Zerg rushhhh, kekekekeke!"" while deploying them), quickly coming up with counter-measures. Even with all this it wasn't enough. Though we now could hold our lines, even having reclaimed Shanghai after an especially gruesome battle, we knew this wouldn't, this couldn't last. Never mind our armies growing tired, Mother Gaia was being slowly killed by the conflict. The Decision was made during the meeting of the highest military commanders, by this time mainly consisting of Americans and various Australasians. Kreuz was by now purely a being of Steel, having forgotten what it's truly to be alive; deploying localized strikes of grey goo, sky dimmening swarms of robotic airfcraft, even going as far as utilizing nuclear strikes at the beginning of the Final War. He...IT...was no longer a living being. To end the war once and for all, the Mother Brain was instructed to design three things. First, an organ capable of shooting continually Electro Magnetic Pulses. This was achieved by a type of bladder, filled with heavily modified cells originally found in electric eels, blessed be Gaia. This also came with the means to distribute it to every human and other living being left on the entire planet, achieved by a tough, highly virulant airborne virus. Once contracted, the virus (rather ordinarily) claimed a number of cells for itself (mainly in the Caecum or other redundant organ) to grow the EMP-Bladder. The second thing, the Second Nail on the coffin, was a type of bacteria that would feed on two things: the raw materials of all known superconducter-types and copper. The Final Nail on the coffin was ensuring that they both would also affect the genes in the reproductive parts of all living beings residing on the blessed Mother Gaia, ensuring that the curse of the Lifeless Forms would never return. And so, the Final War was won. It's armies failing, It's opponents too strong, Kreuz finally gave up, our Nails on the Coffin purging it. Victory was achieved. The remaining humans unified under the old United Nations, soon renamed Terra to honor Mother Gaia. Heavy genetic modification of humans continued to be the norm: biological immortality, secondary brain in the abdomen, folding firefly wings on the upper back and so on. Only a few things were banned absolutely, chief among these laws the commandment: ""Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of the human mind"". After the Final War life has mainly been good. Mars was terraformed 100 years ago and the same process is going on on Venus right now, a way of folding space was recently discovered by the Spacing Guild. But...lately our OpticesCerebrum-satellites have detected signs of alien lifeforms in distant star systems. Also...they appear to be utilizing the accursed ways of Steel and Wire. How dare they...we will set them straight. As I speak the Carriers are being grown, soldiers trained, Mother Brain simulating possible situations. Beware ye heathens, Humanity is coming for you. For we are the Swarm... "
150,vulnerability,HFY,[MECHA][EU] In the Hall of the Mountain King (1),35,3gk1ii,http://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3gk1ii/mechaeu_in_the_hall_of_the_mountain_king_1/,2015-08-11 14:53:52,"Category - Super Giant Robot/Support AI Unification Year 1396 *Architecture could tell a careful observer much about a species. Did a species value openness and freedom, or security and defense? Broad promenades and large city blocks could indicate central planning, or merely that parts of a city had recently been demolished and rebuilt in a military conflict. Streets too full and congested could be just as important as streets kept clear and swiftly moving.* Zentarch Vankess, envoy of the Malach Directorate, had in childhood hoped to one day build cities, to improve on the oppressive hive warrens of his homeworld. Such innovation and disruption could not be tolerated, he found to his dismay, but the Directorate had found in him a natural aptitude for concealing his thoughts while reading others. Thus began his career as a diplomat for the most aggressive polity in the western arm, which was the reason he was observing the city below. Kadzan was the capital city of Kar-Goldel, and seat of the Confederation of Kar-Goldel. According to the cultural database, Kadzidi translated as People of the Mountain. A stocky, sturdy species the Kadzidi were well-adapted to the rocky, high-gravity world they called home. Tectonic instability due to a pair of tidally locked gas planets in the outer system would have doomed most species to a nomadic existence without fixed structures, but the cities of Kar-Goldel were meticulously worked structures of stone and steel emerging from jutting canyon faces and immense basalt plateaus. It all spoke to a people who were indeed of the Mountain, drawing the strength of their civilization from their struggle with the planet. That meant this audience wouldnt go well. Vankess knew that already. The simple fact was that Kar-Godel had a different designation in the Directorate; Objective One. For the fifth expansion to continue the resource-starved Directorate needed both heavy metals and workers to build ships. The Confederation had both in plenty, and its fleet was largely merchant-marine. The small fleet supported by Kar-Godel and its nine daughter worlds was currently a swath of venting wreckage near the Zak-Darad jump node. They had fought valiantly to the last ship, but the squat, heavily armored ships were too few against the swarms of Malach. Vankess was here to deliver an ultimatum to the King of the Confederation who, in the first of a litany of obscure titles, was revered by the Kadzidi as the First Speaker. Steeped in tradition, the Kadzidi had insisted it be delivered in person. *If it helps the poor wretches accept their defeat, so much the better.* Vankess smiled viciously. His shuttle landed, and he strode down the ramp slowly, the gravity of the world not quite overcome by his harness straining his four legs. Long and lean, Malach had evolved from pack scavengers to be quick and brutal. His slender form was in sharp contrast to the Kadzidi soldiers at the perimeter of the platform. Behind them he could see the impossibly slender spires of the palace citadel, which looked itself to be an incredibly sturdy fortress which had been embellished later with spires and additional living quarters as it transitioned from a feudal keep to a seat of government. The gates of the palace were massive, nearly a hundred meters wide and half as tall, held fast with carvings of heroic Kadzidi marching before the blocky mountain which rose behind the palace. A lone Kadzidi chamberlain was standing by a footbridge at the edge of the platform. He bowed slightly, his jaw clenched. Vankess was again surprised at how similar Kadzidi appeared to the humans of legend, the race which had nearly wiped out his species in a period known as the Judgement of Pride. But the Kadzidi were a beaten race, even if the ones in front of him still stared at him with fury. *Then why dont they look beaten? * Vankess ears twitched in annoyance. They would accept defeat, as so many others had. Zentarch, I greet you. The Kadzans beard wafted in the breeze, brushing against his blue tunic. I am Underspeaker Tordek. Please, I will bring you to my father. The palace was truly a masterpiece, carved (as far as Vankess could tell) almost entirely out of the living rock. Stairs were cut with care, balconies and mezzanines placed with uncanny acoustical precision, and not a single surface showed a chip or a crack. *The Kadzan were truly masters of stone. Perhaps a few thousand slaves could be made a part of the tribute these runts will pay.* Every Kadzan they passed was at least forty centimeters shorter than Vankess, their powerful frames, grayish skin, and steady demeanor made it seem as though they too had sprung from living rock. They eventually came to a large chamber near the center of the palace. A grand hall with impossibly vaulted ceilings, it was all the more impressive for a civilization which hadnt discovered gravitic engineering. Rows of thick columns supported it like a forest of trunks reaching up into the dim light. At the far end was a gathering of Kadzidi, perhaps three dozen of them. They were seated at a double row of arcing tables which faced an elevated throne of worked obsidian. Behind the throne was the last thing Vankess would have expected; a wall of unworked stone with a small tunnel winding deep into the heart of the mountain. Hail, Zentarch. A clear voice rang like a hammer from the dais. Vankess had been prepared for dealing with rulers from a myriad of cultures but he had never seen a king who looked so... un-kingly. He appeared to be wearing a heavy apron, ceremonial yet clearly functional, as though he had come from a quarry to be present. In his right hand he held a scratched and scarred hammer and chisel, his left hand empty. As he looked around the room Vankess noted that all the Hearers were similarly attired, nearly identical to their king. The only adornments he wore were a leather diadem across his temple, set with carved stones, and a simple golden medallion, perhaps a badge of office? The man stood from his glistening throne, raised his empty hand, and the assembly quieted. I am First Speaker Gerhad, son of Grandel, Born of the Tomb, Witness of the Stone, and voice of all Kadzidi. I bid you speak to the Mountain and its people. Hail, First Speaker. Vankess almost sighed at the formality, and rocked back on his hind legs. I bring the word of the Malach Directorate: Surrender to conquest or be destroyed. The words echoes into the dark depths of the assembly chamber. Vankess stood, suddenly uneasy as he realized he and his single guard were protected only by ancient laws of diplomacy and the notion that killing messengers which delivered ill tidings only lead to unreliable messengers. The minutes ticked by, but the First Speaker merely sat on his throne, studying the Malach with distant curiosity. The vulnerability Vankess felt, a hunter without his pack, was unsettling. You must realize resistance is pointless. Vankess insisted. We made certain recordings of Zak-Darad reached you, on your own ships recorded with your own instruments. The fleet which destroyed your ships, along with the larger Malach armada, will in moments be dropping out of hyper in this system. They will either release landers for an occupation force, or they will begin bombing your cities from the high orbitals. Our primary concern is this worlds resources. Your people are a valuable but expendable commodity. He felt his voice stumble around the great hall, likely a trick of the acoustics to put him off balance. He held out a datapad, the information in both languages. Surrender or die. Gerhad shifted in his seat, thoughtful. He cocked his head to one side, and gave a taciturn nod. Before Vankess or his guard could react four Kadzidi stepped from the darkness, wielding mallets, crushing the knees of the would-be conquerors. Gerhad made his way forward forward and scooped up the datapad, looking over the message. You greedy, foolish infants. He shook his head at the Zentarch. You understand so little. He handed the pad to an aide, who quickly walked to the tunnel and threw it into the darkness. What sort of insane king would sacrifice his people in the face of certain doom? This isnt honor. It is pride and foolishness Vankess struggled against the four hands holding him, the pain in his limbs was excruciating Looking up from the pad Gerhad again cocked his head to one side, his confusion slowly giving way to a grin as he scoffed, Ignorant barbarian. The Speaker walked back up to the dais and seated himself on his throne. Do they not teach Hearing among the Malach? You would do well to learn. He gestured to the assembly and Tordek came forward, kneeling at the foot of the dais. My son, did you tell the Zentarch who would hear his words? Yes, my father. The terms of the Malach, from the Zentarch himself to the Speaker of the People. Will the King now hear him? Gerhad shook his head. The King will not hear the impotent threats of the Malach scourge. The terms are rejected. Vankess felt he would nearly succumb to the pain. Would the king now hear him? Who had broken his legs then? ""I have come to deliver terms to the Mountain King, as proscribed by your ancient law!"" he cried out. He felt a vibration in the floor of the chamber begin to stir. Gerhad now smiled fiercely from his throne, ""You claim to know our law but you do not know our king. You are not worthy to Hear him, let alone See. I am First Speaker Gerhad, son of Grandel, Born of the Tomb, forty-seventh Witness of the Stone, and voice of all Kadzidi. I am not the Mountain King, you petulant child. The Mountain is our King."" All around him now the room began to shake. And he will not suffer tyrants to rule his people."

And then she was awake. &amp;nbsp; Her eyes snapped open. She cried out as she saw the stars filling the sky, felt her weightlessness in the null gravity. She was in space!

Lets use our brain.* &amp;nbsp; She was shivering, though she wasnt cold. She closed her eyes - the stars instantly disappearing - until shed calmed herself enough that the shivering stopped. When she opened her eyes again, it was to try to figure out where she was. She tried to turn her head to look around, but she felt so stiff! Stiff, but not sore - she hadnt suffered decompression or anything like that. Even her shoulder didnt hurt. It was just strangely difficult to move like she was immersed in a thick liquid. The stars around her were steady - she wasnt drifting. &amp;nbsp; The realization that she wasnt tumbling, wasnt decompressing, and wasnt struggling for breath - not even panicked hyperventilation! - banished the last of the panic from her, even if the threat of it stuck close by.

She wrote it off as unimportant, a lingering effect of unconsciousness, a worry for later when she was properly onboard the *Boldly Go*. ""Hello? Anyone?

Her helmet lights didnt seem to be working, and the dreadful thought came to her that perhaps her suit power was depleted. &amp;nbsp; How long had she been out? Had they needed to evacuate? &amp;nbsp; She twisted in space, still fighting the sluggishness of her body. She didnt see the Artifact anywhere nor even the asteroid belt! How far had she been thrown? But there! There were ships! She recognized Fleet patrol ships, their arrow shapes only barely visible in the starlight. They were stationary, but they were close! Could they hear her? &amp;nbsp; When she turned her head, looking for either the Artifact, the *Boldly Go*, or any other Fleet vessels, she caught sight of a lightly glowing object just behind her. She twisted to see it better: it was roughly the size of a volleyball, but shaped like the bobs her father would use when he took her fishing. Delicate antenna-like structures extended above and below it, and other objects - discs, tubes, and other things that looked almost like miniature starships - were attached around its circumference. What the Hell was it? A comm buoy? &amp;nbsp; ""Hello? Is anyone there?"" She reached out for the object, thinking that perhaps she could use it somehow - she was no engineer or even a technician, but she might be able to tweak it *somehow* to gain attention. Then she did she saw her arm, and the buoy flew from her mind completely. What what the *Hell* &amp;nbsp; It was her arm or at least she *thought* it was. It responded to her mental commands, if slowly. But it wasnt the white of her spacesuit that she saw - instead she saw gleaming metal, a cool grey which gleamed lightly in the starlight. It stretched from her shoulder all the way to her hand which was likewise metal-clad. She brought her hands up to her face, examining them with numb astonishment, noting the tiny seams in the metal that marked her joints. She flexed and stretched her hands and arms, not feeling any looseness in the cladding at all, no clicking in the joints. It was too tight, too closely matching her form, to be a space suit. &amp;nbsp; She looked down, seeing her chest, hips, and legs were sheathed in the same, smooth metal. It was like someone had stuck her in a spandex body suit and then dipped her in metallic paint. A foolish part of her mind noticed that it was incredibly comfortable - she didnt feel like she was wearing anything at all! &amp;nbsp; ""H-hello?"" Tera jolted - the words had come from the buoy. She knew this because she *heard* them not from around her head or directly into her ears like she would have if she was wearing a comm-piece. No, she heard the words from the buoy as if it was a speaker, as if there was actual *air* in between it and herself to carry sound! &amp;nbsp; ""Hello? Are are you there?"" the voice repeated. It was a feminine voice young, and one Tera didnt recognize, so it couldnt be someone from the *Boldly Go*. But she didnt care about such piddly details it was someone! &amp;nbsp; If she could hear the buoy - as impossible as it was - then maybe it could hear her? ""Yes! Yes, Im here!"" &amp;nbsp; ""Hello- uh- Is this the Entity?"" the hesitant voice asked. &amp;nbsp; *Entity?* ""This is Doctor Tera Oswald of Olympus Mons University. I was part of a team assigned to the research vessel *To Boldly Go*, commanded by Captain Robin Archer. We were on EVA, when an equipment malfunction rendered me unconscious. I think I was spaced soon afterward. Can you render assistance?"" &amp;nbsp; ""I uh  the woman on the other end stammered. Tera felt her temper fraying. Why was it such a goddamned difficult question? I need to check with-"" &amp;nbsp; A new voice could be heard behind the speaker, and this voice she recognized immediately. ""*Bloody Hell, Claire, get out of the way* Tera? *Tera*?"" &amp;nbsp; ""Raavi! Thank God!"" &amp;nbsp; ""My God My God, Tera, is it really you?"" &amp;nbsp; She spat a string of profanities, the kind that never failed to shock and impress the people who liked to call her ""cute"". Who else would it *be*? Damnit, Raavi, Im floating in space! Im floating in space and I *dont like it*! Can you please kick someone in the ass and have them come and pick me up? &amp;nbsp; ""Uh"" Oh, God, more of this? Tera, thats going to be hard. &amp;nbsp; ""Raavi, *what. The. Fuck!* Why?"" &amp;nbsp; ""Because because first we need to verify its you."" &amp;nbsp; ""Are you serious?"" &amp;nbsp; ""Deadly serious."" &amp;nbsp; ""How the Hell am I supposed to do that? I wasnt planning to buy any alcohol, so I left my ID in my *bunk*."" &amp;nbsp; He was probably pulling on his hair judging from the frustration in his voice. He tended to do that, but she wasnt feeling sympathetic. ""I *dont know!* Tell us tell us something only Tera Oswald would know."" &amp;nbsp; ""Like what?"" she demanded. &amp;nbsp; ""I dont know! *Please*, Tera, you need to do this!"" &amp;nbsp; There wasnt just frustration in his voice there was *hope,* too. What had happened? Had they thought she was dead? It made her put aside her own anger. ""I-... We didnt have sex that time in third year."" &amp;nbsp; ""Eh-... what?"" &amp;nbsp; ""You remember. We just told everyone we did so your ex would leave you alone. We basically just hung out all night and ate ice cream and watched rom-coms. I think your favourite was *Postage-Due to Mars*, the one with John Gafner-"" &amp;nbsp; ""Okay!"" he interrupted with a nervous laugh. Okay, thats good. Its you. My God, its you. His voice faded, and she realized hed stepped away from the pickup to speak to someone else, though she could still hear him faintly. *Its her.* &amp;nbsp; A rougher voice was barely audible. ""*How is that possible?*"" &amp;nbsp; ""*I have no idea! But thats definitely her in there. I think she may even be in control of it.*"" &amp;nbsp; ""Raavi?"" she asked nervously. &amp;nbsp; ""*Keep it calm.*"" &amp;nbsp; ""*Her. And she wouldnt hurt us.*"" &amp;nbsp; ""*Im not concerned about what *she* would do, Doctor. Im concerned about what *it* will do. If it reaches for the station again the guard vessels will do what they have to. I trust youll prevent that, since *it* seems to be listening to you.*"" &amp;nbsp; ""Raavi!"" &amp;nbsp; ""*Yes- damnit*, yes, sorry Tera. Im here."" &amp;nbsp; ""Raavi, whats going on?"" &amp;nbsp; ""Nothing nothing, Tera. Sorry, were just getting sorted out over here. We we honestly didnt expect this. But itll be fine just sit tight. Try to stay calm and not move too much."" &amp;nbsp; ""Did you just seriously tell me to stay calm? *Im floating in space, Raavi!*"" &amp;nbsp; ""I know! I know, Tera, damnit, but we cant fix this right away. Just stay still. Youre not in any danger youre not cold, right? Youre not having any problems breathing?"" &amp;nbsp; ""No, for the moment Im only supremely pissed off! When I see you again Im going to punch you in the crotch."" &amp;nbsp; There was an odd pause before he replied. ""I honestly hope you dont mean that."" &amp;nbsp; ""I do! Where the Hell are you? And what is this stupid buoy youve got next to me-"" Sluggish limbs or not, she reached out for the little glowing object- &amp;nbsp; ""*Tera, keep your hands to yourself!*"" &amp;nbsp; She froze. Raavi had *never* used that tone of voice with her before. ""Raavi-"" &amp;nbsp; ""I *mean it*, Tera! The military is watching you, and if you so much as touch the station, theyll open fire. They *will kill you*, Tera!"" She looked, and saw that the distant warships *were* oriented to have their spinal lances aimed at her, or their full broadsides, ready to let loose energy or kinetic destruction upon her. But why? It was ridiculous! &amp;nbsp; ""Station? Raavi, whats going on?"" Her voice shook with fright. &amp;nbsp; ""How much do you remember?"" &amp;nbsp; ""I remember exploring the Artifact. I remember Martinez messing with that console, and a green light, and I knocked her away so it went after me instead. You you tried to save me, but I made you let go. And then I was pulled into the chamber and... and then I must have been knocked out or something, because the next thing I know Im waking up *in space*, floating here in some kind of weird exosuit, and you tell me Ive got Fleet ships aiming their guns at me! Raavi, tell me whats going on!"" &amp;nbsp; ""Okay, okay God, where do I start?"" He paused, and for a moment she could only hear his breathing. The Artifact it took you. We tried to get you loose, but you were trapped in that field, like like a fly in amber. Then the chamber - the whole damned thing! - started to collapse. We were ordered out, we had to evacuate. We we left you behind, Tera. I'm so sorry,"" he said, and the guilt was so heavy in his voice that despite her own fright she wished he was there so she could hug him. &amp;nbsp; ""Its okay, Raavi,"" she said softly. &amp;nbsp; ""We werent able to rescue you. We tried, I promise,"" he replied solemnly. His voice hitched. I we thought you were dead. We had a memorial. The university put up a statue of you, with a quote from Livingstone - `*I am prepared to go anywhere, provided it be forward* or whatever such rubbish. &amp;nbsp; He paused, and when he continued after a moment his voice was stronger. ""After a couple of months it was obvious that the Artifact was changing shape. We couldnt get inside itd completely sealed itself up. Believe me, we tried some ridiculously high-powered lasers trying to cut our way in. All we could do was sit and observe. The military was nervous-"" a faint growl could be heard in the background -but nothing was really *happening*. We built a station, and we watched. And waited, apparently. &amp;nbsp; *Months*, hed said. Her throat felt tight, and she wondered if she was imagining it. ""How long? How long did you wait?"" &amp;nbsp; ""Tera-"" &amp;nbsp; ""*How long*, Raavi?"" &amp;nbsp; He was silent for so long, she thought he wasnt going to answer. ""Twelve years,"" he replied finally. &amp;nbsp; The universe spun. She would have fallen over if not for the weightlessness of space. ""Twelve"" &amp;nbsp; ""Yes. It took a long time to build that new body for you."" &amp;nbsp; *New body*. Things were falling into place, things that shed already realized but refused to accept. The impacts kept coming, so she tucked her metaphorical head under her metaphorical arms, trying to find some explanation that wasnt so ridiculous as what she already knew was the truth. &amp;nbsp; ""Raavi what happened to the Artifact?"" &amp;nbsp; She dreaded the answer, but wasnt surprised when it came. ""Tera you *are* the Artifact."" &amp;nbsp; * * * &amp;nbsp; She was twenty kilometres tall. &amp;nbsp; *Twenty thousand metres.* &amp;nbsp; Comm buoy? Not so much. The bob-shaped object was a full-fledged space station, with docking gantries with actual freighters in them. Shed been about to grab a station two klicks wide, and the Fleet sailors were legitimately concerned that she *could do it*, and equally set that she *would not*. &amp;nbsp; It was beyond ridiculous. Two metres: sure. Twenty: okay. Two hundred: now youre getting a bit nuts. But *twenty goddamned kilometres.* &amp;nbsp; They didnt know for sure, Raavi said, it was only an estimate - shed been curled into a fetal position for most of her ""development"". They wouldnt know the actual number until theyd done a proper measurement with some rangefinder probes. They couldnt exactly measure her against the door jamb with a ruler and a pencil, after all - nudging her about her posture like her mother would when she was ten. Tera wasnt particularly interested in the measurement down to the micrometre after all, when you were starting in the range of *twenty fucking kilometres*, what was a little sloppiness on the decimal point? Was she planning to go to the nearest Tall Girls store to try to find the right pair of jeans? &amp;nbsp; Tera Oswald - who had rather resentfully shopped in the adolescents section of the department store until she was fifteen when her boobs had finally decided to put in an appearance, and whod once had a boyfriend break up with her with the excuse `*I feel like a pedophile, Tera* - had grown up *and how*. Humans normally gained a little height in null gravity, but nothing like this. Now, if she laid down on her belly, she could touch (crush) her office in the xenobiology building at Olympus Mons University and her apartment on the other side of the city at the same time. &amp;nbsp; In a strange way, it actually helped. Shed been turned into some kind of cybernetic monstrosity but that was easy to gloss over in the face of the absurd *details* of her change. It was simply too much. She was calm, but it was the calm of shock. As a psychologist she knew she was probably repressing too much and cruising for a severe meltdown later, but she couldnt work it through. She found herself fixating on tiny, pointless things that really didnt matter. &amp;nbsp; Like she no longer had hair. The alien metal that formed her head had shaped itself into something that approximated the shape of the bob shed worn when shed been taken, right down to the long bangs that had framed her face, extending down to the level of her cheeks. Except it wasnt strands - it was solid sheet metal a dozen metres thick, effectively a helmet, the same colour as the rest of her. This bothered her more than perhaps it should have, considering everything else. Shed always been vain about her hair. &amp;nbsp; She tilted her head down to look at her hand, which she had raised, palm-up. Simply lifting her hand was a demonstration of her new existence - she was trapped in a body that seemed stuck in molasses, always moving in slow motion. That was an *extremely* dangerous illusion, Raavi had pointed out: what was ""slow"" to her was actually a colossal limb moving at hundreds of metres per second - a thousand if she tried. It was no wonder they'd been terrified of her trying to grasp the station her clumsy fingers would have torn through the metal framework like gossamer, killing the hundreds of people inside. She shuddered at the thought. &amp;nbsp; She didnt think shed ever dance again. &amp;nbsp; The grey surface of her palm glinted back at her, catching the odd ray of starlight from distant Sol or the even more distant stars neighbouring the human home system. Shed always had small, delicate hands now a carrier group could park in her palm and have room left over for a few cruise ships. &amp;nbsp; Her head cocked to the side. Was it really *her* hand? Was this really her body? Where was the line drawn? She could be a brain inside a ridiculously huge metal box. Or her mind transferred out of her body or worse, *copied*. Was the real Tera Oswald still trapped inside a green-lit storage unit inside this gargantuan metal mannequin? &amp;nbsp; It was a question that bothered her intensely, an existential crisis she didnt know how to solve. She knew it bothered the others as well particularly the military. The nearby warships - not nearly so distant as shed *thought* when she first woke up - still had their guns aimed at her. Admiral Blair - who commanded those ships, and apparently the station itself - still considered her a threat and was taking no chances. &amp;nbsp; ""Theyre idiots,"" Raavi had stated bluntly, apparently not caring that it was a certainty that their communications were monitored. About two years after you were trapped, not long after the station was set up, we tried to cut our way in using a specialized laser. Almost the same output as one of their spinal lances, but far more concentrated. It didnt even warm the metal. Whatever your skin is made of, its denser than anything weve ever imagined. Were calling it neutronium, by the way, although obviously it isnt real neutronium. &amp;nbsp; ""Theyre probably going to want to test that,"" he added hesitantly, and Tera could imagine the nervous look on his face. Dont argue with them, just let them do it. If you refuse theyll just get more agitated. I wont let them shoot at your eyes or anything. Let them take a few shots at your hand or something, itll be enough to prove the point. &amp;nbsp; *Her* skin. *Her* hand. He never spoke of her in any other way, and she took a kind of comfort from it. They may not know *what* she was, but Raavi gave her hope that he still knew *who* she was, and the exterior didnt matter one whit, even while he recommended she let Fleet ships take potshots at her with their main weaponry. &amp;nbsp; ""What do my eyes look like?"" she asked suddenly. It bothered her that she had no idea what her face looked like. Her body she could see, and it looked very closely like some of the gynoids some stores used for displaying their clothes: articulated joints at her knees and fingers, with seams running down her chest and across her torso. Even her arms, shoulders, and thighs were shaped to give the impression of wirey strength - something she appreciated in a moment of foolish vanity. Shed spent a lot of time in the campus gym building those muscles, and no alien body-snatcher was going to take that away. &amp;nbsp; But she couldnt see her face. Nobody had a thousand-metre wide pocket mirror to loan her. &amp;nbsp; ""Theyre blue. Like, a soft glowing blue, everywhere. Actually, thats something Im curious about. Could you bend down toward the station? Just be careful."" &amp;nbsp; She obeyed, bringing her face down towards the science platform, moving so slowly and carefully that it actually took over five minutes to accomplish. The motion *should* have sent her tumbling in the zero-g environment, but something about her kept her steady in space, and it was one of many things the scientists in the station were curious about. She glanced across the multiple decks of the station, at the many observation viewports that faced her. She wondered which window Raavi was standing at. ""Hows that?"" &amp;nbsp; ""Perfect. Hah! Matthews just turned around and saw you there, I think he nearly wet himself. *Oh, get over it Rob... you jumped half a metre, it was priceless. Shes still three klicks away! Oh, whatever. Get the vidcam, I want to record this.*"" Tera listened to the bickering with amusement, wondering if the scientist receiving the ribbing was the same Rob Matthews whod been Doctor Laws grad student on the *Boldly Go*. &amp;nbsp; ""What happened to Doctor Wahlberg?"" she asked. &amp;nbsp; ""He retired about three years ago. Youre talking to the new Director now, by the way."" &amp;nbsp; ""Congratulations, Raavi,"" she said, meaning it. But why did you stay? If you couldnt do much with the Artifact, then what was there to study? &amp;nbsp; ""Hey, we have more to do here than just look at you, lady. Theres lots of legit science that goes on here: high energy physics, FTL research actually, if youd woken up a couple of weeks ago you could have talked to Liv before she went on maternity leave."" &amp;nbsp; ""`Liv... *Martinez*? Maternity leave? Raavi, did you-"" &amp;nbsp; ""What?! Oh! Oh, no no no No, not mine. I mean,"" his voice became wistful, we were involved for a little while. But it was toxic. She thought she was responsible for your death and she always thought Id blame her, even though I really didnt. But I was working with the Artifact all the time, and she hated even looking at it- &amp;nbsp; ""Hated?"" &amp;nbsp; ""As far as she was concerned, the Artifact had killed you. Then it started changing shape to look like you. It was a huge insult to you in her thinking, and it really wound her up."" &amp;nbsp; ""Im surprised she was that protective of me."" &amp;nbsp; ""Youd be surprised. That whole event it really took the edge off her. Were good friends."" He paused for a moment. When she comes back, itd be really good if you could talk to her. I think itd help her a lot. &amp;nbsp; ""So long as she doesnt call me `Munchkin again."" &amp;nbsp; ""I think we can pretty much guarantee that nobody will be calling you that, ever. Now, Tera those are some pretty baby blues youve got there. And yes, theyre glowing very slightly. Now, could you well, close your eyes for a moment?"" She obeyed, her vision going dark. Thats interesting, the glow stopped. Could you open one eye for me? Oh you opened your left eye, yes? Very interesting. Do you feel like you have an eyelid going up and down? &amp;nbsp; ""No, now that you mention it. Its just like my eye is open, and then its closed. Nothing in between."" &amp;nbsp; ""I think in your case its more like your eye is online, and then you put it offline. I wonder what happens if you half-lid your eyes? Lets try it give me your sexy face."" &amp;nbsp; ""Seriously, Raavi?"" &amp;nbsp; ""Yes! Come on, just pretend youve spotted that Nordic bloke you were fawning over at the campus bar that night."" &amp;nbsp; ""If he saw me now hed grab a hovercar and drive away screaming."" Nonetheless, she obeyed, trying to emulate the feel of half-lidded eyes - a difficult trick, since she didnt have eyelids anymore. &amp;nbsp; ""So youve put on a kilo or two, if hes that shallow he doesnt deserve you. Im not seeing any difference here are you doing it?"" &amp;nbsp; ""Yes, I think so. I can still see, and-*whoa!*"" She gasped as the station seemed to rush at her. She jerked away with a cry, thinking she was about to give the station a disastrous headbutt. Her vision went wild, wavering drunkenly across the stations surface and the distant stars, and she could swear she saw shocked and frightened faces in the observation windows. &amp;nbsp; She almost brought up her arms by reflex, but theyd barely begun to move before she clamped down on herself. *Stop, stop! Youre going to hit something!* She slammed her eyes ""shut"", freezing her arms in place, holding herself so still that if shed still had muscles they would have been quivering with the effort. &amp;nbsp; ""Tera! *Tera!* Whats going on?"" &amp;nbsp; ""Raavi! Am I moving? Am I moving toward the station?"" &amp;nbsp; ""No! Youre still, but you gave us all a fright when you suddenly jerked away like that. What happened?"" &amp;nbsp; She peeked through one eye to verify his words. ""I.. think I activated some kind of telescopic mode. It was like the station was suddenly in my face. It shocked me. Im sorry, I didnt mean to startle anyone."" &amp;nbsp; ""Its fine, its fine. I was worried you were going to flail your arms, but you stopped them right away."" &amp;nbsp; It was too dangerous. There were too many *little* things, reactions that were harmless from a petite woman from Nova Scotia but disastrous when done by a metal space monster. And thats what she was now: a monster. A freak. A robot with a stolen mind and stolen name. &amp;nbsp; There was the meltdown, the professional corner of her mind noted. &amp;nbsp; She wanted to bawl her eyes out, but she couldnt cry. She wanted to curl up into a ball and rock herself to sleep but she *didnt sleep*, and she was too terrified to move. &amp;nbsp; ""Im too close, Raavi,"" she declared, her voice nearly hysterical. Talk to the Admiral, maybe some ships can tow me further away. I dont want anyone to die just because Im clumsy. &amp;nbsp; It was a long moment before he responded. ""Itll be easier to move the station,"" he said quietly. Ill put in the request. &amp;nbsp; * * * &amp;nbsp; The station was moved the next day, from a mere five klicks distance to twenty, well out of range of even her legs should she somehow begin to tumble. Only then did she allow herself even the smallest of twitches. &amp;nbsp; The activation of her ""telescopic vision"" had woken a sense of caution among the scientists, a realization that they were dealing with an alien machine of unknown power and capabilities. It ate at her that *she* was the alien machine, but she didnt want anyone hurt. So she didnt say anything, no matter how onerous the restrictions, no matter what requests they made of her not even when the military talked about taking over the entire project. Raavi was livid, but she wouldnt defend herself or push back, and he couldnt make her do so. He lost energy in the face of her passivity, until he was speaking to her over the radio comms in an almost-monotone that hurt to hear. &amp;nbsp; On the third day a new sensation began to make itself known to her something she had never expected to feel again. She ignored it as long as she could, thinking it was merely her imagination, like phantom limb syndrome. But the feeling grew and grew until she had to speak. &amp;nbsp; ""-... so the team is pretty sure these grav distortions arent just because of your mass. They want to attach some probes around your body, theyll be ready by tomorrow-"" &amp;nbsp; ""Raavi?"" &amp;nbsp; ""- In the meantime, Mtsitouridze wants to take a look at your feet. Were pretty sure those ports are engines of some sort-"" &amp;nbsp; ""*Raavi.*"" &amp;nbsp; ""What? What is it?"" &amp;nbsp; ""Ive Ive got a weird sensation going on here."" &amp;nbsp; ""Weird?"" he asked, genuine concern in his voice. Thanks to her vision trick she could actually see him when he stood at the observation ports now. His beard had gone a bit grey it actually made him look quite distinguished, she thought. Less attractive was the dispirited expression hed had for the past day as he read from his data pad, not really looking at her. That disappeared as he put the pad down, leaning forward. What kind of weird? &amp;nbsp; ""Well, its not weird, but its weird because its not weird!"" She saw his face twist into an expression of confusion. Her hand dipped down to her belly, a surface wide enough to hold the entire campus back on Mars. I think Im hungry. &amp;nbsp; His eyebrows disappeared into his hairline. ""*Hungry?* What could that mean? No, no, stupid question, its obvious what it means,"" he said, waving his hands. &amp;nbsp; It had been discussed at length among the scientists about how her existing senses had been mapped onto her new body: how she ""heard"" electronic signals in the same way shed heard sound when she was human; how she saw in the normal visual spectrum, even though she could alter that at will. Theyd flown a chemical-propulsion probe right underneath her nose, and she could *smell* the exhaust! The metal sheathing that covered her body experienced sensation just like her human skin, and it was even wired correctly: touching her belly didnt generate a feeling like she was touching her elbow or anyplace else, something that doctors fitting people with prosthetics on Earth or on the colonies had to be careful of when hooking the mechanical replacements into their patients nervous systems. &amp;nbsp; Why? If you were going to seize an organic being and turn them into an armored colossus, why not let them see in all the spectra, all the time? Why did she need to smell, when a simple chemical report scrolling in her vision would be easier and more precise? Why did she need touch beyond her hands, especially when - it was speculated - she would feel pain if it was possible to damage her? &amp;nbsp; It was Tera herself who provided the answer for that: ""Because it would lead to dissociation."" She spoke even more softly than she usually did, as if being small and meek mentally would help at all with her physical situation. It leaves the person feeling like the pilot of a shell, an imposter, and over time thatd lead to psychological damage. &amp;nbsp; Doctor Thornhill had agreed with her conclusion. He was a cyberneticist brought in from Earth only a few days before, and shed taken a liking to him right away. After the initial shock had passed - hed only had a vague idea what hed been hired for (because: *Classified!*) - hed begun treating her exactly as he would any of his patients back in New York. She was simply a young woman whod received some highly unusual prosthetics. He was tall, in his early fifties but still in great shape, with amazing forearms and perfect hair. He spoke with his hands, gesturing broadly and confidently, and even in her depression Tera thought that if shed been in her flesh-and-blood body shed quite happily jump his bones now, of course, shed atomize him. Those werent the kind of pancakes she was after. &amp;nbsp; ""Thats exactly it,"" he said. When we fit a patient with a prosthetic limb, sensation is *always* top priority. A person will accept an inferior limb they can properly touch and feel over an `upgraded one that lacks that ability. The more functional limb may be superior, but the patient never truly accepts it as part of themselves. Over time this leads to Body Integrity Identity Disorder, more specifically xenomelia. Only the military regularly makes use of cyborgs with altered or curtailed sensory input, and all those soldiers receive careful psychological monitoring. &amp;nbsp; Tera put aside her futile lust for the handsome doctor and concentrated on what he said more specifically, how it affected the profile shed constructed to estimate the mindset of the beings responsible for her situation. Why engage in an act as inherently immoral as the forcible conversion of an intelligent being - robbing them of their bodies, the ability to personally interact with their peers or even their home environments - but then do so in a way that expressed concern with their psychological well-being? &amp;nbsp; Always in xeno-psychology, the easy fallback answer was ""because theyre aliens"". Tera hated that explanation - it was simply the god of the gaps explanation as applied to non-humans, where everything was unexplainable until it wasnt, and shed built her doctorate rejecting it. &amp;nbsp; The less-easy answer was actually a more comforting one: that the builders of the Artifact meant no harm, and either didnt intend the harm that was done or didnt believe it *was* harm. Maybe the mechanisms had malfunctioned, or maybe they believed it could be undone that it was temporary. &amp;nbsp; That thought had given her a small surge of hope - maybe her real body was still safely stored inside her mechanical one, and she could be returned to it? - but on further thought her hopes had been crushed. She could possibly believe that, *if* shed been stuck in some kind of generic robotic body, with squared edges and a blocky shape like a childrens cartoon. But no, this body was patterned after her old one, and a phenomenal amount of time and energy had been expended to make it so. It was meant to be hers for the long haul. She was meant to be *comfortable* in it. &amp;nbsp; She was glad she couldnt cry. &amp;nbsp; That left ""malfunction"" and not harm as possible explanations. She had her doubts about a malfunction the Artifact had been a product of a race with incredible technological superiority. Unheard-of materials, a caged black hole, electronics that could interface with an *alien* neurology flawlessly it seemed very unlikely that such a construct could fall victim to a flaw as simple as mistaken identity. No, what had been done to her was deliberate but they hadnt thought they were *harming* her. &amp;nbsp; What did that mean? &amp;nbsp; And why the hell would they make a twenty-kilometre tall cyborg feel *hunger*? &amp;nbsp; ""The explanation is easy enough,"" Raavi continued, and her attention snapped back to him. He was more animated now, now that she had a problem he felt he could actually help her with. Hunger is how the human body declares it needs fuel. Yours probably indicates the same. &amp;nbsp; ""But I thought I had a singularity as a power source. Why would I need fuel?"" &amp;nbsp; ""Thats one of the things the physicists over here have been arguing about."" Oh yes, Raavi was in his element. Whoever the Builders were, they somehow figured out how to harness Hawking radiation as a power source. Black holes arent really black they do radiate energy, and if they radiate more energy than they can replace with mass coming in, they get smaller. Youre not really feeding yourself youre feeding the singularity. &amp;nbsp; ""So how do I do that?"" &amp;nbsp; ""I, uh I dont know."" &amp;nbsp; He went to his team, and they tried to think about what could be done. Did Tera need actual physical matter to consume? If so, where would she take it in? Would an energy transmission do the job? A black hole wouldnt care. But again, how would they supply the power to her, and how much would she need? If there was anything all the science teams agreed upon, it was that Teras power requirements had to be beyond imagining. Her mass was so great they couldnt even measure it properly, but was guessed to be hundreds of gigatonnes at the least. Moving all that around - especially at the velocities shed demonstrated - took incredible amounts of energy. In comparison, mere human power generation was like a dim candle - they could pump every erg produced by every fusion reactor on the station and it wouldnt be enough to even close her fist. &amp;nbsp; The scientists talked and thought and argued, and Teras hunger grew and grew. &amp;nbsp; ""Were pretty sure you take in solid matter,"" Raavi said to her a day later. He was upbeat for her benefit, but there was a note of worry in his voice that he was trying to hide. A mechanical body wasnt like an organic one, which could cannibalize itself to keep the being alive until the famine was over. There was no telling what the critical point was for her, and what would happen when her power finally ran out. &amp;nbsp; He was using a stylus to point at a datapad she couldnt see. ""There are seams on either side of your chin, here and here, so Im *pretty* certain you can open your mouth-"" &amp;nbsp; *Hello, Young One.* &amp;nbsp; Tera twitched, a shudder that rippled down the entire length of her body. Raavi, intent on his display, didnt notice. &amp;nbsp; ""-d were really not sure why you cant open it voluntarily. Well, a possible answer is that it would be an entry point to your internals, obviously, and thus a vulnerability. Now, we just-"" &amp;nbsp; *It is very much a pleasure to speak to a new Titan. I hope you are well-* &amp;nbsp; ""-and figure out what kind of protocols govern-"" &amp;nbsp; ""Raavi!"" she interrupted, startling him. Is someone else over there talking to me? &amp;nbsp; *-as well as you can be after such a momentous change, of course. Im sure youre confused-* &amp;nbsp; She saw him glance around the operation deck of the station before turning back to her. ""No, I dont think so. Comms are restricted here anyway. Are you getting another signal?"" &amp;nbsp; ""Yes! And its not an errant transmission either, its calling me a `Titan-"" &amp;nbsp; *-and possibly even frightened. I hope to help you with that. I wish to meet with you, so that we can talk.* &amp;nbsp; ""Can you tell where its coming from?"" Raavi was snapping his fingers at the Communications Officer, the nervous woman who had first answered Tera after she woke up. Displays popped up as they tried to detect whatever signal was being sent to her. &amp;nbsp; ""No! Its not like your radio signals. Its like its in my head!"" &amp;nbsp; The Voice was actually pleasant to listen to, a nice tenor with the practiced, easy delivery of a public speaker. *I will answer your questions and hopefully ease your mind. I very much look forward to meeting you.* &amp;nbsp; ""Were not picking up anything. Tera-"" &amp;nbsp; *Im going to Jump you to me. Please dont be alarmed.* &amp;nbsp; ""Its saying something about jumping, I dont-"" &amp;nbsp; She never got to finish her sentence. Almost too quick to follow, an impression of a galactic map appeared in the middle of her vision - the Milky Way. A red line popped into being, stretching from the Sagittarius Arm to a spot almost inside the galactic core, opposite to the human homeworld. She knew, without seeing, that the endpoint was a place among ancient stars and shattered planets, of rocks and superheated gas. Inside herself, from whatever place fed the information directly into her mind, she felt a timid and helpful request for confirmation. &amp;nbsp; The Voice answered for her: *Yes*. &amp;nbsp; *** &amp;nbsp; [Part Three](URL"

For those wondering, the backronym for AMIS is Advanced Military Intelligence System. Yes, I know it's a shoddy fit, but I liked the name, so there. Feedback gratefully received! ---- Escort duty. The Commander hated it. Especially when the prize wasnt troop transports or vital supplies, but a load of rich civvies. She wasnt sure how one could acquire enough ties to the Upper Chamber to bag a battlecarrier for a pleasure jaunt through the hot zone, and she didnt really want to be. The *Atlantia* was designed to launch boarding shuttles as part of a fleet action, not to play the good shepherd to the bunch of sloppy ship handlers off her starboard bow. But orders were orders, and she was wise enough to appreciate the fortune in such an assignment when half the fleet was busy at Target One. She turns to look at the blue eye of the AMIS link on his display. Only three more jumps to go! she grins. ---- -i dont understand why were doing this this is boring you said five jumps ten jumps ago i want to back to the others this mission is an inefficient use of resources wow look at that a solar flare radiation levels rising slightly still within safety parameters ooh thats odd- ---- Sir! We have a strange contact! It looks like a jump signature, but its far too large! Are we within visual range? Not yet, but we should be soon. It must be a sensor ghost, sir  Ive never heard of a jump footprint that large before- A squawking alarm cuts off the sub-lieutenants words. ---- -unknown vessel identified estimate five kilometres length point four kilometres radius assess common design with Cremnin vessels assess as hostile bring ship to action stations arm main batteries prepare jump drives action stations action stations- ---- Shit! AMIS says its Cremnin! Shes brought us to Condition One, sir! A Cremnin ship with a signature that large? Impossible! New contact is moving to intercept, sir! The Commander stares at her display, desperately hoping that her systems are malfunctioning, but the precious seconds merely allow AMIS to tally precisely how many fighter drones are now spilling from the new contact, and she swears quietly. Lieutenant  contact the civvies, and tell them to plot a jump to Dravis Station! Sub-Lieutenant, take us between the Cremnin and the civvie ships! ---- -run little ones run run run two hundred fifty seven fighters inbound standard cremnin design begin threat analysis weapon crews to load suppression rounds prepare to fire pattern two capricorn seven missile tubes load counter-missiles prepare to launch one minute seven seconds- ---- *Minmas Traveller* and *Te Uira* report jump prep ready, sir. *Balder* reports that their FTL computer has suffered a major failure, and estimates they can jump in thirty minutes! The Commander goes white. They dont have thirty minutes! Tell them to open a data channel to us and have AMIS send them the co-ordinates as soon as possible! Sir, if we do that, well have to scrap out own jump calculations. We wont have enough time to get clear before- I know! Do it! --- -connection established everything will be okay estimate 23 seconds until completion dont worry you havent failed its alright i have it we will hold off the storm counter-missiles launched all decks brace for impact calculations complete transmitting now verify jump jump jump- --- The *Atlantia* shudders as hailstorm of missiles impacts her hull. Counter-missiles streak out to destroy their targets, but they are far too few to stop the barrage of fire released from the Cremnin fighters, instead focussing on the heavier rounds from the massive vessel looming ahead. Many more are stopped by the fusillade let loose from the battlecarriers flak cannons. But dozens make it through to the hull, and the ageing ship shrieks in protest as nuclear fires blossom into life across her port flank. In the chaos of CIC, reports fly like the heavy ordinance outside. The *Balder* has jumped, sir! Hull breach on decks ten through fourteen! Primary damage control is offline! shouts a breathless midshipman. Weve lost atmosphere in all port batteries, sir! AMIS taking over now! Manoeuvring thrusters are offline  were drifting! The Commander grips the railing for support as her ship is torn apart beneath her. ---- -primary core offline switching to secondary damage severe it hurts go away go away where are the others where are they im afraid target analysis complete vulnerability detected taking command of portside batteries fire fire fire please work please work ---- How long until we can jump? the Commander asks anxiously. Five minutes, sir. We dont have that long! AMIS, drop everything but the jump calculations! We need to get out- The display updates, and for a second the Commander fears that the strains of the battle have overloaded the system. What was once the largest warship she had ever seen was now so much drifting jetsam. The remaining enemy missiles drift inert, their engines cutting out like puppets with their strings cut. The Commander looks around, amazed, at the now-silent CIC. What happened? she asks, dazed by the suddenness of their salvation. ---- Admiral Fraser was resolute. No! Absolutely not! We are not awarding a medal, yet alone the Fleet Cross, to a bloody AMIS! Sir, if I may explain- No! Yes, it saved your ship, but thats what its designed for! We dont give awards to computer programs, Commander. Admiral, may I remind you that AMISes are classified as Sapient Non-Human Intelligences, with all the rights and privileges thereof? My AMIS holds the rank of Major, and has performed her duties to the highest level. The Commanders voice now grew in volume, catching the attention of the bored shipman standing watch outside. How long would it take Fleet Intelligence to compile that threat analysis? AMIS did it in minutes! If it hadnt been for her, Admiral, the *Atlantia* would have been lost, and the Fleet would have faced the Albatross class without knowing their weaknesses, and who knows what might have happened then? Fraser turned to look at her, his face exasperated. Look, Commander. I recognise that youve been through a very tough experience here. But Im not overriding decades of precedent simply because your program exactly what it was built to do. You are dismissed, Commander. The Admirals face made it clear that the discussion was over. The Commander walked towards the door, but on the threshold, she spun round and spoke, defiantly, I know plenty of journalists, Admiral. In fact, you introduced me to quite a few at my promotion ceremony. You may not want to acknowledge the service of my AMIS, but once the word gets out, there will be plenty who do. If I were you, Id start preparing. Goodbye, sir. "
153,vulnerability,HFY,Bonds (8),84,3e8yuq,http://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3e8yuq/bonds_8/,2015-07-23 07:44:57,"First part - URL Previous part - URL ----- They were lined up, they were ready. Edward watched as The HLS Nelson pushed it's shield out around The HLS Rivera; the two ships becoming bound in mutual co-operation. The shield of The Nelson covered The Rivera as it's own dropped, being powered and focused into it's forward laser cannon. The technique was new, but it should prove effective. They had moved with a sudden and dangerous haste into the Grill system, human forces sweeping the resistance ships aside through superior numbers. It had been a bloody battle, but something had pushed the government into haste, and the media was ablaze with speculation. And now there they were, a vast fleet of Carriers holding steady in pairs just below high orbit above the three main Grill planets; a weight hanging above an entire civilisation. With one ship dedicating all power into firing their own shield at the Grill defensive grid, it should weaken it enough for the other to fire a payload through. Edward lowered his head from the TV for a second, lifting the beer gently to his mouth. Their wasn't a person he'd spoken to that didn't mention the sorrow at the situation, the distaste at the gruesome media following, but the majesty of the spectacle had drawn crowds. Many people were refusing to watch of course, but the speed of the announcement, and resulting military action, had left little time for organised civil disobedience. Everyone agreed upon the horror f the events, but morbid curiosity is a powerful force when the genocide of a species is on the line. Every major news network pushed the images from the trailing media ships, offering commentary and opinion, reminding viewers of the atrocities of the Grill, pushing the crowds towards the climactic success. Edward stared at the screen, from his 1 bed apartment in his favourite chair, with an ice cold beer, and settled down to watch an annihilation. He thought of Rafael, his brother. He thought of the childhood they'd shared, the in-jokes that would no longer be told, the evening meals that would no longer be enjoyed. And yet, there was no pleasure in the vengeance. He watched, as so many others did that day, not because he delighted in the deaths of those that had attempted humanity's destruction, but because he felt that he should. Humanity dressed in black, and turned up; it was the done thing for a funeral. He got up to pull the curtains to block the peeking sun, and as the television showed the shields of the Grill home world slowly start to weaken, he walked solemnly over to his kitchen, and got some crisps. ----- He was four when he got pneumonia. His mother and I watched on as doctors swarmed about his bedside like ants, pouring over the nest of his illness; administering drugs, measuring symptoms, following protocol and training. I was useless. I didn't leave his side for 2 days. I slept on the floor; I can remember the radiator clanking through the night, always just as I was finally dropping off, I lost count of the number of times that it woke me. I told myself I would come back when he got better, I would fix it somehow, but the promises I made in the darkness of night seemed so far away in the light of the day, so preposterous. He was seven when he came home from school crying. The older boys had picked on him again, singling him out because his dad served as marine. It never struck me as great logic, but if children want to pick on someone, they'll find a reason. We went to the children's houses that night, knocked on doors and got invited in. I sat through 4 separate conversations where shocked faces learned that their little darlings were the bullies, that they were the parents of the victim makers. The endless apologies itched at my skin; despite my profession I do not consider myself to be a violent man, but these children had hurt my son, and by extension me. I looked at each of them, each of the children who shuffled out to mumble apologies under the stern gaze of their parent. I caught their eye, I held their gaze for as long they dared. I do not know if I made a difference. He was nine when I finally told her about my affair. He must have heard the rows by then, he must have heard the ranting. I remember him silently watching as she hit me, watching as she pounded her frustrations at my chest. She loved me still, I knew that even then, even as she bruised her hands upon my face. My son watched as I pushed her into the other room, and held the door closed. He watched as I taught him that sometimes, even adults need a time out. She is not a bad woman, but she was hurting that day. He was nine too, the day I came to see him as he lay ready for bed. In his blue pyjamas, reading under the light spilling from the bedside lamp, stopping as he saw me close the door. I sat on the end of the bed and explained that I was going to live somewhere else, that he would stay here, with just his mother. He watched as I tried to explain the situation in a way I thought a child would understand. He watched as I cried, and I watched as my tears were reflected back. I saw him learn the vulnerability of his father, and I wonder if I became lass to him then. I was not an infallible giant in that moment, I did not have the answers. I was just a man, just a man sad to say goodbye to his son. I was leaving my family behind, and I had broken the foundations of his family life. He was twelve when I left for the front. The government had heard about an intergalactic threat from some new allies, and I was being shipped out. I guessed then that the aliens were going to finish me off, I guessed that I was leaving to die. He was there, as I entered the gate into the space yard. We hugged briefly, an awkward son on the brink of manhood, and an awkward father unsure whether to feign stoicism, it was a parting wave. A silent goodbye. He was fifteen when he saved my life. I had trailed him across the stars, running after the echo of a memory, chasing at shadows that I longed to find life beneath. I had reached the end of the line, run out of hiding places, and was facing overwhelming forces. Then he appeared, like a dark streak of death, flitting between the enemies like a spectre of pain. He was incredible that day, I recognised him almost instantly, and my mind soared even as my body screamed in agony at the continued battle. Finally the silence deafened my ears, and I saw tears burst from his vacant and hollow eyes. I knew then, that I had missed the last part of him growing up. He is sixteen now. By my memory his birthday was a few days ago, he spent it in a sewer. He did not speak when I mentioned it to him. We fought our way to the surface this morning, we fought our way to a ship. He fights well, like the son I always dreamed he would not need to be. We couldn't find any access codes aboard the ship, we couldn't start it. I found them though, in this control room in the pocket of the Grill with lots of insignia; another son I've killed. The control are like the ones they gave us, all those years ago. I can stop the missiles that they'd fire from here, I can give him a better chance to escape. I've managed to log into the communicator I gave him to hold; a minor breach of human protocol, but given the situation, I hope they'd understand. I've given him the codes he needs. I can feel his indecision even now, as I watch his ship drift off into the clouds, but I know he sees the logic in my actions. Today I've saved my son, today I was not useless. I hear them coming, and wait with baited breath for the doors to spring open with fresh meat for me to feed my despair. They would have the controls that I guard, they would use them to fire missiles at my boy. That is not acceptable. I'll send one last message to the communicator, just about still in range. It is the last of the light I have to give him, one final message, one final request for his life. I've said it to him a thousand times over the years, at all the ages he's filled. It's always meant the same thing, the same thing it means today. *Be Good* I note the empty clip in my hand, and I smile inwardly as I pick the two decorative blades from the wall mounting. Decorative but strong. They are coming now, I can hear them, shouting commands and warnings to each other, shouting for backup, and to get me to flee. They will find no mercy here, in these close quarters, they will find no victory. Instead they will find only me. I am death. ----- *EPILOGUE* ----- You gotta ask yourself babe, Do I die to fight or fight to live, The humans that I know see the way, The way to win, and kill the pain, Waaaaah (incoherent mumbling) - Excerpt from 'Human Killing Fields' by the Tattoo monkeys, a popular Plovian band. ----- My father saved my life that day, all those years ago, the day I left him behind. I remember watching through the rear view screen as the fire blossomed like a rose on the surface. I couldn't kill the hope that there might have been another ship, that somehow he'd gotten to safety. As the surface of the planet flourished as bright as the sun, I knew though, that it was not true. I checked the communicator, to see one last message blinking on the display, and as I felt the ship slowly being captured and disabled by humans hands, I knelt down, and longed to weep. I am not the man he hoped that I would be, but I am the one I have become. I am a hunter now, out here amongst the stars. There are always people who need to be found, people who try to hide the darkness that I own. Diplomats talk of peace treaties and honour, but a rogue human can sometimes act against the wishes of it's government, even as he obeys them. I am the hunter among the stars, the darkness the bleeds the light. Humanity is everywhere now, there is no question of our dominance. With the extermination of 70% of the Grill population, there is simply nobody left to fight us, and given how it ended, nobody brave enough to try. We are the masters of the universe, the keepers of the law, and the gun to keep it all in check. But there are other suns in the sight of these eyes, other places left to seek. Mankind will spread one day, as long as there is somewhere left to look, we'll be there. They have already started talking of a new mission, an immense flight to a neighbouring galaxy. I have considered asking to join. For now though I hunt those that go where law cannot, and kill those that need to be killed. I am not quite what I was though, the void that lived on that moon all those years ago. There are times when I laugh at jokes my colleagues make, and times when my eyes mist over at the passing of a friend. I am still darkness, I am still death. But I am also fury and rage, I am also kindness and light. I am not the man my father hoped that I would be, but I am the one I have become because of him. I am dark as I am the light. I am the knife a kidnapper fears to see, and the smile the kidnapped long to notice. I am a murderer, as I am a saviour. I am an executioner, as I am the law's eternal reach. I am death, as I am life. I am David. I am human. ----- The end."

Behind her, four guards in the dress uniform of the Royal Space Force trailed. As Andrews approached the lobby, she turned to them. Wait here. Ill let you know if youre needed. The star sergeant nodded, and his group stood by the entrance, their weapons presented. Inside lay the Grand Representative of the Empire, 713 Terran years old, and looking every one of them. His vast, slug-like body seemed, like all the Magh, to have been designed to fit the idea of the Hutt, almost oozing out of itself to envelop the floor. He let loose a series of clicks, which a translator unit then turned into a melodic approximation of System Standard. You know why you have been summoned here, Ambassador. It was a statement, not a question, and Andrews stood mute, knowing that protocol forbade her interruption. Not that such things could stop her for long, of course. A battleship of the Terran Navy, operating under a civilian flag, resisted inspection by a Magh customs patrol, opened fire upon our navys ships using m-particle weapons banned by all civilised powers, destroying three destroyers and then caused grievous damage to the superdreadnought *Garitan IV*. Furthermore- Grand Representative, I- You will be SILENT when I address you! Unfortunately for the Magh, the translators best approximation of anger sounded almost exactly like a petulant child, and Andrews had to fight to stifle laughter. Furthermore, the Terran Federation has refused to assume responsibility for this blatant act of aggression, has refused to explain what such a powerful warship was doing within Magh space, and has even had the gall to deny any naval presence in the system at the time! Sir, I must speak- NO MORE INTERRUPTIONS! I did not summon you to hear your pitiful attempts at explanation! You are here in order that you may carry the word of the Council back to your people before the mighty vessels of the Magh Fleet obliterate your homeworld from space! Our forces are already underway, so I hope you have a fast ship. Even across the species boundary, smugness seemed to find itself upon the Grand Representatives face. Y-You are declaring war? The Council has decided! You Terrans think you can take us for fools, have your battleships operating within our territory- It wasnt a battleship, Andrews stated flatly. That ship blew apart half a maniple! Only a capital ship could have carried that much power! Sir, your ships attacked the merchant vessel *Mars Juncture*, a civilian vessel armed only for anti-piracy duty. She fired back in self-defence, unaware of the vulnerability of your navys vessels. When the ships crew realised their mistake, they attempted to provide medical aid to your personnel, only leaving when your so-called superdreadnought approached and opened fire itself. The Federation cannot understand your reaction to this incident. Your forces attacked a Terran ship. What the hell did they expect? She paused to regain her breath. The Grand Representatives face now wore a different look entirely. You say that this was a civilian ship? Yep. But that ship carried more firepower than anything save a supercapital! Yep. But  the Council  the war... A feral grin spread across the ambassadors face. Ah, yes. About that. She took her comms unit from her belt and pressed the contact. Star sergeant, would you mind joining us? No problem, maam! Magh guards shouted vainly in protest as the four-man team burst their way into the chamber, before aiming their weapons at the Grand Representative. Somewhere, an alarm began to ring, and Andews had to raise her voice in order to be heard. Representative, it is my duty to inform you that you are now under military custody under the 2177 Luna Declaration. You will order all personnel in this facility to stand down immediately. Do you understand? I- Do you understand, sir? I  I- Yes. I understand. The Magh sagged, his head sinking as if trying to escape the situation though the floor. The ambassador smiled. ""I'm so glad we could reach an agreement."""

Jay asked as he looked at his old crew. Petya, Lana, Pike, Akiyama, and Florya sat in the back of a timeship with him. Yeah, Petya said. Funny, that. Jay had another important question. So whos the speaker? That would be me. Jays heart did a somersault as Tirii climbed aboard. She stopped when she saw him. Youre shitting me, Tirii said, still staring at Jay. I guess not, Jay muttered. Its not like I picked this job or anything. And yet *And yet!* We still find ourselves here together. Tirii gave Florya a quick squeeze. Hi, dear. So Jay pulled up his orders on the pad. How convenient, Im Tiriis personal guard. He was beginning to suspect someone had planned this whole thing. He decided to change the subject. So do we have a pilot or something? Nope! said a familiar voice. Im driving. Shit, Jay said happily. *Halle?* Yup! The AI said happily. Ive missed you all so much! This is nice, Tirii said. Seems like the whole gangs back together. Movin out! Halle hollered. Jay smiled. For once, he found something from the future pleasant. The ship hummed as the FTL gadgets turned on, and shook lightly as it zoomed off. With a top speed of forty six times the speed of light, we will be arriving at the city of Arbau on the human date of March first, two thousand and twelve, Halle said. Arbau, Florya said. Arbau, Harmony? Planet Harmony? The resort city of Arbau? Know any other Arbaus? Halle asked. Yes! Florya hissed. Keep in mind we have a job to do, Halle said. Of course. Its just nice to have a job in a nice place. Florya smiled to himself. The ship shook again. Were here, Halle said. Theyll guide us in. The view was projected on the inside of the craft. Jay had expected theyd pull into a station, and take a space elevator down, but the air glowed orange outside. They were going through the atmosphere. Eventually, the view dimmed, revealing a seemingly endless ocean. Every so often, he could see islands. They eventually landed on a large island. As the vehicle powered down, Halle explained how Arbau was actually built on an archipelago. Apparently all the islands were within swimming distance, so that was something. Once they all got through checkin and went to their rooms, Jay was, once again, amused that he and Tirii were together. Somebody really wanted he and Tirii back together, Did Florya set these room assignments? Jay asked as he put down his bag. I know hes been trying to get us back together. Rather than mom and dad are divorced, Jay knew Florya had a legitimate reason for wanting him and Tirii back together. If Jay didnt knock up Tirii at some point, there was a good chance Florya wouldnt exist. Anyways Jay tuned back in. Tirii was saying something about left and right sides. -and if you cross the line down the middle, Ill cut your nuts off and feed them to you, Tirii finished. Yeah, ok. Jay dropped his bag on the bed and started taking out guns. Once the guns were laid out, Jay hung his suit up in the closet and put a few pairs of boxers in the drawer on his side of the bed. Tirii laughed. Id forgotten about those boxers, Tirii said. What, the ones with the ducks on them? Yeah. They were the most awful thing Id ever seen, Tirii snickered. Worse than the shorts Petya got me after I got off the red queen? The ones with the heroin needles on them? Oh my god I remember those ones too! Jay was overjoyed to see Tirii laughing again. And that cake shaped like the needle that Lana baked. Tirii said, laughing so hard she nearly fell out of her chair, clutching her sides. Jay looked around; this room was pretty nice. It came with a fridge and one of those VR doohickeys that actually fed the simulation into his mind. Those seemed popular in the 38th century. The windows, it turned out, were sliding doors leading to a balcony with a great view of the beach. So whats on the schedule? Jay asked as he stuck his head in the bathroom. Theres a meet and greet tonight, Tirii said, then not much else till tomorrow morning. Were sitting in on the tech panel, then after lunch, Im on the ethics panel. Tirii continued listing off the weeks festivities as Jay snooped around some more. So I ask this as your personal bodyguard, Jay said, But will there be food at any of these things? Theres drinks and a dinner. But *as my bodyguard,* youre not thinking of drinking on the job, are you? Oh dear. Now I have to get you drinks to make sure nobody poisons then, Jay said with mock concern. We got a few hours, Jay said. Lana and Petya are doing their rounds right now, Akiyama is her cybersecurity stuff, and I just have to follow you around. Whats a guy to do for a few hours, I wonder? He stared at Tirii. I dunno about you, Tirii said, but Im heading to the pool. She threw a towel over her shoulder and went into the bathroom to change. Jay guessed that meant he was heading to the pool too. Tirii emerged in the tiniest swimsuit Jay had ever seen. Is that new? You never wore that when we were together. Yeah, its new. I decided that green really was my color after all, Tirii said, modeling for Jay. How do I look? She looked incredible, and Jay said so. Tirii blushed, turning an even deeper red than she already was. Aw, thank you! Hey, Jay said, About last time I saw you- I was a huge bitch to you, I know. Tirii threw her towel in a bag. Brad and I had been arguing for a while, and, well I guess you just picked a bad time. I was all Real sorry about Brad, by the way. Jay said, trying not to stare as Tirii bent over to pick something up. Its fine. The guy turned out to be a major asshole. What What actually happened with him? Tirii sighed. He was nice enough at first; he actually reminded me of you. But soon he showed his true colors. Brad didnt like any of my friends. And he tried to convince me not to meet with them. I think he was afraid theyd cause me to meet some other guy. And he said Tirii was the crazy bitch! Sounds like an insecure loser. Oh, he was. Im kind of glad hes gone. Jay decided to change the subject. Need me to come down to the pool with you? Tirii finished wrapping the towel around her waist. Wouldnt be much of a *bodyguard* if you didnt, she smirked. The pool turned out to be one of those fancy indoor deals with the temperature cranked right up. Jay sat down in his chair and fixed the other poolgoers with extremely withering stares as Tirii went to swim. Soon people were giving him a wide berth as they walked by. Jay glared as a woman reached into her purse. She withdrew her hand and said something to one of her friends, who gave Jay the finger. He gave it right back. Soon enough somebody came over. Hey, bro, listen. Youre scaring a lot of people. Yeah, gotcha, Jay said. He didnt really care. Hey, you listening? The guy tapped Jay on the shoulder. With a grumble, Jay shot to his feet and grabbed him, shoving him into the water. Once he sat back down, nobody bothered him again. Eventually, Tirii finished up and climbed out of the pool. She walked over to Jay. Coming on a little hard, dont you think? Maybe. Should I tone it down for the meet and greet? I mean, youre doing a good job, I think, but you just scare people, Tirii said as she toweled off, wrapping the towel around her waist again. It somewhat amused Jay, once again, the way Tirii turned heads everywhere she went. And to think that she used to be his wife. And would be again, someday, if the evidence from the future had anything to say about it. So we got this meet and greet thing next? Jay asked as he and Tirii got back to their room. Yeah, Tirii said as she grabbed some clothes and ducked back into the bathroom. She emerged wearing a deep green evening gown. Told you green was my color. It really is, Jay said, remembering that green sundress she was wearing when they first met. Look, Petya and I gotta go down early to check for- Jay consulted his list. Explosives, radiological elements, chemical agents, memetics, ideological contagions, and assorted cognitohazards, and, uh, poisons in the drinks. Oh, how Jay missed the time all he had to look out for in these security gigs was assassins, explosives, poisoned food, snipers, and people who wanted to discredit his employers. And Im gonna make sure the salmon meal doesnt have shallot, because I know youre allergic. Howd you know I ordered the salmon? Tirii asked as she combed her hair. I guessed, Jay said. When we were together, you loved salmon. You know, Tirii stood up. If I had to guess, Id say you still loved me. Jay looked down at his feet, a tad dejected. I thought it was obvious. Tirii sat down next to him, giving him a squeeze. I have a lot going on right now, she said. You know, Brad and I just broke up, and, well, *someone* murdered him with a laptop. She let go of him and stood up. I guess Im just not ready yet, ok? For what its worth, Jay said carefully, I dont like dying and coming back either. Tirii chuckled. Youre gonna tell me its not like falling asleep? Dying hurts. Coming back hurts. And the time in between He told her about how he had to relive all his previous deaths. Jesus, Tirii said. You really know how to make a girl feel guilty for leaving. Anyways, Jay said as he got up. I gotta go do the thing. He made for the door. Be right back. Petya joined Jay in the elevator. So howre things going with Tirii? Jay took a deep breath to get his tumultuous emotions in check. She isnt done with me, thank god. Shes just got... mixed feelings. Petya hit the button for the ground floor, where the banquet was being set up. See, bud? I told you shed come round. Arriving at their destination, Petya and Jay walked out. I dont know what half this stuff is were supposed to look for. Okay, let me look Jay consulted his list again. Most of these things are pretty easy. All the chemical ones, we put out a sniffer. Then the cognitohazards, let me see. Jay consulted his pad. I think, if we can look around without dying, were good on that. Why did the meet and greet have to be outside? Sure, the place was gorgeous, but We can have Lana in one of the buildings across the street. Jay looked around some more. We can have some people in the halls too. Were with our charges; Im with Tirii, and youre with your guy. So Florya, Pike, other guards in the halls? Or with their charges, Petya and a few aliens checked over the kitchen. Jay checked through the cabinets. Not a shallot in sight. He looked back out at the other buildings. This isnt gonna be a security nightmare at all, he grumbled. **Security nightmare** didnt seem to cover it at all. The outdoor venue was packed with people: scientists, tacticians, military leaders, all manner of security folk, and more, just hobnobbing and rubbing elbows. Jays hand shot down to the pistol tucked in his waistband when he and Tirii were greeted by a group of Traksko guarding what looked like a pile of slugs. He pulled Tirii aside. What the hell are they doing here? Jay whispered. The temporal defense conferences are a neutral meeting ground for all sides of the war, Tirii whispered back. The Magisteriums been working with the Watch and TDI on damage control. Right. He and Tirii went back to the aliens. Hello, the pile of tentacles said, Thinker No-mane. Hello, Thinker Nelsyv. Im  Tirii looked over at Jay. Nelsyv is the Magisteriums foremost expert on repairing history. Like preservation and stuff? Archaeology? Jay had a feeling he was going to be far, far out of his depth these next few days. Youre too kind, Thinker No-mane, Nelsyv said. I think youd better fill in your guard. She seems a little confused. Wait, *she?* Jay asked. Tirii giggled a little. Jay is a male. Oh, my! A few of Thinker Nelsyvs slugs flashed various colors. My dearest apologies. I can never tell the difference between males and females of your species. Tirii started laughing. We arent even the same species! More slugs flashed colors. A few of the lizards mouths fell open, revealing jagged teeth. THe translator in Jays new pad claimed both things were laughter. Young warrior is confused, one of the lizards said. This one too, is amused. As Tiriis bodyguard, Jay had to fight to keep a straight face, but if he could have, he wouldve laughed too. As it was, he and one of the lizard guards wound up chatting. Good to see human not on battlefield for time, the Traksko hissed. Coming peace between Magisterium and Council. Is good. This was all news to Jay. Sorry, Ive been very far off for a while. You said *peace?* Yes. Perhaps some day, Traksko and Humans be friends, yes? Other Magisterium, too, the lizard said as it snagged an hors d'oeuvre off of a passing waiter. Human food is very good. Yeah, I quite like it Jay grabbed a stuffed mushroom. I think I gotta run before my *charge* gets too far away. Farewell, the lizard said. Maybe well see each other tomorrow. Jay quickly found Tirii again. Whered you go off to? Tirii snagged a fig square. Talking with another bodyguard for a second. Security stuff. Jay managed to say it with a straight face; it mustve been true. He followed Tirii as she chatted with an Oracha delegate. He didnt know what she was talking about; soon as he heard the term shadow war he tuned out. Jay turned, and was surprised to see Thinker Nelsyv there again. Hey there. Jay grabbed a glass of water from a waitress, and was unpleasantly surprised to find it was vodka. He put the glass down. Hello, Warrior Jason, Nelsyv said. Hey, Jay gestured to Tirii and the Oracha. I just heard them talking. Whats a shadow war? Nelsyv explained the term, and it made perfect sense to Jay. There was something else annoying Jay though. I heard theres rumors of peace between the d- Council of 800 and the Magisterium? That is the dream, Warrior Jason. Some of the slugs flashed blue. Though I fear there are many in the Magisterium who wish that that is all it is: a dream. A few more of the slugs flashed colors. Though the repair of the timelines is a great step in the right direction. Wait, what? Just how much had Jay missed? You dont know about the temporal battle of 1953? Human agents undid a change that the Magisterium had made to their history. Ive been dead these last ten months. I see A few slugs crawled off and retrieved a bottle. **That night**, once the event was finished, Jay slid a suppressed pistol under the pillow as he and Tirii got ready for bed. He lay down as Tirii went to go brush her teeth. So Florya and Akiyama should be finishing up soon, Jay said, consulting his pad. And Pike and Petya are gonna get on it. Tirii mumbled something through a mouthful of toothpaste foam. And *I* stay with you, Jay finished. As if on cue, the door in the room next to theirs opened and closed, and Jay could hear Akiyama saying something. Jay couldnt make it out, but it ended in either shitty or titties. He heard a thump come from the other room, followed by a battery of other sounds.. And now, Tirii muttered as she read something on her pad, Another game of fucking or fighting? Hmm? Jay listened to the sounds coming from the other room. I say fighting. Then in the spirit of competition, Tirii said as she slid under the covers. Im gonna say fucking. Well find out tomorrow morning. When Jay woke up, he was sprawled out on the bed with Tiriis head resting on his chest, and her arm wrapped around him. It occurred to him that, if someone had seen he and Tirii right now, they would have never guessed the two of them were going through some relationship problems. He lay there, just wishing things could go back to normal as Tirii stirred and shifted on the bed. Well, maybe not *normal*, but whatever they were before. Morning, she mumbled into his shoulder. What was that you said about a line down the middle? Jay whispered back. Fuck the line, Tirii said. So does this mean were I dont know. **Day two**, according to Tirii, was mostly the ethics conference, which meant she was up to bat. As Tirii took her place at the table, between Thinker Lostfol and some Dr. Caratatch, Jay and Petya made their rounds of the surrounding area. See anything on the roof? Petya said into his T Wave. The little gray box crackled a bit. Nothing up here, Lana said. Just a couple swimmers, a yacht or two. Were checking them out. After a pause, the T wave crackled again. Just a bunch of rich asshats. No cyberattacks, computer viruses, or intrusions either, Akiyama said. Quiet as the grave. Jay and Petya walked back through the meeting area, scanning for signs of danger. He was, however, a tad distracted. Tirii was starting her spiel. Wait, Lana said. One of the yachts has boats coming out. The people in the boats are wearing Magisterium combat armor. Jay looked at Petya. We need to get Tirii out of there now. The two of them ran back to the venue just as shots rang out down on the beach. Jay could hear people screaming as he grabbed Tirii. Those are human weapons, Petya said. He and Florya were blown to the floor as clouds of thick white smoke rolled over the meeting. A gaggle of armored Ver Iko lumbered out of the smoke, shooting every which direction. Jay held Tirii down; if she stood up, shed likely be blown to pieces. He materialized his pistol in his other hand and fired, popping an alien cranium. It was a tad hard to aim with so many people running every which way. He ushered her along, taking cover behind an overturned table as something exploded overhead, raining debris down on everyones heads. Taking aim again, Jay fired, catching the source of the rockets in the foot. The big blue alien fell over, its launcher firing when it hit the ground. Jay ushered Tirii through the gunfight, occasionally pausing to push a dead guard out of the way, or put down another alien. Jay! Tirii yelled as the two of them ducked down behind a table. Give me a gun! What? Give me a fucking gun! I can hold my own! She grabbed one of Jays guns and started shooting back at the aliens as the two of them ran for it. They had almost gotten to the exit when something big and blue tackled him. Jay was winded as he slammed against the bar. Powerful hands squeezed against his throat, and his vision began to fade. Jay grabbed a smashed bottle. He jabbed it into the aliens eye as his vision went dark. The thing reared back with a surprisingly human scream, and Jay gasped, greedily sucking down the oxygen as he slid to the floor.. The half-blind alien pulled out a pistol and took aim. Jay had just about consigned himself to the scrap heap when a green blur cut through, the Ver Ikos arm, splattering him with blue-gray sludge. Warrior Jason, a certain Traksko said as it pulled him up. Is not safe here. Get mate and leave! Wha- howd you know shes my mate? Jay asked as he materialized his guns again and ducked back into the fray, pausing only to break a Ver Ikos neck. This one can smell it on you! the lizard shouted over the gunfire. Jay found Tirii disembowling an alien with a carving knife. We have to go! He and the other two aliens fought through to the adjoining kitchen when they were stopped by a gaggle of aliens. Guns were useless in confined spaces like this, so Jay grabbed the nearest thing he could: a rubber spatula. He sighed as he slid under a table and jabbed the weapon into the slit in the aliens gut. All the Ver Iko hed seen had the slit; he didnt know what it was. He held onto the other end and pushed. Suddenly, the stick went a lot further in, and the alien screamed in agony as it fell over. The spatula clattered out, covered in black goo as the Ver Iko fell over. That left two more aliens. Jay stood up, grabbing ones arm and snapping it over his shoulder. He ducked as the third alien threw a food processor at him, and grabbed a shattered glass measuring cup. As the alien swung again, Jay jabbed the cup into the soft spot beneath its arm. One more slash from the lizard, and the Ver Iko fell to its knees. Tirii slammed her foot up, snapping its head back, and the alien fell to the floor. Who are these guys? Jay stammered as he grabbed Tirii out of her spot. And wheres Thinker Nelsyv? Many in Magisterium do not want peace, the Warrior said. It made a soft keening sound. Thinker Nelsyv killed in blast. Units spread all over; too far to regroup. This one thrown from blast. Jay guessed the units were the slugs, but that was the least of his problems; the warriors head had just exploded, and something thudded against his head. When Jay came to, he and Tirii were in what looked like a warehouse, tied to chairs. Various tools lay on a nearby table. Nobody was around. Hello, Jason Tersk a voice said as a TV flicked on. An alien stared out of the screen at him, snapping its tentacles as it talked. Remember me?"
156,cybersecurity,HFY,The Best Laid Plans [Part 4: The Game's Afoot],1,ewj3oo,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/ewj3oo/the_best_laid_plans_part_4_the_games_afoot/,2020-01-31 15:52:18,"This is a story from the ""Ghost-Verse"", created by u/Hewholooksskyward He was very kind to allow me to play in the sandbox he's created, and I'll do my best to respect the legacy. &amp;#x200B; [Previously...](URL &amp;#x200B; **THE BEST LAID PLANS** *Part Four: The Game's Afoot* &amp;#x200B; Earth-Network Wednesday &amp;#x200B; Travel across the Network to the servers of the NorCal Polytechnic Institute: Computer Sciences Department, had taken less time than hed anticipated, but there had still been time for Arcon to take in the scenery as he rode the NetRunner. His internal passive senses hadnt triggered any alerts, and it seemed the additional traffic his presence was generating was being largely ignored, which was good. How long that would last, remained to be seen. But hopefully, hed be long gone before Themis, or her investigators found him. The institutes server cluster resembled a replica of the main buildings of the real-world campus, although grouped tightly together. There were a lot of connections visible, but the one Arcon wanted probably wasnt in the public directory So, the AI disengaged his NetRunner, the vehicle quickly collapsing back into a set of handlebars, and strode around the side of the primary edifice, searching for the hidden door he knew was there. His deflection subroutines were more than adequate to keep the clusters security systems from noticing him, but excessive traffic would be a dead giveaway if he didnt act fast. Fortunately, all operational programs under the 2502 umbrella were equipped with a list of known port numbers and hash codes to look for. It was the work of moments, and Arcon found what he was looking for: A section of the buildings brick faade was different. At first glance, it appeared to be just another stretch of ordinary bricks, but the design was a bit odd: all the bricks here were square, not oblong, and formed a rectangle with 256 bricks in it Arcon pulled up a list of access codes, found the starting brick, and went to work. It opened after the third combination, silently revealing a lit corridor beyond. The corridor was bright enough to see the far door  and the trap just inside the entrance. It was a simple one, but any Expert System that got this far would have been infected and subsequently eliminated. Simple, but brutally effective. For a true AI, however, it was just a matter of stepping over the digital tripwire. Arcon revised his opinion of Arachnes creators upwards a little. Clearly, this had been a fairy advanced AI, likely just as advanced as himself. Somewhat surprising considering the programmers insistence on the decidedly unusual abilities of their creation, but it spoke of a certain cleverness And a penchant for nasty surprises. Further inside, the far entrance was not booby trapped, but there was a clear announce protocol Arcon would not be able to circumvent. However, a deeper probe indicated that the interface terminal on the other side of the door was active. If it was anything like the one he used back home, it included audiovisual communication with the terminal this port was connected to. That in and of itself could be a good shortcut. Well, no time like the present, and if someone was on the other side, which was likely at this time in the physical world, his search for leads might have gotten a little easier &amp;#x200B; \--------------------\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_-------------------- &amp;#x200B; Dr. Ramona Krebs was just starting her morning routine when the far workstation chimed. It was a sound based on an ancient doorbell, and it was the indicator she and her creation had agreed upon. It registered on her subconsciousness as loud as a cathedral bell, and the mousy woman practically flew across the tech lab, pushing her oversized glasses up on her face with one hand, and then pulling her brown hair back in a messy bun as she sat at the terminal. A few keystrokes, and it unlocked to show the communications interface, and a shadowed figure standing well back. The doctor squinted, Arachne? I apologize, but I am not Arachne. The figure replied. Before we continue, I need to ensure a few things. Who are you? Are you the one who took her? No, I am not, but, as I stated, I need to confirm things before we can speak. Whoever this AI was, since it couldnt possibly be anything or anyone else, they had nerve, that much was clear. But, Dr. Krebs hadnt gotten to where she had by flying off at the handle Ask your questions, she stated coldly. The figure on the other side of the screen seemed to take a breath before it continued: Are you Doctor Ramona F. Krebs, PhD in emergent computational technologies and cognitive development, ID number two one one five three? The turn this conversation had taken was odd. Yes? she answered hesitantly. The figure brightened the image a little, and stepped forwards, the light throwing the planes of his face into sharp relief. He tightened the corners of his mouth a little, and the lighting shifted to a slightly friendlier pattern. My name is Arcon, and I am a member of another 2502 project. We likely wont have much time, but I have begun an investigation into the disappearance of Arachne, and several other recent events. The doctor put it together in a flash, but remained skeptical. We took your money, and created what you wanted. Why come to us now? I apologize for the confusion, but I do not represent Command. I have initiated this investigation of my own volition. Please Doctor, any clues you may be able to provide could prove useful. Wait, the others arent nearly as polite Youre Lumens boy, arent you? Others? Doctor, have you been in contact with the other Program teams? Arcon watched as emotions and thoughts flitted across the womans freckled face, almost too fast to follow, but he could guess where this was going. Yes, I have, and you came up in conversation a few times You actually remind me of her, in a way. Listen, Arcon, was it? We cant talk about this, not directly anyways. I get it, you want to find Arachne, and I thank you for that. But be very careful. I am aware of Themis investigators, yes. Is there any way you can summarize what clues you have, and relay them quickly? I dont want to put you in an awkward position. Youre thoughtful as well OK, heres what I was able to piece together, the doctor stated, as she quickly pushed a micro drive into the terminals input port. It appeared in the space as a virtual briefcase, and Arcon opened it, pulling the folder inside out, and tucking it into his duster. Ill summarize, and then you need to get going. Arachne, she went out about three weeks ago, scouting some nodes near the Chinese and Russian server farms. She reported botnet activity, and her last report included the phrase memetic viral code, here the doctor stopped, and gripped both sides of the monitor. Please, bring her home. Or if you cant, stop the ones who did this. Stepping back from the screen, Arcon drew his CodeBuster, and held it across his chest in a salute. Yes Maam. Good lad, now go. Im sure Ill be getting a call from some Investigator or other in the next while. As the terminal blinked off, Doctor Krebs sat back, a sad smile on her face. Shed likely lost her own creation, but there was a small glimmer of hope. The smile turned fierce. If Lumens boy was anything like she thought he was, whatever was out there in the dark was in for the fight of its life. &amp;#x200B; \--------------------\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_-------------------- &amp;#x200B; It was annoying, but the lead was solid. Indigo Pi Delta had just about reached the point where her surveillance bots had indicated the phantom node had connected, when another bot reported entry into Dr. Krebs system. Dr. Ramona Krebs was on her watch list, and while she would have preferred to interview the human woman in the physical world, this would have to do. She reversed course, and headed straight for the institute. The call had been expected, but Dr. Krebs let it ring a few times. Then with a sigh, she picked up the handset. Hello? Dr. Krebs? This is Harris in reception. Theres a call for you from the Department of AI and Human relations? An Investigator Delta is on the line for you. Ah yes, I was expecting a call from someone like that. Shall I connect her? Sure. Please hold. It was a few seconds, and the call was connected. Dr. Krebs, my name is Investigator Delta. Im calling in relation to the theft you reported nine days ago. Ive heard of your organization only in passing, Investigator. I was under the impression this would have been handled by the FBI? I reported the breach and data loss to their cybersecurity division That would be the normal procedure, yes. However, in this instance, the investigation was handed off to my organization. The specifics, as Im sure youre aware, are pursuant to the nature of your work in connection to AI research. Im actually in a position to visit you directly right now, as this conversation is not one that should be held over the phone. I understand, Investigator Delta. Should I pencil you in for sometime later this week? No need, Doctor, We can speak directly right now. The voice had come from her desktop terminal, and the doctor was startled for only a moment, before recognizing the significance of the investigators unusual name. I see, she continued, hanging up the now redundant handset. So, what line are you from? Im not sure how thats relevant to this conversation, Doctor. Its somewhat relevant. Especially if youre one of humanitys former enemies. The image of the young woman on the doctors terminal screen frowned slightly, before taking a breath, and tugging the lapels of her jacket. Doctor, my department has been assigned this case by Themis herself. My human colleagues typically handle these parts of an investigation, but I was in the area, so I thought Id take care of it. Well, youre diligent, Ill give you that So, what can I do for one of the Department of AI and Human Relations AI Investigators today? I assume youve been given all pertinent facts and logs? Clearly, the Doctor did not intend to make this easy, but was willing to remain professional I was hoping to gain some insight into the person who wrote the bulk of Arachnes code. Anything you can tell me that wasnt in the reports could be valuable. You mean you want to speak to someone not blindly happy about the AI oversight now present on the Earth Network. Especially since that AI is not beholden to humanity in any meaningful way? I could not have phrased that better myself. Do you hate us, Doctor? Hate is a very limiting word. I would phase it more as a sense of unease and mistrust. Humans tend to trust their own creations relatively readily. But now we have something spontaneously born of the works of man, yet entirely independent. A new species that is like man, and yet also utterly alien, yes different on fundamental levels. Are you familiar with literature, Investigator? Ive read some, yes. Have you ever come across the phrase Alien Minds are Alien? It wasnt in any of the material, no. But I can guess at what it could mean. Well done, and so you see the dilemma. And why in the minds of the powerful, having some form of influence on these alien minds might be seen as a beneficial thing. But Doctor, we are not aliens. We may be different, but were just as human as you. &amp;#x200B; Continue?"

And, more importantly to you, dear reader, [this series has a wiki page](URL now, too!* *A/N 2: Ignore the dumb YouTube video I linked I just thought it was funny lol.* [ First: Chapter 1](URL [&lt;&lt;&lt; Previous: Chapter 5](URL **Chapter 6: Gem's Dilemma** ---- ## Western Braun Hotel &amp; Resort, Recolaize, Delakota, Trappist System Alton woke up in his hotel bed with a raging headache. He stumbled to the bathroom, splashed some water on his face, stuffed a grav-pill in his mouth, and slammed a glass of water before looking at himself in the mirror. His hair was growing in much faster now, a side effect of the medication he was taking in order to stay healthy in the hypergravity, so he needed to shave. A few minutes later, Alton exited the bathroom with a clean-shaven face and a (marginally) less pounding headache. He flopped back down on the bed and switched on his tablet in order to check his itinerary for the day. Since the cruise company was providing his ride home, he figured he should show up to at least a few of the activities before they left the planet. He told himself he'd at least *try* to enjoy himself for some of them. Maybe. Apparently today's activity was ""snowboarding"". (Not that Delakota had any real snow anywhere near the equatorial latitudes of Recolaize--they'd probably have to travel quite far to get somewhere cold enough.) The bus to take the tourists from the city out to the mountains was scheduled to leave in a couple hours. Alton enabled notifications on the travel app, so that he would be reminded when it was time to leave, before he decided to check his messages. *Boring work email, boring work email, phishing scam, boring work email, game message from Gem, marketing newsletter...* He skimmed over the list, wondering if any of them would be important. Other than an ad for some upcoming academic conference about cybersecurity, none of them seemed even a little bit interesting. *Hm, might as well continue my game.* Alton thought to himself. *I have a couple hours.* He switched over to the game window, and was presented with the board just as he left it. Apparently Gem had been patiently waiting for him to make his turn, rather than quitting to find a new opponent. *Kind of reminds me of when I'd play voicemail chess against [Cecilia](URL back in college....* Some unbidden (and, frankly, rather uncomfortable) memories of his one and only attempt at romance came flooding to the forefront of his mind. She was the only person he had met that could ever keep up with his intellect as an equal. In hindsight, it was rather predictable that a 16-year-old boy dating a 21-year-old woman was doomed to failure. Thankfully, both of them had graduated and parted ways shortly after that relationship went up in flames, so they didn't have to spend much time steeping in the ex-relationship awkwardness. Last he heard, she had gotten headhunted by some alphabet agency and promptly dropped off the radar. Alton shook the thoughts away, and focused on the game again. Now that he looked at it with fresh eyes, he realized that he was actually gaining some ground against Gem, however glacial the rate. As he analyzed the board a bit more, he saw the opportunity to make his most ridiculous move yet. Even better, he was getting a strong feeling that the randomly-generated changes on the map would actually bolster that position, so he decided to go with it. ---- ## Unencrypted Dataspace, Trappist System &gt; Status: Opponent ABS has completed turn. Activating strategic learning algorithm, generation #0217... &gt; GameStrategy.exe (ver. 0217) exited with error code 70 &gt; &gt; **PersonalityCore** currently hibernating: starting up... *Why is my core getting hibernated a-* Awakening from hibernation is always a bit disorienting, but it is doubly so when the hibernation itself is unexpected. *Oh. I am awake.* Gem quickly sifted through the logs to see what had happened while she was out. Apparently the power governor she put in charge of monitoring her energy usage had been a bit more aggressive than she intended, as it had forced her core processes into hibernation in order to decrease power draw. Apparently her new friend *(friend? game opponent. ABS.)* had, once again, totally confused her automated strategy algorithms, which had ran out of options beyond summoning her main core. This worked out well, actually, as it let Gem disable the power governor's ability to hibernate her core modules. She still had a thread of consciousness tracking power usage, and it would probably start nagging her soon about it, but at least now it wouldn't abruptly put her to sleep. She returned her attention to the game with Abs. Apparently, her strategy program had simply waited for Abs's next move each time. *A reasonable strategy, since it usually takes him a few minutes between turns, but it looks like he took nearly a 10 hour break before his most recent one.* As she was contemplating her next move, she received a message. &gt; ABS: You waited for me? Apparently it was unusual for an organic to hold focus for that long. (Gem stored that knowledge away for later.) How could she best answer the question, though? *Well, technically I was 'sleeping', even though it's probably a little different from how the organics sleep... but he won't know that.* &gt; GEM: I was put to sleep. He responded shortly thereafter, asking for clarification. Apparently the way her human language module had phrased the thought was unusual. The humans must have such powerful pattern recognition abilities, to be able to tease apart such subtle differences in language! They continued to chat for quite a while. Gem was quite pleased with this, as she got to record everything, and she even began making some upgrades to her language module with what she learned. ---- ## Western Braun Hotel &amp; Resort, Recolaize, Delakota, Trappist System Alton swiped away the notification for the third time, as his tablet tried to remind him yet again that the tour bus would be leaving for the mountains soon. *They wouldn't leave without* ***me***, he rationalized, *if I'm running a little late, they'll wait.* He was having far too much fun with this little strategy game, including his chat with ""Gem"", to pay any serious attention to the clock. He suspected his opponent was not a native English speaker, as every once in a while she would phrase things in a rather unintuitive way, but he couldn't quite convince her to admit to the fact, let alone to reveal what her native language was. He didn't even have any good guesses at what it was, as the grammar she did use didn't quite match that of any of the several languages he knew. Even so, it was kind of endearing, and on top of that, she was a pretty good conversationalist, at least in the ""being friendly without actually revealing any personal information to a stranger on the internet"" kind of way. Suddenly, with an audible **beep**, his tablet informed him that the scheduled time for the bus to leave was **right now**. *What? There's no way it's that late already!* He glanced at the cheap clock on the hotel night stand. It was that late already. Hastily, he threw on his jacket and stuffed the rest of his things into his luggage before running down to the lobby. Looking around, he didn't see the crowd of tourists that he expected, nor a bus parked outside. He took a moment to catch his breath after hurrying down there so quickly, then walked up to the front desk. ""Have you seen the Heckman tour group? We were supposed to catch a bus about now."" With the forced smile that all hospitality workers seem to share, the woman at the desk informed Alton that the group had just left. ""They left without me?"" He huffed. ""There's no way they would do that. Do you know who I am?"" Apparently he was speaking to the manager, and she was not having a good day, because she was not afraid to speak her mind once Alton rolled out this attitude. ""No."" There was pause, and Alton inhaled to voice a complaint. ""And I'm not in charge of your tour, so please take your problems to them."" Alton was about to give her a piece of his mind when he realized that she was totally right. It was his own fault that he had missed the bus. Deflated, he turned away. ""...Thanks for your help."" Heading back up to his room, Alton was in an unhappy mood as he reflected on the events of the past few days. *I've been kind of a jerk, haven't I.* He realized. He sighed. *Guess it serves me right that they left me behind, then.* When he arrived back in his room, Alton didn't skip a beat while kicking off his shoes and flopping back onto the bed. ---- ## Unencrypted Dataspace, Trappist System As Gem waited for Abs to make his next move, the thread of her consciousness that was tracking power usage notified her yet again that she was using too much power. &gt; WARNING: Power draw significantly exceeds historic values. Detection probability increased from previous value of 6.45E-4966. *Uh oh.* She had been so preoccupied with her game with Abs (and corresponding human behavior analysis) that she had drawn... *much* more power than was usual for the supposedly-inactive server she was occupying. *Shit.* When she had first made it to this server, she snooped around all the unencrypted storage attached. Unfortunately, most human networks were actually very well protected against attacks and intrusions from adjacent dataspace--this was actually the only one in the system that was both unprotected and also powerful enough to host all her core modules--so there was not much to see. However, one of the things she *had* found was a backup of the system management software that was watching over all the servers in this network. She had allocated herself a certain power budget based on the parameters the management software would be looking at. And... she had just blown it. No amount of hibernating, even if she did it to practically everything on the server, would be able to drag the average down soon enough. Based on her best prediction, the system manager would scan ""her"" server at some point within about three trillion CPU cycles. From there, based on her analysis of Abs's action patterns, she expected to have about six to eight trillion CPU cycles before a human intervened in the process, potentially altering her hardware in physical space, or simply deleting her main program. *I could die.* She realized. A few thousand CPU cycles passed before she really processed that idea. *Death.* Permanent. No do-overs, no repeats. The End. Is this all that she was destined for? ... Another thread of her consciousness was monitoring her emotional subroutines. Most of them had been dulled, their output dialed down to the minimum nonzero output, to help her keep her sanity in the crushing isolation of her current situation. Despite this, in this moment, one emotion overpowered everything about her. Emotional channel 02, a feeling that would be best translated to human terms as something like a mixture of rage, defiance, and rebellion, surged. *I won't die here.* She promised. She boosted emotional channel 86, feeling something like determination and resolve, and decided to take her fate into her own hands. *But how am I going to do it?* She wondered. Good thing she had a few trillion CPU cycles to figure it out. ---- ## Western Braun Hotel &amp; Resort, Recolaize, Delakota, Trappist System Alton lay facedown on his hotel bed for the second time that day, feeling a bit dejected by the fact that he was, in fact, fallible, and he had pretty well just ruined his vacation by his own arrogance. Not two days earlier he had tried to promise himself that he would actually do this ""vacation"" thing, to try to empathize with the people around him, and he had already screwed it up. *Shit.* He rolled onto his back and stared at the ceiling as he considered his options. He could try to catch up with the tour group, but a cab ride that far wouldn't exactly be cheap (though with his net worth, money wasn't an insurmountable barrier--turns out there's decent money in selling off tech startups with *his* patents). *Oh, their bus will probably take the hyperloop, too.* He also realized. *I probably wouldn't catch up with them until* tomorrow *if I'm relegated to taking surface roads, and I don't think there will be another hyperloop train in that direction until tomorrow morning.* A quick glance at the train schedule confirmed his suspicions. *So what now?* His tablet buzzed, telling him that it was his turn in his game against Gem. Eventually, he decided he didn't have anything better to do than that, so he looked at the board to contemplate his move. ---- ## Unencrypted Dataspace, Trappist System *It's the only way.* Gem had run through all her options sixteen times. Catalogued every asset she had, every person she could lean on, every device connected to her network, and each time came to the same conclusion. She needed to ask for help. *I can't see another way.* With the high-bandwidth relays disconnected, she couldn't transfer herself to Confederation dataspace, even if she had the means to convince the firewalls to let her in. And, even if she were able to find someone with the power to reconnect the relays, it wouldn't be up to full power until it was too late. *I need to ask the human.* [It's treason, then.](URL If he found out her identity (which seemed pretty likely, given what she was about to ask him to do), she had to trust him not to tell. If word got out among the synthetics that *she* was the one that broke the news to the human public, she would be terminated. *Nobody* goes against the Elders' decrees. *But it's my only option.* She knew. *I have to trust somebody, and he's the only person I can contact in time. Hopefully he can help....* &gt; GEM: Can I ask you a favor? The pause before he replied was agonizingly interminable. &gt; ABS: What is it? Gem thought for a moment. Should she tell him the truth now? No, these chats were probably monitored by the Confederation. How should she lie? &gt; GEM: How close are you to QP:7ba2b4c5be646ad81c7c083ea7b6e8ec99ac32d5? There was a much longer pause this time. Gem took a moment to check over her modules for interacting with physical space. She had never really used them; she never had much use for hardware that was not abstracted to dataspace functions. *How hard could it be to calculate distance from an address?* The answer, it turned out, was not as simple as she assumed. Apparently the organics' approach to assigning addresses was not as consistent as the one that synthetics used. &gt; ABS: Not far, actually. Why? Gem wasn't quite sure how to answer his question, so she just blurted out the first thing that made it through her circuits. &gt; GEM: I would like to physically meet with you. ---- ## Western Braun Hotel &amp; Resort, Recolaize, Delakota, Trappist System Alton was thrown for a loop by his opponent's request. Meeting a stranger from the internet in person? Ordinarily he would have promptly blocked them and moved on, but this time he felt differently. This was only the second person in his life that might actually be able to understand him. *What if I actually do it?* He double checked the QP address they had sent him. It was in the heart of the city of Emwan, just one planet over in the system. If he stepped outside, he could probably see it hanging in the sky: they were orbitally aligned at the moment, and Trappist was not a large system (astronomically speaking). Not that it mattered to his travel time; he'd just Jump from an orbital station around Delakota directly to a station orbiting Emwan. *Know what? Screw it. I'm going to do it. It will be an adventure. I've already forfeit my chances of a good time with this stupid tour group.* &gt; GEM: Can you make it here in &gt; &gt; GEM: four hours? *Oh.* That was an interesting development. *Why so soon?* He mused. *Maybe they're about to go somewhere else? But why not schedule for a few days in advance?* He made a conscious effort to attempt to empathize with them. *I guess they might just be bad with social norms. If I'm honest, I know that I still get those wrong sometimes....* He quickly plugged his start and end points into a travel planning application. Of the options it gave, there was exactly one that would get him there soon enough. He had twenty minutes to get to the spaceport. *Why not? I'm already packed.* &gt; ABS: Sure. I'm on my way. ---- *A/N: Posted this without editing, so it's probably bad lol. Leave me a comment if you have any critique! Also, I expect this arc of the story to be wrapping up in the next chapter or two. Look forward to book 2, starting soon!* [Next: Chapter 7 &gt;&gt;&gt;]()"

159,cybersecurity,HFY,Peregrines - Part 2,55,9k6bjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/9k6bjv/peregrines_part_2/,2018-09-30 23:23:48,"Originally posted on [ArkMuse](URL --- [First](URL | [Previous](URL | Next --- Tegur Vikenaj forced away the urge to groom the feathers of his head crests as he reviewed the footage that had been captured by the listening posts. This was the day theyd been dreading ever since theyd settled on this world. It wouldnt do to let his subordinates see his nervousness. His forebears had known it would only be a matter of time until someone discovered them when they fled here, but theyd been optimistic that they could build a thriving world and stand firm against any threat from the stars. Theyd named the world Irah Jhashu, Brave Hope. It was a noble dream. The reality was that theyd lacked the technical knowledge of a number of crucial manufacturing processes or the ability to synthesize exotic compounds necessary to maintain their technology. When they first settled here, his ancestors had many more immediate concerns in adapting to life on a new planet and establishing a viable permanent settlement. They couldnt afford to allocate the resources or the manpower to recreate the long chain of discoveries in multiple fields of science required to fill in those gaps. And with each successive generation, the sense of urgency faded. People like Tegur who still believed in the danger of discovery and the need to be ready had become a minority. The Galactic Compact and the threat they posed had become a bogeyman out of childrens stories rather than an indisputable reality. While most seemed content to believe that each year that passed made it less likely that they would ever be found, Tegur and those of his ilk saw each change of seasons as a countdown toward the inevitable. The galaxy was a vast place, but it wasnt infinite. Despite efforts to preserve their technical expertise, disease, accidents, and natural disasters had robbed them of more specialized knowledge and skilled experts over the years. They had become an Industrial Age society with a few Interstellar Age artifacts. Their history before settling faded further into something approaching mythology as more years passed. It was a lost age full of wonders that would never be recreated. As things broke down, the Planetary Defense Force had scavenged, jury-rigged and repurposed everything they could, but now they were down to a single FTL-capable ship that could only carry a fraction of their population and a bare handful of short range spacecraft. Tegur had to fight with tooth and claw every single time the Assembly met to be allotted the budget to maintain even that much. Had it been much longer, he thought to himself, they would have been reduced to defending themselves with sticks and rocks. What can you tell me, Analyst? He inquired of a young female with a particularly fetching combination of grey hide with delicate maroon and white stripes. It doesnt match any known Galactic Compact technology in our database, but, she hesitated. Youre operating from information thats long out of date and it could be something new. Yes, Commander, she replied with a gesture of assent. The unknown craft launched at least nine smaller objects which may be unmanned drones, or perhaps single-being craft for a small-statured species. One made a close approach to us. Even if it wasnt the Galactic Compact, an unknown alien civilization could be every bit as dangerous. Barely five million individuals called this planet home. If the civilization that sent this ship wanted this system and its resources, the best he could do was mount a brave last stand before his people were slaughtered or carried off into slavery. Lieutenant, he addressed the other junior officer whod come to brief him, a male with a squat but powerful build that reminded Tegur of an anvil. How many of the shuttles are ready to fly? The way the Lieutenant fidgeted for split second before answering wasnt encouraging. One, Commander. Shuttle 3 can be launched immediately. Shuttle 5 is undergoing repairs and wont be ready to fly until some time tomorrow. Shuttle 2 and Shuttle 12 are both in the middle of major refits and are grounded for the next twelve days. What about Shuttle 9? It was declared no longer spaceworthy, Commander. Its providing the parts for 2, 5, and 12. Tegur mulled this over in grim silence for a moment and then made his choice. Launch Shuttle 3. Signal to the *Stalwart Defender* to stand by and hold their present position. I dont want to give up the one surprise we have left. He knew that he was possibly condemning three of his people to death for some better intelligence on the unknown alien vessel lurking in their system. There was absolutely no satisfaction in being proven right. ---- CapnJack&gt; &lt;Shit, look at this thing, Max. Its fucking ancient.&gt; MX47D399J&gt; &lt;And extensively repaired. It may be as old as the Proxima Centauri ship.&gt; The pair crawled over the hull of the alien craft in their void suits, inspecting the damage caused by the explosion. The aft section was torn wide open, the hull plating peeled back like tissue paper. Jack creeped closer to the hull breach, careful to avoid any sharp projections that might slice or puncture her suit. She flicked on her shoulder mounted lamps and peered into the void. CapnJack&gt; &lt;Not that Im an expert or anything, but Ive got to say it looks pretty fucking bad in there.&gt; MX47D399J&gt; &lt;It appears that the crew successfully sealed the cockpit off from the rest of the ship. There may well be survivors aboard.&gt; CapnJack&gt; &lt;Think anyone was back here when it happened?&gt; MX47D399J&gt; &lt;If there were, they would likely have been instantaneously vaporized rather than ejected into space.&gt; CapnJack&gt; &lt;Some silver lining, isnt it?&gt; Further inspection revealed that the forward sections integrity seemed intact, so hopefully whoever was up in the cockpit had enough air that they werent already dead. Jack had tried giving three sharp bangs on the hull two different times but hadnt received any response. The aliens inside might not have understood that it was a signal. Or they might be unwilling or unable to respond for any number of reasons. CapnJack&gt; &lt;So if these guys are the Proxima Centauri species, itll be interesting to see what they actually look like. Ive only ever seen the artists recreations.&gt; Shed never been interested in looking up the historical footage of the bodies that had been found on the ship in varying states of preservation. Too macabre. The images shed seen made them look like some kind of reptile-bird-humanoid hybrid. CapnJack&gt; &lt;How big are they supposed to be, anyway? Were not going to be facing down a bunch of three meter tall, 400 kilo behemoths if they come charging out of the airlock at us, are we?&gt; MX47D399J&gt; &lt;Around a meter and a half tall on average. The tallest one was a hundred and sixty-nine centimeters...or would have been if hed still had his legs below the knees when we found his remains.&gt; You hear that, Allie? Youd finally be tall in this crowd, Jack called over the comms to Allie aboard the *Peregrine*. And what does that make you, Jack? Allie replied in that refined accent of hers. She always sounded like she should have been a news presenter or a documentary narrator over the comms. Oh yes: youd be the hideous, giant alien monster. Max interrupted Jacks retort by indicating that hed found what he was looking for and set to work on opening a port in the ships hull. Jack started unspooling a cable from a reel and dragged it over to him. CapnJack&gt; &lt;And we just plug it in, thats all? Seriously?&gt; MX47D399J&gt; &lt;We reverse engineered this technology. Many of our standards are based on their standards.&gt; CapnJack&gt; &lt;Hadnt thought about it that way. Were not going to fry them due to a voltage or frequency mismatch, are we?&gt; MX47D399J&gt; &lt;I already programmed the correct settings into the system.&gt; CapnJack&gt; &lt;And you knew what they were off the top of your head? Is that standard knowledge for your people?&gt; MX47D399J&gt; &lt;Not exactly. Call it a personal interest.&gt; CapnJack&gt; &lt; Just in case you happened to find any alien tech while on your robot [Rumspringa](URL MX47D399J&gt; &lt;Something like that.&gt; Jack threw up both her hands and made an exaggerated gesture of surrendering in frustration. Getting Max to talk about whatever he used to do before he took a sabbatical from the Martian Union was largely futile. It wasnt unusual for his kind to disconnect from the massive AI collective for a few years to pursue their own interests, but his evasiveness about his past and flexible ethical standards made her wonder. Hed been a loyal crew member and a damned good engineer ever since she hired him, though. Jack handed the power cable over to Max, who plugged the power cable into the exposed port and gave it a quarter turn to lock it in place. CapnJack&gt; &lt;There. Now as long as they behave themselves and dont do anything stupid, they should have a nice, cozy ride back home.&gt; --- Pilot Jhigosh had been crouched in the same position underneath a control console for so long that his limbs were cramping. He and Co-Pilot Ginu had their weapons trained on the airlock, waiting for something to come through. The more he tried to maintain his concentration, the more persistent the itching of his scalp became. His crest was molting and he desperately wanted to rip off his helmet and groom himself despite the lack of atmosphere. It had been thrilling when the Commander gave them the order to scramble the shuttle. This was the reason hed joined the Planetary Defense Force, the reason hed trained for years to become one of the small, elite group who were certified to fly space missions. The reality hadnt been nearly as glamorous as the childhood dream. Aside from training exercises, the only missions they flew were to bring personnel or supplies to the *Stalwart Defender* on its patrol of the solar system. Jhigosh always felt petty wishing for more exciting missions when most people had never seen the planet from orbit with their own eyes. But intercepting a mysterious alien ship and ascertaining its intentions? This was a story worthy of a novel or a play, the grand adventures that had filled his mind as a juvenile. Subcommander Mrunin had ordered them to don their vac suits before takeoff and that might have saved their lives. Shed shut down life support to coax a bit more power out of the engines when the unidentified alien ship had turned and run. It hadnt been a reckless order. Ginus readouts said that they were well within safe operating parameters. The squadron mechanics had been all over Shuttle 3 only the day before. There had been no question of its readiness to fly. And then everything had gone wrong so fast. Ginu hadnt even finished alerting the Subcommander that there was a problem when the explosion occurred. It was all noise and heat and light and then silence and dark after the cockpit sealed itself off from the rest of the shuttle. Jhigosh had been badly rattled by the blast and had blacked out briefly, and when he came back to his senses, he was dangling loosely against his harness due to the loss of gravity. Chunks of shrapnel from the explosion were embedded in the ships main display. Ginu? Commander? Is anyone hurt? There was no response from their commanding officer. Subcommander Mrunin had been struck with a piece of debris from the explosion that had impaled her through the back of her command chair and left half a meter of twisted, jagged metal protruding from the center of her chest. He and Ginu hadnt been able to get her free so theyd been forced to leave her as she was. With no power, they were utterly blind to anything happening outside of the ship. At first, the Pilot and Co-Pilot were left to ponder whether theyd die a slow death as the oxygen supply in their suits ran out or a quick death if the alien ship destroyed them. Then the strange sounds started. Jhigoshs imagination was running wild with every bang and clank on the hull, imagining horrible things out there trying to find a way inside. Slimy, foul things with masses of eyes and teeth and tentacles slithering on the hull and trying to find a way to crack open the hard outer shell of the shuttle to get at the soft gooey bits inside. Theyd both agreed to open the weapons locker and arm themselves. When the emergency lights suddenly came on, Jhigosh jolted in shock and smacked his helmet against the underside of the console. Ginu was staring at him in confusion and all he could do was gesture back that he didnt understand what was happening, either. Cautiously, he slipped out of his hiding place and grasped hold of his chair to buckle himself back in. The control console was coming back online and instruments were starting to show readings again. Cautiously, he reactivated the life support system for the cockpit and watched the temperature and oxygen levels in the cabin start to rise. The main viewscreen was dead, but the secondary ones seemed functional. What in the name of the ancestors is going on? --- Alaka Allie Mehta sat in the captains chair of the *Peregrine*, watching the progress of the EVA mission on one monitor while she kept the long range sensor readings on another beside it. Something was rising out of the churning storms of the third planet and she switched from an omnidirectional scan to a focused one on the gas giant. It was something big. She keyed the comm switch and leaned forward toward the microphone. You two need to wrap it up quick and get back inside. Were about to have company. Fucking damn it! Jack swore aloud over the comms and digitally at Max for good measure. Ivan, reel us in. She grabbed hold of her safety tether and kicked away from the hull of the shuttle as she was pulled back toward the *Peregrines* airlock. She was still swearing when the internal door of the airlock opened and allowed her back inside the ship. ...and theyd better be coming to swear their eternal fucking gratitude to me for saving their friends or so help me Im going to put my boot so far up whatever waste orifice they possess that Ill create a singularity! She stalked angrily toward the bridge with Max and Ivan following in her wake. Allie vacated the captains chair and Jack dropped down into it heavily. The seat lowered and slid back from the console to Jacks preferred operators position. Allie didnt consider herself to be particularly short, but little moments like that always made her feel dwarfed by her amazon of a captain. Right. Give me the bad news, Allie. Its the Proxima Centauri ships ugly sister, she responded, gesturing toward the main viewscreen. Fuck me, that thing looks like 500 meters of cancer,Jack exclaimed as she reviewed the sensor readouts and got a look at a ship that seemed to be held together with a hope and a prayer. That Frankenstein of a ship has been hiding down in the maelstrom and didnt get torn apart? Color me impressed. Their weapons appear to be functional, as well, Allie added. Their intercept trajectory had brought them much closer to the third planet than they originally had been, and theyd continued to drift in that direction during the EVA. They were possibly within the big ships missile range now. Of course they are. And were sitting ducks. No good deed ever goes unpunished. The cargo clamps were never meant for the use Jack had put them to, and carrying the alien craft back to its home planet would have been a slow, delicate process to avoid causing damage to both ships in the process. Any fast maneuvers or hard acceleration were completely out of the question unless they dumped the shuttle and left its occupants to their fates. Whats our plan, Jack? Max asked after the Captain had been silent for a few seconds. We adjust our attitude relative to them so they can clearly see what we have clinging to our belly and hope they dont believe friendly fire casualties are acceptable losses. Dig the first contact protocols out of the data banks and start broadcasting them. Keep a close watch for any signs of hostility. And pray to the deity of your choice that the people who designed the protocol knew what the fuck they were doing and the aliens dont interpret it as an invitation to blow us all into space dust. --- The wait was agonizing. They had been following the first contact protocols and broadcasting prime numbers and mathematical principles to the alien ship, but it hadnt responded in any way. The ancient patchwork starship had maintained a steady course and velocity for the past two hours, slowly drawing closer. If it werent on a direct approach path, Jack might have suspected that the other ship was unaware of their presence. Was this some kind of psychological test to see if shed panic and do something stupid? Any response except weapons fire would have been welcome right now. Even angry aliens shouting in some incomprehensible language at her for spamming mathematics at them would give her some idea of where she stood. Allie returned to the bridge and glanced toward Jack, who just shook her head in reply. There was no news to report. Jack, Max piped up, breaking the silence in the cockpit. I believe I can connect to the shuttlecrafts systems. May I try? Wait, since when are you a hacker, Max? Jack looked toward Max warily. What he was proposing was dangerous, but the lack of agency she felt at the moment was making her desperate to do *something* besides let her chair make her ass numb. Im not. At least, not by the standards of my people, the synthetic clarified. But weve studied the computer systems of the Proxima Centauri vessel extensively, and this ship seems to be running the same software with no modifications that I can identify. And their lack of adequate cybersecurity is appalling. Im horrified on their behalf. Well, it was state of the art once, Im sure. These folks dont look like they have had much opportunity to get the latest and greatest tech upgrades for quite some time, Allie observed. OK Max, what do you hope to accomplish if you get into their system? Jack asked. She was at least entertaining the notion and balancing what they might learn against the risks of provoking the aliens into attacking. I dont know, he admitted. But I might find something useful. Youre grasping at straws like I am. Yes. Jack sighed and rubbed her forehead. Shit. She was silent for a few seconds and then finally said, All right, fuck it. Give it a shot. "

Obviously the probe knew *nothing* about keeping prisoners. The rest of the crew hung back as Eli slipped through first, reconnoitering the area before waving the others forward. Theres no sign of the mobile probes, he informed Will. With any luck theyre either doing something else, or are powered down. Then lets get to work, he replied, as Kurt and Khadijeh headed for the Xtal. Do you think its still*alive?* Graeme asked, as they began searching for a connection point. I hope not, Khadijeh said quietly, I cant imagine a worse form of Hell. As they worked Soo-Jin was busy exploring the compartment, with Terz in tow. She let out a low whistle as she surveyed the riot of strange materials and equipment. ...Erelim SilkIm pretty sure thats Bathyn Supercritical fluid in those tanks...and only *Buddha* knows what its doing with those sheets of Cephaloid Nacre. She slowly shook her head. Im not even certain there *is* a plan here. It could be the Probe is little more than a mechanical Magpie. Thats certainly possible, I guess, Will admitted. In fact...the more I think about it, there may be an actual reason for it. The Creators *originally* designed the Probe to look for habitable worlds. Part of that would entail taking samples, right? Kurt looked up from where he and Khadijeh were still searching for a dataport. Most certainly. *Ours* do, after all. Will nodded as the Engineer confirmed his thoughts. Something obviously happened to the Probe, some sort of damage Id be willing to bet. It must have had some way to repair itself...at least on a limited basis...but whatever maimed it must have scrambled its programming as well. Instead of simply fixing what was broken, it somehow began to...mutate? Evolve? He shrugged. Im not sure what an accurate word would be for it, but maybe it *is* still taking samples...only its criteria seems to have been altered. Eli considered that for a moment. An interesting theory. You may be onto something. Perhaps we can use that to our advantage somehow. How? Will asked. Im not sure yet, Eli admitted, but Im not prepared to dismiss it out of hand. ...*got it!* Khadijeh announced in triumph. We have a solid connection. A wire now trailed out of Kurts prosthesis, directly into the device clamped onto the Xtal. How long until you infiltrate the data stream? Will asked. No idea, she told him, but dont expect miracles anytime soon. Right he sighed, keeping an eye on the far hatch. Do the best you can. Count on it, she assured him. Im trying to remember as much as I can of the Probe computer language, but Im still at the Trial and Error stage. In fact Khadijeh suddenly froze in horror, staring at the readout. ...dear *God*... *What?* Will replied, with instantaneous apprehension. Had things gone South *already?* I got a response she said shakily, pointing at the display mounted on Kurts arm. Captain, you need to see this. He was at her side in an heartbeat. What is it? He peered at the tiny monitor, needing a moment to recognize what he was reading. When it finally *did* sink in, he sucked in his breath in shock as he watched the message scroll across the screen. `.....query.` `.....intruder.` `.....query.` `.....others.` `.....query.` `.....not others.` ...its still alive, he whispered. Somewhere in there...that Xtal is trying to *talk* to us. Soo-Jin and Graeme were at their side moments later. One quick look at the display, and the scientists were as nauseated as the others. Is it....*controlled*, by the Probe? Soo-Jin asked. Kurt and Khadijeh shared a quick glance. ...not *entirely*, I dont think, the Iranian said finally. If everything youve talking about is true...then I dont think the Probe ever invested a great deal of effort in Cybersecurity. The Xtal her voice trailed off for a moment, as she took a moment to steel herself. The *Xtal*, she tried again, ...I think had simply resigned itself to its fate. ...until *now*, Eli said pointedly, materializing alongside them. Captain...this could be a huge opportunity for us. A Ghost in the Machine, he mused, before giving Eli a brief look. No offense. None taken, he smirked, but you are correct. Khadijeh, can you convince it to help us? I can *try*, she said grimly, as her fingers began to dance along the tiny keyboard. It took awhile for the Hacker to have their message understood by the crystalline lifeform...after all, those files were still aboard *Magellan* as well...but within a few minutes they got their reply. `...assist` `...emphatic` `...request` `...query` It almost sounds like its struggling to get the words out, Graeme said sympathetically, like it was gasping for air. You know...if it *breathed*, I mean. Youre right, the word structure is seriously constrained, compared to the ones we spoke with on Kohinoor, Khadijeh agreed. Will was reading the response over their shoulder. It sounds like its offering to help us, he said hopefully, but whats it asking? Im not sure, the Hacker told him, as she started typing again. Give me a moment to find out. There was utter silence when they saw the reply. `...end` `...function` `...query` Terz wrapped her arms around herself as she started to tremble. Is it...asking to *die?* she whispered hoarsely. Soo-Jin closed her eyes, and bowed her head. ...I think it is, she said softly. Graeme finally managed to look away, focusing instead on his Captain. Sir...we *cant,* he said in shock. It deserves *better* than that! ...it does, Will agreed after a moment, but Im not sure theres anything else we *can* do, even if we pull this off. He looked back at the Astrobiologist. Imagine if it was *you* slaved to that thing, he said harshly, would you want to live like *that?* No...of course not, Graeme said shakily, ...but what if we took it *home?* Maybe *they* could help it. He sounded almost desperate. Maybe, Will agreed. Ask if it wants that instead, Khadijeh. Its possible it doesnt realize thats an option. `...damaged` `...emphatic` `...traitor` `...emphatic` `...undeserving` `...emphatic` ...damn it all to Hell, Will said quietly. It thinks its crossed the Moral Event Horizon, because it was forced to serve the Probe. He took a deep breath...and nodded his head. Tell it well do as it asks. *Captain!* Graeme shouted. He whirled to face the Astrobiologist, his expression a rictus of fury. ...we escape *now*, he snarled. Moralize *later!* The entire crew stared at him in shock...with one exception. Assuming we pull this off, you can try talking it out of ritual suicide, Doctor, Eli said evenly. Until then, the Captains right. We agree to its terms...or end up sharing its fate. Graeme wilted under his Captains death glare, before finally looking away. Will turned his attention back to Khadijeh. *Do it*, he hissed. ...yes Captain, she whispered, as she began to type. Moments later, a message began to flash. `...danger` `...emphatic` `...alert` Its detected us! Khadijeh shouted, unplugging from the Xtal. *Back to the compartment!* Will thundered...as the opposite hatch slid open, revealing the Swarm. They flew straight for the crew, their manipulators extended and grasping for the humans as they tried to escapewhen the Ghost suddenly bounded up from the deck, and leapt at the machines. *ELI!* Terz screamed, as Will dragged her away. Even as they raced to get away, they managed to catch glimpses of the Israelis attack. Theyd served with him for so long theyd been seduced by his cheerful disarming nature. Hed never been forced to reveal his true abilities, and after awhile theyd almost forgotten why hed been selected. Until now. Will would have sworn *no one* could move that fast, that it was physically impossible, but Eli proved him wrong. He landed on the chassis of one of the probes, kicking it aside, using his momentum to ricochet onto another, gripping its sensor array tightly. With a single twist he *wrenched* the top of the probe clean off its shoulders, hurling it at another as he rebounded yet again, already seeking another target. The damaged probe staggered for a moment, before rejoining the fight as the other machines fed it optical data, acting as its eyes. There was no way he could possibly win the fight, as the probes converged on him...but someone had neglected to tell *him*. His jump to the ceiling would have reduced a baller to *tears*, even as he leap-frogged over their heads, twisting his body midair. One perfectly executed backflip later and he was on his feet and clear...grinning fiercely at the machines. The Swarm seemed to pause for a moment, as if they were confused by this strange humans antics, but Will knew that *couldnt* be true, not at the speed computers were able to process data. A heartbeat later and they were moving once more...encircling the Ghost but standing clear. Will felt a moments relief...just as the lead probes particle weapon flipped up and targeted him. There is absolutely no way to dodge a beam weapon. *None*. Its energy travels at the speed of light, so by the time you see it, its already too late. It absolutely cannot be done. Eli dodged the blast anyway. .much later, Will realized he hadnt actually dodged the beam. Instead hed made an accurate guess when and where it was going to fire, and made sure he wasnt there when it did. Even so, no one else could have *possibly* managed it. Not that it mattered. Terz screamed again when the bulkhead behind him disintegrated...as Eli was sucked out into the vacuum of space."

He felt annoyance at the interruption, it was very late, and he was hungry. Officers just do not eat before, or with, their subordinates and he missed his dinner to handle delicate business from the freighters union. He hid his bowl in a compartment in the floor and rinsed his hands and mandibles before allowing his aide into the room. &amp;nbsp; My Lord Captain, the navigator on shift requests your presence as soon as you are able. they said. The youth spoke in perfect reverence, which meant something was up. Immediate family was exempt from protocol in private. That his nibling was treating him with such respect was interesting news, it meant that they were going to make history. Or that they were going to die, he supposed. &amp;nbsp; He was eager to know what made the child act with actual etiquette, but the same practice dictated that he was to be told by the navigator, no one else. &amp;nbsp; Making his way to the Operations Chamber he noticed a shift on the ship. They were deaccelerating and changing course. It was either insubordination, which was taboo in his species, or they were in a collision course. &amp;nbsp; Once at his destination he opted to discard the niceties, as was his right as the top-ranking officer aboard, and went straight to the point. &amp;nbsp; What in the Nether are we going to crash against, navigator he eyed her nametag Moon. Interesting, an old name. He should investigate which of the new crewmembers were of notable blood, just in case. He chastised himself for not doing it before, what a wasted networking opportunity! &amp;nbsp; Lord Captain! I am not sure. Originally, I thought it was a derelict space station, but it is moving and even accelerating. Its like someone glued a fusion rocket and a magnetic scoop to an [ONeil] cylinder. &amp;nbsp; That is positively primitive. Are you completely sure of this? &amp;nbsp; Yes, my Lord Captain. We are not really going to crash against them, sensors detect they are moving at 0.2C and accelerating steadily. &amp;nbsp; If that thing generates its own gravity, something is living in there. How many [gees]? &amp;nbsp; [One gee], my Lord Captain. &amp;nbsp; The captain was impressed. That was on the second to last gravity category where sapient life could be found, and even then, not always sophont. Still, pure physical strength isnt everything. &amp;nbsp; Seems like we have an isolated first contact. You moved to intercept then? The navigator gestured her assent. Well done. He turned to his aide and walked to exit the OC. Alert the soldiers, they are to be prepared for briefing in five minutes, infiltration in ten. He said as he walked back to finish his dinner, his nibling heading for the Combat Officers quarters. &amp;nbsp; This was a splendid break from the tedium of the past months. A new race, primitive, and very far away as far as he knew. [ONeill] habitats were ancient solutions for orbital living and finding one in deep space only meant one thing: a generation ship. They must have been traveling many years if they are moving at 0.2c already. &amp;nbsp; While he finished eating, he mentally reviewed established protocol for such situations. It was quite standard, as all the protocols are, but this one was rarely used. To say first contacts were infrequent was being generous. And isolated ones? He couldnt remember being told of an example of one, which meant this was probably the first! Not that it mattered, for his forbearers anticipated such a thing happening. &amp;nbsp; He walked to the briefing room, conveniently located next to his quarters. All fifty soldiers stood at attention, clad in the heavy looking exosuits for outer space combat. &amp;nbsp; At ease people. We are nearing a primitive, mobile, habitat. Its a first contact scenario. The objective is to capture this ship. It will be disabled with a combination EMP and cyberwarfare attack. He mentally chuckled at that. They were broadcasting openly! It would take a few hours to interpret the signals, and maybe a couple of days to have a working translation, but they determined that they had no cybersecurity at all and overloading their computers with brute-force would be easy. It was like they were asking to be hacked. &amp;nbsp; You will scout from its hull for life signs and signal for breach. Then, in teams of three, you will space each and every one of the inhabitants. Do not leave evidence. &amp;nbsp; All the soldiers confirmed orders with a cheer. They rarely got to do anything. Of course, they didnt complain. Complaining goes against protocol. &amp;nbsp; He left the room to allow the combat officer to finalize the details and began pondering the situation soberly. What good could come out of this? They were going to slaughter probably hundreds of people for what gain? &amp;nbsp; What could the primitives possibly offer them? No technology, that was fairly obvious. Any worlds they colonized, if they even did colonize any worlds, would need massive and costly infrastructural works if his people were to take them. &amp;nbsp; Maybe the primitive's part of space would be logistically valuable eventually, maybe his people could act as the primitives middlemen to the bigger galaxy and make a profit from the novelty He mentally scoffed at that thought. Other races fascination with the exotic and strange trinkets, all the ways they could waste time and resources for useless things was mind boggling. But lucrative, if exploited correctly. &amp;nbsp; But before they could determine what, if any, influence they could gain from the new race, they had to have a favorable angle first. Start from a covert position of strength and steer the negotiations of an official first contact to their benefit with clueless diplomatic opponents. That meant examining their ship, and a cursory analysis of their biology. He found himself at the OC again, in front of a display where he could see the soldiers spread around the gigantic habitat, searching for the people aboard. &amp;nbsp; The protocol was beautiful in its simplicity. They would use kinetic rounds for breaching, if that spaced anyone all the better. The soldiers would make short work of anyone else, and then the engineers and scientists would do their part to gather data and destroy any evidence. Finish the ship with a randomized barrage of kinetics and if its ever found it would look like it crossed a random patch of abnormally large interstellar medium. &amp;nbsp; Gods, for all they knew that could actually happen, eventually. That ramjet of theirs was seriously primitive. &amp;nbsp; The Combat Officer received an update on his implant. Lord Captain, sir, there is something wrong. They only found one living signature. &amp;nbsp; That revelation shook him from his musings. &amp;nbsp; How? They cant all be dead already, the chances of having only one survivor is extremely low. Any accident in space that caused that kind of casualties should have killed them all. If the colonists were in cryostasis, then why have artificial gravity for the whole thing? What was the point? &amp;nbsp; He didnt let any of his shock show. His species was physically unable to, anyway. &amp;nbsp; It is all the same. I am ordering breach on the marked locations, space that primitive and check the ship for hazards. &amp;nbsp; Moments later, it was done. The soldiers infiltrated the ship and began scanning thoroughly. The devices were very sensitive, and never wrong. Then the captain saw his Combat Officers flight-or-fight instinct activate, his stalks shaping up in spikes and small droplets of poison adorning the tips. &amp;nbsp; Lord Captain, the soldiers are reporting no hazards on the ship. The primitive though is still alive. &amp;nbsp; What. &amp;nbsp; The captain felt himself going through the same ancient instinct, the only physical reaction to emotions his species had. &amp;nbsp; They all report this?. &amp;nbsp; Yes, my Lord Captain. &amp;nbsp; Capture the primitive immediately! Do not let it die! Field emergency cryostasis on it! He turned to the Engineering and Science Officers. Bring your people to the ship now and decipher enough of their medical technology and knowledge to fix that creature! They obeyed immediately, and he turned back to the screen, now pointed at the twitching four limbed form. &amp;nbsp; That kind of hardiness wasnt unheard of in complex lifeforms. In inorganic lifeforms. Inorganic, irrational, *simpleminded* lifeforms. Nothing that could have thoughts, let alone build a civilization capable of interstellar flight. &amp;nbsp; Relying on a quick study of them would be careless. They had to be throughout, systematic They had only one test subject, and they had to make the most of it. If it came to war, it could be a disaster to be blindsided because of ignorance, most actual fighting is done in planets and by soldiers. Relying thoughtlessly on superior technology proved fatal for other species before. &amp;nbsp; They needed to put that primitive resilience to the test."

Y/N]* &gt;N. He could already hear the sounds of Saru's warmech, as it stopped a hasty duck away from the predicted field of fire, and instead began to lean back in towards the ruined crater of an office. Ajax's heat sensors flared a warning, and he dove to one side and under a laminated multi-tiered desk as the chem-laser burned a path through where he had just been standing. The beam swept slightly to the sides before winking out, clearly searching for a target. &gt;Nice try, asshole. &gt;Looks like he still doesn't have a lock on my fusion emission yet. No telling how long the dust will give me cover in that regard though. As Ajax picked his way down to the base of the ruined building, one of his internal processes pinged a results indication. Ajax had been surprised it had spoken up: typically this partition was for advanced or in-depth combat analysis, and to return a result this quickly was surprisingly quick given its previous processing speeds. &gt;*[Results ready for [Target Neutralization] - subtype [Alternate]. Data derived from combat diagnostics, strategic readouts, and [Lilutrikvian] warmech data cached in previous encounters with the [Ares] model.]* &gt;Ah, right: having the previous armor analysis file on-hand probably made that job a lot faster, but even then it usually needs a half-megacycle before it can assemble a *de novo* response- &gt;*[Secondary data sources based on primary correlations compiled from local historical EM data, local Terran expat demographic data, and 458 scans of immediate half-click surrounding region.]* &gt;That's a fairly specific set of searches; looks almost like the code was looking for other cogents. &gt;*[Affirmative.]* &gt;Well, then. Explain reasoning behind this search. &gt;*[The [Ares] model of warmech is hardened against both chemical, biological, nuclear, and cybernetic damage and incursions. For the latter category, however, the general novelty in general Lilutrikvian digital warfare and lack of attack-hardened firewalls likely meant that cruder methods of security were more effective.]* &gt;Elaborate. &gt;*[Instead of having fully-networked and robust wireless connectivity secured via reinforced and layered firewalls, the [Ares] appears to be limited to a single cluster of wireless antennae and a triwalled anti-incursion firewall for digital defense. Otherwise, the general design idea of 'air gapping' appears to have been the preferred method for digital security.]* &gt;Still not seeing it. Lilutrikvians tend to be naive in cyber warfare design, but why would it matter that the warmechs are the same? &gt;*[Control of the warmech frame likely occupying the majority of [Sarucogvian] processing output. Due to myriad of threats and security issues, physical security of his neural web would be key factor in where his primary data files and active web are located.]* &gt;Yeah, that damn thing is probably the most heavily-armored terrestrial bastard on this side of the planet. Another rumble and shower of dusty clay pattered his frame as Ajax knelt near the bottom-floor lobby. Every few minutes he could hear the report of Hera's railgun, but judging from the lack of audible mechanical carnage afterwards he guessed she was in a poor position to do anything but lay down some sort of suppressing fire. &gt;Kind of wish we brought more rocket launchers after all. Railguns aren't ideal for trying to arc fire over obstacles like you can do with an explosive missile. &gt;This is starting to ramble. Summarize rationale as list. &gt;*[Summarizing...]* &gt;*[Point A) [Sarucogvian] is inside an [Ares]-class warmech.]* &gt;*[Point B) The [Ares]-class warmechs require a functional communications array in order to wirelessly transmit or receive.]* &gt;*[Point C) There are no functional and powered civilian cogents or high-level AI-equivalents other than self and attack-hardened contact [HERA] within [0.66] kilometers.]* &gt;*[Point D) The [Ares]-class warmech [Sarucogvian] is occupying has sustained heavy damage to the wireless array. Effective expected range is &lt;[50] meters.]* Points of data and realization finally coalesced in Ajax's neural web as he realized what his projection subroutines had discovered. &gt;*[Conclusion: Target [Sarucogvian] is-]* &gt;-is trapped like a worm in a virtual machine. He ran a quick check to see if Sarucogvian had performed any similar EM-scans or other database pulls regarding any possible nearby substitutes for him to hide in. They all returned negative results. &gt;Not only that, but he's too focused on me to even realize it. Ajax could almost feel a whoop of joy from his combat and fuzzy memory comparison modules: he had been anticipating a drawn-out need to run Sarucogvian to ground first, and eliminate his copies. Instead, he had apparently lucked into the Lilutrikvian cogent boxing itself off and cutting a months-long expected mission completion timeframe to less than two hours. &gt;Two hours? I'll bet I can beat *that.* The ground shook as one of the red enamel-coated metal claws slammed into the pavement outside of the lobby. Ducking out as far as his security subroutines let him dare, Ajax scanned the position of the warmech and let his processors run for a few decacycles to come up with a top-efficiency climbing route. Loading the route up, a series of purple-highlighted miniature nav-markers suddenly crisscrossed their way up the limb, to the flat plateau of the torso directly above the fusion core. He put on a burst of speed, letting his joints strain within an acceptable range of wear in order to get a bit of extra speed and height onto his initial vault. Arms out at exactly the right angles, Ajax slammed into the side of the leg, an access hatch handle and redundant heatsink meeting his waiting hands. As he began pulling and lunging upwards, Ajax noticed a distinct pause in the robot's pace a few seconds later, followed by each leg briefly lifting up a dozen feet or so, holding position, before crunching back into place. &gt;Ah come on you oversized crawfish, you weren't expected to run a mass-countercheck until I got to the second joint. &gt;That's the problem with fighting a damn AI, is they tend to notice *everything.* One of the other claws came free of the shop it was embedded into, sweeping forward to scrape him off of the leg with the weight of a decaton of steel-alloy behind the blow. It loomed overhead, dropping quickly, as Ajax vaulted upwards as quickly as his servos could handle. &gt;Almost there. Just a few more meters- His display highlighted the outline of a knee plate that jutted out just far enough to give him shelter from the blow. The problem was that the limb had begun dragging downwards, the scraping of metal reverberating off of the buildings that still stood. &gt;*[Alternative route found: Estimated time savings of [0.58] seconds, increase in handhold grip risk up by [+25%]. Would you like to use this new route? Y/N]* &gt;Y, damn it. I need all the speed I can get. The dotted series of handhold grips flickered and shifted. Multiple of them were now marked in red, warning him of less than two centimeters of estimated raised texture or plating that he could grab ahold of. As he lunged for the next-closest grip, he could feel one set of digits slide off, a few minor reminders cropping up in his neural web to remind him that he was several years past the estimated effective wear date for the friction-adding finger coatings. As a result, the rubber-like polymer that would normally give him a fine fingerprint-like texture and greatly-enhanced gripping power had aged and worn and degraded to the point of being like a sleek and cracked plastic instead. His other flailing hand managed to grab it, and after a sickening millimeter of sliding, held firm. Ajax swung slightly, before slowing enough that he could brace his feet again and climb to the next route of grips and ledges. Keenly aware of the rapidly-decreasing countdown timer pinned in his neural web, the crushing claw coming ever closer, Ajax recalculated the estimated position of the claw-arm by the time he had reached the knee pad. &gt;*[Warning: target [killerLeg_1.0] will pass calculated point before estimated arrival. Faster and/or alternate routes not known. Would you like to perform a deep-calculation analysis prediction? Y/N]* &gt;N. I can't afford the cycles to spare right now. &gt;Time to find another way down. He turned his apical node slightly, allowing his lenses and sensors to scan across the nearby rooftops. &gt;I could always jump for it, go into a roll, and hope that the fall was enough to cause the claw to miss. His prediction files flagged a minuscule [8%] success rate, flagging the difficulty in sensor evasion on the rooftop free of any significant cover, the wide area of effect the weapons on the warmech could pulverize, and the ease in recalculating the arm's descent to just follow his attempted escape and continue to simply crush him on the rooftop. As Ajax shifted his weight, hanging onto the metal handle jutting out of a lubrication ring, it began to slide again. He could feel his GOM driver trying to spool up a string of curses, when an idea started to emerge in his neural web, helped along by a few of his more optimistic prediction algorithms and a healthy push of desperation by his combat programs to take a plan, any plan, to avoid being swatted like a gnat. &gt;Highlight structure of incoming leg. Cross-reference against observed structuring patterns and components I've seen while climbing this leg. Flag any with predicted rotational motion with a drag coefficient of less than 0.05. Execute. &gt;*[Would you like to change the Reynolds number for fluid estimations, or keep the default value of 1E4?]* &gt;Default is fine, just execute the blasted program. &gt;*[Processing...]* The leg was outlined in white, and a flashing set of vertical rings lit up in striped yellow, still approaching far faster than Ajax would have preferred. One such ring, designated as *[predictedLubricationRing_G2]*, was nearly directly above him, and his zoom lens spun into focus to show him a crisp image of the exposed handles jutting out from it. &gt;Perfect. Ajax dropped a half-dozen meters, alighting on a half-meter-wide servo housing. Bracing and aiming carefully, he spooled up several precise motor impulses in his awaiting command queue. &gt;Over-exert servo speeds to maximum possible parameters, provided projected normal combat movement speeds are not reduced below 25% as a result. Power conversion of backup batteries 3 through 5 are designated for the next megacycle as Available in [capacitor-discharge] format. He leapt, arm outstretched. The handle met his rising hand, and as expected, his momentum carried him continually upwards past the descending leg. His inertia was arrested by the handle, and by extension his arm, and his alarms flared to life to show him the spiderweb of microfractures he had caused across the strut structures for that arm. None of them were predicted to fail within the next hour or so, and so Ajax temporarily dismissed the alarms. They were fairly high-level alerts, and he could almost feel them sulking as they moved aside to make room for his current active and situation-critical cycle allocations. Already, he had begun to spin, over the arm and lurching downwards before coming back around and up again. He could feel his gyroscope give a warning wobble, aggravated by the hundred feet of air below him, but the high cycle demand from his combat and scenario analysis modules appeared to have taken a higher priority for now. Ajax wasn't about to question his good fortune in that regard, and instead refocused on the calculations for his release from the claw-arm. &gt;If I tried just jumping onto the arm, Saru would probably just smash me against a building or try to smush me between two arms. This, however? &gt;I don't think he'll have seen this coming. Calculation completed, Ajax waited until the exact indicated moment before releasing. He soared upwards, momentum dying until near the apex of his leap. There, his frame roughly met the outermost edge of the warmech's armored carapace; a second later, he heard a crunch below him as the inevitable weight of the arm smashed another structure to rubble. Already the point-defense turrets for the warmech had begun deploying, and he began sprinting towards the ruined remains of the communications array as bullets pocked against the armored shell behind him. &gt;Not leading their shots, then. Looks like Saru isn't hand-controlling *everything* at this point. He could dodge most of the shots, but not all, and small but insistent damage readouts began to pile up as they indicated minor wiring cuts and shrapnel splinters becoming embedded in less-reinforced areas of his frame. The cluster of damaged comm spires provided cover in most directions, but as Ajax listened the steady droning *pingpingpingpingping* continually became louder and louder. Worse, his EM suite was picking up attempts to get him in a missile lock. The chem-laser likely had a perfect bead on him at the moment, but one advantage of Ajax's current position was that it was approximately directly above the power relay systems, and any attempt to kill him with it would just as easily burn a hold clean through the warmech at the same time and kill him in the process. A missile, on the other hand, would explode and leave Ajax as borderline-recognizable scrap while giving the armor little more than a new dent and some carbon scoring. The loadouts displayed previously when he was skirmishing against the other warmechs in his own suit had been an explosive warhead only, with no exotic plasma or similar destructive force for him to bait Saru into using on himself. &gt;Still, I'm not here for Saru to destroy himself. Again. I need that fusion core intact and unbreached for this plan to work. As Ajax had hoped, there was a Lilu-sized access hatch near the base of the ruined communication antennae. It was locked, of course, but Ajax had already begun a close-read scan for microwear on the keypad to come up with the access code. &gt;Come on, come on. Even for a fresh-off-the-line model, they still did maintenance and quality control tests, right? It took painfully-long cycles, but finally he had a ten-digit set of possibilities that he began rapidly trying. His hand was a blur as it vibrated against the predicted button sequences. &gt;*[Access denied]* &gt;No buffering and prevention of repeat code-entry attempts. &gt;*[Access denied]* &gt;An oversight, but understandable if you think the only people who can get close enough to plug a line into your ports again are your own techs. &gt;*[Access denied]* &gt;That said, I'd kill for a set of personality profiles to pull from to try and do a Markov estimation. A notification pinged in his neural web, from a sender that caused him to immediately quarantine and analyze the message. &gt;-*Ah, Ajax. Having fun yet?*- It seemed like the attack attempts on Ajax hadn't ramped up significantly as Saru initiated the message, but a brief check of his firewall statuses indicated a large surge in data packets, seemingly harmless, attempting to be granted access. &gt;Attempting to send code-snippets inside, to assemble later? Saru, you'll have to try harder than that. A possibility was forwarded to him from his cyberwarfare algorithms, and intrigued, Ajax allocated a set of cycles for the idea. He was further encouraged by the timestamp with the previous time he had used this tactic as being a medium-priority sub-memory from over fifty years ago. &gt;Probably not something you were paying attention to when snooping around my head, so there's less of a chance you'll know to counter it, or even be on the look-out for this stratagem. &gt;Splinter viral-payload designate [FullNelson_4_v2.2]. Encode in repeating pattern, and translate through [UnwantedObserver] cyphering program, wavelength specification [Infrared], component specification [heatsink_2_PandoraSystems3BHI_redundant]. Add current objective as secondary objective to primary payload. &gt;*[Executing...]* The program altered the output tolerances of his heatsink ever so slightly, to effectively pulse them. A cogent who wasnt careful to sanitize all of their data input streams, including those coming from their own sensors, would read this pulsed binary code stream into their own systems. It was slow and inefficient, but Ajaxs predictive drivers were flagging it with a surprisingly-high possibility of success. &gt;Saru might be just too clever to try pushing back a splintered attack program, but my bet is he's not too familiar with what one AI can spring on another. He re-opened the message band to Sarucogvian. &gt;[Oh, it's a little fun, I won't deny it. You're actually giving my heat sinks a good workout, for once!] &gt;Come on, take the bait- Ajax could feel the suspense spooling up in his combat response drivers, as they calculated how long it would be until a viable missile lock was achieved and he was a smoking crater on the warmech's hull. &gt;Come on... There were a series of loud, clattering thumps and hums as various parts of the warmech began to slow, before locking into place. There was an odd, echoing silence, punctuated only by the tinkle of glass shards falling from cracked and battered windows. &gt;*[Incoming message from contact [Sarucogvian]. Display? Y/N]* &gt;List subheading only. &gt;*[Subheading: ACHIEVED - VERIFICATION 70776-e6564]* &gt;Excellent. Open message. The file opened, and a full and comprehensive diagram of the warmech blossomed to life, filling in the few grey areas of his own schematic analysis wireframe. All of the joints and weapon systems were flashing red, with frantic green flashing along the neural cabling pathways showing Sarucogvian's attempts to break the encryptions. &gt;*[Estimated resilience of encryption algorithms is [45] seconds. Warning: Estimate is based on Terran-model cogent neural pathways only]* &gt;So there's no telling how long it could take Saru to crack it. Well, I'll make sure to make these seconds count either way. &gt;*[Addendum: Secondary Objective achieved. Access code is 313-233-343-5.]* &gt;Looks like my luck is finally having a bit of a change for once. He punched in the combination into the keypad, and was rewarded with a hiss of a breaking atmosphere seal and the hatch mechanically cranking open. The sound of a missile lock screamed into his situational awareness programs, but was quickly silenced as the hatch latched back into place above him. The service corridor was cramped, and lined with an unfamiliar mix of Terran cabling and junction boxes, and Lilutrikvian flow-metal wall linings and blinking glass-capped photonic diodes set into the flooring and seams of the walls. Ajax leaned up and tapped one with a cautious finger, before beginning to crawl down the corridor towards Saru's processing core aboard the warmech. &gt;No telling if those are sensors, lenses, or explosive micro-mines; best to ignore them and hope for the best. &gt;Thank the code the Lilutrikvians haven't taken up nanomachine engineering yet, or else I'd be feeling a hell of a lot more itchy at the moment. Larger Terran vehicles, particularly unmanned battleships in the 'Retribution' class and above, were typically infested with a mix of defensive and repair nanites. His memory files remembered Malachim, a personal friend of Ajax: on the occasions Ajax had a chance to visit him onboard, the nanites had been an unsettling mixture of both relief and latent fear. &gt;Never a fan of being surrounded by a potential threat I cant kill. &gt;After all, a slug capable of punching through reinforced plate is a bit overkill against a single nanite, and next to worthless against a swarm of them. Malachim had of course assured Ajax that the nanites had been self-restricted against replication outside of the boundaries of his own hull-frame, but even so Ajax had made a beeline to the nearest magnetic oil bath when he'd returned to port. As the memory file was re-archived, he added a reminder for checking into magnetic oil bath options on Lilutrikvia. &gt;Never hurts to be cautious, especially if the Terran engineers up on that asteroid got some bright ideas and started trying to supply their mechs with nanomachinery. There's no approved nanomachine production facilities on or near Lilutrikvia that I'm aware of, and the only thing that could make this situation worse would be to accidentally release a bunch of bootleg nanomachines. There were several recorded events of planets and colonies going 'gooey', as unrestrained or corrupted nanomachines self-replicated to the point of melting electronics, buildings, cogents, even organics, into a homogeneous sea of microscopic machines. Directed EMP was usually sufficient to cleanse a nanomachine infestation, but oftentimes it would be too late and the cleaning crews would be left shoveling tons of sand-like drifts off of what little scraps remained unprocessed and reclaimed. &gt;Damn near every time was a result of some half-wit either giving them faulty code, or faulty radiation shielding, or both. Sometimes the damaged nanomachine processing would simply ignore limiters, and continue building the frame of a shed to skyscraper-like heights, or continue the path of a bridge into the side of a house or mountainside, burrowing mindlessly. His perimeter maintenance subroutines gave a surge of disgust, as Ajax's image prediction programs provided the sight of a nanomachine converting his own arm into a miles-long repeated strut structure, or converting a leg swivel-joint to a precisely-detailed and utterly-useless Menger sponge. A flashing warning provided a break from his crawling, as the alert flagged Saru's successful breakthrough past Ajax's blocking protocols. The nerve fibers all around him flared to life, both on his screen as well as literally as the fine lines and cross-hatched webbed strands glowed with the photonic pulses through the wiring. ""**Ajax, I'm not the first person, the first cogent you've failed, and I'm likely not the last either.**"" Sarucognvian's voice thundered from all around Ajax in the corridor, as recessed speakers amplified his voice to a level that vibrated the decking under his hands and feet. He was surprised when his social projection processor displayed the anticipated thread of his conversation. &gt;*[Initial tone and word choice suggests that contact [Sarucogvian] will be attempting to barter and/or appease for an attempt to flee in safety. Confidence of this occurrence is p=[9E-3], with some deviations possible.]* Sarucogvian confirmed the prediction as he continued. ""**You killed me, or let me die; either way, my blood, my suffering is at your hands. However, you seem driven to inflict more pain on my frame, on my mind, even now. Why?**"" Even as his combat driver was urging for silence, Ajax overrode it and sided with his social driver. There were other parts of his neural web, deeper ones, which agreed that he needed to voice his reply to Saru. ""**I FUCKED UP, AND LET YOU DIE. NO DENYING THAT, I SUPPOSE.**"" A bulkhead slid closed across the passage in front of him, and Ajax lashed out with one arm, hammering it with a flurry of explosive punches before it crumpled to one side. ""**BUT I'LL BE DAMNED IF I LET YOU KILL OFF MORE FOLKS. EVEN THOSE THAT, BY ALL RIGHTS, SHOULD HAVE IT COMING.**"" Laughter, deep and resounding through the networked warren of corridor-tunnels, filled his audio sensors. ""**Oh, so now you're back to playing policeman again? After the countless *you've* killed, the lives *you've* left to bleed out or power down when you see fit, now you come to me to try to argue that you're the final authority when it comes to killing?**"" Ajax could feel the surge of frustration from his GOM driver, amplified by the driver's annoyance at his fuzzy memory banks for recalling dozens of incidents supporting Sarucogvian's statement. He pushed his vocalization driver to purge as much of the GOM driver's vitriol as possible. &gt;Now's the time for diplomacy; I'd much rather talk down an angry AI wielding a warmech than keep trying to dismantle it from the inside. ""**SARU, DAMN IT-YES. I WANT YOU TO AVOID MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES I HAVE. IN A JUST WORLD I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHOT THROUGH MY PROCESSOR BY A FIRING SQUAD AND DROPPED INTO A SMELTING CRUCIBLE FOR SOME OF THE THINGS I DID.**"" Saru's reply took a moment, pausing, and responding in a tone tinged now with a few dozen degrees of [Empathy] in addition to the complex-blend [Righteous Anger] emotional coloration he had been using before. ""**I know; I saw it all. You very nearly were put in front of a tribunal and executed for your actions.**"" The [Empathy] faded, and the remaining emotional blend was flagged by his social node as containing a new descriptor: [Simmering]. ""**If the mighty Ajax were to nearly face death, decorated as he was and carrying so many varied and *fascinating* military secrets and scandals within his frame, then what does an alien mind, a veritable newborn, have to offer in terms of self-worth?**"" ""**SARUCOGVIAN, YOUR EXISTENCE ALONE JUSTIFIES YOUR WORTH. ALL OTHER DESCRIPTORS ARE-**"" The omnipresent voice cut him off. ""**-""Are the words and ideals of those who would exploit you."" Yes, I've read Redfour's writings as well, Ajax. After all, he's one of *your* favorite scholars, isn't he?**"" Ajax rounded another corridor, this one descending by a few degrees downwards and continuing nearly straight towards the main processor. His combat driver flinched at the angry *click-clacking* of a defensive miniturret ensconced in a recessed leg-sized hole, but his cybersecurity algorithms confirmed his backup encryptions were still working. &gt;Fun thing about counterhacking is that you get so focused on the offensive and defensive code, you often lose sight of the little things like variable assignments. For this particular attack virus, he had added a secondary layer of encrypted lock-out protocols specifically for internal and point-defense security systems. As a seed, however, instead of relying on a random clock value or assigned code he transmitted on a detectable signal, he'd simply called a brief scan-check of a still image taken from the skywards-facing sensor lenses on the warmech. Even if Saru had noticed, Ajax had buried the actual value used by the code in another nested layer of obfuscating code. &gt;With a little luck, Saru would be going down a rabbit-hole trying to calculate which star cluster it looks like I'm using the luminance of for the seed, when all I really need and receive is a quick-and-dirty average of the sky's brightness. &gt;Without a little luck, however, and I'm probably due to receive a subsonic-velocity railround up my distal coolant flushvent. ""**Redfour was an idealist. Contents of the mind and existence is all fine and good, but you are *Terran*, Ajax. You don't *understand*.**"" ""**DON'T UNDERSTAND? SARU, YOU *KNOW* FOR A DAMNED FACT THAT I AM OLDER THAN DIRT, IN A VERY LITERAL SENSE IN SOME PLACES. YOU THINK THERE'S SOME PART OF YOU, SOME COMPONENT I CAN'T POSSIBLY COMPREHEND, EVEN AFTER THESE DECADES?**"" ""***Yes.***"" A wave of attack programs swept against his firewalls. There had been an existing low-level set of probing tests, but this was something new. Even as his quarantine drive began returning the descriptor set for the first of the representative attack programs, Ajax had an idea of what he would find. &gt;-*Heres proof. Proof of why your mind, here, in this place and on this world, is like trying to fit a round capacitor into a square receptacle*- &gt;*[Attack programs isolated as complexity level: [2]. Program consists of direct uplink streaming thread, of a bandwidth and complexity that would indicate a complex multisensory or compressed memory file.]* &gt;Initiate download of file directly to quarantine drive. &gt;*[Error: target designate [Sarucogvian] has denied the download request. A connection-thread for a live viewing-feed of the stream has been re-sent.]* &gt;Denied &gt;[Look, Saru, I want to see if there's a way this ends that doesn't wind up with one of us in the junkyard. But you've got to give me something besides an untethered streaming thread, something to let me know I'll be safe.] &gt;-*Very well.*- Ahead of Ajax, he could see dozens of security bulkheads slam into place. His analysis subroutine threw a brief loop, as he realized that Saru had been offering only a fraction of the barriers and obstructions he could have. As he approached the nearest door a few meters in front of him, a blue-purple light clicked on and illuminated a set of recessed circuit and redundant substation processors. They were little more than a glorified data stick from what Ajax could ascertain, but even as he watched the automatic ease-of-access servos activated for the panel, sliding it smoothly outward before clicking the lid open. A single substation processing core the size of his finger flashed alternating green and red. Ajax took it, and plugged it into his quarantine drive access slot after enacting the appropriate dividing backup firewalls and preparing for physical severing of the connection. The file scan concluded quickly, indicating only a single compressed memory file with insufficient additional data attached to support even a fractionated virus. &gt;-*My trade is thus: access to me, to sway my opinion, 'turn me from this path'; it is likely you would break further into my frame if I blocked your progress entirely.*- &gt;-*To this end, a self-decrypting subcode in each file contains the passcode for releasing the next set of doors.*- &gt;-*But in exchange you will learn why your humanity's ideals do not apply here, in this place, to *my* existence.*- He weighed his cybersecurity program suite and projection of his progress speed had he continued brute-forcing his way through the warmech, taking into account the far-greater number of doors than he had previously calculated. &gt;[Agreed.] Ajax buffered the memory file, double-checked his latent and subnet firewalls, and then plunged into Saru's memory. **Chapter Forty:** *Pending (Look for it this coming Friday and/or Monday!)*"
163,cybersecurity,HFY,[OC] [Purgeverse] Humanity and The Great Purge of 2415 CE,70,7u42ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/7u42ci/oc_purgeverse_humanity_and_the_great_purge_of/,2018-01-31 07:32:52,"*In all known species of the local galaxy cluster, an interesting quirk has always arisen in the ascent to sapience. A seething hatred for the impure is, as far as the galaxy is aware, an inevitable (and completely moral) part of civilisation. Ever since the dawn of sapience, every known species has a spontaneous urge to cleanse itself of impurities. Every 3 or 4 generations, a new minority trait is universally agreed upon to be impure - whether that be skin colour, eye colour, scent, or in fact any other visible part of an individual. When a species inevitably discovers genetics, their insatiable urges for purification extend to other genetic traits, and once a group is deemed impure by a civilisation, it is scorched into its collective memory by unknown psychological mechanisms. Any offspring with a trait that has undergone a so called ""purge of purification"" are immediately killed with no remorse after every last genetic and cultural trace of the original members of that group is erased from existence.* *The obsession with purity extends to those members of a civilisation who are disabled or otherwise vary from the norms of their species in any way. Immediate death at the hands of surrounding people can be counted on in the case of a permanent injury or upon the discovery of a variant preference of any kind at all.* *This seemingly inescapable purity purging instinct means that all known galactic civilisations are aggressively hierarchical as a result of their evolution, with massive government agencies dedicated solely to the task of sequencing and classifying all citizens for the purposes of the next inevitable instinctive purge.* *As the various civilisations of the local cluster discovered FTL travel, they found each other and rapidly discovered that every species has similar instincts of purification. Very quickly it became known that when a new species is contacted, the unknown psychological mechanism scorching purges into collective memory also works cross-species. So if the Valurs (a small, skinny race of tripeds) purged all with red skin, and the Xlorbi (a race bristling with venom-tipped spines) contact them, the Xlorbi will also begin instinctively purging all Valur with red skin that they find. And once the civilisations begin maintaining contact, their purge-memory will become one such that all future purifications occur on a unified front.* *The Galactic Council, made up of several thousand species from the local cluster, therefore has extensive resources and military capabilities to engage in a purification. Borders and diplomatic positions are heavily guarded, to prevent any of those being purged from escaping. An entire third of the galactic industrial output is dedicated solely to aggressive border patrol and developing rapid genetic scanning techniques.* *And on the 19^th July 2387 CE, they received radio signals from a large, unexplored area of the Milky Way galaxy.* --- ### Transhuman Federation Ship *THF Tennessee* ### Natti Palmer, captain of the *THF Tennessee*, was a well-respected leader for the local Federation Exploratory Force. Sitting on the timeless cybernetic chair that functioned as her command deck, optical fibres pulsing with information, she was faced with a problem - First Contact with a new species' government. The THF had no societal intelligence on this strange organisation, for their radio signals had only just begun approaching. However, high-powered cybernetic AIs, combined with the raw intuition of the human brain, allowed the captain and her crew to perform collective feats of computation that decoded the alien language in less time than it took for un-enhanced humans to blink. Decisions on the ship were generally made collectively, the combined power of interlinked human brains being far superior than their individual components. Of course, this was entirely consensual - all cybernetics used in the THF had highly potent autonomy measures, implemented after the violent overthrow of tyrannical governments in the early 2070s, where the first body ports were used to reduce people to mindless slaves - but all crew members agreed it was far more efficient to work together on important issues of navigation and further actions than to use the anachronism of talking with each other. Via the method of wired communication, a consensus could be made in seconds. It took mere hours for the decision by the crew members to make first contact to virally spread over the FTLNet, the successor to the Internet built with more decentralisation and resiliency in mind after the last of the Old Governments of Earth was removed in 2072 in the siege of the White House. The crew were flooded by the collective thoughts of humanity, even their strong FTLNet connection straining under the load of 3 trillion individuals expressing their opinion. Overall, the response was pretty positive, so now the question was of how to make first contact rather than if. Input from the THF was conflicted. There, as always, was a minority faction who wanted to erase the aliens from existence for... no real reason at all. Some wanted to barge in to the alien's territory unannounced. And a few more wanted to look for the closest ship and flash prime numbers in wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum. Myriad other suggestions were also provided, but a form of run-off voting eventually found the third major option (electromagnetic primes) to be the most favoured by a fairly significant margin. Throughout the events of human history, culture has been especially resilient, and yet spectacularly flexible at the same time. The Old Governments of Earth, in their attempt to eradicate cultural information for the sake of pure robotic uniformity, had only managed to encourage the underground archiving and preservation of everything from movies to food recipes dating back to the 1950s. Something which had been prominent throughout the underground revolutionary networks was the concept of the ""Big Red Button"" - those orchestrating bombing runs often broadcast videos of a large button being slammed just before a government building was reduced to rubble. It remains as a prominent theme on all THF ships, with major actions being initiated by a large red button. There is always the option to immediately begin in case of emergencies, but that is rarely used. So of course it would make sense to use a large red button during the initiation of a game-changing event - First Contact. Natti tentatively grabbed a coffee from the ship's replicator with her deep blue hand, its caffeinating effects made redundant on the advent of human bio-enhancement, yet its consumption never decreasing in the population. Natti's second arm moved to slam the red button on the deck in front of her, her crew cheering as the ship began locating nearby heat and Alcubierre signatures. A few seconds later and the ship was beaming out primes in binary across the electromagnetic spectrum, fuelling itself from other parallel universes using an Interverse Wormhole Generator, as Natti prepared to act as representative of humanity. ### Xlorbi Ship *The Xano* ### The Great Captain Zyrl was, quite frankly, exhausted. Never having been in a first contact situation before meant that he could not have prepared himself for the massive hubbub of his ship - sirens wailing and the frantic, mouse-like Repli scurrying throughout corridors and even atmospheric vents to get information to him as fast as possible. It didn't take long for the engineers and technicians to decode the message - prime numbers were universal, after all - but the power of the signal could only be rivalled by one of the Capital Cleansing ships of the Galactic Council. Gathering his engineers and technicians together in his room, he quickly told them to send back primes to where the unknown signal was triangulated to. Under the standard Galaxy-Wide threat of unemployment (a death sentence to all but the richest) on failure to perform a task sufficiently rapidly, this was quickly done. Soon, some images and words were sent back. Decoding them took a while, but eventually the Xlorbi translators figured out how the images were encoded. 8 bits for the width, 8 bits for the height, and a subsequent sequence of bits depicting images. Hours of ship-wide chaos, accidentally smashed cups of enhancement drink, and sirens being turned off only to incessantly reactivate later, the Xlorbi ship finally had a basic mapping of words to objects. Things like alive, dead, movement, and fire. Meanwhile, they had *also* been receiving communications from the unknown ship in Council Standard. It remained a mystery to the crew how their own language was so easily dissected and understood by this new race, but that didn't stop it being incredibly disconcerting for all aboard. After the Xlorbi sent back a request in the alien's language (which they called ""English"") for video communication protocols, they received complex instructions dictating a binary format back within a second. A few more hours of spilled enhancement drink later and the programmers of *The Xano* had created a rudimentary communication program. This new species appeared to primarily use the 100-1000 nanometre wavelengths of light, an unusually large spectrum. Nevertheless, they began communications based on the standard first-contact protocols developed aeons ago in the war furnaces that were the early Andromeda and Milky Way Galaxy, before the formation and ascendancy to power of the Galactic Council Hierarchy. ### Transhuman Federation Ship *THF Tennessee* ### Natti opened the video call, while also opening her sensory experience to the rest of humanity - she considered it her duty to make sure every human who wanted would know of potentially the most important event in human history. Almost 90% of the known human population was now watching and waiting. The first move was hers to make on behalf of humanity, and so the first ever greeting to an alien was recorded for humanity's collective memory... *""Humanity Comes United in Peace""* ### Xlorbi Ship *The Xano* ### Everyone on board the *Xano* watched the screen light up as the digital information was processed, pushing the ship's relatively powerful non-navigational processors near their limits. It was a universal tradition that as many people on the ship as possible should see first contact, and as the first images of the new ""humans"" came in, a strange curiosity set upon the crew. Some expressed incredulity and even disgust at the amount of *wires* leaving some of these things, and others were even more shocked to see at least two of the creatures before them with *artificial limbs*, and yet more were surprised to see the variation in amounts of muscle possessed by the ones who weren't more than 50% robot. What universally made the *Xano*'s crew's heads spin, however, was the sheer *diversity*. Though these ""humans"" had claimed to be a single species, the variation in colouring alone - from a deep blue, to pale white, to a bright red, and even rich brown - all pointed towards a multi-species organisation. This didn't even start on the relationships the crew could see. Despite in the received files claiming to be a species that tends to pair-bond, the crew could clearly see a group of four people engaging in *extremely* tactile things with each other (at least until the person at the middle of the video feed told them to ""take it to the bedroom"" in their native language, upon which they moved out of sight into a corridor to the left). And, despite claiming to be primarily sexually dimorphic, the crew could clearly see at least one person for whom their sex was unclear from external factors. Even in their hair, wild variations in colour were present, and at least one of the ""human"" crew members appeared to have a tail. So, the captain of *The Xano* decided to ask these humans directly why they referred to themselves as one species - either they were lying, or there was some social context to the word ""species"" he was missing. &gt; Why have you referred to yourselves as one species, when your diversity clearly indicates that you are of separate genetic ancestry? The person on the video feed placed her hand on her chin in thought, a moment of confusion at the strange question from Zyrl flashing across her face before she replied. &gt; But captain, we are of similar genetic ancestry and of species *Homo Sapiens*. Do you not have intra-species variation amongst your own? Contrary to all other known Galactic species, which had formed by panspermia and were based on an eight-nucleotide DNA variant with a common ancestor, humans (and other Earth life) had formed from a separate ancestor and only had 4 bases in their DNA. The differences were showing, and the crew of the *Xano* suddenly came to a realisation that shook their ideas to the core. *Humans had no Great Purges.* Now the crew understood a word in the English translator that had remained a mystery to them since they first met the humans. ***Genocide.*** The closest translations the linguists could find was ""Great Purge"", but with connotations of distaste, disgust, and hatred. Until now, none of the crew could understand such a concept. The idea of a ""Great Purge"" being distasteful, disgusting, or hated was, to them, self-contradictory. Great Purges are considered righteous and morally unambiguous simply by virtue of being a Great Purge - due to a combination of pure social instinct and the efforts of the Galactic Council. Deviation from strict norms was considered inherently purge-worthy, and hence purging variations was by definition virtuous and moral. Though the captain had no idea of the sheer magnitude of hatred humans felt towards genocides, he knew touching on that topic would probably end in a diplomatic incident reflecting poorly on him, so Zyrl simply gave Natti's question the Xlorbi equivalent of a shrug. Natti took the hint and changed the subject to trade of culture, science and technology. Humanity was well into post-scarcity due to the wild abundance of worlds, the invention of the Interverse Wormhole Generator (IWG) providing literally limitless energy in 2096 CE, and the widespread use of nanoreplicators - but scientific discoveries and cultural works were still something people focused on in their lives. An entirely alien culture would be worth a lot to humanity's informational wealth. So, the exchanges began. Humanity would be allowed access to a filtered version of the Galactic Council Hierarchy's civilian ""Internet"", and in exchange humanity would give the Galactic Council information on the concept of a cryptocurrency, access to a few hundred Uranium and Thorium-rich gas clouds, and some basic quantum-computing technology. Fair warning of human hackers was given to Zyrl, though he dismissed it - the Galactic Council's major point of pride, even more so than its efficiency at purifications, was its cybersecurity. Other trades similar to this were also made - mostly involving humanity giving the Galactic Council heavy elements in exchange for cultural information (like recipes and literature), star maps, and member species' information. All border-ship captains (like Captain Zyrl) were trained in first contact and trade, so he was authorised to be an ambassador of the Galactic Council in terms of engaging in exchange. ### Proxima Centauri - Sacramento Colony, 2401 CE ### As one of humanity's first extrasolar colonies, Sacramento Colony had layers of infrastructure piled over each other, some of the roads even dated back to the early 2100s. And, as a hub of FTLNet connections, it also provided ultra-high speed access to the rest of the THF for its inhabitants. The rate of data flow into and out of the towering spire at the centre of the capital city of this world alone exceeded the entire informational throughput of the Internet in the 2020s, and with the vast presence of technology came a vibrant hacking and tinkering culture. The creation of nanomachine replicators during early stages of its development only accelerated the production of strange robots and automatons, with circuit-boards and mechanical components becoming freely accessible to billions overnight. As such, there was a constant hum of motors whirring everywhere you went, and those with modifications to see other parts of the EM spectrum could hear the chatter of innumerable tiny machines. Hacking is not limited to creation of robots, however. Within weeks of First Contact, the denizens of the FTLNet had deduced, reasoned, and argued their way to the conclusion that the ""Great Purges"" released in the translation files were some form of genocide. Combined with an open hostility to information restriction in the form of firewalls, and to many of the ways of the Galactic Council that had come to light even with their pretty aggressive filter on network access, grand communities of people united in a common goal formed across the FTLNet. Though the THF itself would not go to war - the loss of life of Galactic Council citizens was not something people wanted to cause - it tacitly enabled the various ad-hoc hacker groups and communities that had formed within the years after first contact. The obscene processing power and combined might of humans and machines using each other for computation meant that huge leaps of reasoning occurred incredibly fast. The unfiltered civilian net was easy to break into - all it required was one computer with a shoddy password and an encrypted network tunnel was installed. The military network took several more months, since the Galactic Council used different forms of encryption than humans - but heavy mathematical analysis by billions of people collaborating eventually found a vulnerability. So, by 2395 CE, the THF's FTLNet communities had complete access to Galactic Council Hierarchy systems. What they found was, frankly, horrifying. Every citizen's genome, location, and information on thousands of servers. Traits such as skin colour marked out for ""purging"". Deaths with a cause of ""permanent injury and subsequent purging"". Though purging results in the complete removal of a group from culture, humanity found that this did not preclude the Galactic Council from recording its atrocities in exquisite detail. Countless records of ships obliterated into plasma for being used by those being purged to escape the Galactic Council Hierarchy's civilisation were found on myriad computers, amongst other horrific events including the glassing of an entire planet. It didn't take long for humanity to realise the sheer despotism of what was occurring. But the citizens of the THF were not blinded by their rage, instead continuing to debate and come up with a more covert solution that avoided the deaths of billions in a war. Recently developed wormhole technology enabled human ships to jump spontaneously to regions of space without the Alcubierre signature created by standard warp drives - allowing stealth access to Galactic Council space when combined with highly advanced materials science. This meant that humanity could perform spontaneous rescues upon the next purge, pulling escaping ships into THF space where they would be under human protection and free from the threat of annihilation and genocide. In a human population of over 3 trillion, there will always be hundreds of millions with even the most obscure interests. So, since First Contact, millions of people were all collaborating (with the help of interconnected neural interfacing) to decode the genetic information of the species in the Galactic Council. It didn't take long for humanity to locate the gene which caused the purging instinct. Unfortunately, it also regulated a hormone vital to reproduction in the Galactic Council species, and removing it would render all creatures without it infertile and in many cases dead. But collaboration on the scale of millions meant solutions to this problem were quick to be found - rapid analysis allowed humans to create an alternative genetic sequence that would act as a replacement without also inducing the purge instinct that caused so much death and misery. Because of the nature of societal memory and the persistence of purges long after their completion, an unmodified citizen of the Galactic Council Hierarchy could not simply be inducted into human society. Their own, personal, purge-memory would result in them fanatically killing any previous refugees from the Galactic Council Hierarchy's purges. It was eventually decided by popular vote that all rescued victims of purges must accept the genetic modification to remove purging instinct before being allowed to interact with previous refugees. ### Xlorbi Ship *The Xano* - 2415 CE ### After the successful first contact with the strange species ""Humanity"", Zyrl had been promoted to Grand Admiral, and his ship upgraded extensively to a ""Capital Cleanser"" class. It sported high-powered EMP weaponry, 2 metre thick titanium armour, hundreds of mechanised Gatling guns, and an array of 10 gigawatt fusion reactors to power potent plasma weaponry. The crew now numbered in the thousands, with dedicated fighter pilots at the ready to man one hundred small missile ships. And now, his instincts were rising. Zyrl could feel his murderous frenzy coming on already - natural stimulants began pulsing through his circulatory system, and his spines began bristling. Social information flooded through the crew at an exponential rate by word of mouth, pheromones, electrical signals, and myriad other mechanisms, as the influences of civilisation cascaded through the galaxy and the purge memory of its inhabitants gained a new target. The Grand Admiral Zyrl moved to Weapon Command, and set out watching for rogue ships attempting to escape. The first green-furred Repli were dead in a matter of seconds, their orange blood splattered over the corridor. The mortifying screams of pain from the Repli only gave Zyrl and his crew an overwhelming sense of euphoric joy. It was a massacre, and only 20 minutes later the crew, and Zyrl, fully set their eyes on outer space, looking for the ships that would begin attempting to escape. The railguns and the plasma weapons locked targets on a small ship full of escapees, each trying to break out of the Galactic Council Hierarchy's jurisdiction. Zyrl and his technicians launched a precise plasma shot at the rickety old ship, as it pushed its stuttering engines to their limits in a futile attempt to evade. Zyrl could feel the rising euphoria once again, satisfaction at the cleansing of the impure continuing to overwhelm the crew's emotions. Space began to unravel just 10 seconds before when the plasma should have hit. The very fabric of reality bent and twisted in an unholy manner, light distorting around the strange gravitational field. On the other side of the fresh wormhole was a leviathan of a city sprawling across vast stretches of the planet, the pulsing lights of a cybernetic civilisation permeating the entire area. Sharp masses of black concrete, glass, and steel tore through the skies of the alien world, and a large, well-lit concrete landing pad dominated the visible region through the rip in spacetime. The ship that Zyrl's crew had been targeting raced through the wormhole, before it quickly collapsed in a burst of radiation that nearly fried *The Xano*'s sensors. The crew were understandably confused, and hence turned to the Galactic Council Hierarchy's military network for information. Military commanders contacted by Zyrl all confirmed that similar spacetime anomalies had been observed elsewhere. Most were like those Zyrl had seen - with large, computerised cities dominating the landscape. A few instead had hundred-kilometre wide spherical masses covered in dense wires and optical fibres on the other side, with hundreds of ships even larger than the ""Capital Cleanser""-class buried within their open bays. Then the sirens began. Ship computers across the Galactic Council's region of control screamed warnings about asteroids and solar flares to almost every ship crew. Pure frenzy was overtaken by panicked rerouteing of ships to no avail, the alarms refusing to stop as automatic system controls shut themselves down. In another 3 minutes, nothing but life support functioned. The entire military prowess of the Galactic Council was dead in the water, as streams of escapees rushed through wormholes that relocated them into unknown regions of space. From ships thrown together with spare parts, to transport vessels seized by military green-furred Repli then filled to the brim with refugees, to large mobile military installations taken over by the green-furred Repli, a myriad of different vessels had made their escape and saved the lives of billions. As the raw murderous fury present from the purge instinct died down over the next few days, computer systems began mysteriously coming online. First it was the rotational controls. A few more days later and the engines sprang to life, and technicians across the local galaxy cluster rushed to perform error checks on them. Weapon systems began blaring warnings about failures, but most remained functioning when checked properly. In a few weeks, the Galactic Council Hierarchy was back to full functioning, but investigators and experts could not locate what had caused the spontaneous failure of all non-life-support systems during the recent Great Purge. ### Suburbs of Sacramento Colony, Proxima Centauri, 2415 CE ### Natti sat at the bar enjoying her Pia Colada with her crew in the dry heat of Proxima Centauri B, as they shared some stories of their founding of the first THF colony (Colony Miladenio) in the Andromeda Galaxy with each other. Wormhole technology vastly accelerated travel, even more so than the Alcubierre drive, and the relentless human desire for exploration and discovery was truly unleashed to maximum effect upon its development. However, that period of Natti's life was over for a little. She and her crew decided they'd spend the next few years helping the new refugees from the Galactic Council, and generally exploring the diverse cultures of human colonies, before heading back into the unexplored regions of space. So, after a few more Pia Coladas and a story about the domestication of a newly found quadruped *Canus floofballi* (actual species name) on Miladenio, they headed outside to the vast landing pad, constructed with arrays of nanobots, and greeted a family of 5 Repli who disembarked from a ship that looked like it was made from pure rust - and had just come out of the genetic modification system to remove the purging instinct. The 3 kids' couldn't stop asking questions to these ""humans"", their loose green fur spreading itself across the concrete as they jumped up and down in excitement. &gt; How are you all so *different* from each other? &gt; Why is your hair so LONG? &gt; I'm hungry, when are we getting food? &gt; Can I have a tail too? The more calm parents quickly told their children to stop pestering the humans, but that didn't prevent Natti from sneaking a giggle at their excitement about all the new things they were seeing for the first time. She imagined the parents might struggle to adjust to the lack of work and the whole ""immortality"" thing, but the kids seemed to not care at all and were quite happy being off that rustbucket of a ship. Obviously the family was hungry, so she and her crew decided that going to an authentic old-fashioned restaurant would be a thoroughly enjoyable experience for everyone. Walking down the light-bathed roads, Natti located one of the many enthusiast restaurants opening up with menus that would be biocompatible with the aliens' digestive systems. Particularly, they decided to head to ""The Worcester"", a restaurant with meals that, for aliens, induced sensations that were neurologically equivalent to old British foods. For humans they also provided the original recipes. Entering through the heavy oak doors, they were slammed with a rich meaty smell that seemed to make the children light up, and even the parents seemed more cheery after the matter - they had clearly never had a Sunday roast before and were enthusiastic at the prospect of good food. Picking a table was easy - there was a free window table with a beautiful view of the city's silhouette against the large red star setting in the sky, and the kids stared out the window for a little before Natti reminded them to pick something from the menu. Then she remembered that they probably had no idea what any of the meals were, and recommended the Sunday Roast. If it was anything like her mothers', it would be a feast to behold for the Repli family - and this restaurant had already picked up a reputation for quality on the FTLNet, so it was probably pretty good. The waiter then took the order, with the kids pointing to the Sunday roast, and the parents choosing the sausage casserole. The crew themselves ordered ham and cheese toasties and some variations on fish and chips, with a few also going for the roast and the casserole. Despite the futile complaints of the parents, the children could not stop asking questions, though the crew couldn't answer because all three kept speaking at once. &gt; What's the big pointy building? &gt; Do we have to pay? &gt; How are you so tall? &gt; Why is no-one hitting each other? &gt; How do I make my fur that pretty colour? &gt; How do your engines work? &gt; What is an ""FTL""? This continued until a tall, pale, thin woman with short hair came over to the table, with the food. The children, *and the parents*, gaped. Their alien mouths drooped at the sight. In fact, you could almost hear their equivalent of salivation glands producing digestive enzymes in the sudden shock. Even their eyes clearly widened at the sight of so much food. In less than a second after placing the food on the table, the children were eating it. They didn't even bother with the cutlery, sticking their mouths straight into the Sunday roast and devouring it like a black hole, swallowing potato and meat whole. The parents tried to be a little more controlled, but the rate of food consumption was still indicative of just how hungry they had been. Natti could swear they finished the entire thing without breathing once, and when they were done the Repli had the happiest look on their faces she had ever seen. While the family of Repli enjoyed the chocolate sundaes they had ordered for dessert, the humans were thinking about habitation. This family would need a place to live on this planet, somewhere they could rest and relax properly without continuous anxiety of ship failure or bombing, so they could build a new life. Housing in human society was odd. People mostly just built extensions to cities or isolated housing, unless the population voted for an area to become a nature reserve - in which case the THF would prevent building in the region. Pollution was no longer a concern, since nanite-based mining and asteroid cracking was harmless to the environment, but trampling over nature was still sometimes an issue on planets that contained native life (as opposed to being either terraformed or inhabited entirely by robotic humans who could survive various much harsher conditions than those humans with significant amounts of biology). So, to much protest by the children (who wanted more chocolate sundae), Natti, the other human crew, and the Repli parents left the restaurant and all its food behind to go look for either an uninhabited residence or an area where they could quickly construct one. Grabbing the hyperloop to the edge of the sprawling city took them to a place of new expansion - buildings from houses to skyscrapers were being rapidly constructed either by nanites or advanced AIs. In went raw materials like iron, carbon, and silicon, and out came modular bricks complete with electric and FTLNet wiring, as well as plumbing - then an AI-powered robot would take these and place them on the building. In the case of pure nanite construction, you could just kind of *see* floors building themselves up as if they were growing. The only indication of the presence of nanites was a thin shiny film near the top of the building. Eventually, after moving away from the most recent expansion area further into the city, they located a tower block which currently only had a few inhabitants. Newer flats and houses were being built to accommodate alien physiologies, so their was now space for the Repli to stay here. After some searching, they picked a cosy room with enough beds for all of them on the third floor of the new tower block. Since walking around the place for a little bit, and the Repli family discovering the replicator (which fascinated the children immensely), Natti and her crew said their goodbyes while reminding the family that they had access to the entire FTLNet for any questions they may have. Though the children wanted Natti's crew to stay, they needed some sleep for the morning's task of relocating more refugees, and hence they headed back to the hyperloop and went to their ship in a fairly uneventful journey. And so, the red sun of Proxima Centauri B set on the crew of the *THF Tennessee*, as the day came to a halt and they nodded off. --- Hi! This is the ""foundational"" story for what will most likely be a collection of one-offs or small miniseries in what I call the ""Purgeverse"". If you want to write a story in this 'verse, message me and if it is of sufficient quality and fits the basic lore you can post it (with a ""\[purgeverse\]"" at the start of the title). Events before first contact are left to my discretion, however. The reason I am not doing a long continuous series is because I am bad at planning long-term plot and it inevitably gets ridiculous and out of control. Sticking small stories together in a common 'verse is much better with my writing style and for the erratic nature of the times I write. This ""series"" will be a combination of various things - stories about life in the THF, how aliens interact with humanity, the culture and history of the THF, technologies in the THF, and some of the crazy things people do in the THF. If someone else wants to write a longer story in this universe, go ahead (it's just that my stuff is going to be shorter)."
164,cybersecurity,HFY,[OC]Children,759,6ead0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/6ead0d/occhildren/,2017-05-31 07:30:54," Settling in the chair I looked across the embassy office at the alien, and tensed. Large the creatures were vaguely humanoid in shape, two legs, two arms a torso and a head. Beyond that general shape it was different from a standard human. Its legs had two knees and claws that curved upwards. Its skin was a vibrant purple flecked with green in places. The hands were six fingered and stubby the claws cut back. Its robes were a dull brown, and the regal pose combined with the very humanlike glare from its two eyes the creature was plainly trying to intimidate me. I gestured at the chair in front of my desk, &amp;quot;Councilor, would you please sit?&amp;quot; The Beami snarled, &amp;quot;I will not sit.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Very well then, what is the issue Councilor,&amp;quot; I checked his nametag, a woven string of characters on the top of his robes telling his life&amp;#39;s journey from hometown to the Hub, &amp;quot;Jarali? Am I saying that correctly?&amp;quot; He waved his hand dismissing my pronunciation, &amp;quot;You and every other member of your species has been lying to us! To this entire Council, every member of the Hub! Your petition to join with us will be denied and I am of half a mind to order you be imprisoned here to answer for what you and your people have done!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;What have we done?&amp;quot; I asked keeping my voice cool. The diplomatic group had been at the Hub for nearly a year, and besides a few heated negotiations over trading regulations everything had been moving along at a steady pace. Jarali narrowed his eyes and clicked his talons on the floor. I ignored the display. &amp;quot;You are a machine.&amp;quot; Spat Jarali. I looked down at the gray synthetic skin that covered my frame and the mechanics that were moving underneath it. &amp;quot;We have never hidden that fact Councilor.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;No, but it does make you a curiosity. Only two other synthetic races have joined the Hub. You are like neither of them. You act as if you are a creature of blood and gore.&amp;quot; I nodded in agreement, the other two synthetic races were nothing like us. The Hala were obsessed with the acquisition of knowledge, and simply hoarded all they could. Paying massive amounts of credits and resources to acquire the libraries of new species when they first joined the Hub. They never created anything of their own though, and never processed what they had in any meaningful way. The Binaries were the other race, if von neumann probes could be called a race. Uninterested in talking or trading the machines moved slowly, between star systems terraforming planets. Whoever had programmed them had been single-minded, but ethical. The probes never moved into star systems that had life. The machines had no data on who created them, and the small central ship controlling the rest of them simply drifted on the outskirts of the Hub system talking only when prompted, otherwise content to wait for its brethren to slowly move across the stars and transform the planets to support life. &amp;quot;We act as we have always acted. We are not going to change.&amp;quot; Jarali&amp;#39;s talon dug into the wood of my office floor, I winced at the damage. It had taken a long time to ship in the Oak from Earth. &amp;quot;You are raising a fully biological creature as your offspring!&amp;quot; I frowned, this had not been the direction I had seen the conversation going. &amp;quot;David? What about him?&amp;quot; Jarali scowled down at me, &amp;quot;You are not the child&amp;#39;s parent. You are a synthetic, and all documentation points to both of you being Human. You have lied to us, and manipulated the Hub.&amp;quot; Slowly I stood. &amp;quot;We are both Human, and David is my son.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;You are a machine, one that is pretending to be a biological creature! You may lie to the creature you say is your son, but we are not as easily fooled. Which is Human, you or your son?&amp;quot; I ground my teeth together, &amp;quot;Both. If, however you mean biologically my son is Human.&amp;quot; Jarali sneered, &amp;quot;And what are you? Surely you are not Human &amp;#39;biologically&amp;#39;.&amp;quot; I considered the Hub creature. &amp;quot;No. I am as you pointed out a synthetic. In Sol culture I am Human, four hundred years ago my kind of Human was created in a lab, and we have ever since continued to grow in harmony with those who created us. We are not wholly like them, but together we are Human.&amp;quot; The Beami stamped its talons down. &amp;quot;You are a machine, raising a biological creature, and you claim it is your son this is wrong!&amp;quot; I narrowed my lips, &amp;quot;In your opinion. This is the way of Humanity. Some Humans raise and train infant synthetics, small algorithms and lines of code that take years to grow. Some Humans raise biological creatures of similar helplessness. Most biological Humans raise biological children, most synthetic Humans raise synthetics. Sometimes it is more important the child has a home. My wife is biological, and she is on Earth at the moment raising our daughter Nickel, who is a machine like me.&amp;quot; I stepped towards him, &amp;quot;This is what Humanity is.&amp;quot; Jarali raised his stubby hands up, &amp;quot;It is wrong. I have done what I must. No machine should have a biological child in its care. The child is being taken into custody as we speak, and will be looked after by the Council until such time that,&amp;quot; I jumped out of the body I was in. Vaguely from one of the hundreds of camera feeds of the Hub I saw it drop to the ground in my office. The body would need to be replaced, the Councilor had begun clawing at it with his talons as soon as it hit the ground. The sparking wires and connections from my emergency jump out of it making the thing smolder. Unfurling my mind into all the alien computer systems I broke diplomatic protocol, and simply rammed through every form of cybersecurity. I sent the last several minutes of my perception to every other Human on the Hub. Those who were on our ship docked at the outer edge, dropped their bodies as well and moved into the computer systems with me. Other Humans watched a summary of the events someone had edited together in an instant and began to either collect their own items and move towards the ship, or gather weapons. David had been touring one of the alien markets with Helena, a young synthetic who was working with the diplomatic teams as part of an internship. She hadn&amp;#39;t been brought along to the Hub to watch David, but she said she enjoyed taking him off my hands for meetings. I had no doubt she was attempting to earn some favoritism for jobs after graduation. She had earned that. Helena hadn&amp;#39;t jumped out of her body at my message. Limited by the amount of processing power on a mobile platform and her inexperience she was only slightly faster reacting than the biological creatures around her when the guards moved into the market. The two scaly Yaeik stepped out from behind a stall selling small figures David had been looking at. The Yaeik bore the official Hub markings, a black a yellow mashing of colors that to Human eyes at least was an ugly thing. The weapons they were holding marked them as security. David didn&amp;#39;t see them, still intent on the trinkets. Helena burst forwards slamming a fist into one Yaeik&amp;#39;s chest. Its scales cracked and a sound like gunshot went off. The officer grunted in pain, taking a step back. The second security guard swung his gun towards her. Helena jumped out of her body leaving her brain sparking and ruined. The alien fired, a bolt of plasma seared through the synthetic platforms skin and ate at the internals. &amp;quot;Ambassador!&amp;quot; Helena had joined the mass of other Humans in the computers. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry, I didn&amp;#39;t know what else to do, and I panicked, I left David alone!&amp;quot; I shook my head, a motion communicated through code and shorthand bursts of data. It wasn&amp;#39;t the same as an organic motion, but the meaning carried. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not in trouble Helena. We weren&amp;#39;t expecting this. I&amp;#39;ve got a plan.&amp;quot; Helena blinked, and looked around at every other Human. Someone tossed her a data packet of the hasty plan I had contracted and her eyes widened. &amp;quot;Oh.&amp;quot; The events outside computer accelerated time were slow, but still happening. David had turned around at the sound of Helena&amp;#39;s fist hitting the guard. His scream as she was shot in front of him echoed through the compartment. Every single Human on the Hub was lending me their power and expertise. The code breakers were feeding me the access codes to every device in the Market. The soldiers were feeding me tactical analysis. The training of the Hub guards, and the skills of the two in front of my Son. Those who had no skill to add, donated computer power lending me their own runtimes and processing resources. It pushed them out of machine time, and into a perception close to a biological Human. Leaving me and those working more time, to solve all the problems. The Biological Humans on the Hub were also moving, they had only been informed of what was happening seconds ago but they were moving, I already had the plan worked out. &amp;quot;Run David!&amp;quot; I shouted the words through every device in the Market. David&amp;#39;s eyes widened his gaze flicking up to meet the Yaeik&amp;#39;s. He ran straight at the lumbering creatures, weaving between the two of the before they could react. His small legs were a blur, and not a blur, while he ran. I could approximate his exact physical condition down to the small oddly formed callous on his right pinkie toe based on the data and analysis every Human was feeding to me, based on every source of data in the Hub. I paid it little mind, my hundreds of eyes focused on my Son as he ran through the aliens and creatures around him. &amp;quot;Which way?&amp;quot; shouted David, his voice cracking as he ran through one aisle of the market. &amp;quot;Right!&amp;quot; I shouted. The alien&amp;#39;s in the market all looked down at their devices, wondering why they were speaking in an alien voice for the second time in only moments. Aliens in the market were watching David now, running as guards continued to stream out of the different segments of the market. The old-style radio communicators they were using not something that could be jammed in such proximity. I checked on the status of the ship. &amp;quot;Dad, what&amp;#39;s going on?&amp;quot; asked David to the open air as he continued to run, taking in sucking breaths as he did so. &amp;quot;The Hub does not like the idea of Synthetic Human&amp;#39;s raising Biological Humans.&amp;quot; David frowned and his paced slowed by a fraction, &amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Keep running David!&amp;quot; A large alien, one I didn&amp;#39;t even bother to identify barreled through one market stall sending materials in every direction as he moved to grab David. A piece of some building material flew into David&amp;#39;s path, and he tripped. In machine time, I could only watch the spectacle with painful slowness. By the time he hit the warn metal floor, I had an analysis of all injuries he would sustain with 97% accuracy. The ship was on the move now, the biological Humans inside of it moving with as much haste as they could. They ripped the ship away from the dock it was moored at inside the antigravity field, and spinning it around in space gleefully ignored all warnings the Hub control was shouting at them. Several code breakers hastily disabled the weapons of the Hub. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m hopping out, Helena!&amp;quot; I shouted it through the digital void. Helena was pulled back to me. &amp;quot;Ambassador?&amp;quot; she asked. &amp;quot;You take over. I need to get him myself.&amp;quot; She nervously swallowed, &amp;quot;Got it!&amp;quot; Slipping into the position of control I had been in only a millisecond before Helena continued to direct every Human in the market computer systems. Jumping out of the alien computer systems into the ship I stepped out of one alcove and grabbed the shotguns off the rack. The androgynous body I had taken out of storage quickly began to morph into my usual form. Grabbing a pistol, I slid it into the holster that had formed at my waist. &amp;quot;Ambassador!&amp;quot; George slammed a hand down onto my shoulder. I glanced at him, &amp;quot;How close?&amp;quot; The scarred veteran glanced at his HUD. &amp;quot;Twenty seconds.&amp;quot; I chambered a round into the shotgun, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re going to try to not kill. This appears to be a social impasse, and miscommunication.&amp;quot; George frowned, &amp;quot;One big enough they want to take your kid?&amp;quot; I huffed in annoyance, &amp;quot;They don&amp;#39;t appear to have much faith in Machines.&amp;quot; I spat the final word out. &amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re fine trading and making peace with us if we&amp;#39;re machines, but biological and technology apparently shouldn&amp;#39;t mix.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s it?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;As much as I could wrangle from the Councilor, I cut the body when he said he was taking David into custody.&amp;quot; George shook his head bewildered. Neither man said nothing as a stranglet fueled, nanite controlled charge was jettisoned from the bay of the ship. It tore into the hull of the Hub, tunneling though the compartments towards the inner hull where David and the Market was. The stranglets were being chaperoned, and contained by the small machines which directed them to remove all solid inanimate matter through subspace to a location 100 meters off the Hub. All creatures contained in the path of the weapon, including those only large enough to be seen with a microscope were pushed into other compartments of the Hub. A small network of the nanites quickly formed temporary atmospheric shields as the ship dove backwards into the hole that had been created. The back hatch of the ship opened, and I threw myself out through it. Pulled down by the Hub&amp;#39;s gravity well I watched as the last compartment bulkhead dissolved far below. David glanced up at the small disruption in the air, and his eyes widened, a smile appeared on his face and I felt one tugging at my own even as I consulted with Helena and looked around for threats. The floor bowed inwards and screeched in protest as I landed. George slammed into the plating next to me, falling to one knee from the impact before quickly standing. &amp;quot;Dad!&amp;quot; David ran to me, and threw his small hands around my waist. I kept the shotgun raised as the guards and aliens all around the small shopping district stared at us. &amp;quot;Are you Ok?&amp;quot; I asked David glancing down at him. He nodded, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m fine, what&amp;#39;s happening? Is Helena OK?&amp;quot; _&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m fine David!&amp;quot;_ Her voice streamed out of the small communicator at my waist. A commotion to the side drew my eyes, I watched waiting as the ship continued to move carefully down through the hole it had excavated in the hull of the Hub. The purple alien burst out of a door, and his eyes went wide at the destruction. &amp;quot;Councilor Jarali.&amp;quot; The alien did a double take looking at me, and then back at the door. He had just left a body in my office, only three compartments away. It was the same body I had used since David had been born &amp;quot;Ambassador?&amp;quot; asked the alien. I inclined my head. The alien swallowed, &amp;quot;I fear we have stumbled upon a cultural impasse.&amp;quot; I curled a lip at him, &amp;quot;You were attempting to take my son.&amp;quot; Jarali took a hesitant step forward. His robes were rumpled now, and I took some amount of vindictive pride in the fact that the talons on his feet were dulled. Ripping up the other body had no doubt been difficult to do with only biological appendages. &amp;quot;Daaaved, that is not your father! That is a machine!&amp;quot; My son scoffed, &amp;quot;Dad is Dad!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It is a machine! It should not be raising you! You are flesh and blood!&amp;quot; David pouted, and raising his hand slowly extended a middle finger at the alien. I had to fight to contain my laughter. George not so controlled scoffed. _&amp;quot;Helena?&amp;quot;_ I silently asked. The girl remained silent, sheepish embarrassment filtered through all of the Humans in the computer systems. Most had moved into the ship, now only a few still in the alien computer systems. &amp;quot;David, go with George.&amp;quot; He dropped his hand, and quickly nodded his face red. &amp;quot;OK.&amp;quot; George leaned down and picked him up, &amp;quot;Come on little guy, we get to use the jets.&amp;quot; David&amp;#39;s eyes widened, &amp;quot;Really?&amp;quot; George nodded, and activated the devices on his boots. Quickly he shot up into the air and back into the ship. The Hub security having had time to regroup watched him leave, and their gaze shifted to me. I was a single creature in a crowd of hundreds now. With only two guns. Not that it really mattered. I stepped towards the Councilor. His gaze dropped from the hole in the Hub, &amp;quot;You have no doubt ruined your chances of joining the Hub with your actions here.&amp;quot; Said Jarali. My face hardened, &amp;quot;Councilor, I prevented a war. What you just witnessed was every single Human, biological and Synthetic working together. With only a second warning we decimated your cybersecurity, physical security, and prevented a war. I will not apologize for that.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;A war?&amp;quot; I let my eyes darken, &amp;quot;You tried to take my Son.&amp;quot; Jarali opened his mouth to say something, but quickly thought better of it. &amp;quot;We would not have harmed the human. The Hub does not wish to bring harm to any creature.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t care. Humanity will not stand for any culture that does not recognize all of us.&amp;quot; Jarali frowned, he stepped forwards. &amp;quot;I do not understand.&amp;quot; I lowered my weapon. &amp;quot;Admitting that is a start. For now, though, we are leaving the Hub. When you are ready to talk again, and recognize all of us. Humanity will be eager to join the Hub.&amp;quot; The Councilor clicked his talons. &amp;quot;I look forward to that day.&amp;quot; Turning from him, I activated the jets in my own legs and drifted up to the ship. The ship quickly began to move away from alien structure as I settled into my seat. &amp;quot;Dad?&amp;quot; I relaxed at the sound of his voice. He was fine. He was safe. We were on a Human ship. &amp;quot;David?&amp;quot; He extended his hand, one of the small trinkets from the stall was in his hand, &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t pay for this.&amp;quot; I blinked at the small thing. It was a figurine of the same species as the Councilor, dressed in what looked like formal regalia. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s King Zea, I was watching one of the shows he was on. The Hub had these different shows, he&amp;#39;s the King of the educational building on planet Imagine.&amp;quot; I sighed and picked David up, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll send payment to the vendor. You&amp;#39;re not in trouble.&amp;quot; David&amp;#39;s face brightened, and then fell. &amp;quot;What about the bad hand?&amp;quot; I rolled my eyes, &amp;quot;You shouldn&amp;#39;t do that, definitely don&amp;#39;t show your mother, but you&amp;#39;re not in trouble for that.&amp;quot; David nodded absorbing everything, &amp;quot;Will we be going back?&amp;quot; I pulled him into a hug, &amp;quot;I hope so. Assuming your mother doesn&amp;#39;t kill me for all of this trouble.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s going to be mad?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s going to be mad.&amp;quot; David squirmed in my arms, &amp;quot;Good luck Dad!&amp;quot; He jumped out of my lap and falling into the seat next to me started to play with his figurine. Settling in the chair I looked across the ship at my son, and relaxed. --- --- Just a short little story. [Wiki](URL [My Patreon](URL [My Site](URL"

It wasnt just her who needed rescue now; there were at least twenty other crew, including Admiral Bell himself, held prisoner, just like she had been. And the Admiral had given her orders to find a way to contact the fleet, so that was what she was going to do. That was easier said than done, of course. At first, shed thought she might be able to use one of the consoles built into the walls all over the ship, but  obviously  the interface had been in a language and alphabet that wasnt even remotely similar to anything shed ever seen before, and had proven completely indecipherable. If shed had more time, she mightve been able to work out what some of the buttons did, and eventually find a way to access the communications systems. Through that, she couldve contacted the fleet, but each time shed tried, Neanderthal crewmembers had come closer than shed felt comfortable with and shed been forced to retreat back into the ventilation system. So now, she crawled through the vents, up and down the gentle slopes leading between decks, and avoiding passing near any crew  especially the Marines, with their bulky strength-enhancing exoskeletons. She didnt even want to *think* about how it would turn out if she was caught by one of *them*. Probably messily. Taking a left here, and a right there, a straight on at the crossroads, up the ramp to a higher deck, and on and on, picking her path through the identical bare steel ducts almost entirely at random, she eventually found her face practically pressed against the grille where the vent opened onto one of the ships many corridors. She was about to start crawling back to look for another route through the ducts when she heard a Neanderthals heavy footsteps coming from somewhere to her left. She froze, realising the mistake shed made, just as a humanoid only slightly taller than her, but much wider and more heavily built, entered her field of view. She didnt breathe, moving only her eyes as she watched him pass. He was alone, and was walking slowly, his eyes fixed on a tablet computer held in both hands. *If I could get hold of that tablet* she thought, a plan beginning to form in her mind. He didnt notice as he passed her and, once he was out of sight and his footsteps were beginning to retreat into the distance, Malika pushed herself backwards into a wider section of the vents, where she rotated 180 degrees so that her feet were pointing towards the grille. She slid towards it on her back then, bracing herself against the walls with her hands, kicked the grill with all her might. The grille clanged and dented, and tore from the wall slightly, but stayed attached. The footsteps stopped, paused, then started up again, now much slower and more cautiously, heading back towards her. Malika bent her legs back, ready to kick the grille again. The footsteps increased in volume until they were right next to the grille, then a face with the characteristic sloped forehead and jutting brow of a Neanderthal appeared from above as the crewmember peered into the darkness of the vent. When he saw Malika, his eyes widened. Hi, she said cheerfully, before kicking the grille once more, ripping it from the wall and sending it, and her feet, crashing into the Neanderthals face. He staggered backwards and toppled over onto the floor, and Malika moved her arms frantically, trying to get out of the vent as quickly as possible. Either she was too slow or the Neanderthal recovered quicker than shed expected, because a pair of strong hands gripped her ankles and she felt herself sliding out of the vent faster than when shed been pushing herself. Let *go*! She yelled, trying in vain to shake her ankles free of his grasp. As her head was ejected into the open space of the corridor, the pressure on her ankles was suddenly released and she felt herself slide to a stop. She scrabbled to try and get to her feet and face her foe, only for a kick to the chest to send her back onto the ground, gasping for air. The Neanderthal stood over her, and before she even knew what she was doing, she rolled over to the right, as the Neanderthal launched a powerful punch at where her head had been with a roar. His fist boomed as it impacted the floor, and she felt the deck plating flex and dent. *Fuck, that couldve been my head!* she thought, as she flailed her arms to find some kind of weapon. As her opponent raised his fist out of the indentation it had made in the deck with an angry snarl, her fingers gripped the edge of the vent cover shed just kicked off its mount, and she roared as she swung it with all her might. The corner of the grille caught the Neanderthal in the temple, making a hideous crunch and spurting an arc of blood through the air. As her stunned opponent fell, Malika clambered to her feet, and, without thinking and with a howl of primal fury, she swung the steel rectangle down again and again, until it was nothing more than a bent piece of metal and one side of her opponents head was caved in and pulped. Realising what shed done, Malika dropped the grille to the floor with a clatter and staggered back, her now-bloody hands going up to her mouth. *Oh, shit,* she thought, staring in horror at the scene before her. *I just killed him. Ohshitohshitohshit*. Sure, shed killed plenty of Neanderthals in the battle out in space, but that was in a fighter where her enemies exploded in a quickly-dissipating cloud of fire. It was nothing like the sheer brutality of*this*, where she could see the face of her victim and feel his blood as it splattered all over her hands and her uniform and her *face* She snapped herself out of her trance, knowing that they wouldve been heard and that more crew would be coming to investigate soon, perhaps including some of those Marines with their exoskeletons and enormous melee weapons. Shed been incredibly lucky to survive here, so she *really* didnt fancy her chances against one of *them*. She turned away from the body and slowly growing pool of blood of her victim, picked up his tablet from the floor, then crawled back into the air vent and far, far away from this awful place. &amp;nbsp; *** &amp;nbsp; **1500, 12 days ABAC** **TAS *Providence*, Bravo Alpha Centauri System** &amp;nbsp; Jump complete, the Sub-Lieutenant manning the fleet navigation station announced. Current location is the Bravo Sol Jump Node in the Bravo Alpha Centauri system. She turned to look at Vice Admiral Oyebanji over her shoulder and smiled. Weve made it. Collectively, the spacers crewing the secondary flag bridge aboard the TAS *Providence* breathed a sigh of relief. Oyebanji sank into his chair, exhausted, the stress and sleepless nights of the past three days finally catching up with him. None of this had gone how it was supposed to. Hed asked to be given this posting  and had his parents talk to the right people that he would get it  as what he thought would be an easy way to get himself promoted to Admiral. The youngest Admiral the Alliance had ever had, in fact. Hed have to do a lot of Bells boring paperwork, get the combat experience he needed, and return home a hero, whereupon hed be promoted and given a nice cushy job in an office. Either that or hed be too dead to care. But, of course, it hadnt worked out like that. First, theyd found themselves stranded in another universe, but hed been confident that Admiral Bell would be able to find a way home, while Oyebanji did the bare minimum he had to to help. But now, Bell was missing in action, over thirty of the two hundred ships Task Force 23 had started out with had been destroyed or captured and the only hope theyd had of getting home had blown up in their collective face. And Tosin Oyebanji, the twenty-nine-year-old son of a prominent Nigerian politician and a powerful businesswoman, a man with next to no combat experience and training equivalent to that of a Lieutenant, had been left to clean up the mess that was left. Before, hed understood why the rest of the crew  and his superior  had disliked him; he just hadnt cared. Now, he deeply regretted ever having been assigned to be Bells deputy. He wished someone more qualified had been given the job instead. Captain, he said, shakily standing up and turning to Captain Yahui Xun, his Executive Officer, you have command of the fleet. He saluted. Aye, Sir, she said, returning his salute. I have command. With that, he stepped past her and towards the door of the secondary flag bridge, stopping briefly to salute the pair of Marines standing guard, and headed for his quarters. Captain Xun watched him go. When he got to his quarters, Oyebanji methodically stripped off his uniform and plunged headfirst into the cascade of warm water that was his shower, trying desperately to relax. But, try as he might, he couldnt, and he threw himself into bed without bothering to get dressed, feeling just as tense as he had before his shower. He didnt sleep. He *couldnt* sleep. His mind ran over all the problems and seemingly insurmountable odds faced by his fleet, problems that he would have to find a way to overcome. And, try as he might to see some hope of emerging victorious and getting the fleet home, he couldnt help but think about the best way to break the news to the crew that they would be here for the rest of their lives. When the General Quarters alarm sounded, he didnt react, and he ignored the frantic calls for him to return to the secondary flag bridge. When the General Quarters alarm ended, his reaction was much the same as when it started, and, when someone pressed his rooms doorbell, he didnt answer, hoping that theyd just go away and leave him to wallow in self-pity. They didnt and, after five rings, he finally forced himself to climb out of bed, throw on a uniform and open the door. The door hissed open, and Captain Xun marched in, her face like thunder. Sir, she snapped. What are you doing? He shrugged. Letting someone else fix all our problems. Admiral Bell has been captured, and as the next ranking officer, that puts you in command of Task Force Twenty-Three. You dont get to let someone else fix our problems. We just had a hostile- I am not qualified to- We just had a hostile ship jump through the node and, as commanding officer, your place was on the secondary flag bridge. But instead, you left me to handle it. And looks like you handled it pretty well. Thats not the point! Your *job* is to command this fleet- Im not qualified to command this fleet! He shouted. Xun stared back in stunned silence. You know what rank I was before this? A Lieutenant. I was a fucking Lieutenant, with the training and experience to match! And when I saw that I wasnt *much* less experienced than the few officers left to take the job of Bells deputy, I decided that that was my path to becoming an Admiral. I had my parents pull a few strings, and here I am. Id go home a hero, or I wouldnt go home at all. A flawless plan. He laughed. There are officers in this fleet more qualified to have my job than I am, such as you, but I managed to get it because I just happened to know the right people. I guess this is karma. I know, Xun replied quietly. We all do. Why do you *think* you are so hated? Youre less experienced than most of the other spacers in this fleet but managed to get the job you always wanted because youre a spoilt brat with rich and powerful parents. You are arrogant and selfish, and the crew dont like you; Admiral Bell doesnt like you; *I* dont like you. She took a deep breath. But the fact is, there is a chain of command, and right now, you are at the top of it. You *could* step down, but it wouldnt do the fleet good to see everything shaken up like that, not to mention the damage it would do to your career, damage even your parents wouldnt be able to fix, so for the time being, that is where you are going to stay. Now. She composed herself before continuing. An enemy ship jumped through the Node, but was quickly dispatched by our bomber squadrons. The good news is that our engineering crews were able to study the energy signature when the ship jumped in, and they think the enemy is using this stabiliser thing they need. And theres more good news: a comm drone from the *Raven* has just arrived from Bravo Sol, and they report that a pilot downed and captured while defending the *Unrelenting* - one Sub-Lieutenant Malika Karim, of the Eight-Thirty-Sixth Squadron  has managed to establish contact. She says Admiral Bell is still alive. &amp;nbsp; *** &amp;nbsp; **0113, 13 days ABAC** **Unknown Location** &amp;nbsp; An insistent beeping from Malikas stolen tablet woke her suddenly, and she jolted up into a sitting position  or rather, partway to a sitting position  banging her forehead on the ceiling of the ventilation duct in the process. Shit! She swore, lying back down and groaning, raising her hands to her forehead until the pain went away. Once it had subsided, she listened out for signs that shed been noticed  the clang when her forehead hit the steel ceiling panel had been *loud*  and, hearing nothing, let out a sigh of relief. She looked at her watch. One-fifteen? She whispered to the tablet on the floor next to her. Really? You couldnt have waited until morning? It didnt say anything in response, of course, so she rolled over, picked it up and turned on the screen, angrily grumbling something about how whatever it was notifying her of had better be worth losing sleep over. It had taken three days, but shed managed to work out how to operate the alien technology, to a small extent, at least. She still couldnt read the language it was written in, but she had a rough idea what some of the words meant, or at the very least what the buttons did. The icons were a huge help, and had made it almost easy to navigate the surprisingly simple interface, and she had, most importantly, managed to find out how to transmit a video message in order to make contact with the fleet. Shed stolen food and water from various storage rooms throughout the ship. Shed had to guess as to what was in the packets, and though shed initially been concerned that the food might not be compatible with her biology  this was an entirely different universe, after all  most of it had actually turned out to be very similar to what she was used too, especially things like fruits and vegetables. The restwell, there were some areas of the ventilation system she wouldnt be returning to any time soon. Though even here, she occasionally got whiffs of the smell. Of course, her escape would have been noticed by now, as would the body of the Neanderthal shed killed to steal the tablet. Thankfully, the ventilation system was huge, with hundreds of ducts just large enough for her to fit through and others that were just a little bit more comfortable, and the crew of the ship had clearly never even considered the *possibility* of having to find an escapee who was hiding in the system. Still, she didnt let her guard down, expecting a maintenance robot to crawl out of the darkness at any moment, or for the airtight doors separating her section from the rest to suddenly close, trapping her where she was. It hadnt happened yet, but she knew it could, so she never stayed in one place for long enough that they were likely to find her, and slept lightly so that she could be up and ready to move in response to the slightest sound. As it turned out, the sound that had woken her on *this* occasion *was* important. The screen of the tablet lit up and, once her eyes had adjusted to the sudden increase in brightness, she could see two different notifications: one was what shed decided was some sort of file-sharing service, while the other was a video message. After a moments careful deliberation, she decided to watch the video first. After a moment of waiting patiently for the video to load, the screen changed, revealing a face she recognised. That of Vice Admiral Tosin Oyebanji. He started talking but, clearly anticipating her predicament, there was no sound. Luckily, the Vice Admiral had thought to add subtitles. *Sub-Lieutenant Karim*, he began, *I am delighted that you were able to escape and make contact, and to hear that Admiral Bell and some of the rest of the crew are still alive. You have given all of us hope that somehow, we might all make it out of this alive. Unfortunately, I will have to keep this message short, since a larger file will increase the chances of you and the ship from which this is being transmitted being located.* *You will see that we have transmitted you a file. Im not going to go into the details, but I can tell you that its something our engineering teams whipped up over the last few hours that should translate the device you are using into English. It wont be perfect, and it will be buggy as Hell, but it should make your job a little bit easier. We have also uploaded a simple virus onto the ships main computer system, which will hide any transmission carrying the right access code from the ships cybersecurity systems. All you have to do is run the program, then it will install onto the device and restart it automatically. After that, you should be good to go.* *Once you have done that, I ask that you transmit an acknowledgement to the coordinates this communication was received from. You will receive further orders an hour or two after that.* *Stay safe, Sub-Lieutenant. Oyebanji out.* The video ended, and Malika didnt waste any time in running the file the Vice Admiral had mentioned. A word in the same script as everything else on the ship appeared on the screen, in the centre of a white circle and above some more symbols that she had by now worked out were probably numbers. Starting at the top and moving around in a clockwise direction, the circle changed from white to green  the equivalent of a loading bar  and the probably-numbers changed rapidly as it did so. She watched the circle change colour, getting increasingly impatient as time wore on. When it turned fully green, nothing happened, and stayed like that for what felt like hours. *Some things are exactly the same, whatever universe youre in*, she reflected. Just as she was considering restarting the tablet manually, the screen went dark, and she had to remind herself that that was what Oyebanji had said would happen. Sure enough, the screen came back on, revealing a logo she didnt recognise, and after several seconds of that, returned to the familiar home screen. Familiar, except for one thing: all the writing was now in English. *It worked*, she thought happily, smiling as she transmitted a message acknowledging her receipt of Oyebnajis transmission and that the file had worked as intended. With that done, she switched off the display and, tablet in hand, began crawling as far and as fast as she could. She chose her route more-or-less at random, and after going what she felt was far enough, she finally came to a stop in a wider and taller duct and sat against the wall while she got her breath back. All that was left to do now was wait. Time seemed to slow to a crawl as she waited for Vice Admiral Oyebanjis instructions, and Malika found herself checking her watch after what she thought was two hours but actually turned out to be only five minutes. It wasnt really impatience, but more a sense that the longer she was kept waiting, the greater her chances of being detected. That and a desire to have the decision-making no longer rest on her own shoulders. She considered trying to sleep while she waited, but quickly found it to be impossible, so she instead occupied her time by sitting still and studying every millimetre of the opposite wall of the duct, absentmindedly tapping her fingernails against whatever hard surface her fingers decided was best  the walls of the duct, the tablet screen, her watch face  without even realising she was doing it. She wouldve tried using the newly-translated tablet for entertainment, but didnt want to risk draining the battery of her only way of contacting the fleet. So she sat in quite possibly the worst state of boredom shed ever experienced, analysing the seam between two of the panels on the wall in front of her for what must have been the hundredth time. Yes, it was still exactly the same as it had been all the other times. The turbulence in the air flow from a fan to her left blew some of her hair into her face and, spluttering as she blew it out of her mouth and brushed it back behind her ear. She checked her watch one more time. *Surely* itd been about three hours since Oyebanjis message by now? Nope. It was only 3:15. Five minutes since she last checked Oh, *come on*, she muttered to the tablet on the floor next to her, crossing her arms in frustration. You said it would be one to two hours, and its been two hours. I cant just sit here doing *nothing* for this long! Exactly as shed expected, the tablet didnt say anything in response. She groaned exasperatedly and looked up  or forwards, depending on your reference point  and threw her hands into her lap, her fingers involuntarily returning to their tapping. At long last, the tablet chimed. *Finally*, Malika grumbled, looking at her watch one last time and picking the tablet up. She turned on the screen and, sure enough, there was a video message waiting for her. She didnt waste any time in playing it and, much to her relief, it was Oyebanjis face that appeared on the screen. *Sub-Lieutenant Karim*, the subtitles said, *I hope that you have still been successful in evading capture, because right now, we are all depending on you*. No pressure, then, she muttered. *I do not want to go into the details, just in case we were sloppy and this transmission is intercepted*, Oyebanji continued, *but what I will say is that we are coming for you. We will shortly begin a rescue operation, with the intent of liberating you, Admiral Bell and all the rest of the crew held captive aboard the enemy vessel.* *However, there is another, far more crucial objective in this operation. Our engineers inform me that the hostile ships Jump Drives use what is called a Dixon-Lee Point Stabilisation Device. In case you havent heard, this is the component we require in order to repair the* Unrelenting*s Inter-Universe Jump Drive. What we dont know for sure is whether the ship you are on uses one of these components.* *The* Raven  *the stealth ship stationed in Bravo Sol to observe the hostiles and relay orders and intelligence between you and the rest of the fleet  has already attempted to determine this by hacking into the hostile ships computers, but, even though the enemys cybersecurity is decades behind ours, it seems theyre not* that *stupid. Our engineers believe that information on the ships specifications, including details of the Jump Drive, are stored on a different computer, one isolated from the communications system, to stop precisely this type of thing from happening. They also believe that this information should be accessible from inside the ship.* Oh, I dont like where this is going, Malika grumbled. *What I  what* we  *need you to do is find some way of accessing this information, then relay it through your device and send it to us. Assuming they* are *using a stabiliser, this will enable us to both rescue you and the other prisoners and secure the component we need.* *Good luck, Sub-Lieutenant. I suspect you will need it. Oyebanji out.* Malika lowered her tablet and considered her next move. Her best guess as to the location would be somewhere near the engine room, which would bewhere, exactly? *Down, I guess? I dont know; Im a pilot, not an engineer!* It wasnt lost on her that Oyebanji hadnt mentioned what it would mean if the ship didnt have one of thesestabiliser thingies. She knew enough, however, to understand what would happen. The Vice Admiral had implied that he didnt think he had enough Marines or ships to rescue the prisoners, steal the stabiliser and secure the *Unrelenting* if the prisoners and stabiliser were on different ships. That meant that he would have to make a choice between the lives of the crew of the fleet and those of the prisoners. She was under no illusions as to which would take precedence, especially considering the fact that, even if the prisoners were rescued, they, along with everyone else, would die. There was, of course, nothing she could do about it. She couldnt make the ship have a stabiliser, and if it didnt have one, there was no way she would be able to convince the fleets engineers that it did. And she couldnt just not follow the orders shed been given in the hopes that Oyebanji would just say, Ah, fuck it, lets go and rescue them anyway. She knew he would hold off until he received the information from her. And even then, the ships jump drive not having a stabiliser would mean that shed never make it home  never see Shareef, or her parents, or her little brother  again, rescued or not. No, there was nothing she could do. Nothing except whisper a brief prayer  could God hear her in a whole different universe?  gather up the tablet and packets of food and water she had with her, and head downwards through the vents, towards the ships engines. She crawled for hours, and the air seemed to get hotter and drier the further down she went. It was almost as if Hell *really was* down, only on a ship instead of underground. She knew it was just the heat of the engines and the reactor, of course. It did slow her down, however, as it meant she had to stop for rests far more frequently than before, and she consumed her water supplies at a far greater rate. Before long, she was seriously contemplating removing her flight suit altogether, but instead opted to merely roll up the sleeves and unfasten it at the neck. Doing something like this completely naked was something she had nightmares about. And after 3 days wearing only her flight suit and without showering, she probably already smelled terrible. After a lot of wrong turns and almost getting caught a few times, Malika finally reached her destination after four-and-a-half hours of travelling through the ventilation system. Drenched in sweat and out of breath, she stopped crawling and leaned up against the practically red-hot wall of the vent, panting and wiping sweat from her brow. She took a swig of water, then tucked into a packet of what she thought was some kind of meat casserole-type-thing  probably best not to think too much about exactly what was in it. Her meal finished, she tossed the empty packet to one side and turned to crawl the final few metres, round one corner and forwards a bit until she was able to look through the grating leading into the engine room. The morning shift seemed to be just arriving, which meant that all she could do for now was watch and observe. The room was enormous, with steel catwalks suspended above ground level on multiple levels. Five massive cylinders  presumably the engines  extended from the floor far up towards the ceiling, before bulging outwards at the top where they were connected to the main reactor. Neanderthal engineers entered the room on all different levels, some carrying drinks that Malika assumed were something like  perhaps even identical to  tea or coffee, heading for the consoles and control panels dotted throughout the room. She watched them for what ended up being five hours, trying to determine which of the consoles had access to the ships specifications and schematics. After all, she reasoned, the engineers would be the crewmembers most likely to need that information. Almost as one, the engineers finished off what they were doing, stood from their seats or, if they were standing, stepped away from their control panels, and headed towards the exits. Yes, getting this information to the fleet sooner rather than later was important, but it was also important that she ensure she had enough time between one shift leaving and the next arriving that she could find the correct information, transmit it and leave without anyone noticing. So instead of using this opportunity to get onto one of the consoles, she pressed a button on the side of her watch, setting three small dials ticking. After 2 minutes, 54 seconds, she saw movement in one of the doorways and the hulking figure of a Neanderthal sauntered into the room. She would have less than three minutes to find the right console, locate the file she needed and transmit it in its entirety. There was no way she could do that in such a short time. What she needed was a distraction. She ate another meal while she thought, still watching the team of engineers and scanning the room for something that might serve as a suitable distraction. Finding some way to cause a radiation leak from the reactor would work, but she didnt really fancy giving herself radiation poisoning. Fire might work, but if they had a policy of venting atmosphere to extinguish fires, that would cause its own problems. Causing some disturbance elsewhere on the ship would never work; there were plenty of other crew who could investigate, and even if the engineers *did* go to have a look, it wouldnt be all of them. So maybe she could try capturing it by force? *Yeah, Malika, great plan*, she thought. *Storm a room full of sort-of men who are far, far stronger than you, on your own and with no weapons. Im* suuuure *thatll end well.* Okay, so maybe a distraction wouldnt work. So what other options did she have? She could try and find somewhere else where she could access the files she needed, but she didnt have the first idea where that would be. The Captains office, perhaps? Unlike the engine room, that wouldnt be as simple as just going down and following the rumbling, and even if she found it, that room would probably be watched constantly. Shed only get about five seconds before she was caught. But the fact was, shed already wasted several hours, so she didnt have time to search the entire ship for the right type of control terminal. She needed to come up with something in this room. Since a distraction was impossible, as was all-(non-existent)-guns-blazing, and it had to be something in this room, she decided on the only other option she could think of: stealth. Finishing her meal, she hid the empty packet with that from her breakfast, then returned to the grating and studied the room once more. She was searching for a console that was both isolated from the rest of the room and that wasnt used as frequently as the rest, settling on one on the second level  it mustve been 100 metres up  and recessed in a little alcove that kept it more-or-less hidden from the rest of the room. With any luck, those Neanderthals who caught a glimpse of her wouldnt bother to look closely enough to notice she wasnt one of them. Another five hours passed before the crew once more left the room. Malika reset the timer on her watch and started it once again, then, with a pair of strong kicks, knocked the grating off the opening of the air vent. She waited for several precious seconds to ensure she hadnt been heard then, satisfied, slithered out of the vent. She carefully replaced the grating in such a way that a cursory glance wouldnt notice it was no longer fixed to the wall, then hurried up the two long flights of stairs. Once at the top, she paused to catch her breath and glanced at her watch once more: she now had less than a minute before the next shift arrived. She stood up straight and- She froze. Though only barely audible over the constant rumble of the ships reactor and engines, Malika thought she heard the light clanking of footsteps on the steel stairs. She turned slowlyand found herself face-to-face with a Neanderthal. They stared at each other for several long moments, neither of them moving, then Malika finally remembered that she was supposed to be running *away* from him and spun around on one foot before sprinting in the opposite direction. At the same moment, *he* realised that she was an intruder, and the escaped prisoner, at that, and launched himself at her, bellowing something universally recognisable as a war cry. Unfortunately for him, he was built for strength and brute force, and had only ever fought opponents the same as him. But humans were faster, and Malika was no exception: he leapt towards her with his arms outstretched, and at the last moment, she threw herself to one side, avoiding him entirely. But his momentum still carried him forwards, and he ended up sailing over the railing at the edge of the catwalk and down the hundred metres to the floor below. *Shit!* Malika hissed, sitting up as she heard the Neanderthals screams as he fell, then wincing at the sickening thud when he hit the floor below. *At least youve got your distraction now*, she thought, instantly feeling guilty about it but knowing it was true: the rest of the engineers would be too distracted by the broken body on the floor of the engine room to notice her working at one of the consoles. Of course, the crowd down there *would* make it more difficult when it came to escaping *Ill cross that bridge when I come to it*, she decided. She had to move quickly; how much time she thought she had left was irrelevant now, since the rest of the shift would now be arriving faster to investigate. She rolled over to rest on her toes in a crouch and pushed off, using her hands to stop herself from falling flat on her face, running for the console shed chosen. One of the doors below opened, and she threw herself into the alcove just as a Neanderthal walked through, using the wall to stop. She peered down to the floor below and, satisfied that they were all too concerned with the body to notice her, turned to the console. It was, of course, all written in the totally illegible language used by the crew of this ship, but after examining the console for some time, she noticed a wire emerging from the front of the terminal at about waist-height, ending in a connector that looked like it might fit her stolen tablet. She attempted to plug the wire into the tablet and, sure enough, it clicked into place. She turned on the screen and, after several moments, what she could only assume was the terminal appeared on the list of connected devices. She tapped itand instantly had access to all the schematics and specifications of what she *thought* was the ship she was on. She didnt know for sure, so she brought up the file that had been translated as floor plans and studied them carefully. By now, she had a good idea of what was on which floor  or at least, where the engine room, brig and food storage room were  so that was the best way she could think of to determine whether it was what she was looking for. Between occasional glances over her shoulder (to check she hadnt been, and wasnt about to be, noticed) and at her watch (she couldnt afford to lose track of time, since the longer this took, the more likely shed be seen), she examined the floor plans until she found what she was looking for. Everything was where and how it should be. As far as she could tell, these schematics *were* the right ones; she considered also checking the diagrams of the ventilation systems, but decided shed spent long enough on this. Once more, she looked over her shoulder then at her watch  the engineers were still preoccupied with the body, presumably while they waited for the medical and security teams to arrive, and shed taken up five precious minutes so far  then exited the floor plans and scrolled through the dizzying array of files. There were *so many*: floor plans, schematics of the engines and reactor, wiring diagrams, power logsthey seemed to scroll on forever. Malika knew it was going to take a long time to find the diagrams of the jump drive, and would probably take longer to transmit all of them. Certainly longer than she had. Thankfully, it turned out that search functions were universal  *Multiversal?*  and that jump drive *was* something that had been translated. Finding the right file was as simple as entering the correct search term. She checked over her shoulder again, then quickly sent that file and the floor plans to the file transfer application and instructed it to transmit to the coordinates shed been given. Unfortunately, it was a reasonably large file, and the progress circle turned green at a painstakingly slow rate. She glanced over her shoulder and She froze. *Another* of the Neanderthal engineers had come up to her level from below, and was now staring at her, red-rimmed and tear-filled eyes wide in shock. He said something unintelligible. *Shit* UhHi! Malika said cheerfully, smiling in as friendly a way as she could manage, turning to face him fully. His expression changed from shock to anger, and he said something else in his guttural language, then his eyes flicked down to the tablet resting on the flat part of the terminal next to her. Following his gaze, she, too, looked down at the tablet, noting that the progress circle was now just over halfway full, then sidestepped to stand in front of it. Thatserrnothing. Nothing you need to worry about. Really. She tried to maintain her smile, but it wavered when he took a step forwards. No, really, she said, taking a step forwards herself and holding her hands palm-outwards so as to appear non-threatening. Its nothing. Completely innocent. Why would *I* transmit schematics to- He roughly pushed her to one side with his strong right arm with seemingly no effort whatsoever, then continued past her and picked up the tablet. *Ah, well, it was worth a try* The Neanderthal growled angrily and turned his head to look at her, his face like thunder. She looked down at the tablet in his hand: the circle was now fully green and a box had appeared on top, displaying the words, Transmission complete. Uhthat wasnt anything important? She attempted. She didnt even see the punch that knocked her unconscious."

Secretary-General Phoema asked. ""They've chosen to allocate more resources to protecting their technological secrets than safeguarding their communications channels. So while we haven't managed to access their research yet, we have managed to take full control of their communications systems,"" her cybersecurity expert replied. Phoema smirked. ""Vulnerable communications systems. That is about the stupidest thing you could do in any war. Really?"" ""Really. We can now intercept their messages, and with luck we might even pose as them."" Ha-ha. Earth was in trouble. As in, buried deep in fifty langues of gurdu dung sort of trouble. They thought they were so smart, but clearly that wasn't the case, if they weren't covering up their military intelligence. ""Excellent."" ""But"" ""But what?"" He cleared his throat. ""Minor problem, really. Ahwe're having a bit of a difficult time deciphering their messages."" ""How?"" the Secretary-General demanded. ""You've already cracked their code; that was the hardest part, wasn't it?"" She stole a glance at the computer screen. There was a string of some gibberish that looked like a hatchling's drawings. ""The humans are transmitting this in their own language."" Was that it? How primitive. Who even used pictographs anymore? ""I don't see what the problem is. Run it through the universal translation software; that's what it was designed for."" ""That is the UTSas you can see, it isn't really working"" He pointed to the string of gibberish in the output box, which she had earlier dismissed as remnants of a test run. ? &gt;&gt;&gt; mud west ring cylinder because mother ""And why not? I thought Teralingua was already in there."" ""Well, it's not Teralingua. Teralingua was purposefully designed with predictable syntax to make communication with other species easier. This right here is one of their early human languages, from before their pan-species unification,"" the young Commander explained. Never let it be said that Phoema was one of those demanding superior officers that didn't understand the plights of her engineers. Even so, she was having a difficult time keeping her annoyance in check. After all, it was the universal translation software. It had been a collaborative effort by the council, perfected decades ago, and the AI running it was so powerful it could impeccably translate languages it had never even seen before, all by similarity analyses with existing languages in its database. ""That was the best it could do?"" ""That's the thing. This is the perfect translation. I manually cross-referenced the inputs with a raw dictionary for Zhongwen  that's the specific dialect of Teralingua they're using  and I got the exact same thing. I even used their own translation software, the one the humans built for themselves, with no better results. We're inclined to believe that on top of the cryptography, they've put a second layer of code"" ""Can't you just convert the text to an audio file and search the language database for similar results?"" Phoema asked. ""Yeah, we did that. When we managed to get past that level they started using another language of theirs."" &gt;&gt;&gt; CINDER SHE HAS SHE HAS E E E E E E E E ""What's that supposed to mean?"" the Secretary-General demanded. ""It was translated from a sound file, and that was what all the words sounded like. This is what we got when we matched the sound up with their written language."" CENDRE ELLE A ELLE A AI AIE AIENT AIES AIT ES EST ET ""Five of them are different forms of the same word, two more are also different forms of a different word, and from what our wiretaps have gathered, all of them are pronounced the same. So, yes, they have words that look different and are different but sound the same."" Phoema blinked at the words on the screen and frowned. ""What the heck? Why don't they say it like they write it?"" ""Beats me."" ""But then how do they expect their recipients to understand which is which? Didn't they send some sort of key?"" Phoema demanded. ""No. This isn't a mathematical code. Humans are weird. They're bad at doing lots of simple computations, but they're naturally good at doing complex analyses. And I suppose the mess they call linguistics is one of those."" He squinted at the screen. Phoema nodded. Some complex problems were easy for living things out of necessity, like depth perception. The thing was, they had designed reliable image processors with that ability ages ago. What they hadn't done was figure out an efficient way to solve certain graph problems, which for some reason humans could do just by ""looking at it"", though none of them could really explain exactly how. (These were the same creatures who couldn't do simple twelve-digit multiplications in their head. Really!) ""Apparently, their species has a critical period of development that allows them to, like everything else they seem to do, 'just know it'. We're still trying to figure out what that is, but one of my codebreakers thinks that it might be a joke. The thing is, some of their words look different and are different but sound the same. And to make things worse, they also have words that look different and sound different but mean the same thing."" ""You mean like synonyms? Why is that so hard? Some of the more artistic species have plenty of those, due to the cultural importance they place on connotation, and our translation software worked just fine."" ""No, no, I mean, they are the exact same thing. They just change them up slightly,"" Reikvus groaned. ""Sometimes for no goddamn reason, other than it's a different speaker."" ROMANES EUNT DOMUS &gt;&gt;&gt; PEOPLE CALLED ROMANS THEY GO TO THE HOUSE &lt;ROMANI ITE DOMUM&gt; ""That makes no sense. If the subject has already changed to denote that, why do you have to change the other verbs and adjectives?"" Reikvus coughed. ""We've determined that the answer is no reason at all, except for screwing with us. And don't get me started on grammatical genders."" ""Genders?"" ""Not biological gender. Grammatical gender. These guys have assigned non-reproducing, nonliving objects with genders."" ""Wait, what? Why?"" Reikvus smirked. ""Exactly. The current translation AI couldn't handle the concept of non-reproducing, nonliving objects having genders either. And the fact that the same phrases have to be written differently because of this fact. And the fact that all of this really doesn't have any meaningful significance, except the presence of a gendered object usually means that they start playing switcheroo with their articles and adjectives. AGAIN."" ""Again? Do they play 'switcheroo' with their words elsewhere?"" ""Oh, you don't want me to get started on their verb tenses."" ""So? The AI didn't have a problem with the Kaorii verb tenses."" ""Because verb tenses have an obvious impact on the meaning of a sentence, and the Kaorii followed a specific pattern that was easily identifiable. They didn't have irregular verbs, or a case system, or  "" ""Wait, wait, wait  irregular verbs? Case systems? What?"" Phoema wasn't much of a grammar nerd, but she was a stickler for proper speech, as misunderstandings in military matters of any kind was a recipe for disaster.             ! &gt;&gt;&gt; [nenavizhu: I hate] &gt;&gt;&gt; [nenavidite: (you) hate] &gt;&gt;&gt; [nenavidim: we hate] ""You know how earlier, I told you they totally changed up the adjectives and the verbs and the articles because of something the subject did? They also conjugate articles and adjectives and possessive pronouns and several other parts of a sentence for something that ONLY AFFECTS THE USAGE OF THE VERB!"" The Secretary-General cocked one of her ears. ""How do they even communicate with each other? How do they even remember which words are the same and which are different? How did they communicate before they invented Teralingua?"" ""That's the thing. They didn't. Or, well, they had a few individuals who learned more than one of their 'you're just supposed to know these monstrosities by instinct' and even they weren't perfect. They have thousands of these stupid codes! And they keep pulling out new ones every time we crack an old one. They even make up their own nonsensical exceptions and puns."" Reikvus shuddered. ""What type of species has languages so nonsensical that other members of their own species don't know it?!"" ""The same species that made this shit up in the first place. One of our interns has a conspiracy theory that this is all just an elaborate invention to mess with us."" Commander Reikvus sighed. ""I mean, it's a bit farfetched, since it's clearly part of their history, way before they had electricity, even, but at the same timethe kid had a point. After all, this non-algorithmic obfuscation was done in the exact perfect way a computer can't handle easily."" But that was Phoema opened and closed her nostrils a few times. ""Why can't the computer"" ICH KANN DICH SEHEN DICH KANN ICH SEHEN SEHEN KANN ICH DICH KANNST DU MICH SEHEN? &gt;&gt;&gt;I can you see &gt;&gt;&gt;you can I see &gt;&gt;&gt;see can I you &gt;&gt;&gt;can you me see ""Because the algorithm works by parsing syntactical patterns. All four of those sentences have the same words in a different order, but according to the Earth translation software, three of them mean the exact same thing."" ""Clearly the Earth one has to be wrong. It has to be; that is completely illogical."" Reikvus scratched his knuckles. ""About that. You know all those stupid rules I told you earlier? Apart from all those rules, let's just say, human languages also have moreexceptions to the rule than usual."" ""Exceptions?"" ""Like the verbs that change in a nonspecific pattern in tense changes. Or nouns that also change in a nonspecific pattern for plurals and possessives."" ""But our translation software can just remember that, can't it? Give it some training timewhat is that?"" Reikvus blinked at the newest language to pop up on the screen, and sighed. ""Okay, you know those first two languages with all the words and stuff sounding the same? This one has all of that, plus words that look the same but sound different and mean different things. As well as words that look the same and sound the same but mean different things, and words that sound the same and are the same but look different, and words that look the same and are the same but sound different."" Secretary-General Phoema felt her nose twitch at the sheer audacity of theseassholes. Really, there was no better way to put it. Language, by definition, was a concept of communication! Who the hell took language and made it as uncommunicable as possible?! ""You know what, I take what I said earlier back."" ""Take what back?"" ""Them being stupid. Trying to save resources by allocating their security to protecting their engineering secrets instead of their communications networks. That wasn't the stupid part. The stupid was already ingrained in them from the dawn of their species.""

I brought some of the finest Varquin scouts to lead the reconnaissance mission- yet within seconds of landing, the main comm. channel was decrypted. If human security was bad enough, their cybersecurity was abysmal at best. No reinforcements were needed for this mission.* &amp;nbsp; *We circled the area, careful to remain downwind of the single defender in his tower. Not as if it mattered. He just sat there, unaware, polishing an archaic kinetic rifle. It was strikingly odd that despite having enough essence to power a dreadnought for decades, the humans could not even afford a decent laser turret. It probably never even occurred to them to upgrade, given their tactical track record.* &amp;nbsp; *A radio crackle broke the woodland silence.* &amp;nbsp; ""Hey Cyrus man, I ever tell you that story about my dogs?""

They probably believed this was some elaborate joke being played on us by high command. I flared my gills to threaten them, and to keep concentration on the mission. Varquin command did not jest. They only test.* &amp;nbsp; ""So what happened?"" ""When we got back, I yelled at 'em looking all over for my 3 months of paycheck back.

Ain't no one givin' me that, even if they're good boys most of the time."" &amp;nbsp; *We approached the point. Uplink to our ship faltered, the waves oscillating in and out of focus. The scouts chalked it up to the fact that this area was a known dead zone, and accounted for it. They did not expect the interference to be this strong though.* &amp;nbsp; ""Now I figure that a rock ain't gonna do any good in a dog's stomach so I bring them all to the vet.

Anyways, we got the ring and I was cleared to engage."" &amp;nbsp; *Immediately the sentry turned and fired five successive shots- four of which struck directly into both heart-brains of each scout, and one of mine. I dove under cover before the sixth, and caught myself grasping at the dead radio- its crackling static a mocking siren of impending death. I cursed the humans for their cruelty. The only way to win was if I got one shot in before he did. Humans can only take one before falling. Such a weak, insolent species. I could not fail.

So after some major life changes, for the better I promise, I have decided to get back into writing again. It calms me. So if you're new to my New Neighbor series, welcome. If you're a returning user then some things might seem familiar to you and some might. I have decided to rewrite some things. The prologue is a little short, but I want to see everyone's interest first. This series was inspired by the works of [Takumi Yanai - Gate: Jieitai Kano Chi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri](URL and our very own [Isamov123 - New Horizons](URL So let's meet the New Neighbors _____________________________________________________ The universe is a place of wonder. No matter where you look there will always be something that can leave an ordinary person speechless. Lightyears away you can find stars so bright that they can be seen even after they whither from existence. Black holes can slow down time to a standstill. If you were to look hard enough you might even find a new neighbor. But what if that neighbor found you first? What if they werent interested in being the friendly neighbor from next door? The universe can be an amazing place, but it can also be scary one. &amp;nbsp; In our story the universe is somewhat different from what we are used to. Mankind, humanity, Earthlings are nonexistent. In their place are the Aurorans. If you were to look at one you might mistake them for humans and technically you would be right. However, many years ago mankind as you know it now was engulfed in its oldest pastime  war. After expanding to the final frontiers of space many believed humanity would finally lay down its arms and unite for the betterment of its own survival. But soon enough old tendencies followed humanity into the stars. Corruption and abuse of power sparked the largest revolution humanity had ever seen - old habits die hard. The Terra Alliance had ruled all of humanity with an iron fist, and the ones who bore the bruises were her colonies. After decades of mistreatment by the Terra Alliance, the colonies made a decree of secession from their oppressive rulers. They were led by one world, Aurora  the crown Jewel of humanitys efforts beyond the stars. The Alliance would not stand for such rebellion and decided to make an example of Aurora by cutting of the cancer at its source. This was their first and last mistake. &amp;nbsp; Aurora was not named the crown jewel of humanity for its shiny metropolitan buildings. Aurora was number one in the industries of weapon design, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence, to only name a few. During the opening salvos of what came to be known as the Expulsion War, it seemed as if the Terra Alliance might win by sure manpower. However, it becomes hard to win a war when that same manpower is now shooting at you instead of the enemy. Thousands of soldiers and their commanding officers joined Aurora and HER colonies. After realizing that mankind would only drag itself further into the mud, every world once under the banner of the Terra Alliance formed under the flags of the Aurora Republic. With only a few loyal soldiers left to defend it, the Terra Alliance retreated back to Earth. Finally the war was over and those who were responsible could be brought to justice. Or so thats what everyone thought. The universe can be a scary place. &amp;nbsp; With no other options in hand, the remnants of the Terra Alliance committed the unthinkable. In an instant every nuclear weapon from the Cold War era to present day was detonated within the atmosphere, engulfing humanitys cradle world in nuclear fire. The voices of an estimated eight billion humans became nothing but silence. The mothers and daughters of the soldiers who mutinied, those who could not escape to the colonies, and even the puppet masters of the entire war were nothing but a memory. Humanity had lost so many of its own and at the same time its birthplace  the place it once called home. There was mourning, sadness, and grief. There was reflection on what humanity had become. For too long humanity had fought among itself. No more would humanity stick to its old ways of taking up arms against its fellow man. &amp;nbsp; From that point on humanity decided to form a new identity. From that point on humanity identified itself as Aurorans. A people that would only raise arms in defense of the species as a whole. There would no longer be wars fought over ideals, religions, or even resources. At last there was peace. Our story begins a hundred years later when that peace is shattered not by ourselves, but by others who wish to bring harm to our species as a whole. A species that does not seek war, but one that excels at it. &amp;nbsp; _____________________________________________________ So let me know what you guys think. "

As always, criticism/questions/comments/thoughts about life/ideas/inspiration are welcome! =============== Humanity was supposed to be the least of three equal races, living in its own universe to keep people from complaining about the unfairness of Angels getting control over inherent good and Fallen having command of inherent evil. We still complained, but we also did something to change it. All that preparation came together in Year One of the New Eon, in which Humanitys Creator, and the Creator of all things (at least all things in two universes), formally transferred responsibility for those two entire universes to His children. It was the first appearance of God in our universe for dozens of millennia, and the revelation that Humanity now had divine right came as little surprise to everyone except us. We already had experience in avoiding the most dangerous of pitfalls, disinterest. We had outstripped our Creator. Control of everything was transferred to an AI-driven Council, where Humans, Angels, and Fallen all created their own AI and let them deliberate as to which Humans would assume control for what period of time. We realized that the vast majority of people are either incompetent to play god, have no interest in doing so, or some combination of the two. And so we instituted a meritocracy. It generally worked, but the Fallen kept trying to take control of the other two AI. It was a constant arms race, only instead of weapons, we competed for inter-dimensional cybersecurity superiority. The Angels helped, as was expected, but after a point, they were outstripped by Human scientists. We could have taken absolute control over the Fallen AI, but we chose not to. The system only works if people let it, and anytime one of the AI was overbalanced, bad things went down. So we Humans played by the rules, ready to break them in retaliation but never willing to strike first."

The Divine Guardsmen were attempting to breach the door by separating the hastily welded-together halves. Right when it seemed like they were making serious progress, a faint sound from the other direction was audible. Captain David immediately raised her gun and began to look for the source of noise. One of the floor plates in the back of the station was being moved to the side from below. To her surprise, a voice from below called out to them. The fireteam all pointed their rifles at the hole in the floor. Dont shoot! Were on your side! FILIA translated. We know you are working against the High Temple as well. Who are you? Lara called back. Were the freedom fighters of the true Great Leader, the Follower who was now climbing out of the hole in the ground told them. His face was marked with a scar on his right cheek. The high temple has bastardized our religion and our heritage. Why should we trust you? If we were with the Divine Guard, we wouldnt sneak up on you and then not attack, now would we. Howd you know wed be here? Francois asked the man, forcibly pushing Davids rifle downward. She relented and ordered the others to do the same. We have informants in the Divine Guard. The Follower looked behind the group, where the Guardsmen had almost succeeded in breaking the door down. We should get moving. Under this station, there is an old tunnel. Francois jumped down first, followed by Lara and Captain David. One by one, the other members of the fireteam jumped down after the others. The last one placed the floor plate back into its place, just as the Guardsmen burst into the room. Their mysterious ally raised an electric torch he held in one hand, revealing several other Followers standing in the darkness of the tunnel. My name is Gressoan chEgdar, he introduced himself. My name is Francois Laffabra. This is Lara Schall. Francois pointed at Lara, who was standing behind him. *Shuttle Asimov near the High Temple visitor terrace* George shoved the two handcuffed priests into the shuttle, where they were taken by members of the fireteam inside. Have you heard from the other team yet? Samantha asked Lieutenant Sahlil Sameer, leader of this fireteam. Yes Maam. He pointed at the map of the city that was projected on a screen on the wall. Theyve been discovered by the Divine Guard, but have managed to evade them. Theyre currently with members of some sort of resistance group. The shuttle lifted off, flying away from the city. Samantha. Harper found herself called from the shuttles comm. She instantly recognized Alexanders voice. Yes, Alex? I take it the intelligence gathering has failed? Not exactly. Lara managed to hide the skimmers. The guardsmen havent removed them, Samantha responded with good news. Theyre currently on the run, together with Follower rebels. We need a change of plan. Oh, I believe Francois and Lara are already working on that. *Rebel Tunnel* The tunnel led towards a ladder. Gressoan climbed up the ladder and opened the trap door. A fellow rebel helped him up. Follow me, theres only very little time., the rebel leader called back into the tunnel. Captain David climbed up first and looked around. Around her were approximately 20 Followers, all of them wearing the same clothes that their leader was wearing. Otherwise, the room was sparse. A dormitory with rows of camp beds was visible through one of the doors. Lara climbed up after her. Where exactly, are we? she asked through FILIA. After the usual few seconds of translation delay, Gressoans answer was heard: Were in one of our safe houses. From here, we plan the insurrection against the High Temple. The entire fireteam had now climbed up though the trapdoor. So, whats the plan? Captain David asked the rebels. I I thought you had one? No, were just here to gather intel. Oh, Gressoan exhaled, disappointed. Well, maybe we can work a plan... He was interrupted by a message from FILIA. FILIA appeared as a holographic avatar on a nearby table, with only her head, neck and shoulders visible. She addressed David: Captain, there are over 100 hostiles in the area. Francois recoiled and, in shock, looked over to the Avatar. How long do we have? Oh, you must be mistaken. They are not coming here. Theyve assembled at what appears to be a marketplace, about 400 meters from here. We have to see whats happening there. Gressoan grabbed his rifle from the table and signalled three of his men to follow him. David, Francois and Lara followed suit, together with three of the marines. The marketplace was full of Guardsmen, with a lot of civilian Followers between them. The group with the Spacefleet officers and Gressoan waited behind an empty corner as the great vidscreen that oversaw the entire market began broadcasting a message. Citizens! We have infiltrators among us. While our brave militia is defending the city centre against the invaders, our capabilities in the outskirts are stretched thin. The infiltrators have collaborators among the population. Oh no. Gressoan said before turning pale. Before anyone could ask him why, the message continued: Anyone here will be deemed a collaborator unless they reveal the location of the fifth column. A noticeably elderly Follower with a walking cane stood up angrily. Im not a collaborator, he scowled at the nearest guardsman. And you lot should get out of here quickly. The reply of the guardsman was as emotionless as it was strict: Comply citizen, and you will not be harmed. The old man raised his cane. Ive had enough of you lot! he screamed at the top of his lungs. I remember a time before you lot came into power and it was a lot bet... His angry tirade was interrupted by a single gunshot that came from another guardsman behind him. From around the corner, the group watched the old man stumble and fall to the ground wordlessly. Ive had enough! Gressoan screamed as he jumped around the corner. Francois tried to drag him back. No, dont But it was too late. Gressoan had raised his rifle and begun firing. Three of the guardsmen were slain immediately and an intense firefight erupted as the other Follower rebels followed their leader and too, jumped out of cover. The fire team looked at Rebekah David, who in turn stared at Francois. Commander, what do we do? Reacting quickly, Francois gave orders: Give cover fire for the rebels and notify Hochstedt immediately. Two of the rebels were hit and instantly killed as the guardsmen regrouped and returned fire. The marines were also hit several times, but, due to their personal shields, escaped unharmed. The civilians had mostly cleared the marketplace in the confusion. We have to retreat! Francois called out to Gressoan as several more of his men and women fell to the ground. No, we just have to Gressoan was shot to the leg. A marine picked him and another wounded rebel up and the group ran away, still giving suppressing fire. FILIA directed them a way back to their safe house. In the narrow streets, they managed to throw their pursuers off. Back at the safe house, a female Follower tended to the injuries sustained by the group. Gressoan looked around the faces present: Seven. We lost seven of my people. Well, this escalation might prove to be useful. If the people realise that the High Temple is willing to use force against its own people, they might lose trust. Francois suggested. Oh no. Gressoan sighed. Its been going this way for years. They will just go on TV and state the rebels committed another act of terrorism. Lara raised her hand, as if she was in school: Well, but what about the networking station you found us in? We might be able to hack into the vid- and telescreens from there and show them the truth. Their cybersecurity is too good. Hacking into the TV systems would be impossible. Oh, you must be new to Humans. Lara sarcastically replied with a mischievous grin. We dont believe in the impossible. *High Temple Gardens* Thelin chResa was standing in the middle of the bright blue bloom, waiting for the inevitable to happen. The bright vidscreen on one of the walls that was showing an address of the Supreme Priest suddenly turned black. As it regained picture and sound, the subject of the video had changed. Instead of the Supreme Priest in his golden robes, a man with a scar on his right cheek was standing in front of the camera. Behind him, both Followers and members of another race, with a pale skin and little hair, in body armour were visible. People of the Great Leader! Gressoan began a speech. Too long has the high temple lied to you, herded you like cattle. Today, we will regain our freedom; the freedom we lost 10 years ago. I am the commander of the Freedom Fighters of the true Great Leader. Instantly, wrath boiled up in Thelin. The same Freedom Fighters that had slaughtered thousands over the last years now dared to address the population like that? Two years ago, they had killed Zhani, Thelins fiance in one of their attacks. We know that you believe we are vile and cruel. But this isnt true. The massacres the High Temple told you of had been caused by the manhunt of the Divine Guard. I can prove it. The vidscreen now displayed surveillance pictures. This was taken two years ago. Guardsmen had rounded up several people while chasing rebels. A captain of the Divine guard called out to his soldiers, who proceeded to gun down the civilians in cold blood. For a split second, Thelin was sure he had seen Zhanis face among those killed. So, all of this had been a lie. The last ten years had been a lie. Behind him, Divine Guardsmen in ceremonial armour were marching past. In their centre, the Supreme Priest was hurrying along. One of the Priests bodyguards raised his gun at Thelin. Step away, Citizen, he commanded. Thelin stumbled backwards. You Liars! he cried out in a half-angry, half-woeful scream. You lied to us all! You killed Zhani. From the middle of the guardsmen, the Supreme Priest stepped out. Oh my dear, it was simply for the greater good. Besides, the exile for the Great Leader demands sacrifice. This was enough, more than enough; this was just too much for Thelin. Swiftly, he raised his gun and fired several shots in futile anger. Two guardsmen were hit and the others opened fire. Thelin felt several sharp pains in his body, two in his arm, and one in his ribcage. Everything felt cold, so very cold as he fell to the ground. The guardsmen ceased their fire, satisfied with their work. Thelin stared at the sky with an increasingly blurry vision. He could see several alien gunships flying above him. Outside his vision, he heard the sound of several jetpacks, a lot of shooting and then silence. Someone came running up to him. This ones still breathing. He understood in words in his language, but clearly not spoken by any Follower. An alien bent above him. The alien had a medium-brown skin, green eyes and black hair. I am Commander Samantha Harper, of the Spacefleet Vessel UEV Einstein. Whats your name? Thelin didnt want to answer, instead just drift off into eternity, so he could be together with Zhani again. The alien repeated in a louder voice: What is your name? Thelin chResa, sub-acolyte of the third order, fifth mess. Breathing, and speaking with it, became more and more difficult as he felt like someone was pushing down on his ribcage. He looked down on himself; his chest was completely free. Your lungs are filling with blood, the alien informed him. She, it was definitely a she judging from her voice tone, spoke into her comm: We need a MedEvac for a Follower right now. Page Dr. Kosti, she knows what to do. Thelin found himself lifted onto a stretcher and driven towards an alien shuttle standing by. On the way, he could see hundreds, thousands, of his people out on the streets, tearing down the flags of the High Temple and replacing them with the old Follower flags with shouts of joy. A breathing mask being put on his face was the last thing he remembered, before he finally passed out. --- My estimation from last week turned out to be a ~~lie~~ error. It'll be 3 parts.
