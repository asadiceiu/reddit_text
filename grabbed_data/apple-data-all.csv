0,vulnerability,apple,Found a vulnerability in apple DEP installed MDMs,1,9rivfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/9rivfa/found_a_vulnerability_in_apple_dep_installed_mdms/,2018-10-26 19:18:28,Today while screwing around with an iOS file viewer I discovered where in the system files MDMs are kept. On a hunch I deleted the file from the backup I made and restored my iPad. Theres no trace of the Lightspeed MDM or web filter anymore. Its totally gone. I dont know if apple knows this or not but I have a feeling this needs to be fixed. This is on the 2017 iPad 9.7 with iOS 12.0.1. 
1,vulnerability,apple,Parents Be Warned: Screen Time Sucks,0,9gux4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/9gux4j/parents_be_warned_screen_time_sucks/,2018-09-18 23:40:26,"I am a parent and was really looking forward to the iOS12 Screen Time feature. It is unusable for so many reasons. Here are a few: 1. Screen Time can be bypassed easily by any kid over 9 years old. For example, if you set Downtime to restrict usage of the the phone between certain hours, all the child has to do is change the time settings on the phone to a time outside the restrictions you set. This vulnerability was identified and documented extensively during the beta. Huge hole that remains unfixed in the final release. 2. Even without problem #1 above, major applications can still operate during downtime. For example, if a child is at his/her Downtime, or has reached a time limit, applications like Safari can be opened. And with Safari, a kid can attempt to navigate to a website, and then the Screen Time app indicates the application is restricted. Good right? No -- all the kid has to do is kill the Safari app, and then restart it. And presto, the website loads unimpeded despite the time limit. Need to go to a different website = rinse and repeat the above. The easy solution to this is to simply disable Safari completely during restricted time periods. Seems like this is possible, since it is possible to restrict certain Apps like Safari at all times. 3. You can not limit text messaging without preventing the kid from receiving messages during Downtime. The preference here is to prohibit texting during Downtime, but allow the phone to continue to receive messages. So that when Downtime is over, the child can view any messages received during Downtime (including important messages from parents). 4. Only one parent can remotely manage each kid's phone. I could go on, but the issues above are enough for me to conclude the best way to restrict access, is to restrict physical access to the phone. In other words, lock the phones up at night. These issues are so glaring that Apple had to know about them before the release. It's a half-baked product at best. Apple -- you can do better."
2,vulnerability,apple,[Opinion] Apple painted themselves into a 'Thermal Corner' with the Macbook Pro just like they did with the Trashcan Mac Pro.,692,8zybd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8zybd9/opinion_apple_painted_themselves_into_a_thermal/,2018-07-19 04:56:39,"A while back Daring Fireball did a very cool and very exclusive [""The Mac Pro Lives"" article](URL In it, there are some very interesting statements by Craig Federighi and Phil Schiller: **Federighi:** &gt; I think we designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner, if you will. We designed a system with the kind of GPUs that at the time we thought we needed, and that we thought we could well serve with a two GPU architecture. That that was the thermal limit we needed, or the thermal capacity we needed. But workloads didnt materialize to fit that as broadly as we hoped. &gt; Being able to put larger single GPUs required a different system architecture and more thermal capacity than that system was designed to accommodate. So it became fairly difficult to adjust. At the same time, so many of our customers were moving to iMac that we saw a path to address many, many more of those that were finding themselves limited by a Mac Pro through next generation iMac. And really put a lot of our energy behind that. **Schiller:** &gt; As weve said, we made something bold that we thought would be great for the majority of our Mac Pro users. And what we discovered was that it was great for some and not others. Enough so that we need to take another path. One of the good things, hopefully, with Apple through the years has been a willingness to say when something isnt quite what we wanted it to be, didnt live up to expectations, to not be afraid to admit it and look for the next answer. ----------------- I'm willing to bet that Apple was hoping Intel's new CPU's were going to run cooler than they actually do. Unfortunately for everyone, Coffee Lake has higher power consumption than Kaby Lake... As seen in the very detailed section under this [NotebookCheck review](URL Which talks about how Performance per watt is worse on Coffee Lake compared to Kaby Lake. Generation|Architecture Name|Process|Model|Cores|Clock (Base-Turbo)|Max Power Con| |:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| 8th Gen |Kaby Lake R |14nm+ |i5-8550U| 4 cores| 1.6Ghz / 3.4Ghz | **41W** | 8th Gen |Coffee Lake |14nm++ |i5-8559U| 4 cores| 2.3Ghz / 3.8Ghz | **51W** | This is a summary table of that review. For those extra 0.4 Ghz, the chips have a 10W higher power consumption at peak performance. Performance per watt is down, and while these new chips have a microcode update for patching the spectre vulnerability, perhaps Intel had to bump up the clocks so this new chip didn't perform worse than the previous generation... (That's one likely reason for why we see these changes). Unfortunately history is repeating itself here - Apple left no thermal headroom on the MacBook Pro, and the extra power consumption, and resulting heat is just too much for these machines. This seems to be EXACTLY what happened with the Mac Pro (2013) which was tiny, but barely enough to manage thermals. ------------ I really hope, if apple is serious, that this generation of MacBook Pros (2016-2018) is set aside and Apple refocuses on Professional computing like they are with the new Mac Pro desktop they have in the works. Until then, I'm not buying a new MacBook Pro - I need a pro machine I can travel with (best tool for my needs) but for now, my 2014 MBP will suffice. "
3,vulnerability,apple,Apple ID Hacked - QUESTIONS,1,9031dt,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/9031dt/apple_id_hacked_questions/,2018-07-19 15:25:37,"I very recently received a notice on my iphone, along with an email, that my apple ID was now being used from a new computer, which I noticed had a chinese character in the name. Immediately realizing what had happened, I attempted to try to figure out how to contain this situation. Although I eventually changed my password, I still have a boatload of questions about this experience that I cannot find answers to with a Google search. As follows: 1) Is there a way to quickly lock down an account that you know has been compromised? If there is a fraud alert from a bank, it almost always comes with a link that says ""if you did not authorizethis, click: X."" Why is there nothing like this in the email/notification Apple sends about a new device using your ID? 2) If my Apple ID password is completely unique, HOW did anyone hack it? I thought whatever vulnerability that allowed brute force attacks that resulted in the nude photo scandal was fixed? 3) How do I report this incident to Apple and get a human being to speak with to try to figure out what happened and if this hacker pulled/synced any of my data? The Apple Support page for the Apple ID does not have anything even resembling reporting fraud/account security (HOW??) 4) When I changed my password, I logged into my account management page and saw that under my list of ""authorized devices,"" the random Chinese computer was still there. Were they able to access anything with my password changed? Why is there no quick way to report an unauthorized user and block their access?? This whole experience has made me completely lose faith in Apple... I am just so unbelievably disappointed at how hard this was and how few answers I feel like I have. 5) In the span of about 10-15 minutes before I was able to change my password, approximately 90 imessages were sent to numbers with the Chinese country code with a very long message in Chinese. When plugged into Google translate, it was a short erotic story about a masseuse, with text at the bottom saying: ""--- WeChat public number search ""Russian bookstore"" reply ""602"" to continue reading exciting content ---"" My question - is this a known attack/MO? If so, are they mostly spammers, or were they going after my credit cards/private notes/photos, etc? 6) Finally, is there anything else I should do to limit any vulnerabilities? I changed my password, enabled 2 factor ID, removed this chinese laptop from my list of authorized users, but so far that is it. Any suggestions? Thank you so much for any and all help or insight. This was an unexpected turn to my night. "

Apparently High Sierra now lacks drivers to support any adapter other than the first party Apple one.

Would you trust this company to no include any malicious software in this driver?

Tons of users appear to be doing it, but after all weve found out about spyware from software from that area, would you pay the premium for the Apple adapter? Thanks!"
5,vulnerability,apple,"iPhone infected with Cellebrite, mSpy, and more. Apple refuses to acknowledge it's bug bounty program - what to do?",1,8ot54b,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8ot54b/iphone_infected_with_cellebrite_mspy_and_more/,2018-06-06 04:17:08,"Note: All of this is documented and pictures and e-mails have been saved in the event someone wants to help me and would like references. Long story short: I was overseas for an extended period of time. People would receive phone calls I did not make, I would receive text messages (on iMessage, Telegram, Whatsapp, etc.) that were not authentic. The iPhone was hacked without my knowledge. The iPhone was never and never has been jailbroken. I informed Apple of this (including the vulnerability in the Wifi chip of the phone) over a year ago via their product-security team. I never received a response. Upon my arrival back to the US, I went to my local genius bar. I was told by the head of the genius bar to have the phone examined by a law enforcement forensic analyst. So, I then spent over $500 to run a forensic analysis on my iPhone. At the time, it didn't occur to me that this forensic analyst was using cellebrite (or a variation of it) to inspect my phone. The analyst literally popped the phone into his equipment and didn't need a password nor any form of authentication to access my device. The analyst could see all recent activity on the phone (including deleted pictures, old contacts from eons ago, etc.) After this event, I was told to enroll in the Apple developer program to ensure I receive the newest security updates as quickly as possible (so, I had a DEV/Beta profile on the phone). This apparently still did not stop the device from being hacked. Fast forward to April of this year. I was using iMessage with the same phone....under the impression that my phone was secure. I screen shotted in real time my messages disappearing as I was typing them. I sent another followup email to the product-security team. No response after 2 months. I ended up calling Apple HQ and explained the situation. I was assigned a case number and essentially, all that happened was a hard reset under the guidance of security at Apple via AppleView. I informed the security specialist that the phone had mSpy previously confirmed on the phone, and in addition it was injected physically with cellebrite from the ""forensic analyst"" unbeknownst to me. After spending more than 6 hours on the phone with Apple with my case number, I was told that the bug bounty program only applies to people who have found a ""solution"" to hacks. I reiterated on the call to make sure I understood this correctly. So essentially, having a device that's had it's AppleID hacked, iCloud hacked, has been physically injected with cellebrite (etc), and while being enrolled in the Dev program, this phone does not qualify for the bug bounty program, nor does it qualify for anything else in relation to help from Apple HQ. I would like to ask, what's the point of the bug bounty program if devices that have been visibly hacked (as seen in the AppleView sessions), why does Apple not care to find the vulnerabilities in the hacked devices? There's literally nothing Apple can do except do a refresh wipe on the account and phone? To recapitulate: iphone --&gt; mSpy --&gt; forensic analysis (cellebrite injection) --&gt; AppleCare and Apple Sec do nothing. Where can I go for help with this? It's absolutely absurd that Apple doesn't have a program for devices that are compromised. If you're an innocent person who's life has been turned upside down due to spyware and malware, and Apple is so hardcore about the security of their products, I would assume Apple would want the device (or something similar to the bug bounty program). Any suggestions or advice are greatly appreciated. Thank you. "

12,vulnerability,apple,PSA: Physical Access is Total Access,112,7g8o86,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7g8o86/psa_physical_access_is_total_access/,2017-11-29 10:46:23,"Edit3: It seems that the exploit works when Screen or File sharing is turned on, as this by passes requirement for a password to be set in the same way that the system preferences unlock screen did. This promotes the exploit from requiring physical access and privilege escalation to a network penetration vulnerability. Much worse than my original assessment A lot of people commenting on [this](URL post are very concerned about the recent exploit found on macOS High Sierra that allows the root user to be enabled with a blank password. While this is in fact concerning, it isn't even close to the worst exploit ever, and that's because physical access to an unencrypted system is total access. Unless you have file vault and a firmware password turned on, anyone with physical access to your computer can get a root shell or mount your computer as an external hard drive by design. They're called single user mode and target disk mode respectively. It's also important to note that this bug is a privilege escalation bug, not a penetration bug. That is to say that it is only exploitable by people who already have access to your computer, whether it be physical or through VNC or remote desktop. Some random person on the internet cannot use this against you. If you are really concerned about the security of your computer and data, you'll do the following: - Enable file vault - Set a firmware password - Require password upon waking from sleep and screen saver In the wake of this bug, setting a password for the root user is also recommend, but would ordinarily not be needed as a user with no password cannot be used to login. Edit: Fixed link and grammar/spelling Edit2: It looks like the exploit may also work on local networks when display sharing is turned on. See [this](URL tweet."

I have a Iphone 6S that is currently updated to the current firmware/update as of today did several updates through Itunes as well. I just feel very paranoid regardless consulting a genius at the Apple Store how immune IOS is to malware/spyware. Here's the thing. Recently I noticed weird texts and conversations with relatives that make me feel that there is something wrong. For example, I'll get a text from people RIGHT when I make it to my house. I'll drive into the driveway and get a text, ""yay! you made it home! Text me!"" when no one is even in the house. This happens alot. Very frequent since last year. Strike one. Then there's these two relatives I know that came to me to talk about photos and notes I made on my phone that I never shared info about. I am very private with my phone, even sleep with it under my pillow. So I made a PC Part Picker list for a desktop I'm building and the next afternoon they came and asked about the list, why I considered building a desktop, strike two. 1.I never shared my icloud password or passcode 2.I made sure it is a secure password and protect my phone with my life 3.I don't do goofy shit with my phone/no jailbreak. Specifically stock. After research I came up with some conclusions, YiSPecter is a patched vulnerability, so not that. Metasploit is a very common intro tool so they might be using that tool, I dunno. I read somewhere that duplicating someone's SIM card is another easy access into the phone and can be easily received in the wrong hands unless the person specifically demand to their service provider do not allow duplicates, changes without their specific permission. After this inclining suspicion I went to both the Apple store and my local phone service provider to clarify things. I asked the Genius again about possible IOS malware/spyware. They immediately concluded that my phone was updated and IOS is immune to such viruses, and only said it would be a problem if it were their Mac Computers. Phew! Then I went to my local phone service provider to see if my SIM card was duplicated. They also told me(with kind of an attitude)that SIM cards cannot be duplicated and cannot be used for malicious activity since they don't store personal information, just allow service.

In looking for an app or method that would allow me to compose a message to be delivered at a particular time I discover that not only is there no such thing in the Apple universe, there never will be such a thing because Apple specifically disallows timed message delivery. The only reason I can find is the ""security issue"" mentioned in the title, but no other explanation. How does allowing me to compose a message at 4 AM to be sent at 8 AM equal a ""security issue"" so dire that not only does Apple not do it, they don't allow anyone else to do it on their hardware, either? I don't get it. EDIT: Yes, I know there are some workarounds, all of which are either costly (such as paid apps or free apps that access paid services) or klugey (setting up Automator scripts on a Mac to send messages for you? Puhleese!), but none of them simple. That's not the point of this question, anyhow. The question I'm asking is WHY does Apple restrict this? What exactly is the security risk in allowing this? I can find all manner of mentions that the simple function of setting a time/date for iMessage or SMS text delivery is disallowed by Apple. To quote one: **""[T]he iPhone doesnt let you schedule messages. There isnt any such feature in the default Messages app, and Apple wont allow any third-party apps to send a message without you explicitly tapping the Send button.""** So whydafuq not?

25,vulnerability,apple,How my AppleID was compromised.,0,4xbhtc,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/4xbhtc/how_my_appleid_was_compromised/,2016-08-12 13:00:04,"So, i was an Android user and decided to switch temporarily to iphone due to some issues in my Nexus phone and i must say the experience has been disheartening. One of the first things i was trying to do was to setup an appleID. To my shock, when i entered my email id to register, the system prompted that this email ID is already registered as an AppleID. The next thing which i did was to reset the password and i was able to successfully do this. After logging in, I could see the user information of the earlier user who tried to register with my email id. There was no payment information registered, but i was able to see the name, DOB and address information. I also see that this user has incorrectly entered some invalid rescue email ID. I cant use [this](URL link to reset my security questions, as it prompts me to enter the answer to security question to reset my security question ! Now, since i didn't have access to the answers of security questions the earlier user had set, i tried to contact Apple Customer Care to explain this incident and to reset the security questions. And honestly, i was disappointed with the way they responded to this incident. On the call, i tried to explain this issue and i requested them to tell me the below information :- * When was this ID created? * Was the user able to verify the email address(*which was of course mine*) * Was there any kind of activity on this account? * Resetting the security questions. The initial support agent was pretty adamant that this ID was created yesterday by me and there was no activity on this id. I explained to her that i could see the previous user's information right now. This agent redirected the call to a senior technician to assist me. He started off by asking me the token# which can be generated on the site to assist in such issues, which i gave him. Below were his thoughts on this issue :- * If you want to know more information, like when this ID was created and was there any kind of activity, or to reset the security questions, there needs to be 2 level authentication. The first being the token# (*which i gave him*) and the second being the Credit card information. I was deeply concerned with this as he was asking me to verify my identity by putting in my Credit Card# on a profile which is not completely owned by me till now. * Hesitantly, i go ahead and put in my credit card details. Now, the site throws an error stating ""unable to validate the information"". I am pretty sure there are no issues with my credit card. * I again call in the customer care and explain to them the same issue. At this point, even they dont have much clue as to what could be the issue. Now the customer care folks say that they need to raise an RTA (*or something like that*) to escalate with their engineers. Now the things which pissed me off was the customer care folks were trying to take this issue pretty lightly and just kept on delaying. To summarize, below is an example of how this can be misused. * So, right now i can grab an email id of any of my friend (*who could be a potential apple customer in the future*), and register an appleid by submitting the security questions. * i wont be able to verify the account as i dont have access to that email ID. * Assume, after certain days my friend tries to register for an appleID with his emailID. He would be prompted by the system that this email ID is already registered for an appleID. * My friend can change the password and login, but he cant change the security questions. * Even Apple has no clue of how to reset the security questions. Isnt this a vulnerability in the system which can be exploited where people can just create AppleID accounts under the email id of different person? "

34,vulnerability,apple,A thought on Apple's rumored *rootless* functionality. Will the user be able to disable it?,3,372xl7,http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/372xl7/a_thought_on_apples_rumored_rootless/,2015-05-24 20:59:22,"I cross-post a significant part of this from a comment I just made over at r/osx. *rootless* is, as many of you know a new, rumored, security feature of OSX 10.11, whereby access to System files would be forbidden to the user, even with root/administrative access. Many here on r/apple, over at r/osx, and elsewhere are not very happy with the idea of losing yet another piece of control over their own machine. On this same line, others argue that they expect that the feature can be disabled. What I'd argue instead is that, from a security design perspective, to be able to disable rootless would make its very implementation a bad (i.e. useless) one. What this new function aims at, is basically to prevent the access to system files by simple privilege escalation. I.e. the attacker prompts a password to the user or uses a vulnerability to get root access to the shell, and do nasty stuff with your system. The attacker can be a human attacker, or a piece of malware, or any vulnerability exploit delivery mechanism - it does not matter. If you include a function to overcome/disable this, that can be simply called from the administrative panel (i.e. goes on to change some com.apple.* file the administrator can change) with root privileges, the ""rootless"" implementation becomes immediately stupid. At this point to disable rootless becomes a single, deterministic step that the attacker has to take after the privilege escalation happens and before touching /System. This obviously does not add any additional security to the system, because the very same privilege escaltion attack that would have worked without rootless would still work with rootless with no added complexity. That's why I do not think this is going to be Apple's implementation of rootless. **edit** I add here a comment I made further below to clarify the issue better. let's clear this up. the question here is ""would rootless add any real security to the system, could it be disabled by an administrative user?"" Because of the functionality of rootless, the attack we focus on is having the attacker installing files in some system directory. Therefore: goal: the attacker wants to get some files in /System. **CASE A: no rootless.** /System can be accessed only by an Administrator. The attacker must: 1.A) Escalate privileges and become root. The attacker can: trick the user in giving him the password (e.g. prompting a password dialog); use credentials he/she has already stole; exploit a system vulnerability that grants him root privileges without having to use the actual credentials. 2.A) Use the access granted in 1.A to install whatever he/she wants in /System **CASE B: rootless, can be disabled by root.** 1.B) Same as 1.A. 2.B) The attacker uses his root administrative access (gained in 1.B) to disable rootless using the exactly same procedure as the administrator would legitimately use. 3.B) Same as 2.A. 2.B does not require any further attack to be executed by the attacker, as he/she is simply executing actions that the administrator can, by design, execute. Therefore 2.B does not add any further constraint/complexity to the successful attack. **Hence, if rootless can be disabled by an administrative user, rootless is useless.**"

I love my Galaxy S9+, it's by a long shot the best phone I've ever owned. However, I'm thinking about jumping ship to an iPhone for my next phone, or within the next year since Apples OS is more secure and has privacy as one of their top concerns. Coming from someone who hasn't had an iPhone since the 5s which I had up to 2017 around iOS 10 days, and been using Samsung Galaxy S series devices since, what should I expect if I decide to pull the trigger? I have a few questions since I'm not familiar with how iPhones have been. If anyone knows the answer to any of these, it would be much appreciated! 1) What is the best iPhone I can get used for around $350? I'd be selling my S9+ and a few other things. I'm fine with a used phone, every phone I have has been used/refurbished except my 5s. 2) Has the design or OS changed since iOS 10 other than the physical design of the phone? 3) How does do recent iPhones perform on T-Mobiles LTE network, should I expect similar connection levels and data speeds? My S9+ has been great so far, and fast internet is important to me. 4) How much of a pain would it be to transfer all my stuff over (50gb worth) to Apple? 5) Would be I have to be downgrading in terms of specs? 6) Is Apple Pay almost the same thing as Samsung Pay? 7) As someone who likes technology a lot and utilizes a lot of functions on my phone, would I be disappointed in the software department going from Samsung One UI to iOS? 8) Can you still jailbreak iPhones like I did on my 5s, or is that dead now? Thank you all! This is just a consideration I have been having ever since I discovered how much data Google collects and sells from the OS. Privacy and data security is important to me since I've been studying and getting into coding and cybersecurity in the past year. It would come to a lot of shock to people if I bought an iPhone though, since I always raved how good my Galaxies have been in recent years. Privacy and knowing my personal data isn't being sold online by big companies is more important to me though "

39,cybersecurity,apple,My opinions on the new 2018 MBP,0,8ydmr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8ydmr1/my_opinions_on_the_new_2018_mbp/,2018-07-13 06:55:19,"To start I'll disclose some information about what I use Macs for and my history with them: I have been an avid Windows user for nearly my entire life and just recently switched to Mac earlier this year. Back when I used Windows, I'd describe myself as a power-user and I was constantly getting the newest machines with the beefiest specs. I'm also a current college student triple majoring in Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, and Cybersecurity so it goes without saying that I need a reliable machine that can handle intensive work like multi-tasking between 3-4 IDE's, compiling 1000+ lines of code, 20-30 minute debug sessions, modeling, autoCAD, CAS, VM, and various exploit tools. What made me eventually switch over to Mac was XCode, being able to triple boot, pc longevity, design, and the ecosystem. I hunkered down and ending up buying an i7 2.3ghz 2012 MBPr and I love it, but I'll be honest and say that I am considering selling it and getting a new model. Now to get to my opinions on the new MBP's, I'll break it into an easy pro-con list. # PROS: * Gorgeous design (same dimensions and design as 2017, but still nice to point out) * New coffee lake processors (4-core standard, 15"" can get 6-core) * 2 more (for a total of 4) Thunderbolt ports * 13"" model is *fast* \- like *really fast*. Some early benchmarks have shown that the spec'd out 13"" is actually faster than the spec'd out 15"" for single-core tasks. So I no longer have to pay a premium for a larger 15"" screen I don't want or need just for extra performance. * New keyboards. I know that Apple claimed the only new feature to this 3rd generation of keyboards is ""quieter"" typing, but I suspect this was more of save-face technique they used to avoid admitting their defective keyboards. After all, they're still sticking to their story that it's only a few cases, not a widespread event. * More powerful (albeit only slightly) gpu * 32 GB RAM *^(finally)* * True tone * Mojave compatibility (obviously, but still worth noting) * 4TB SSD available (I know it's expensive, but little known fact - SSD prices make a huge leap once you pass 2TB) * Improved battery life in 13"" (not sure about 15"" after switching to DDR4 RAM) * T2 chip (huge for security professionals - more toys to play with, more things to try and break &gt;:) ) * Hey Siri # CONS: * Touch bar received no major update. I'm fine with it being standard on every new MBP, but if that's the case then I expect Apple to update it every year like they would the cpu, gpu, screen, etc. * Still no escape key * Still using i5 chips for baseline model. For real? It's 2018. i7 should be standard not an upgrade option. * College student discount is meh. I'd rather have 10-20&amp;#37; off my new machine than a free pair of Beats, imho. Now I have to jump through hoops to try and sell these things on eBay. Also, 20&amp;#37; off on Apple Care+ is sort of a joke/tease. If you want me to bite the bait and buy it, give me a real discount. * Screen resolution and ppi unchanged All in all, these machines actually look good. Are they earth shattering or *ohmygoshineedtosellmymacrightnowandbuythenewmodel* worthy? No. Will I upgrade from my 2012 machine? Probably. The processors offer a considerable leg up from last year alone, and almost doubly outperform my own from 6 years ago. If you're not impressed, rumor is that Apple will still be releasing new MB's later this year that - wait for it - *don't* feature the Touch bar. My guess is that this'll be the new MBA model and the rumored ""lower priced"" MB. I'd say that Touch bar is probably a standard feature on MBP's from here on out (sorry to the folks who hate them). What do you think? Are you going to get the new MBP? Why/why not?"
