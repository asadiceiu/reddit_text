I have multiple credible sources like NIST and memorandums from the executive office to the IC community, but none of that covers the regulatory requirement. If some people could comment the regulation they used along with the vulnerability it covered, that would be helpful to me and I'm sure many other people who go through this course. Hopefully this requirement gets kicked in the future, but it's here at the moment, so I guess we just have to deal with it."
1,vulnerability,WGU,PASSED C844 (Emerging Technologies in Cybersecurity),1,gq3mn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/gq3mn8/passed_c844_emerging_technologies_in_cybersecurity/,2020-05-25 13:34:27,"Proudly to announce that I can finally place this one under my belt! To be honest, I did not read the whole course content, but I did review the labs (1,2,3,5,9) to prepare myself for the Nmap and Wireshark portions. My only struggles with this course, was using the virtual labs on my MacBook. Regardless if I tried FireFox, Brave, Chrome, or Safari --- none of them worked. It would be a hit or miss when I initially started this course in the beginning of May. The labs were down for the first portion of this month. What prepared me the most was the fact I already had my Security+ &amp; SSCP (Kudos to WGU!) -- If you have those two certifications or if you already took these two courses at WGU, then this course should be a breeze since Security+/SSCP covers most of these domains already. This course was more of a refresher. Good material for researching and referencing. Here are a quick pro-tips for my course: Lab 1: Nmap: Make sure all the virtual labs are turned on. Then, follow the scan instructions. *(It takes several mins to load fully).* From there, you need to look at the network topology. This will be a good starting point to see which hosts have the most active ports and from there you should be able to detect vulnerable ports. Great website to reference ports: [URL Common Vulnerability and Exposures -- great resource for port vulnerability. It has a massive knowledge database. Wireshark: Simply run the pre-loaded scan and filter through anamolies and ports. There are a ton of resources/vulnearbilites here that you can use. For my demonstration, I only used 4. Another good resource is to use the labs that are provided. This will give you enough demonstrations on how to use Wireshark and what to look out for. Hint: You can also use the search bar to filter out information. Keywords help as well (Ex: NTP,POP3,HTTP, etc...) Final report pages (including references and cover): 15 pages -- (I go into details a lot in my research papers). Lab 2: Read the entire case study at least two times. Highlight or Comment (Word) each paragraph and point out any feedback, vulnerabilities that you detect. This will help you write out your report. The report was fairly easy. Since I've been working in IT for several years now, I have experience creating MDM policies and working with wireless networks. Simply, research good policies, and companies that coincide with the report. You need to know at least one legality concern with the company. I can't give you the answer, but think which law can be used in this scenario and how it relates to it. Final report pages (including references and cover): 8 pages. Hope this info helps! It took me about 3 weeks to complete this course. I did not read any material or took any pretests. I only went over the labs mentioned above and used my expertise experience. Note that you do not have the same amount of pages that I did. Some people only wrote about 5-6 pages and still passed. I like to give as much detail as possible. It's always better to have too much than too little. Good luck Night Owls!"

This was BY FAR the worst class in the entire WGU-IT lineup. After reading other reddit posts about it, I was not thrilled to be taking it. The fact that it is a part of the incredibly dated and ""mile wide, inch deep"" EC-Council did not help either. About 15-20 questions are on the tools mentioned throughout the book. A lot of questions are situational (James is an Incident Manager at ABC Corp...). I read a lot of complaints about bad grammar and spelling to the point that it made the question not understandable. I didn't have that issue, I saw some grammar errors, but if you have half a brain you can easily figure out what they are trying to say. Maybe that was just my question set, I dunno. A lot of the questions will pull from other classes in the CSIA lineup, so you'll already know some of the stuff. I found it very difficult to study for this test due to my experience with the poorly written and organized material (which I go into great detail below). I found these pluralsight course somewhat helpful: [URL The history of this Cyber Defense and Countermeasures course, or the ECIH/Certified Incident Handler, is that the v1 class was incredibly easy. So easy, in fact, that no one gave much credit to the cert you got from passing the exam. ""Not worth the paper it's printed on"" was the most common phrase I read. So ECC comes out with a v2 of the course. They doubled the number of questions (now 100) and test the graduate on the most pedantic of data points. ""There are lists, Neo, endless lists...where graduates are no longer taught. They are tortured."" So what makes this course so terrible? 1. It is entirely dependent on the poorly written, horribly organized, and extremely repetitive EC-Council certified curricula. There is NO WGU alternate study or test prep material (I would wash uCertify's feet with my tears if they had course material). There's not even a pre-assessment! The qualifier for getting an assessment approval from the course mentor is ""complete the material"" and ""learn the tools."" Awful. And it's over 1000 pages! The official ISC2 study guide for the CISSP is barely more than that at 1100 pages! 2. The course material is out of date by YEARS. If you visit some of the URLs that append the list of tools at the end of each section, you'll see they haven't been updated (or in business) for years. I found several with copyright year or latest blog entry from over TEN YEARS ago (check out [URL which is listed as a tool in the Live Process Analysis section; I hope you have .NET framework 2.0 cause Yapro won't run without it). And LOL at referencing sourceforge as an official location for ""respected tool sets."" Other referenced sites are github and (my personal favorite) [docs.google.com](URL LMAO. Some of the info is completely irrelevant too. There is a section on reporting spam emails and it gives you step by step instructions for Gmail, Yahoo Mail, and Hotmail. I guess they haven't heard of that small email startup all those young tech companies are using called Outlook. 3. ECC takes a shotgun approach with incident response and handling. The material covers the roles of Incident Manager/Analyst across multiple departments and disciplines. You are expected to become an expert on everything from analyzing email headers, to pulling volatile data from a CPU cache, to configuring firewalls, to hardening application code, to performing vulnerability assessments, to assessing the behavior of insider threats. There is no ONE PERSON who does all that at any company at the level they discuss in the book. However, the actual granularity they cover is laughable. For example, they have multiple lists that looks like this: 1. Set up work space with proper lighting and ergonomic chair 2. Open laptop 3. Place hands on home row of the keyboard 4. Type in admin username and password to log into the computer 5. Copy volatile CPU cache data to a USB drive you forensically sanitized earlier 6. Double click on word processing icon on your desktop 7. Open ""Chain of Custody"" document 8. etc... 4. I have some **VERY STRONG** suspicions that EC-Council is breaking ethical boundaries. They have an [""Elite Vendor](URL program where some company that meets the ""high standards"" set by ECC can pay them $5,000 up front and $3,600 every year after that to be part of the prestigious group. ECC says one of the benefits of membership is: *""Article, inserts and advertising in* *other EC-Council publications* *where deemed fit and appropriate, on a complimentary basis or at discounted rates.""* A **HUGE** part of this course (huuuuuuuuuuge) is the endless lists of tools to perform certain tasks; tools you've never even heard of before. Typically, one or two tools get their own ""spotlight"" at the top of the list with a paragraph or two descriptor and several bullets about product features. Then the section goes on to list a 6-10ish more tools to accomplish the same thing, each accompanied by a URL. So what am I saying here? I'm saying it looks **SUPER SKETCHY** that ECC is headlining certain tools with straight up plagiarized web copy (*PhishTank is a collaborative clearinghouse for data and information about phishing on the internet*), while dumping a wheelbarrow full of other tools into each chapter. Fortunately, ECC provides a link to all their ""Elite Vendors"" so we can see there is no conflict of interest in the tools they mention in their CERTIFIED CURRICULA. Oh, wait, [the link](URL doesn't actually take you anywhere: 404 PAGE NOT FOUND. I did an [Internet Archive](URL search on that URL and found out it has never existed at all. I sent an email to ECC partner support asking for a copy of the list. I have yet to receive a reply. 5. The endless lists. I counted the number of bullet points per section across all the chapters. The average is 80 bullet points per section. Not per chapter. PER SECTION. Some sections had between 200-300 bullets. One section has two and a half consecutive pages with nothing but bullet points. Didn't we learn in high school that if your presentation has more than 3 bullet points, it's a bad presentation? I think ECC skipped that class. The bullet points are just a symptom of the real illness, a desperate attempt to remain relevant. During the actual test, you will be assessed on your ability to memorize lists with more than a dozen items. I had maybe 20 questions about random tools that do some such thing. Some of the tools weren't the ""headliner"" tools I mentioned, but rather buried deep in one of the lists. You'll also be tested on your ability to remember a couple dozen ""things to consider when doing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ forensic analysis"" from 9 different chapters. The really crappy thing here, is that if you can't remember Step 7 from the Email Spoofing Incident Analysis process, or a few random tools to perform packet analysis or behavior monitoring, you'll fail the test and won't pass the class. Failing a student for not knowing the trivial details of such disparate processes procedures, methodologies, and ideologies is immoral. It's like testing a ballet dancer at Julliard on the total weight in grams of a specific kind of ballet slippers. WGU, I don't know what kind of dirty pictures ECC has of you, but they are clearly blackmailing you into maintain your relationship. I want any of the faculty from the College of IT to look me in the eye and tell me this is a valuable certification that will advance my career. This course is a disgrace and diminishes the claims you make in your mission statement about ""improving quality"" and earning ""credible credentials."" Please, PLEASE get rid of this dumpster fire of a course and severe your relationship with ECC...or at the very least, HOLD THEM TO A HIGHER STANDARD; the same high standard I've held for you up until now."

I have a hard time getting back in the groove after the 19th pun or batman joke. And lastly...and I hate to do this to you...is reading the book. I've been doing Incident Management for over 10 years and this book goes off on the most irrelevant tangents and deep dives. I'd say about 20% of this book is actually useful: the forensic processes (NOT the 65 point bullet lists of ""things to consider""), the legal concerns (laws, regs, standards), risk/vulnerability/BCDR/, building an incident team. The rest is unnecessary and it's downright slimy for ECC to say a student doesn't know Incident Handling because they can't remember the name of some random tool used for analyzing email headers that you download from Github. There is a butt-load of tools, try to be familiar with at least a few from each section to improve your chances with those questions. I honestly wouldn't bother with the endless lists. As long as you understand the general concepts of what to do in certain situations, you should be able to make it through those questions. I would recommend being familiar with the steps for certain processes like gathering forensic data or Incident Response. There are some questions about those specifically and knowing the steps and the correct order will help you. This was by far the hardest class, harder than the CCSP or ITIL Foundations (which is really dry). There are some quizlets online that were helpful (check other reddit posts on C842 and there is one linked in the course chatter). There is also a practice test set on Udemy which is kinda useful but not amazing. It does get you in the groove. For 10 bucks it's not a terrible study material since there is literally nothing else. Go into it with a positive attitude and have confidence in everything else you've learned so far. The ProctorU Chrome Add-on they make you download is total BS too. They ~~demand~~ request access to your computer and then run a script that kills a bunch of background processes. But they don't tell you about the script or what it does until it already runs. You just get a notification that says ""abc background process closed, def background process closed, ghi background process closed, etc."" Like, WTF?? Ugh. Now I have an axe to grind. WGU, I am disappointed you have maintained your relationship with EC-Council and you should be ashamed you make students take this class. As far as I can tell, the ECIH/Certified Incident Handler used to be incredibly easy in v1. So easy, in fact, that no one gave much credit to the cert you got from passing the exam.

I'm a former BSIT student now in the MSCIA program. I have done course posts for [C726](URL [C725](URL and [C700](URL &amp;#x200B; This one was almost a nice refresher after C726. I took my sweet time reviewing the materials, but I didn't go too in depth because I found them frustrating. I made it through most of BSIT relying solely on uCertify despite it's flaws so I get quiet annoyed when they fail me. This course links to the CISSP material so often it would have been easier to study that only except it didn't seem to relate well to the PA and OA questions. &amp;#x200B; This one is all about the theory, policies, and procedures which might be dry/annoying, but aren't hard. **Exam** I think this exam fits closely enough with the PA, but I think the questions are in general poorly written. In the PA it will direct you to the related chapter. That chapter is likely made up of links from the CISSP material which may or may not be related to the question at all. I think this course in general could use work on linking the actual material to the course and providing better information summaries in uCertify versus paragraph after paragraph of theories. Take the PA, read up on roles (OMG!! Where did their role definitions come from?! I'm still wondering) use the hell out of the practice tests to study and just get it over with. &amp;#x200B; **TASK 1** Not terrible. It was one of the more straight forward tasks except that the task requirement paragraphs skip around a bit so watch out or you'll need to revise for a minor detail. **Advice** I again talked with Wendy who likes to help you talk through your paper organization to make sure you'll cover everything well but without being overkill. Organize the paper to the paragraphs and you'll be fine. I used a few sites like Guru99 suggestions on physical and logical threats/vulnerabilities because I kept mixing them up while providing my examples of how they're weakening the Psinuvia security posture. For acceptable use, mobile, and password policies do a brief overview then do bullet points for specific actions to add to the 'policies'. Add which standard you referred to at the end. Short, sweet, simple. For HIPAA, GDPR, PII don't make the mistake I did and try to include them together. Break them up. It makes it easier for the reviewer to see you're checking off the rubric. For PCI use the [document](URL previously linked by [ChernobylChild](URL . It's a fabulous summary. There are summaries for all the policies if you look. I made a needlessly large table of the 12 requirements and how I planned on addressing them. I made the business continuity planning out to be waaaay more difficult than it needs to be. I revised it probably 10 times before doing the same as the other policies with a short summary directly dealing with the floods and tornadoes problem. IT Department Duties was the easiest part! Make up two departments, make a table with roles and responsibilities, don't forget to include specifics about each role. &amp;#x200B; I ended up wasting a lot of time by fretting far too much about the risk and vulnerability parts. If you're stuck jump in on an easier part because this paper doesn't need to be crazy cohesive."

7,vulnerability,WGU,MSCIA C726 - Cybersecurity Architecture &amp; Engineering,6,cvpsvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/cvpsvv/mscia_c726_cybersecurity_architecture_engineering/,2019-08-27 01:46:26," As noted [previously](URL I have experience with WGU in the BSIT program and I'd like to help increase the information about the MSCIA program as I go along. See my [C725](URL and [C700](URL posts for more information C726 was a beast of a course. Not that the work is difficult, but that the concepts behind the papers are so broad and the scenarios provide a million ways to approach a solution. In addition, the multiple references in the course materials to other sections of textbooks meant that I was never quite clear on what I really had read or if somehow, I just mixed up my information. I wish for courses like these the textbook would use giant block quotes rather than adding links into the chapters because its incredibly disorienting. Im not going to go into too many details since this one has been reviewed a few times and Id rather help answer specific questions for this one. **TASK 1** This is just compiling requirements for a project. Read the SA, and the Case Study and write down what you see as the largest problems. I think theres room for going with a hardware and/or software approach. I did a software development approach because making a requirements document is literally my job, so it was a piece of cake. I was pretty worn out from the C700 course so I wanted to avoid going too deep into a hardware solution. **Advice** 1. Summarize each system as you read through the SA and Case Study. They overlap a lot, but the SA includes more info for the system logic/machines/etc. than the case study. Roughly sketch out the process flow as you go so you dont end up with too much info about each and floundering for a while trying to simplify things. 2. Dont forget before and after flowcharts for **EACH** system. It sounds like this is where a lot of people get tripped up. 3. Read the example for Task 1 I think its an attachment in Chapter 2 of the course materials. 4. Dont get too hung up on trying to answer every security vulnerability. Just focus on the ones that touch your solution(s). (Like dont worry so much about the leaky basement if youre not re-doing the building security) 5. Focus on the whys. What standards is this company responsible for following and how are they failing to do that? Talk about the data and how youre making it more secure via a software/hardware/both solution My submission ended up being about 15 pages. 6 were just the flowcharts and 3 were the requirements. Requirements dont need to be perfect just document what youre planning on making sure the system does. *Just a sidebar that requirements can be stupid easy like: A) (Functional  what it does) The* *system allows users to log on and access data according to their role-based account* *privileges. B) (Nonfunctional  outside the basic functions can be focused on security, traffic,* *hosting location) The system allows multiple concurrent users.* **TASK 2** I found this part to be much more difficult. Its beyond the scope of how I normally work and included that unique blend of hardware/software (at least my approach did) that drives me batty. As a reminder, WGU evaluators dont care if every single detail of a new network or system is made up or painted in broad strokes as long as the rubric is met they dont freak out too much. **Advice** 1. Use the DREAD video (link in the course tips) to understand the spreadsheet portion. However, youre only asked to rank 10 vulnerabilities and address 5. I believe the advice I heard was to make sure the top 5 addressed in the task match the top 5, by rank, evaluated in the spreadsheet. So, if you ambitiously do the entire workbook, youll find yourself mourning the wasted time later. 2. Follow the template, but dont forget to refresh what the rubric asks for. I had to re-submit based on a failure to explain my choices in a few sections including the standards, assumptions, and dependencies. 3. Flowcharts are cool. I re-used mine with a few additions from Task 1. 4. Modes of operation are the devil. I emailed Wendy (Hi Wendy! I guess Im kind of outing my Reddit profile) for specifics and where to find them. She was super helpful, but the course resources werent. She explained evaluators are looking for modes like: production, cloud, testing, parallel, pilot testing, etc types of environments. I think I ended up calling mine like user mode and explained that meant they were outside an administrative environment, so escalations of privilege are harder. 5. You dont need multiple paragraphs for each section. I had a few where I just made a statement and moved on. That didnt seem to be a problem. My submission was like 18 pages for this, but after I had to re-submit I wanted to make sure I covered my explanations of the standards, assumptions, and dependencies were thorough enough. I think I would have benefited by sending in a portion of my paper to Wendy sooner even if it was just the sections I was more frustrated by. This is essentially everything my mentor has ever told me, but I struggle wanting to have a good product before having someone review. Best of luck! I'll respond to questions to the best of my ability"
8,vulnerability,WGU,How to Complete the MSCIA in 2 Months: Quick Reference Guide,53,c244nc,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/c244nc/how_to_complete_the_mscia_in_2_months_quick/,2019-06-19 02:09:32,"&amp;#x200B; # How to Complete MCSCIA in 2 Months # Background First off, this approach may not work for everyone, but I highly suggest the methods proposed in this quick reference document. I work in Information Security as a Risk Analyst and Systems Auditor. My primary activities consist of creating and architecting security/compliance programs for researchers and private investigators. Many of these programs are subject to statutory and regulatory compliance and stipulate the adoption of governance and control frameworks. I tell you this, because every day I facilitate the creation of safeguards/countermeasures and assess the effectiveness of security controls that span numerous frameworks. Therefore, most of the material and even scenarios (performance assessments) were very familiar to me. However, my approach is not solely reliant on experience, but more so a straightforward and repeatable approach towards completing your assignments and beating the evaluators at their own game. So, lets get started! # Passing Objective Assessments with Ease! ## Always Take the Pre-Assessment First! You dont know, what you dont know. I started the program on April 4th and my best friend kept challenging me to go ahead and take the pre-assessment for Information Security and Assurance  C725. Like many of you all, I was extremely nervous and anxious, but I just went ahead and went for it. Surprisingly I passed the pre-assessment. But, heres the thing. even if you pass you still need to prepare for the actual objective assessment. Therefore, I developed a few steps to help you prepare your objective assessments regardless if you fail or pass the pre-assessment. ## Step 1: Review Your Weaknesses It doesnt matter whether you failed or passed the pre-assessment. The goal is to ascertain your level of knowledge and determine where you need to focus your studies. I call this gap-studying, although I guarantee you someone has beat me to itlol. You will need view your coaching report in print view and go through each question one-by-one and understand why the correct answer is right and why the incorrect answers are wrong. ### Make a Quick Reference Guide (QRG) 1. Go through each question one-by-one and look up the definitions for each distractor and correct answer (key). Start populating your study guide in tools like OneNote, Evernote, or Notepad++. 2. Next, go through the course material, and go the end of each section and answer the questions. Add these questions to your QRG too ### Review Course Notecards After Ive made my QRG, I go through the notecards for each chapter just to assess my gaps. If I run into notecards that I have a hard time remembering, I add them to the QRG as well. ## Step 2: Prepping for The Objective Assessment Now that youve created your QRG, its time to review your notes and prepare for the exam. This part is straightforward. Simply scroll through your guide while hiding the answers and answer the question out loud or in your head to see if youre correct. ### Know the Wrong Answers Too! Dont just focus on knowing the right answer. Understand the why the distractors are wrong too. But why Blake? Why in the hell would I be concerned with the wrong answers? Ill tell you. Because those same wrong answers will be right answers in other questions on your actual exam! I used to focus on just knowing the right answers too and I used to be horrible at taking tests when I was younger. So, trust me when I say this is probably one of the smartest things you can do for two main reasons: **1. Youll actually learn the material and will pass the exam** **2. This will prepare you for similar exams and you will be able to easily identify wrong answers.** ## Step 3: Take the Objective Assessment Now that youve built up all that confidence and you are able to identify the wrong and right answers, go ahead and schedule the exam now vs later. The beautiful thing about WGU, is that you can literally take your assessment in 30 minutes at any time of the day. Ive personally found that scheduling my exam as soon as I feel somewhat confident made me grind for the next 30 minutes to get my head in the right space for the assessment. Seven assessments later, and I guess the strategy is working pretty well huh!? I strongly urge you to try these methods. I can honestly say that I did not read any course material in the masters program except for Secure Software Design, because I had absolutely no experience in that domain. # Passing the ""Dreaded"" Performance Assessments Ok, I get it, no one likes writing papers, but I promise I can help you attenuate that anxiety with a few simple steps. They are assessing competency and ensuring that you can articulate your thoughts onto a particular medium in a succinct and clear manner. From my personal experience, writing papers was extremely difficult in the past. You dont have to take my word for it, but at the University of Phoenix, I wrote over 105 papers and some of the instructors were extremely strict for a simple punctuation error. Ok, enough of my rant, lets get to it!  ### Lead the Horse to Water Youre going to have to spell it out for these people. That means that you will need to create your outline based on their grading rubric. They are not going to take the time to pick through your paper to see if you met their assessment criteria. Let me show you how I construct my paper. ### Step 1: Breaking Down the Rubric &amp; Requirements into Actionable Tasks Examine the rubric for HAP2 Task 1: Cybersecurity Management I  Strategic URL URL You need to use the **Requirements** &amp; **Rubric** to Create Your Outline &amp; Objectives. Let me show you how. First, I label the requirement as so. **Requirement** Describe both the physical vulnerabilities and physical threats that put the security posture of Psinuvia Inc. at risk. Provide details from the attached Independent Security Report, including how each vulnerability or threat is negatively impacting the security posture of the company. Next, I create assessment objectives based on the same criteria the evaluator uses to grade our assignments. For example, look at the Competent section in the picture above and break it down into questions that you can use to grade yourself. For example, take a look at the following: Under Competent, it states The submission describes both physical vulnerabilities and physical threats that put the security posture of Psinuvia Inc. at risk. We need to break this down into easily digestible question so we can only write whats necessary and give the evaluators what they want. Check out the example below **Questions:** * **Did you describe physical vulnerabilities that put Psinuvia at risk?** * **Did you describe physical threats that put Psinuvia at risk?** Your end-product should resemble the following: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Requirement** Describe both the physical vulnerabilities and physical threats that put the security posture of Psinuvia Inc. at risk. Provide details from the attached Independent Security Report, including how each vulnerability or threat is negatively impacting the security posture of the company. **Questions**: * **Did you describe physical vulnerabilities that put Psinuvia at risk?** * **Did you describe physical threats that put Psinuvia at risk?** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ### Step 2: Understand the Assignment Now that youve created your outline and you know what the evaluator is looking for you need to get a better understanding of the assignment so that you can actually have something to write about.  **Review the Scenario/Overview** Your goal is to understand the problem, the proposed solution, and why the solution is appropriate. I use a reading method called SQ3R which stands for Survey, Question, Read, Recite, and Review. Lets face it. some of the assignments have pages upon pages of material that we all have to read to gathering a complete understanding of the problem. As an systems auditor, Im faced with the same issue every week. But dont sweat it, heres a quick way you can tackle massive amounts of reading with ease. ***Survey = Creating an Outline of The Content*** Dont laugh, but I literally only read the first paragraph of any material and simply read the first sentence of each paragraph until I finish that section. The first sentence is the limited topic and the authors controlling idea (opinion). This lets you know what to the subject is and what to expect if you keep reading. Surveying or scanning the material allows me to quickly understand an overview of the problem. ***Question = Make sense out of the material*** Now that I have a general idea of what Im about to read, I know where to focus my time and energy. As you start reading a paragraph, make quick bullet points of the main problems. This will assist you in creating your own why, when, where, who, what, and how questions. This method ensures that you dont get writers block. **Read =** In My Opinion, Optional Typically, I only read material that it is very relevant to my career or if Im very interested to me, therefore. well you catch my driftlol. Im not about to read 35 pages of fluff just to figure out the top ten things wrong with the assignment. Instead, I look for keywords like **wishes, wants, considering, fails, tries,** and more to identify the core problems. **Review** This is where I take all of the bullet points I created for the overview and then add them to the outline I created in step 1. Each bullet point/problem should have a home in the rubric. If it doesnt, then it is probably not relevant or conducive to the evaluator. **Recite** This step is good if you are taking notes from your reading to take an objective assessment but not if you are trying to draft a paper for your performance assessment. Performance assessments typically introduce a very specific issue that they want you to solve. Although the recite step is great for self-learners preparing for other types of exams.  For more information on SQ3R, I totally recommend you all look at [**The Science of Self-Learning: How to Teach Yourself Anything**](URL &amp; [**The Science of Rapid Skill Acquisition: Advanced Methods to Learn, Remember, and Master New Skills and Information**](URL from Amazon. These are one of the few books in my life that Ive actually read from cover to cover. Additionally, these books put me in the right headspace while going through the masters program. ### Step 3: Gathering Your Resources/References WGU does have a few good resources in the Course Information section of your assessment. Many students such as my best friend also says that the course instructors may have additional resources. However, Heres my advice on where and how to obtain resources to help you throughout your journey. ***Reddit, Well Im mean youre here already***.  First of Reddit is the number one recommended source that I can provide you. It helped me out tremendously and there are tons of other students just like you and I who are dealing with the same issues with these assignments. Surprisingly, everyone also exercises a fair amount of tact and professionalisms when sharing their thoughts and ideas. ***IT Resources*** The content in WGU is pretty good, although as an IT professional you are probably already fairly resourceful. Here are some additional resources that I use specifically for performance assessments *Resources for compliance, legal, policiesetc.* * URL * URL (this should be your go-to source) * isaca.org * OWASP.org * ISC2.org * URL * URL (for the legal stuff) * IT-specific training resources * URL * URL * URL * youtube.com (yeah thats right good ole YouTube) Im simply summarizing some resources you can leverage at your own disposal, however, please do not view this as a complete list. Dont forget to reference certification guides too. There is a ton of useful information there too. ***Social Media (Well, Just LinkedIn)*** Im not big on social media at all, but LinkedIn and LinkedIn Learning have been extremely helpful for me. I suggest looking for students that are in your same program or already completed it. Similarly, in the same way you found me.  ## Draft the Damn Paper &amp; Stop Procrastinating Listen everyone, its not going to bite you I promise. Well, youll probably get a bite or two from the evaluators once or twice . Like I said earlier, WGU is simply trying to obtain your level of competence of the subject matter. With this in mind, as long as you write against the grading rubric &amp; the requirements and ask yourself the questions you created earlier in Step 1, I promise youll be fine. ### Dont Sweat the Resubmissions So, my best friend and I use two different approaches. He will overwhelm them with tons of legitimate material, so they dont have a choice to send it back. The approach is very sound and has worked for him. However, Im a path of least resistance guy. Once I got a whiff of how strict they were on grading papers, I started to write in an extremely concise manner and gave them very straightforward and focused submissions. Dont get me wrong, all objectives were met, but I did not add any extraneous graphics, charts, plans, or processes unless absolutely necessary and conducive to the paper. My strategy, if you think that more is needed, just dont. Let me repeat that. If you think that more is needed to meet the objective, just dont. But, Blake why would I not just give them everything I can so they cant return my paper for review?. Heres my simple and straightforward answer: The review and resubmissions help you understand exactly what is missing! Why would you spend hours of your time and sanity to add to parts of your paper that may not contribute to your grade at all? I mean we just get a pass or fail folks! If youve tailored your paper to the rubric, created your assessments objectives, and understand the problem; youll be fine. Turn it in and see how well your approach worked for you. If you only had one or two areas you needed to improve, then you did pretty good and have a solid understanding of the material. If you have multiple problems, then your approach needs improvement. No matter how good you think your assignment is, dont go thinking that a random evaluator wont find something wrong with it or ask you add something that may not seem useful at all. Remember, you are writing your papers for them, not for you. # Conclusion Keep in mind that I put in some ridiculous hours to study during this program. I literally study for 8 to 12 hours on weekends and maybe 4 to 5 hours on weekdays. Funny thing, is that I finished my last four courses, including the Capstone in the same week. Theres a funny story of why I did this, and Ill mention that at the end. ## Tips Any classes that only have one type of assessment should be added to your current term. WGU is constantly improving its program and adding more tasks and assessments to their courses. Be proactive and identify all classes that only have one assessment and knock those out first. Especially the assessment objectives. If youre not careful, and dont activate the easy classes, you could wind up with double work for taking too long to complete your program (although theres no such thing ) ## The Funny, but No Funny Story After spending all of Labor Day weekend tattooing my brain with CHFI material, I was ready to take my exam. I scheduled, drank a ton of coffee and was more prepared than ever. After I entered my voucher code, the Proctor attempted to login in with their proctor ID several times. They stated that somethings wrong with the voucher and that they would be unable to continue. The folks didnt even try to contact EC Council or WGU over the phone. So, Im extremely mad right? I just took off half a day of work and wrecked my brain with study material. More importantly, Im totally lit off a triple shot of espresso! Lol,  So I send a nice lengthy and tactful email to WGU and EC Council. Meanwhile, Im still extremely jittery from all the caffeine. So out of frustration, I decide to go ahead and take both pre-assessments for Cybersecurity Management Strategic and Tactical. I didnt even care if I passed; I just need to put this caffeine and frustration to use lol. Surprisingly, I did pass. I actually felt like my day wasnt wasted then lol. So, I went ahead and created my Quick Reference Guides for both exams and took one after another on the following days. That weekend, I was finally cleared to try and take my CHFI exam again. This time everything worked, and I successfully passed the exam. Im very hype now, and all I could think about was going ahead and getting a head-start on the Capstone. Within two days, I finished the Capstone. Honestly, I was so motivated from day to day by constantly pushing myself. Im so glad it is over though, and this is probably the hardest Ive worked for anything during this short amount of time. I hope this strategy helps someone out there. Always feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn if you have questions about any how to approach these assignments. Even if they are not specifically within this program. Find me @ [URL"
9,vulnerability,WGU,MSCIA C700 - Secure Network Design Paper,4,bx3213,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/bx3213/mscia_c700_secure_network_design_paper/,2019-06-06 00:16:08,"As noted [previously](URL I have experience with WGU in the BSIT program and I'd like to help increase the information about the MSCIA program as I go along. &amp;#x200B; For the love of Pete don't do what I did on this one and panic, fret, and overall procrastinate for more than a month. BUT if you do, buckle down and at least do yourself the favor of summarizing in your own words what the scenario expects, the present setup, and what your rough ideas are for correcting the issues. do it over a few days, but don't restart that entire odyssey a dozen times like I did because you'll drive yourself crazy, have too many repeating notes, and make this thing seem like a total beast. Overall I think it took me about two days to write the paper and ended up being about 15pgs. However, I think that's because I created a bunch of guilt and baggage because I've pushed it off for ages. I think the major problem with this paper is that there's essentially no example or hint of what you're expected to produce in the course materials, tips, chatter, etc. In addition the course mentors are trying to help but their advice seems just as vague as the PA scenario. &amp;#x200B; **Important points:** 1. Vagueness. Note just how vague everything is about this assignment not directly referencing physical equipment. My numerous phone calls with student/course mentors stressed I was worrying too much about what type of application would replace another. They care about specific machines not what FTP client you'll use. Point out what applications are vulnerabilities and why. State how you'd remediate it broadly (replace or upgrade to version X.X.X) you don't need to say exact steps or exact application replacements. 2. Proof. Have a reference for why you think something is vulnerable (don't worry about specific internal references for the Zenmap and Openvas scans) like notifications from the vendor's website. Most of the time if it's referenced in the scans you'll have enough info, but if it's something you found on your own (like the router has a specific vulnerability) tell the reviewer where you found it. 3. Gather your replacement options before you start writing. I had a broad idea about what I wanted to use, but I realized quickly I'd mention the replacement equipment elsewhere so I needed to update most sections of my paper as I narrowed down my choices. Eventually I stopped, located all replacement equipment (within my budgeted allowance) and diagrammed my network. Then I could finish the paper without too much additional work. 4. Diagram as you're 'shopping' I know the network layout I wanted to use so I drew that up first and added specific details for each (similar to Company A's diagram) as I decided on each piece. That helped me quickly reference the model number or vendor during my writing. 5.$35k is not a lot I had one specific call where I was freaking out about all the details in this task when the mentor reminded me that in his view the budget was the real problem. It actually helped stop my loop and gave me something specific I could figure out. His advice really helped me make measurable progress. Plus fake shopping was fun! There's no concern about vendor integration, processing speeds (everything is faster than what the companies have now), or getting approval. 6. Scans You don't need to become a total expert on reading these scans. You don't need to reference every finding. Just summarize major concerns and address them somehow (OpenVAS tells you what to do 90% of the time). Zenmap was more intimidating to me until I just researched what every one of those open ports meant. I picked the most concerning of those and ignored the rest. 7. Vagueness I know I said it previously, but be specific about your equipment and how you'll fix things if it will help. Otherwise stop freaking out. You don't need to know every detail about what the hell vsftpd is and if you should use it or lose it. There's a lot of information in this assignment and it's too much. But it does help you learn to sift through the noise and pinpoint the major problems. \*\*Bonus 1 Visio is specifically mentioned, but I used Lucidchart for reasons. It wasn't even mentioned in my summary report. &amp;#x200B; Keep in mind this is what worked for me. I don't intend to give much more specific detail so if you're concerned draft up part of your paper and send it to your mentor. Hell, read it over the phone! Just reach out for help to the people doing this as their job. &amp;#x200B; My hope is that this one will become a bit more polished over time. Presently there's almost no resources published by the mentors on the course page. I assume that's to reduce confusion because they mention repeatedly there are still people taking the previous version. That is doing a severe disservice to those of us eager to accelerate and research on our own. &amp;#x200B; Best of luck!!"
10,vulnerability,WGU,Completed MSCSIA in 23 Weeks (Long Read),13,bckaug,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/bckaug/completed_mscsia_in_23_weeks_long_read/,2019-04-13 09:25:12,"Hello folks. I am writing this the day that I have submitted my application for graduation. I began my degree on November 1st, and honestly, I was not expecting to complete this when I did. This degree was chalked full of good information, and I cannot speak enough praises of the degree as a whole, and how it has helped me progress in my full-time position. I am a network admin at a gov. datacenter, and am a traditional guardsman for the ANG, in the IA AFSC. I currently hold an active Security+, CCNA, CCNA Security, and now the CEH and CHFI. The bulk majority of my degree info was directly relevant to both of my career fields, and it was satisfying to have been able to complete the degree this quickly. Admittedly, there were a couple classes I had complaints with, but my adviser, Tim Leogrande, was willing to take much of my feedback, and provided a lot of great insight for each of my courses. Tim was the real reason I was able to get through this degree so efficiently. (More on that in the closing paragraphs.) Now, for my big caveat to all of this: I would not recommend someone go though the course material this quickly unless you meet the following critieria: * You do not have a job, or you are willing to cut out a lot of your social life. * You have completed the CEH or CHFI before starting the degree. * You do not believe sleep. * You can crank out well written papers quickly. The first few months were pretty straight forward for me. However, once I hit January, things got busy in my personal life, and I really cut it close towards the end. I will go into that with more detail as I discuss each class. * **C700 Secure Network Design** (01Nov - 8Nov) - This was my least favorite class out of all of them. First of all, the text book was the same text book I used for my Associates degree Network 101 course, back in 2015. (Tim gave me the ISBN number to get a head start on the course before my semester started) It quizzes you on a bunch of made up terms that are not industry standard (I.E. The VPN chapter). Fortunately my CCNA and Netadmin experience helped me a lot with this one. Get through this class as quickly as possible, and make sure you are comfortable with those practice questions before you take the test. Be aware that the practice questions (in course material) do not match the test questions. * **TFT2** **Cyberlaw, Regulations and Compliance** (08Nov - 23Nov) - As mentioned by another poster, this class is pretty broad, and arguably vague. Also, this was the first paper I wrote since I completed my Bachelors degree at WVU back in May 2018. Once I found my groove, I managed tasks 2-4 finished in three days. I believe my shortest paper was 6 pages long, and the longest was close to 9. * **JIT2 Risk Management** (24Nov - 28Nov) - This paper was actually pretty interesting, and was great prep work for the capstone. Only a single paper for this class, with a 13-15 page recommendation. I have no idea how that was possible, as I ended up writing a 31 page paper. Now admittedly this was beyond overkill, but it was still a three day write for me. * **C706 Secure Software Design** (29Nov - 16Dec) - I am not a programmer or a system admin, so this course was a bit harder for me. A lot of brute force memorization occurred for this one. I was told that I needed to practice the labs in order to be familiar with the assignments, but the all but one of the labs were broken for me. I mentioned this to Tim, and he said he had received several reports of this and they were working to correct the issue. Admittedly this class was very interesting, but probably the least relevant to my career field. * **C688 Cyberwarfare** (17Dec - 23Dec) - This class was absolutely fascinating. I am a younger guy (25), so a lot of the topics discussed in this course were new to me. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the various attacks that wreaked havoc on the internet leading up to Stuxnet. Also, being in the Air Guard, my experience with Defense-in-Depth was very helpful. *(Admittedly, only spending a week on this class makes it seem like I am lying about learning a lot, but many of my papers had 10-25 references attached to them. And prior experience made a lot of these papers significantly easier to write.)* * **VLT2 Security Policies and Standards** (24Dec - 11Jan) - I have a love-hate relationship with this class. This class has some of the best information in it, in regards to developing a security plan an developing a security plan (very helpful prep work for the capstone). However, this was the only class where I had to resubmit a paper ***5 TIMES***. Task 4 kept getting kicked back for me, and I had to get the professor involved. I eventually worked it out, but I was not satisfied with how I had to do it. *(I attended MAGFEST in January, and I ended up working on Task 4 while setup in the LAN Party center, so I was a bit salty about that.)* Regardless of my paper experience, the information was very good, and forces you to get in that mindset of a security auditor, which is a great perspective in my opinion. * **C701 Ethical Hacking (CEH)** (12Jan - 15Feb) - CEH was... something. I would say that the Sec+ was about a mile wide but an inch deep worth of info. The CCNA was about 10 yards wide, but a mile deep. The CEH was about a mile wide, and three inches deep, with the occasional manhole. The text was very broad and covered a lot of information, which was pretty high level, but there were a few sections that it seemed like you need to know waaaay too much about it. I am a very anxious test taker, so I spent a lot of time prepping for this one. As many others have said, there are a crap ton of typos on this exam, which felt pretty insulting. That being said, the info was good, and not even a week after passing the exam, I found myself using the info at work to solve some complex troubleshooting issues. Funny how things work out. * **C702 Forensics and Network Intrusion (CHFI)** (16Feb - 27Mar) - Jesus H. Christ this test was hard. I believe this is the only time that I have taken a cert exam where reading the textbook front to back was absolutely necessary. Between questions about SIM Cards and Apache logs, this test was all over the place. Also the fact that there is only one other good external resource for studying for this made this that much worse. Actually read the text book. Take the end of chapter quizzes until you get very comfortable with those questions. Please for the love of god purchase the Ken Underhill Udemy course, and DO NOT attempt the exam until you are consistently scoring highly on all of the quizzes. I took this exam twice, and passed on 27 March. This was by far the most miserable experience of the degree. I am going to interrupt my course breakdown here to talk about a very important point that nearly caused me to start a second semester. When you get that email at the 45 day mark warning you that you are close to the end of the semester, please read it. Do not be like me and brush it off. I ignored a very important line in the email: "" If you are looking to accelerate a course into your current term of study, I will not approve accelerating any course after **March 31, 2019 at 11:59 PM ET**. "" Keep in mind that date, and compare it to when I completed my CHFI. In order to complete my degree this semester, I had to have all of my tasks for FXT2 and my Prospectus completed by 31March. Needless to say, between tapping into 1 day of PTO, and probably losing about 5 years of my life with the amount of caffeine I consumed, I got it done. * **FXT2 Disaster Recovery Planning** (28Mar - 30Mar) - This course probably would have been super fascinating, if not mundane. DRP's are not fun, in my opinion, but are absolutely necessary. That being said, I have audited a couple of these in my short career, so this came super easily for me (thankfully). I ended up completing all of my tasks on 29Mar, and had them submitted that evening. Fortunately, only one got kicked back, so that worked out in my favor. * **LQT2 Capstone** (30Mar - 9Apr) - Call it a stroke of genius, or a gift from god, but I managed to get significant inspiration for my project from a previous project I had performed for my bachelors, combined with a recent project I performed at work (network admin at a gov. datacenter). I managed to put together my prospectus over those 2 days, with about a combined 4 hours of sleep over three days. This is not healthy. Please do not do this. That being said, my project ended up being very fun to work on. I have a home lab of networking gear, and a hyper-v based VM box, so I was able to put together my test scenario pretty quickly. The pentesting side of my project turned out to be a lot of fun, as I had never had to brute-force attack a network switch before. I managed to cobble together a 74 page project, including risk assessment charts, STIG checklists/vulnerability assessments, a full-fat project plan schedule, network architecture designs, and a dump of a switch configuration. *(There was quite a bit more, but those were my personal highlights.)* Make the most out of your project, as I was able to use my project to negotiate for a raise at work. As many students were aware, there was website maintenance that occurred last weekend. This disassociated my Task 1 and Task 2 from capstone, resulting in delaying the completion of my degree until today, 12April. A huge thank you to assessment services and the IT department, they provided a lot of information of the status of the recovery, and were very pleasant to communicate with. &amp;#x200B; I want to say a big thank you to Tim. I was initially planning on doing this degree in 2 semesters, originally starting in August 2018, and have my work reimburse my tuition using my work benefits ($3500/yr), and split it between 2018 and 2019. However, I had a training deployment through the ANG which started midway though August pushing my start date back to November. Work stated that they would only utilize by 2019 funds, meaning the 2nd semester would be out of pocket, which caused me to get a bit anxious. Tim mentioned in my orientation (originally in July 2018) that he had a couple students that recently did a 6 month masters. My masochistic ass decided that that was a good idea. Tim really helped me achieve my goals by providing great information for each course, and even giving a couple pep talks in a couple of our meetings. *(Tim mentioned that he hates motivational speeches, yet he is a great motivation speaker!)* He was very realistic with me, and did not sugarcoat any opinions he had. As someone with military background, I really appreciated this. &amp;#x200B; Anyways, this was my degree in a nutshell. As you can tell, I have gotten very comfortable with churning out large blocks of text in a short amount of time (wrote this in about 45 minutes). I really enjoyed this degree, and thought a lot of the information was very good and relevant to my career. Just please, do not do this in 6 months unless you really feel confident in your work, and meet those guidelines I posted at the top.

11,vulnerability,WGU,The uCertify practice questions for Cloud Essentials and Cloud Applications are unacceptably poor quality,3,9f8y07,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/9f8y07/the_ucertify_practice_questions_for_cloud/,2018-09-13 01:50:27,"I just completed my Cloud Essentials course and am working my way through the Cloud Applications course using the uCertify material. Both courses suffer from improperly or otherwise horribly worded questions and answers, that often do little more than create frustration and the sense that I am wasting my time. One of the more egregious examples of this is as follows... &gt;Question: ""Andrew wants to test his cloud access to determine whether there is any vulnerability that an attacker could exploit. Which of the following validations of cloud testing will he perform?"" I chose answer A: ""Vulnerability scanning"", which was marked incorrect with the following explanation. &gt;""Answer A is incorrect. Vulnerability scanning is used to find objects in your cloud deployment that can be exploited or are potential security threats."" ""Penetration Testing"" is the answer uCertify marks as correct, but there is nothing in the question making it clear that it must be a pen test from outside the network. This is just a poorly formed question and there are many more that are just as confusing or plain wrong. I submitted direct feedback to uCertify, but felt this was worth venting here as well."
12,vulnerability,WGU,Finished MS Cybersecurity and Info Assurance last week,49,8p4g9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/8p4g9t/finished_ms_cybersecurity_and_info_assurance_last/,2018-06-07 07:14:48,"Last week I finished up my final task for the Masters of Science in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance program. On Monday my student mentor began the graduation talks with me and after 3 terms, I can finally say, it's over! That being said, I know a lot of people are asking questions about this program so here is my two cents &amp; feedback. To WGU staffers, if you happen to feel this is too negative, I am sorry. I only ask that you use my feedback in the event you remove this post. I am posting this not as a gripe or complaint, but as helpful feedback. I promise not to include any names. This post isn't going to help me as I likely won't be a student at WGU again. I have been working IT since 2000 and specifically with penetration testing on the architecture exploitation side of the house for 10 years. I've worked in every domain of CISSP since at least 2005 or earlier. I completed a bachelors in 2005 (EE from Maryland). I hold about 12 current IT certifications and have let probably every bit of 20 expire since I don't need them (Security+, Net+, CCNA, CCNA Wireless, CCNA Security, JavaRE, GSEC, MSE, LPIC-1, LPIC-2, etc.) I enjoyed my time with WGU and I am happy I completed this program. This was the only masters program for me due to my very heavy work and travel schedule making a normal college impossible. I am on the road for over 200 days a year and many nights are in hotels with very poor wifi or no internet connectivity at all. I could not attend a college that required multiple nights of mandatory webinars or sessions. I also do not have the time to hang out on student forums, write X-number of posts on topics each week, respond to X-number of other students posts, and respond to the professors comments on your posts. I absolutely refuse to take part in a group project through an online based college where the entire group shares the final grade regardless of input or effort on the said project. UMUC, I'm looking at you!!! I worked on a project with 5 people and 4 of them stopped helping after week 1. The professor more or less forced me to do it by myself if I wanted a good grade. How much time did I spend? - Not once did I ever spend more than 10 hours a week on WGU homework. I finished my entire capstone, prospectus, written project, and presentation w/ video in two weeks start to finish. This is a slight smack in my own face because this means I could have finished sooner had I spent more time each week. As previously stated, I have 18 years experience in IT and have held CISSP for nearly 10 years. The vast majority of this was a review for me. Your time and effort will likely vary. Pros: - CEH and CHFI are worthwhile certifications. I hold higher, more difficult certifications, and my employer still wants me to maintain CEH because that's what his clients know. I hold GXPN, GLEG, and GSLC and I am taking GSE later this year in Vegas. GSE is considered by many to be the most difficult IT certification. I'm personally nervous as hell and think I'll fail the hands-on part of it on my first try or two. If I tell a client we are working on vulnerability assessments for that I hold GXPN most times they wonder what it is. I have even had a fellow IT person ask ""is that as good as CEH?"" even though CEH is leaps and bounds easier. That goes to show you how well CEH is known outside. - This program puts you well over halfway on the material covered under CISSP. I recommend you don't stop here but you keep going for CISSP, even if you must settle with the Associate level until you meet experience requirements. - My student mentors: I had 3 of them due to no fault of my own, that I know of! I was told one retired and one quit though neither of them said anything about it. My third SM did OK and he left me alone most weeks unless I asked for help. Cons: - Feedback on tasks, even passing items, was very poor. My student mentor could not understand the feedback sometimes because they would copy and paste ""does not meet requirements"" over and over. During one course, the course mentor reviewed my work, said it was great, and it still got returned. I set up a meeting with the course mentor, he talked things over with me and confirmed he could clearly see the rubric requirements they said did not meet requirements. He manually marked my task as completed within minutes of me resubmitting it. This has me wondering how many students this has impacted. How many students are spending hours, with no feedback, no help, but have actually passed the task? - Some of the course mentors in the Course Chatter are blatantly rude. If WGU is going to use this course chatter system, WGU staff should be responding in a helpful manner (and timely) not saying ""you didn't read your directions did you?"" as a response. - A few courses used very old material. I'm talking 20+ years old material. I recalled one of the task scenarios when I was in high school back in the late 90's. I pointed it out to the course mentor and she said she was unable to update the course materials due to internal issues. WGU should be updating their course materials periodically to ensure they are somewhat current (less than 10 years old would be a start). We should not ever have to explain why a bank running Windows 98 SP1 is a problem. - Some course tasks were unable to be completed if you used the most current references (NIST, ISO, etc.) I don't remember which exact course or reference as it has been a year or so. I think it might have been TFT2 or VLT2. The task required you to have a reference that was removed when the ISO or NIST reference was updated. The version of the task required you to use was over 10 years outdated (meaning it was updated over 10 years ago). I struggled on this task because we own the most up to date references through our license at work so I used them. It wasn't until I struggled with it for two weeks and got the task returned 3 times with a ""does not meet requirements"" canned response, that I reached out to the course mentor. She responded, ""go to this page, this reference number"" and when I told her it was not there that was when we figured out you had to use the ~2002 reference for an ISO/NIST. Recommendations for future or current students: - They aren't overly strict with APA or MLA styles. You can probably tell by my writing style here that I am far from perfect. Make it easy to understand with a clean layout. My references were not correct to APA standards most times but not once did they get returned. The only citations I used were (name, date) at the end of the line and made an input on the references page for it. Every reference all the way through the program was a web-based reference too. - Write your tasks to the rubric and only to the rubric. Do not include anything else or it might confuse the graders. Make clear and easy to see navigation tabs in MS Word which point to Rubric requirements. If it happens to be a heading, mark that heading as, for example: ""Justification (A2)"" where A2 was the rubric item number. I found if you don't leave the graders looking for your topic and you quite literally spell it out, you'll do well. In my normal college classes, this would have got my papers marked down because they did not transition well. - I highly recommend you use Grammarly and if you have the funds, pay for Grammarly Premium. All risk management tasks and both Capstone tasks made it through on the first try using Grammarly."
13,vulnerability,WGU,Did WGU get removed the IT: Security Emphasis bachelor's degree program?,2,83zp8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/83zp8e/did_wgu_get_removed_the_it_security_emphasis/,2018-03-13 10:39:41,"Edit: typo in title, sorry. URL I switched into this program a while ago after doing a contract in IT Security. This was the only thing available at that time which was closest to anything IT Security related, so I switched into it. After working in the field, however, I came to realize that the degree and the program classes didn't have many security related classes other than the certs which were Network+, Security+ , CCNA and CCNA Security. ALl good certs, but it would be stretch in my opinion to call your degree ""Security Emphasis"" with those two certs, and especially after working in the field. I gave WGU my feedback regarding this and also mentioned that having a specialized Cyber Security related degree program with more classes focused on Security such as Incidence Response, Vulnerability management and other areas of security would be a much stronger degree than the IT Security Emphasis degree. Today I was looking to see if WGU might release a CS degree and ended up on the IT degrees page (pictured above, imgur link) and saw that the IT Security Emphasis degree no longer exists. Funnily enough I decided to switch my major to general IT to graduate and be done with my undergrad knowing it would take me too long to do those 2 CCNA's while also paying the tuition at this rate. So does this mean the IT Security Degree is no longer offered at WGU and has been replaced with the Cyber Security degree? Honestly I am impressed with WGU's ability to adapt like this, but I also feel for the students who are currently in those programs and see their majors disappear off the site : ( I know they still get to graduate with the degree they started with so it's no big deal there.

I finished my other courses in 6 months but I definitely bit off more than I can chew with my Capstone. My final paper was 96 pages and after reading it, I realized I probably could have easily added about 20 more pages. I chose to write about creation and implementation of a vulnerability management program. The topic alone seemed pretty great, but the fictional company I wrote about never had one before, so I went into great detail of the technical path to perform a vulnerability assessment as a baseline.

I recommend doing the classes in this order, and I'll explain why later: 1. C727 - Cybersecurity Management I - Strategic 2. C701 - Ethical Hacking 3. C795 - Cybersecurity Management II - Tactical There's a lot of talk here about the PA, so I'll cover that a little bit too. Once again, it's another write to the Rubric and guess what they're looking for. It's really not hard, just another one that you have to do the labs and then figure out what details the evaluators are looking for. My first submission was kicked back. I didn't go too deeply into the Who, when, etc of Section C, but that was easily fixed. Section E was totally on me: I misread the roles from the Incident response Plan. In Section F, I had to add two sentences about my remediation and three sources, and then the paper passed. It was pretty easy to address the points and didn't take much; my corrected resubmission as only about 250 more words than the first submission. I won't go into this too much, because others have covered it in other posts - but I'll answer any questions. My paper ended up being 10 pages long; six of them were screenshots. There's not a lot of talk about the OA. It's similar to the PreA, but a little bit harder. Know your RAID levels and backups (the differences between full, incremental, and differential and when to use them). Know your DR plans and exercises. I recommend focusing on the CISSP chapters 15, 16, and 18 and do the question banks at the end (honestly, I only skimmed the book over the past few weeks). The reason why I recommended doing the classes I suggested in the order above is that there are some questions about which tools to use and when to use them; having the CEH fresh in your mind will help on this. This is another class that can be easily done in two to four weeks, once you get past the PA - that seems to be the stumbling block for a lot of people. Had it not been for Covid and my workload, I could have had this done by the end of June. In fact, I only took the exam last night because my term ends at the end of August; I came home from work and just scheduled the exam in an hour's time. One last thing to mention: I'm sure the Proctor was fine - I had no problems with him - but I could not understand him at all. Not because of an accent, but because his line was full of static and would keep cutting out. He could hear me fine. The beginning part of the exam was a nightmare (trying to do the whole showing the license, panning the room, etc) because I could not understand him. I kept telling him and he put me on a five minute hold and came back, but it wasn't much better. (Funny story, a bird started making noise on his end in the background - not only did that come through fine, but it ended up setting my bird off.) I kept suggesting to use the chat window, but I think he was against that (again, I couldn't really make out what he said). AT the end of the exam, I kept saying that I was done after I submitted the exam, took the survey, posted in the chat room, opened a new tab to load up WGU's page to check my grade before he got back to me. When he did, I only understood ONE word because of all the static, and that was ""survey."" Since I've done this a few times, I just took control and told him I'm done, here look at my whiteboard and how both sides are clean, I've already done the survey, and am ready to go. He said a few more unintelligible things and then disconnected. (Yes, I did bring up the communication issues on the survey.)"

Identify flaws is the network, propose new design. I feel like you can get away with many different approaches to this as long as your answers make sense. &amp;#x200B; **C701 - Ethical Hacking** Before entering the program, I found as much study material for CEH as I could (random places, book, quizlets) and drilled practice questions. This test sucks and is low quality and I don't care about it. &amp;#x200B; **C702 - Forensics and Network Intrusion** You can study for CHFI the same way as CEH. CHFI isn't a requirement anymore but the curriculum is the same. I had taken digital forensics in college years ago so I almost didn't have to study for this. &amp;#x200B; **C706 - Secure Software Design** Do the pre-assessment and understand all the questions, right answers, and wrong answers. Do ALL the practice questions in the course material (CISSP Secure Software Design questions). &amp;#x200B; **C725 - Information Security and Assurance** I took the pre-assessment and immediately took the OA and passed it. This is kind of in between Security+ and CISSP. You can prepare for this course prior to enrollment by doing Sec+ or CISSP or at least studying for those exams. &amp;#x200B; **C726 - Cybersecurity Architecture and Engineering** You have to come up with a new secure solution for a messed up network.

51,cybersecurity,WGU,Just completed C727 (Cybersecurity Management I - Strategic)! My lengthy write-up,7,gzupco,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/gzupco/just_completed_c727_cybersecurity_management_i/,2020-06-10 05:56:04,"I found C727 to be the breather class I needed after C701 (the CEH) and dealing with the extra workload due to Covid. Once CEH was out of the way, I wanted to try and catch up, due to all the aforementioned stuff eating up three months - half my term. I wanted to bust through this one quickly. Because I was on-call at work the week I started this class, that ruled out taking the OA that week, so instead I worked on the paper first. During lunch breaks over the week, I put together just a quick outline in Word of the rubric and did some googling of various links for regulations and such - pretty much just prep work for the writing of the paper itself. Then on Saturday, I spent about five or six hours writing it. Having gone through C726, I figured I was free to expand upon details since the info supplied did not state much; for example, I made up issues to resolve in the ""industry standards for securing assets"" part, such as password complexity and implementing forced password changes after 90 days. The Security Department and Risk Department was the easiest. I just came up with four roles each, stated I'd decide directors at a later date, and then made a graphic in MSPaint (only the finest of graphics programs for this paper!) with two boxes, one for each department, with the roles I mentioned in the text. Above the two, I had a box stating IT Director with lines showing that the two departments reported to the IT Director; I did not list any other roles or departments in IT. For PCI DSS compliance, I listed all twelve points and what they mitigate - each point was only a sentence or two. I honestly know very little about GDPR, so I had done the most research on that during my lunch breaks. I chose four points and wrote a couple sentence paragraph on each. Pretty much did the same with HIPAA. The Business Continuity part, I just focused on how to deal with tornadoes and flooding. My paper ended up being 8 pages long, including a full page for the cover letter and a page with eight sources. I did my best to be brief (difficult for me, as you can tell) and spoonfed each rubric section to them (I even labeled each section, like ""Section A: blah blah blah""). Submitted it around midnight. The next morning, it did get kicked back: I didn't go into the consequences of HIPAA violations enough. I did mention them, but didn't go into details, such as civil and criminal penalties. I spent no more than fifteen minutes adding a short paragraph, with one more source for it, and resubmitted. A few hours later, it passed. On to the OA... After I got my paper back on Sunday, I decided to try the PreAssessment. Never opened the book, just jumped in - only got one wrong. That felt pretty good. It pretty much felt like a Security+ and Project+ refresher. The next day, I decided to try the PreA again on my lunch break, while I was half-distracted. Pulled a perfect score, but I think there was some memorization, so I jotted down some notes on two Post-It notes, reminding myself to refresh my memory on Cobit, CMMI, all the SLA/ ALE/ etc. formulas, and various role based access. (Normally I have a spiral notebook for taking notes - writing things down and putting them in my own words helps me remember things - for each class. Those two Post-its were all I wrote down.) Monday night, I tried to take the exam, but as other posters on this subreddit can attest, they were having a lot of problems last night. I was able to get connected to the proctor, but were were never able to start the exam. Every time we started, we were getting SQL errors, such as Database is in Transition. The proctor kept trying to adjust my browser settings, but I kept telling her, that she should talk to someone because that error is on their end. Was eventually told to stay in camera view and not leave while she checked on her side. I was able to reach my phone and post here and saw others having issues while also checking out C727 quizlets. Hey, why not? The proctor told me several times to ""find some work to do."" After one hour forty minutes (and I was getting cranky and hungry, I didn't eat after work), she told me to reschedule. I called assessment services, but there was about 127 people in line ahead of me with a 500 to 600 minute wait (I misheard it at first and thought it said over 500,000 minutes by the way it stated the numbers so quickly. By now, it was 8:30pm, and I waited on hold for a bit, but decided to do the ""press 1 and get the call back"" option. I also emailed Assessment and my SM and explained what happened and I need to reschedule (the system wouldn't let me, since I was trying a reschedule an exam that was technically in the past). About 11:30pm, I did get a call back and they took care of it. Now, onto today for the REAL OA. I took the day off work (unrelated) and took the exam at 1:30pm. I spent about 45 minutes on the exam, including reviewing bookmarked questions. Saw more ALE type calculations than I was expecting, and a number of ones revolving roles and controls that I wasn't too sure about. Make sure you really read the questions; I'm glad I reviewed mine because there were a couple times where I saw word like ""preventive"" or ""label"" that I missed on my first read that completely gave away the answer. Walked away with a 79% - which I'm perfectly happy with for not cracking open the book and spending only about a week on the class. Hoping to start on C795 next."

I just got my AAS in Cybersec from a local Tech College and was interested in WGU for my bachelor's and master's because of the training for certifications it is supposed to provide. I just talked to an education counselor but wanted clarification from some students. Are the certs part of the course (i mean like taking the cert exam part of the course, not just earn it from taking the course) or are the certs separate from the courses, like if you pass this course and the final you should be able to pass this cert so here's your voucher."

My mentor had the nerve to say I was the only one who failed when I first failed in Feb....then I check course chatter....nope....not just me...Reddit....nope not just me. I pointed out their lies, their changing of the test (It was CHANGED....they finally admitted it.), their issues and all I got was headaches. BUT....in the end....I passed and I am done. BUT I am VERY grateful to WGU.....regardless of that last hideous class.....I really enjoyed working on my Master's degree. I worked hard on it, I never gave up. It is nice to know there is a support group out there and here on Reddit as well. The only things I would tell WGU, is to get rid of the CEH and CHFI classes.....put in place of them PenTest+ and CySa+. I already bought vouchers for them and will be taking those certs shortly. I love those to certs....and WGU would be wise to add them to the Master's program and get rid of the CEH and their awful CHFI. To anyone who is discouraged....do NOT give up. Keep pushing through.

I have tried searching through the sub, but would appreciate any advice. I know ultimately it comes down to ""do what interests you"". I'm hoping maybe you can give me insight into your experience with WGU and if your degree has led you to finding a fulfilling career? Thank you in advance! **Background:** B.S. Biotechnology (2011), almost a decade of experience in the field mainly in stem cell therapy. Originally planned to go into pharmacy, but due to financial constraints at the time, I did not and that's how I ended up in biotechnology. While my field is incredibly interesting and I did love my jobs, I don't have a passion for it. I went into it because (1) I am good at it, (2) it was easy to find a job, (3) and I was able to move up quickly. Even so, I always toyed with the idea of changing careers into computer science or a more health focused field. A series of events occured that finalized my decision to change careers. My husband's job moved us to an area where there were few job opportunities in my field and the opportunities that were available required a long commute and much lower pay. Eventually I lucked out and found a great position, which led to being recruited to a start-up. I was putting in 60+ hours/week, worked weekends, and was traveling across the country to oversee the start up of our second facility. Despite the stress of it all, I was very happy to be a part of something big. Unfortunately, things didn't work out. I ended up getting laid off the week my movers were supposed to come and move me to the second facility to oversee it full time. Boo hoo. After some soul searching and encouragement from my husband, I decided this was the perfect time for a career change. It is expected that my husband's job will move him at least two more times and likely in more remote areas. I decided I want to pursue a career that will allow me to telework or at the very least provide me with skills and more job opportunities. Since my lay off, I took up a government position doing administrative work. Part of my duties involved some very light IT and cybersecurity work. I have always been interested in computer science so I was eager to take up some of these duties just to get an idea of what it involved. Since then I enrolled in an online MS IS program and am taking two summer courses (Intro to IS and IS Business Management). The courses are pretty interesting, but I feel that it is very slow paced. Since I am used to self-teaching myself, I get through each chapter very quickly but am not allowed to move on until the following week."

Here is what I wish I would have known before starting task 1 and how vague it is. 1. Do not read any of the chapters. They are vaguely helpful in generic risk and architecture from an overview perspective. I got all the way to the second chapter and nothing in the first two chapters were even covered the performance assessment. 2. Remember, it is really hard to flunk a performance assessment on the first try. Dont be a perfectionist!!!! Try using a minimally viable product concept and see how many of the sections are competent before spending 4 weeks writing a 30 page paper. If it does not pass the first grading then perform an agile sprint and get the section or sections that are not up to competency completed. Rinse and repeat this process up to 4 times. 3. Read the task 1 case study. 4. Choose 2 mimi projects you would like to fix for the company 4.A. Identify the software issues. Find the lifecycle of each product. 5. Read the risk assessment, focus on table 3.2 6. After reading the risk assessment answer the question Is the IT department competent at their job? 6.A. No, they are not --&gt; then consider a solution that tries to eliminate the usage of the internal IT department. Think of buying a commercial system, cloud, SAAS, etc. Do you really want the IT department to implement or maintain this new system? 6.B. Yes, they are competent --&gt; think about a solution by hiring software development company, hiring project team and building tools internally, buying corporate software and host internally, PAAS, or SAAS type solutions. 7. Identify the data types and any regulations on them. How will your solution handle these? 8. Try to verbalize 1 mini project to a significant other and how you would implement it. Then try the second mini project. 9. I really wish I had read task 2 question before starting two write on task 1. They help you to focus in on a game plan from a high level of exactly what to do. 10. Start writing on task 1 11. Section 5.1 of the paper, dont use the built in table. Delete them. You will be unable to copy and paste anything into efficiently. You will basically have to copy each cell one at a time. Solution, create your table in excel, dont forget to use headers, create borders, then copy and paste it into the word document. 12. For the process diagrams use a swim lane diagram. My mentor said this was the number one section he saw that would cause a paper to not be proficient. Basically, do something slightly more in-depth of this example on YouTube. [URL . Dont do any of the decision points (triangles). Just focus on the major task that a position must do for your solution. 12.A. If you have access to Microsoft Visio, use a swim lane template that is built in. 12.B. There is a swim lane template on the internet for Google Drawings. [URL You can use this for free. Open it up, then make a copy of it to your own google drive. Now you can use it. Then download your creation as a .jpg file and then insert the jpg into your word document. 13. Before turning the paper in, refresh the table of contents (in case you made any changes) 14. Dont forget to create your bibliography/works cited section at the bottom of the paper. &amp;#x200B; I really hope this is helpful! If not, I can't stop you from commenting below!"

To be honest, I did not read the whole course content, but I did review the labs (1,2,3,5,9) to prepare myself for the Nmap and Wireshark portions. My only struggles with this course, was using the virtual labs on my MacBook. Regardless if I tried FireFox, Brave, Chrome, or Safari --- none of them worked. It would be a hit or miss when I initially started this course in the beginning of May. The labs were down for the first portion of this month. What prepared me the most was the fact I already had my Security+ &amp; SSCP (Kudos to WGU!) -- If you have those two certifications or if you already took these two courses at WGU, then this course should be a breeze since Security+/SSCP covers most of these domains already. This course was more of a refresher. Good material for researching and referencing. Here are a quick pro-tips for my course: Lab 1: Nmap: Make sure all the virtual labs are turned on. Then, follow the scan instructions. *(It takes several mins to load fully).* From there, you need to look at the network topology. This will be a good starting point to see which hosts have the most active ports and from there you should be able to detect vulnerable ports. Great website to reference ports: [URL Common Vulnerability and Exposures -- great resource for port vulnerability. It has a massive knowledge database. Wireshark: Simply run the pre-loaded scan and filter through anamolies and ports. There are a ton of resources/vulnearbilites here that you can use. For my demonstration, I only used 4. Another good resource is to use the labs that are provided. This will give you enough demonstrations on how to use Wireshark and what to look out for. Hint: You can also use the search bar to filter out information. Keywords help as well (Ex: NTP,POP3,HTTP, etc...) Final report pages (including references and cover): 15 pages -- (I go into details a lot in my research papers). Lab 2: Read the entire case study at least two times. Highlight or Comment (Word) each paragraph and point out any feedback, vulnerabilities that you detect. This will help you write out your report. The report was fairly easy. Since I've been working in IT for several years now, I have experience creating MDM policies and working with wireless networks. Simply, research good policies, and companies that coincide with the report. You need to know at least one legality concern with the company. I can't give you the answer, but think which law can be used in this scenario and how it relates to it. Final report pages (including references and cover): 8 pages. Hope this info helps! It took me about 3 weeks to complete this course. I did not read any material or took any pretests. I only went over the labs mentioned above and used my expertise experience. Note that you do not have the same amount of pages that I did. Some people only wrote about 5-6 pages and still passed. I like to give as much detail as possible. It's always better to have too much than too little. Good luck Night Owls!"

Over all the program is good. I really like that I come out with a bunch of certs as well as the degree. There are several things that are annoying to the point of making me wish I had chosen a different school. First, Ucertify's software sucks. They make regular updates that help, but it is not up to par and feels like it hasnt been updated in adecade. I would rather have an actual ebook that I can read on a device of my choice and just use Ucertify for the labs and practice tests. Speaking of labs and practice tests, the software is unreliable and the practice tests are riddles with typos and bad questions. The labs are really slow and crash, no matter what web browser I use. My son goes to a different school and has the same problems with Ucertify. Second, some classes are not well written. From what I have read they havent changed in a couple years and there are no plans to change them. Emerging Technologies in Cybersecurity, c844, for example. For starters, it doesnt cover emerging technology. It covers decade old technology. The other big issue is that the provided materials do not cover the assessments. Do a quick google search and you will find dissatisfied students going back 3 years for this class. From what I am reading about the legal class it is much the same. The main issue with most assessments is the rubrics are hard to understand and follow. There are other resources, like Hack The Box, Try Hack Me and others provide a reliable environment for virtual labs. Please review the courses and make sure the assessments are supported by the course material or at least provide links to external resources. Pass the rubrics through your kids and see if they can understand them. If not they are too complex and need to be redone. I do this regularly for technical documentation I write at work. /rant"

Can anyone provide some insight on this program and if you feel it was worth it? It seems WGU does things a little differently than my previous school regarding scheduling and such. I'm currently awaiting a call back from my assigned enrollment specialist, but figured I'd get feedback from students as well since you're apt to being more transparent than someone working for the school.

The labs are a mess and I can no longer see the instructions of which machine I need to use to scan using wireshark. I loaded the lab once and did the Nmap portion but when I loaded the lab a second time the instructions were gone. CI and WGU apparently are aware but they didnt provide any info for the instructions. Im trying to find out what machine I need to use and what subnet I need to scan. I tried the Kali Linux VM but that only has one network card and is scanning the 192.168.0.0/24. I believe the subnet I need to scan is 192.168.27.0/24 like the Nmap portion. Any info is appreciated

WGU's Cybersecurity Program is rigorous. Started last April with only my experience as a Wordpress Web Developer. I've come a long way and learnt a lot so far. **My Strategy** I start each term with a plan to finish a course within a week if possible. My schedule with a full time job is demanding so I have to wake up at night to study. 12 am to 6am. Except on weekends. I need my sanity. Before I begin each course, I draw a timeline. My timeline covers the learning resources and how much time I have to study them. I like to aim for a week because it gives me a realistic goal to work towards depending on how voluminous the material is. At the end of the week, I take stock of what I have learnt and how much of the material I was able to cover and retain mentally. I have to be realistic and give myself hard answers to any questions I have about my readiness. If I don't feel confident enough to take the exam, I give myself an additional week until I attain that state of readiness. In that same week, Next, I look at the Course tips and read the Student Chatter. I've always found the chatter very helpful in terms of gauging the experience of other students who have attempted the same course. I learn from their failures and successes. In the Chatter, I also discover some other learning materials and resources utilized by students for the course that might not be included in the Course tips. Every additional resource gives an edge. Pre-assessments and Practice tests. These are super helpful. I am glad WGU's model incorporates pre-assessments for most courses. I even see practice tests on Linkedin Learning , Skillsoft and Pluralsight which my WGU account gives me access to. It gives you a great way to gauge your readiness and knowledge level several times before an exam. I also make use of practice tests for every course. I search for them online via several avenues like Reddit,Discord, etc. There's always a practice test out there you can use to stay sharp all the way up until exam day. Lastly, for me it's all about eating the Elephant. One bite at a time. Every course is just another milestone to pass on the way to my final goal. My Program Mentor helps me stick to my academic milestones and provides encouragement and advice every step of the way. His help is invaluable. The best way to describe it is like having a fitness coach. I'm not the kind of Guy who needs a lot of Self Motivation so I only reached out to him when I needed new course unlocked and he was always on standby to get it done. I hope this helps someone out there! Onto the Masters!"

Pretty stoked since I got held behind on my CompTIA Project+ Cert (everyone was stuck in limbo during the Covid-19 Pandemic). The assessments were pretty straight forward. The questions were simple and the case study they have provided, pretty much has all the answers embedded within the investigators work. Just simply read, and highlight the important information from the case study. From there, work around your notes and the knowledge you have obtained while studying at WGU will easily be applied. Since I am 80% done with my Cybersecurity Information Assurance (IA) Degree, this course was a breeze to pass. Having my Security+ and SSCP certificate, all the knowledge I have gained from both certs were easily implemented into my course work. Basically if you know the Chinese Wall Method and other Access Control Mitigation Methods, then this course will be a breeze. I could have passed it in a week, but I am a full time employee as well. I am now considered a Sr. Tech Support, however I work in all domains that I have studied for. Each course WGU has provided me has 110% aligned me with my current work field.

That way, they will show up in the Table of Contents. Then go through and answer each one of them. Google the term if you don't know it.

After a brief meeting with my Course Instructor, he set some goals for me to achieve before opening the O.A. up for me to take a second attempt. Basically, he wanted me to read more of the material on InfoSec policy, which he could clearly tell that I had not done. After hitting that material and requesting that he approve a second attempt, I scheduled the test and took it, at the end of my second week of the term. I will do my best to relate my observations without giving away detailed information regarding the Objective Assessment. First of all, I found that the pre-assessment does NOT mirror the Objective Assessment much at all. As I have found out quickly, you are not guaranteed to pass the O.A. just because you passed the pre-Assessments and the practice tests. Know the CIA Triad. Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. Know it, breath it, live it. This is not the only other course that you will see it in. And, you will probably see multiple questions about it on the O.A. (most of the undergrad Cybersecurity guys probably already know this material, but I came straight from a CompSci undergrad at a State University, and had minimal exposure to the CIA). Don't just memorize the basic definition of each leg of the Triad, but understand their application. Research other examples than the course material provides. You cannot study the CIA too much, in my opinion, seeing as you will get hit with it again and again, as I just found in C706. I obsessed over rote memorization of the TCSEC and Orange Book ratings. Probably a bit of overkill on my part. My best personal method for passing the test was taking a week and going through the material page by page, I write handwritten notes on a note pad of the key material. You can usually tell what they are expecting you to prioritize based on the Knowledge Check questions at the bottom of the page. Handwriting the core material and terms has always helped me commit to memory. My years of Sys Admin experience and undergrad studies helped me breeze through the Operational, Physical Security and Encryption portions of the exam. Good luck to everyone in the endeavor."

I'll add my own little personal notes as well as I'm listing them in the order that I have them scheduled to take. * Data Management - Foundations  C175 - Basically just learning SQL, right? If so, I've got a decent familiarity with it. * Data Management - Applications  C170 - Same basic thing as C175? * Network and Security - Applications  C178 - OA is just Security+, not super worried and have already started using outside materials to study for it. * Managing Web Security  C837- Summary sounds like it would be a combo of Network+ and Security+. That about right? Yay worthless CIW cert. * Digital Forensics in Cybersecurity  C840 - This class actually sounds interesting and potentially challenging. * Information Systems Security  C845 - Have heard the test for this one is challenging. * Business of IT - Project Management  C176 - Is it as bad as the ITIL test? Heavens help me if so. * Legal Issues in Information Security  C841 - Seems like a common sense/straight forward class. Memorize laws/numbers and know about good and bad behaviors? * Managing Cloud Security  C838 - Have heard also difficult, due to OA * Emerging Technologies in Cybersecurity  C844 - Sounds neat. Is it? * Managing Information Security  C843 - Six CUs, which makes me nervous. * Cyber Defense and Countermeasures  C842 - Seems like it's basically what to do when the fecal matter hits the rotary impeller. Definitely see this one being useful. * IT Capstone Written Project  C769 - Would be nice to actually *find* a sample capstone project so I know what to expect.

Read the case study and literally highlight the issues that stand out to you. Then go through the rubric and figure out where you going to discuss those issues, how you can expand on them, what laws apply to those problems, etc. Kind of make a game plan/brainstorming sheet on what youre going to write before you begin.  Like other WGU papers, literally put A. then write 2-3 paragraphs about that bullet point in the rubric and move on to B.. That way the evaluator doesnt have to go digging through your paper to see if you understand and addressed the required topics  because youre dictating each specific bullet point. Sometimes people get the misconception that the paper must flow eloquently, but they want to see what you know, not how pretty you can compose a paper. Another thread mentioned this, and it saved me a lot of time! Go back to C841 and reference Appendix B to find laws that relate to cybersecurity it will save you time combing through google. Overall, my paper ended up being 10-11 pages with the title page, table of contents and citations and probably took about 8-10 hours to write. "

I am currently in my third term of BSCSIA and I am 62% (46 CUs left) of the way complete with my degree. This term I have really fallen behind and I only managed to complete 1 class of 4 CUs so far and my term ends at the end of this month. I don't want to seem like I am making excuses but I have been (and still are) going through a major financial crisis this term and unfortunately WGU has been pushed aside because of this. My goal was to have enough CUs completed this term to be able to transfer over to the Computer Science degree program as I have realized that Cybersecurity is not where I want to be anymore. I have spoken to my program mentor about transferring and she explained to me that I have to be in good standing with the current degree I am working in order to be able to transfer degree programs. With only 4 CUs completed this term and my term being over this month I'm not sure if I will be in good standing to be able to transfer. At the moment I have two classes left that I have registered for and I have yet to complete this term (C170 and C839). I was wondering if any of you all have any advice you can give on what my next steps should be. I have attempted to call student services with them only instructing me to call my program mentor (who is currently unavailable). I have also attempted to call my current course instructor for C170 and also was directed to voicemail. I know it's most likely after hours for them both so I don't blame them for not responding but this issue needs immediate attention. I can't help but feeling overwhelmed with everything going on at the moment so any feedback and advice would greatly be appreciated :)

Working on a security+ and really love it actually, finding a passion from this in cybersecurity and feeling genuinely needed in the world of infosec to meet the ever growing demands of protecting versus the threats out there. I'm someone who's got kids and really wants to make a career switch, and finding that cyber security seems to be what interests me the most (although I also feel flexible on this as I think software development might be interesting too, but I don't find the same ""feeling needed"" there). Anyway, I have gone to college before and tbh, would consider it a complete fail at this point. I studied liberal arts, have struggled to make use of the degree, and have never really made payments on my student loans or anything like that and have never found a job that used my degree. At this point, 13 years later, I've long given up on the idea. The point of this is that I am gonna preface my questions with some background and how this basically has led to what I call ""Economic PTSD"" because when I originally did this degree, it was basically supposed to be the best way for me to establish a career for myself, then when I graduated (2008) it basically seemed to become a scam. Hence, I am informing you, the kind readers, of my intense fears that whatever I do will not work out in the end and my investment will be for naught. Again, I have Economic PTSD. I hear that cybersecurity is one very extremely rapidly growing field, and I draw a lot of confidence from this and in a way, feel kinda blessed that I'm finding passion in it. But I also hear that they don't just willy nilly hire someone in such a field because they have a degree related to it; they generally want experience before they hand the keys to security over (understandably). So my actual questions. Am I off in thinking that perhaps exceptions could be made if the need grows that they have to take chances on someone with just a degree and no experience eventually? Because how does one get experience? I hear that a common roadmap is helpdesk/NOC/etc. then working up to it but then I also hear that NOC and the CCNA type routes are potentially getting outdated because of cloud computing. So how are we going to fill this need for infosec? And how well does WGU prepare you for such a career? What sort of steps after graduating should I expect to realistically take in order to get there? At least, I'm CURRENTLY pretty sure this is what I want to do. And I'm making decisions now under the view that it is. I'm not experienced enough to say for sure that it really is what I want to do, but I've spent a lot of my life ruminating upon the introspective aspects of my career, wondering what I want to do, and ultimately have been so indecisive to the point that I end up doing...manual labor, which I've seriously never even liked, while I search for other jobs and largely struggle to get out of the field. Luckily I am gonna start a job far more fulfilling next month. But regardless, decisions are gonna have to be made, and while my passion is there, it was there before when I studied liberal arts, or at least I thought it was. But passion alone, sadly, is not the only factor; as stated before I have kids, and a wife. There are mouths to feed. I don't want to do this if it isn't gonna lead to a fulfilling career. Thanks so much for reading and any responses that come along. Really appreciate it. I hope someone who's graduated from this program can provide insight in particular on how it prepared them and maybe their background story, but I appreciate anything."

However I find out of all topics, so far, Cybersecurity interests me the most. This would seem that CSIA is the way to go for me, but what if I find out that I somehow dislike it when I get into it? But then it kinda looks like CSIA wins on certifications that can get you an entry level role in many respects. Although the material for Computer Science seems to be far more foundational and fundamental, which is a big plus IMO. I do believe I'm good at math by nature, although that would be an issue for me potentially regardless. A little backstory, I was a kid who struggled in school with a rough upbringing; I let this get to me and had a rebellious emo phase, and as a result I was held back in math multiple times (I failed every class actually). The last time I took a math class was high school geometry. =/ I actually do have a Bachelor's of Arts from a somewhat alternative school that wasn't so big on math requirements, and mostly I didn't really seem to learn anything particularly relevant to the real world. My regret there is that I did not study Computer Science, actually. Since that was available to me in that realm and I somehow didn't do it. Nobody knows how I didn't given my history with computers always being a big part of my life, and I'm no exception. Looks like I'm aiming for a January 1 enrollment. While I remember it, here's a random question. I do have two kids and a wife, and I was wondering; if life happens and gets intense, can I take a month off and get back in no problem?

I took my sweet time reviewing the materials, but I didn't go too in depth because I found them frustrating. I made it through most of BSIT relying solely on uCertify despite it's flaws so I get quiet annoyed when they fail me. This course links to the CISSP material so often it would have been easier to study that only except it didn't seem to relate well to the PA and OA questions. &amp;#x200B; This one is all about the theory, policies, and procedures which might be dry/annoying, but aren't hard. **Exam** I think this exam fits closely enough with the PA, but I think the questions are in general poorly written. In the PA it will direct you to the related chapter. That chapter is likely made up of links from the CISSP material which may or may not be related to the question at all. I think this course in general could use work on linking the actual material to the course and providing better information summaries in uCertify versus paragraph after paragraph of theories. Take the PA, read up on roles (OMG!! Where did their role definitions come from?! I'm still wondering) use the hell out of the practice tests to study and just get it over with. &amp;#x200B; **TASK 1** Not terrible. It was one of the more straight forward tasks except that the task requirement paragraphs skip around a bit so watch out or you'll need to revise for a minor detail. **Advice** I again talked with Wendy who likes to help you talk through your paper organization to make sure you'll cover everything well but without being overkill. Organize the paper to the paragraphs and you'll be fine. I used a few sites like Guru99 suggestions on physical and logical threats/vulnerabilities because I kept mixing them up while providing my examples of how they're weakening the Psinuvia security posture. For acceptable use, mobile, and password policies do a brief overview then do bullet points for specific actions to add to the 'policies'. Add which standard you referred to at the end. Short, sweet, simple. For HIPAA, GDPR, PII don't make the mistake I did and try to include them together. Break them up. It makes it easier for the reviewer to see you're checking off the rubric. For PCI use the [document](URL previously linked by [ChernobylChild](URL . It's a fabulous summary. There are summaries for all the policies if you look. I made a needlessly large table of the 12 requirements and how I planned on addressing them. I made the business continuity planning out to be waaaay more difficult than it needs to be. I revised it probably 10 times before doing the same as the other policies with a short summary directly dealing with the floods and tornadoes problem. IT Department Duties was the easiest part! Make up two departments, make a table with roles and responsibilities, don't forget to include specifics about each role. &amp;#x200B; I ended up wasting a lot of time by fretting far too much about the risk and vulnerability parts. If you're stuck jump in on an easier part because this paper doesn't need to be crazy cohesive."

A quick background of myself: \- Received a BS from a brick and mortar university in 2014 in Business Administration. Solid GPA with minimal effort (3.45) because I found I was much more interested in the overall ""college experience"". It was a great four years, don't get more wrong, but I need to get a degree relevant to my current (and only) industry. \- I've been employed in various roles in IT since graduation such as software developer, business analyst, project manager, and information supervisor. I'm 100% self-taught and have always had an aptitude with computers. To be honest, I should have majored in computer science during my time at the brick and mortar university but my younger self was, again, interested more in the ""college experience"". My current role involves me supervising the cybersecurity and identity management team. \- I transferred in 33 credits that cover all of my general education requirements. Nothing transferred is related to IT but I am confident that I can test out of many of the required courses in a day or so each (ex: Intro to IT, IT Foundations, IT Applications, Data Management, etc.) With all that being said, any tips to get as deep into the weeds as possible before my official 11/1 start date? As it stands, I need 23 courses which include the capstone or 89 credits to complete this degree. Ideally, I'd like to get this done in one term but am willing to stretch it out to two. My employer is bankrolling the cost but my motivation comes from the fact that I should have done this in the past and am now looking to redeem myself. I'm confident I can fast track/accelerate a good amount of these courses due to my experience. Question: are PAs proctored or only OAs? My initial strategy is to go in and take the PA for some of these easier classes immediately to see where I stand. My understanding is that OAs, since they are proctored, require advanced scheduling. I definitely could be wrong and please correct me if so. Thanks in advance for any tips!"

The studying and practice tests definitely paid off. Since WGU has revamped its curriculum for MSCSIA early in the year. It seems that the degree is leaning towards the CISSP certification standards of knowing the Common Body of Knowledge (CBK). With that said, you need to also put effort into reading the ISC\^2 CISSP Study Guide 8th, Ed. which is also included in the course material. There are links to the book within the Information Security &amp; Assurance eBook. I would highly recommend doing lots of practice quizzes per chapter and the practice tests to better familiarize you with the way questions that will be asked on your Objective Assessment. If you have studied/taken your Security+ certification you will have a base knowledge and honestly, this class is pretty much a Security+ on steroids. The pre-assessment didn't really help me much since they were exactly the same questions asked just in a different order. Therefore, I recommend doing the practice tests in both ebooks. I also recommend Quizlet there are good flashcards pertaining to the C725 class as well which you can find on the r/WGU pages just search for C725 and you should be able to find couple threads that link to those Quizlet study material.

Since then, I've decided to start by BS in either Cybersecurity (most likely) or data science at WGU. It seems like a perfect fit for me now. However, I do wonder, if my treatment/health improve, is a more traditional and more GPA restrictive school still an option. I know it's not necessary to IT, but I'd still love to get my Master's or PhD at one of my dream schools. With the pass/fail grading system WGU has, however, I worry that my transcript/GPA won't stand out, even though my GPA is very competitive right now. Has anybody here used their WGU BS in IT to pursue higher eduction at a more competitive school? Can you tell me your experience?"

Task 2 lists sections a, b and c which appears not to be directly corresponding to the Rubric. The entire structure is so confusing it makes it difficult to even start writing it. Also, the number of required schematics, rubrics, charts etc would need 30 pages on its own LOL. Maybe I'm not reading the requirements correctly, so I thought by checking archived Capstone works that other students did (available on WGU website) would help, but the format now is completely different so not much of a help there. Once again, writing it is not that complicated, the biggest thing is to decipher all the requirements that are given and coming up with the format. Any of you are struggling with a Capstone, any suggestions by our follow graduates regarding format or understanding of the requirements? I would appreciate any feedback."

My advice.",9,d4bvpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/d4bvpk/passed_2nd_attempt_bscia_c838_managing_cloud/,2019-09-15 08:14:07,"First of all, let me start of by mentioning that I have only failed 1 objective assessment since attending WGU, and that was for a Microsoft cert when I was in the IT - Security curriculum. That was, until about 2 weeks ago. The Objective Assessment for C838 - Managing Cloud Security is a beast. It is a 125 question test. 2 weeks ago, I failed on my first attempt by about 5 question, and after taking it, I would not have been surprised if I had failed by more than that. After the failure, I talked to the course mentor and he did a great job pointing me to where I needed to study. The first things that helped me pass this test was having had completed C837 - Managing Web Security, C841 - Legal Issues in Information Security, C840 - Digital Forensics in Cybersecurity, and C845 - Information Systems Security. These 4 coursed probably helped me answer about 50-70 questions alone. Having completed the two database classes (C175 and C170) also helped with about 5 questions on the test. I usually like the uCertify material. Heck, C845 requires the ISC2 SSCP cert in order to pass, and that was a beast of a test. But, the uCertify material helped tremendously. In fact, all you need is the practice tests, and I would say that you have enough knowledge to pass the SSCP cert. I approached this course the same way, as this class is all ISC2 CCSP material. However, the uCertify practice tests will NOT be enough to pass the Objective Assessment. You will need to read the Security Guidance PDF found in Chapter 12. This is an external link. Specifically, memorize the Cloud Data Lifecycle found on page 63, and the functions and phases table found on page 65. Come up with at least 10 flash cards for those 2 pages. For the rest of the PDF, I did read most of it. You should be able to come up with another 10-30 flash cards from other areas on the PDF. If you want to know what subjects, I would recommend that you take the Pre-Assessment (PGZO), then map what your weaknesses to the subjects found in the chapter 12 PDF. Another great source were the end of chapter quiz's and flashcards. You also have access to the Skillsoft material. I was not a big fan of that. There is also the Sybex ISC2 CCSP Official Study Guide and Practice tests eBooks. You can also create a Sybex account and gain access to the online version of the tests. I didn't use these much, but I will when I go for my CCSP exam after term. Further, the best resource to determine if you are prepared for the Objective Assessment (GZO1) is by taking the pre-assessment (PGZO). It is NOT a word for word duplicate, in fact, I don't think the two tests have any questions in common. But I would be willing to say that the Pre-Assessment follows the same subjects, definitions and sources as the OA. If you continue to fail the pre-assessment, or if you can't find the source material, then follow the next source: Your course mentor. I cannot overstate this. Use the course mentor. Had I called them after my first pre-assessment failure, then I would not have failed my OA. So those are the things I did. 1) Used uCertify practice tests. 2) Used end of chapter flash cards and quiz's. 3) Fail the Pre-Assessment to gauge your knowledge. 4) Study the Chapter 12 PDF. 5) Use the course mentor to point you towards the source material in the areas you are failing. That's it. Follow that advice, and you will pass the OA first try. Good luck!"

I checked a transfer credit rubric from WGU and I expect almost 65% of courses will be transferred if I send UC Davis transcript to WGU. I am pretty sure I can finish in one term. Do you think is it worth that I give up BS Biological science degree from UC Davis and declare a BS NOS from WGU online program? I am not trying to say WGU degree is worthless. The thing is that not completing the degree where I spent 4 years and finish from an online college.

""I was very satisfied in the beginning, but I feel the university has been losing its appeal over time. I started on February 2018 and was able to complete 13 classes in my first 6-month term, which was amazing. However, you are making it more difficult for me and other students with these new restrictions and guidelines. Previously, If I finished my 12 units before my term was completed, I was able to start studying for my next class, without adding it to my degree plan. Now I have to add those extra classes to my degree plan to even begin studying which is more strenuous. It was nice before because if I didn't know if I can complete it on time I would study for it the best I can and if time was available within my current term I would then add it to my degree plan and pass the class within the next few days. Now if I have a month and a half left I'm nervous about adding a class to my degree plan which leads to me to not risk the pressure and stress and just completely stop studying. This has made me less efficient in school and I hope you realize that is what made WGU great thus far."""

Currently, my major is Information Management w/ a Network Assurance &amp; Forensic IT concentration. I got suckered into my local CC to take this major because it sounded interesting and I kept hearing about the need for Cybersecurity professionals and felt it could be a lucrative opportunity. My experience, however; hasn't been great. Being a new program, the curriculum feels thrown together and whats worse is they don't have people with industry knowledge teaching the classes and its showing. Any questions any of us students have go unanswered or shrugged off. All the coursework seems more like busy work than exercised with practical applications. Idk, it's been a hugely demoralizing experience and I all but resigned myself as someone who spent thousands of dollars over more years than I'm comfortable admitting all to get close but ultimately fail. I wanted to take responsibility for my part in it and start again elsewhere. This is where I found WGU. So my dilemma is in which major to apply for admission to. I could continue with the BS in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance but idk if I have or ever really had a passion for IT security given my current situation. Another option that does interest me is the data analytics track. I like the idea of being able to interpret data and extrapolating usable information from it. Another possibility which is equally attractive is to go for the IT management BS. I'm already studying for the Certified Associate of Project Management (CAPM) exam and figure maybe a more general management focused degree would be more practical. I already have a lot of course work completed so the data analytics track might take the most time as I've only taken 2 courses in DB management, I guess I just wanted to test the waters and ask current WGU students and alumni what they think is best for my current situation.

204,cybersecurity,WGU,MSCIA C726 - Cybersecurity Architecture &amp; Engineering,6,cvpsvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/cvpsvv/mscia_c726_cybersecurity_architecture_engineering/,2019-08-27 01:46:26," As noted [previously](URL I have experience with WGU in the BSIT program and I'd like to help increase the information about the MSCIA program as I go along. See my [C725](URL and [C700](URL posts for more information C726 was a beast of a course. Not that the work is difficult, but that the concepts behind the papers are so broad and the scenarios provide a million ways to approach a solution. In addition, the multiple references in the course materials to other sections of textbooks meant that I was never quite clear on what I really had read or if somehow, I just mixed up my information. I wish for courses like these the textbook would use giant block quotes rather than adding links into the chapters because its incredibly disorienting. Im not going to go into too many details since this one has been reviewed a few times and Id rather help answer specific questions for this one. **TASK 1** This is just compiling requirements for a project. Read the SA, and the Case Study and write down what you see as the largest problems. I think theres room for going with a hardware and/or software approach. I did a software development approach because making a requirements document is literally my job, so it was a piece of cake. I was pretty worn out from the C700 course so I wanted to avoid going too deep into a hardware solution. **Advice** 1. Summarize each system as you read through the SA and Case Study. They overlap a lot, but the SA includes more info for the system logic/machines/etc. than the case study. Roughly sketch out the process flow as you go so you dont end up with too much info about each and floundering for a while trying to simplify things. 2. Dont forget before and after flowcharts for **EACH** system. It sounds like this is where a lot of people get tripped up. 3. Read the example for Task 1 I think its an attachment in Chapter 2 of the course materials. 4. Dont get too hung up on trying to answer every security vulnerability. Just focus on the ones that touch your solution(s). (Like dont worry so much about the leaky basement if youre not re-doing the building security) 5. Focus on the whys. What standards is this company responsible for following and how are they failing to do that? Talk about the data and how youre making it more secure via a software/hardware/both solution My submission ended up being about 15 pages. 6 were just the flowcharts and 3 were the requirements. Requirements dont need to be perfect just document what youre planning on making sure the system does. *Just a sidebar that requirements can be stupid easy like: A) (Functional  what it does) The* *system allows users to log on and access data according to their role-based account* *privileges. B) (Nonfunctional  outside the basic functions can be focused on security, traffic,* *hosting location) The system allows multiple concurrent users.* **TASK 2** I found this part to be much more difficult. Its beyond the scope of how I normally work and included that unique blend of hardware/software (at least my approach did) that drives me batty. As a reminder, WGU evaluators dont care if every single detail of a new network or system is made up or painted in broad strokes as long as the rubric is met they dont freak out too much. **Advice** 1. Use the DREAD video (link in the course tips) to understand the spreadsheet portion. However, youre only asked to rank 10 vulnerabilities and address 5. I believe the advice I heard was to make sure the top 5 addressed in the task match the top 5, by rank, evaluated in the spreadsheet. So, if you ambitiously do the entire workbook, youll find yourself mourning the wasted time later. 2. Follow the template, but dont forget to refresh what the rubric asks for. I had to re-submit based on a failure to explain my choices in a few sections including the standards, assumptions, and dependencies. 3. Flowcharts are cool. I re-used mine with a few additions from Task 1. 4. Modes of operation are the devil. I emailed Wendy (Hi Wendy! I guess Im kind of outing my Reddit profile) for specifics and where to find them. She was super helpful, but the course resources werent. She explained evaluators are looking for modes like: production, cloud, testing, parallel, pilot testing, etc types of environments. I think I ended up calling mine like user mode and explained that meant they were outside an administrative environment, so escalations of privilege are harder. 5. You dont need multiple paragraphs for each section. I had a few where I just made a statement and moved on. That didnt seem to be a problem. My submission was like 18 pages for this, but after I had to re-submit I wanted to make sure I covered my explanations of the standards, assumptions, and dependencies were thorough enough. I think I would have benefited by sending in a portion of my paper to Wendy sooner even if it was just the sections I was more frustrated by. This is essentially everything my mentor has ever told me, but I struggle wanting to have a good product before having someone review. Best of luck! I'll respond to questions to the best of my ability"

I have Autism along with a Specific Learning Disability, but through hard work I always managed to obtain As in most subjects except Math (which I am horrible at). I received a academic award in my senior year for a 3.5 GPA, besides the Pros there is a Con, my IQ is only average maybe two of points below 100. From what I read on the internet the mean IQ of college students range from 105-115, and Ive known quite a few people of average intelligence who graduated with a degree. I graduated from high school in 2013 and became a slacker. It wasnt until mid 2014 that I changed my ways and enrolled into a private college to study IT where I attained mostly As and a B in computer hardware, the school filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy (you might remember the 2014 Obama Administration crack down on for-profit schools). Since then I have worked a few call center jobs, I never got into technical support because of the way I learn, process, and retain information but through repetition Im able to retain information and get better at whatever task Im assigned to. Im very studious and Im always checking out books from the library on my favorite subject, history. I always thrive to learn and my performance in the past can prove that. I know I wont do very well in Cybersecurity or Network Administration because of all the protocols you have to memorize, but I am thinking about working as a Computer Support Technician that works with hardware. Im enrolled at my local community college and Im working on a A.S. in IT. Would I be the ideal candidate for WGU or should I stop dreaming?

Sorry for the long post. &amp;#x200B; Preface: I'm currently about halfway through the IT Business Management degree. I had wanted to take a more technical course such as cybersecurity or software development, but couldn't due to not having work experience in the field or having completed a ""high-level IT course"" within the past few years - which I'm still not clear what this refers to, as I was told that IT certification courses like MTA and COMPTIA did not count. It almost seems like you have to have been previously enrolled in an IT course or already be a professional in the field to even enroll in those programs. Even the IT courses in my own program don't count. It's quite confusing. &amp;#x200B; I have around 2-3 years of experience as a hobbyist programmer, being functional in many C-family languages and being intimately familiar with OOP. I do a lot of work with Arduino, Raspi, 3D printer firmware, often creating my own software to accomplish simple tasks during my projects. I've also developed or helped develop a modest handful of simple games in Unity and Unreal Engine, which required C# and C++ respectively. I also have nearly a decade of work experience where management of computer hardware (system maintenance, upgrade, and repair) and software (virus and malware/adware removal, performance optimization, new software install, etc) was an ""unofficial"" job duty, because I've been the ""computer guy"" pretty much everywhere I've ever worked, even if my actual job is grilling chicken or kicking rowdy customers out of a property. I also have plenty of supervisory and management experience from these jobs. &amp;#x200B; Ideally, I would like to pursue a career in software development after I graduate. I've noticed most of the Junior Dev jobs around me just require ""a Bachelor's degree"" in general and a basic familiarity with OOP concepts, but I'm not really sure if I'm going to get the sideways-eye about trying to get into software dev with a business degree, even if it's biased towards technology. My hobbyist experience might help me, but I've been turned away from IT repair work before due to having no ""official"" experience in the field, even though I've been building, repairing, and setting up desktop computers and home networks in an occasional, ""on-the-side"" capacity for the past 13 years. I'm also aware that, due to the nature of my degree being business-oriented, I may have more luck pursuing a traditional suit-and-tie job in a marketing or management capacity. I don't take issue with that and would still be happy to work in any of those roles, but my true passion and career aspiration lies in software development, perhaps one day becoming the CTO of an existing company or one I help create (after some more education, of course). &amp;#x200B; Finally, the question: For people who may have completed the Bachelor's of IT Business Management program and gone on to be software developers, was it difficult to articulate how your degree relates to the field? Were there any third-party certifications (MTA, COMPTIA, etc) that you achieved to help you get work like this that you suggest I look into? If you used a portfolio of your previous projects to help you find work in this field, what kind of projects that you had done do you think really helped sealed the deal? &amp;#x200B; Any feedback is appreciated.

Then what? They lack rigor needed to build high quality graduates. I am information security major with a minor in criminology. I have a well rounded education that will allow me to work in any position in cybersecurity. I can go down the technician route, the management route, the compliance route or behavioral analysis route. I can become a security software developer. My school paid for my sec+ in a 45 day training over the summer. This is something WGU could never offer me for free. My school gave me a research opportunity at an ivy league school, a paid internship this summer at a cybersecurity consulting firm and I am employed as a government data analyst because of a STEM pipeline program through my school. I am finishing my senior capstone at the federal reserve in August as a cybersecurity analyst. I have networked and made connections in the field through events and opportunities given to me by my school. My mentor is endorsing me for CSSLP cert, which is the next step. Who do you think the recruiter is going to choose for an analyst position? The B.S. in Information Security with a minor in Criminology. Strong curriculum in math and science. Two internships in cybersecurity sector collectively two years and half of experience. Computer security research at an ivy league school. Certified in Sec+ and CSSLP. GitHub projects and network design projects. A senior capstone in a top agency. Or... WGU grad with all entry level certs, no projects, no research and no experience or entry level experience in help desk. Weak curriculum in math and science. No connections or networking opportunities. No internship opportunities. No answer needed here. Its obviously the first one. Generic? WGU is generic and pushes trade programs as degree programs. They are a joke. Everything in the information assurance program is free at my local community trade school. Even the local community colleges and the education department here gives free prep. classes on those certs and pays for them if you are under employed. WGU software development degree is a bigger joke! When did employers want programming certs over programming projects? This simply a poor way to prepare someone for a field that demands projects and could careless about a Programming language cert. thats how you know their program is utter garbage. At least the MIS or CIS programs at state schools help students become well rounded. They can take programming courses, management courses, etc... so they arent pigeonholed into one cybersecurity role. But, they are prepared for any role they choose. Security Software Developer or Engineer- Programming classes and math classes IT Auditor- Business classes, programming classes, math classes. Behavior/Intelligence Analyst - psychology classes Compliance Analyst - political science and policy focused classes If you want to do cybersecurity engineering for hardware or software go into computer engineering. But for software, you can just do computer science, CIS or MIS. All these jobs require good problem solving skills (math) and good written communication skills (English) and the ability to present ideas and findings in a public forum. (Public speaking 101) Even my degree program in Information Security is well rounded. The foundation is in computer science with courses that are focused in forensic computing electives. I know a few classmates and degree mates that are now working in the field as analysts, junior project managers or security developers at Boeing, Moodys, Atena, Accenture, Amazon, Google, MasterCard, etc.. OP, maximum your potential. Start at a community college or a state school. They have tremendous resources, opportunities and connections for you. [URL [URL Check that out. TTOT, if it worked for you great. But, I needed a college experience that was lasting and I got a good ROI. Not everyone wants to just get a piece of paper to show an employer. B&amp;M colleges are good for people who see it as an experience to network and maximize other opportunities. Plus, federal aid and state aid covered everything. """

My thought in switching is that I'll have a better chance breaking into the Networking field with my help desk experience than I would getting into a cyber security job with no security experience. The idea is that I could go into networking then start working toward a security focus once I have some networking experience."
228,cybersecurity,WGU,Has anyone satisfied CISSP requirements solely from WGU certs/degree path?,0,bz3j57,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/bz3j57/has_anyone_satisfied_cissp_requirements_solely/,2019-06-11 07:23:48,"I'm currently in the BS:CSIA program and I'm looking into getting my CISSP once I finally complete the program. I'm going over the information that is required to get it going and I see that if you do not have any experience in security, you can get your CISSP (the entire cert, not the associate) by satisfying requirements via certifications. I see now that some of the certs that WGU chose to place in their degree path may actually be because of this certification. I have never heard of CIW in the past and I find it interesting that the two CIW certs you get on this path satisfy a year worth of CISSP experience. My question is: has anyone received the CISSP after completing their WGU degree? Namely the BS in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance? I currently have no experience in security, but I notice that after I complete all the certs in the path, I'll have 5 ""years"" towards the CISSP or technically 6 with the WGU degree counting as one full year as well and I suppose that would mean I qualify for the CISSP and not the associate version."

I have about two years of IT college, but never finished my Associate's which was an awful move. I do have about 3 1/2 years being a Printer and PC technician, 1yr of helpdesk. I currently work at an IT management company, where I see tons of enivronments onsite, doing everything from network diagnostics, VPNs, Windows repairs, pretty much everything you'd expect an MSP to do. They are willing to pay for my education, which is a real bonus. I'm looking at WGU since it also offers certs alongside the degree itself. I've been wanting to break into Cybersecurity, and I'd like to to BS &gt; MS, preferably at the same school. Would it be better to do Network Operations and Security, or just pure Cybersecurity?

My options are as followed. \-IT Management Degree- This would be quick because I would only have to take a few more courses and it would have the name behind it. But I don't know if it would teach me a lot and would be good for those jobs. \-MBA in IT. This would get me and MBA and it had the it behind it but once again I don't know if it would teach me much and would be looked upon favorably. \- Cybersecurity MS Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
231,cybersecurity,WGU,How to Complete the MSCIA in 2 Months: Quick Reference Guide,53,c244nc,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/c244nc/how_to_complete_the_mscia_in_2_months_quick/,2019-06-19 02:09:32,"&amp;#x200B; # How to Complete MCSCIA in 2 Months # Background First off, this approach may not work for everyone, but I highly suggest the methods proposed in this quick reference document. I work in Information Security as a Risk Analyst and Systems Auditor. My primary activities consist of creating and architecting security/compliance programs for researchers and private investigators. Many of these programs are subject to statutory and regulatory compliance and stipulate the adoption of governance and control frameworks. I tell you this, because every day I facilitate the creation of safeguards/countermeasures and assess the effectiveness of security controls that span numerous frameworks. Therefore, most of the material and even scenarios (performance assessments) were very familiar to me. However, my approach is not solely reliant on experience, but more so a straightforward and repeatable approach towards completing your assignments and beating the evaluators at their own game. So, lets get started! # Passing Objective Assessments with Ease! ## Always Take the Pre-Assessment First! You dont know, what you dont know. I started the program on April 4th and my best friend kept challenging me to go ahead and take the pre-assessment for Information Security and Assurance  C725. Like many of you all, I was extremely nervous and anxious, but I just went ahead and went for it. Surprisingly I passed the pre-assessment. But, heres the thing. even if you pass you still need to prepare for the actual objective assessment. Therefore, I developed a few steps to help you prepare your objective assessments regardless if you fail or pass the pre-assessment. ## Step 1: Review Your Weaknesses It doesnt matter whether you failed or passed the pre-assessment. The goal is to ascertain your level of knowledge and determine where you need to focus your studies. I call this gap-studying, although I guarantee you someone has beat me to itlol. You will need view your coaching report in print view and go through each question one-by-one and understand why the correct answer is right and why the incorrect answers are wrong. ### Make a Quick Reference Guide (QRG) 1. Go through each question one-by-one and look up the definitions for each distractor and correct answer (key). Start populating your study guide in tools like OneNote, Evernote, or Notepad++. 2. Next, go through the course material, and go the end of each section and answer the questions. Add these questions to your QRG too ### Review Course Notecards After Ive made my QRG, I go through the notecards for each chapter just to assess my gaps. If I run into notecards that I have a hard time remembering, I add them to the QRG as well. ## Step 2: Prepping for The Objective Assessment Now that youve created your QRG, its time to review your notes and prepare for the exam. This part is straightforward. Simply scroll through your guide while hiding the answers and answer the question out loud or in your head to see if youre correct. ### Know the Wrong Answers Too! Dont just focus on knowing the right answer. Understand the why the distractors are wrong too. But why Blake? Why in the hell would I be concerned with the wrong answers? Ill tell you. Because those same wrong answers will be right answers in other questions on your actual exam! I used to focus on just knowing the right answers too and I used to be horrible at taking tests when I was younger. So, trust me when I say this is probably one of the smartest things you can do for two main reasons: **1. Youll actually learn the material and will pass the exam** **2. This will prepare you for similar exams and you will be able to easily identify wrong answers.** ## Step 3: Take the Objective Assessment Now that youve built up all that confidence and you are able to identify the wrong and right answers, go ahead and schedule the exam now vs later. The beautiful thing about WGU, is that you can literally take your assessment in 30 minutes at any time of the day. Ive personally found that scheduling my exam as soon as I feel somewhat confident made me grind for the next 30 minutes to get my head in the right space for the assessment. Seven assessments later, and I guess the strategy is working pretty well huh!? I strongly urge you to try these methods. I can honestly say that I did not read any course material in the masters program except for Secure Software Design, because I had absolutely no experience in that domain. # Passing the ""Dreaded"" Performance Assessments Ok, I get it, no one likes writing papers, but I promise I can help you attenuate that anxiety with a few simple steps. They are assessing competency and ensuring that you can articulate your thoughts onto a particular medium in a succinct and clear manner. From my personal experience, writing papers was extremely difficult in the past. You dont have to take my word for it, but at the University of Phoenix, I wrote over 105 papers and some of the instructors were extremely strict for a simple punctuation error. Ok, enough of my rant, lets get to it!  ### Lead the Horse to Water Youre going to have to spell it out for these people. That means that you will need to create your outline based on their grading rubric. They are not going to take the time to pick through your paper to see if you met their assessment criteria. Let me show you how I construct my paper. ### Step 1: Breaking Down the Rubric &amp; Requirements into Actionable Tasks Examine the rubric for HAP2 Task 1: Cybersecurity Management I  Strategic URL URL You need to use the **Requirements** &amp; **Rubric** to Create Your Outline &amp; Objectives. Let me show you how. First, I label the requirement as so. **Requirement** Describe both the physical vulnerabilities and physical threats that put the security posture of Psinuvia Inc. at risk. Provide details from the attached Independent Security Report, including how each vulnerability or threat is negatively impacting the security posture of the company. Next, I create assessment objectives based on the same criteria the evaluator uses to grade our assignments. For example, look at the Competent section in the picture above and break it down into questions that you can use to grade yourself. For example, take a look at the following: Under Competent, it states The submission describes both physical vulnerabilities and physical threats that put the security posture of Psinuvia Inc. at risk. We need to break this down into easily digestible question so we can only write whats necessary and give the evaluators what they want. Check out the example below **Questions:** * **Did you describe physical vulnerabilities that put Psinuvia at risk?** * **Did you describe physical threats that put Psinuvia at risk?** Your end-product should resemble the following: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Requirement** Describe both the physical vulnerabilities and physical threats that put the security posture of Psinuvia Inc. at risk. Provide details from the attached Independent Security Report, including how each vulnerability or threat is negatively impacting the security posture of the company. **Questions**: * **Did you describe physical vulnerabilities that put Psinuvia at risk?** * **Did you describe physical threats that put Psinuvia at risk?** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ### Step 2: Understand the Assignment Now that youve created your outline and you know what the evaluator is looking for you need to get a better understanding of the assignment so that you can actually have something to write about.  **Review the Scenario/Overview** Your goal is to understand the problem, the proposed solution, and why the solution is appropriate. I use a reading method called SQ3R which stands for Survey, Question, Read, Recite, and Review. Lets face it. some of the assignments have pages upon pages of material that we all have to read to gathering a complete understanding of the problem. As an systems auditor, Im faced with the same issue every week. But dont sweat it, heres a quick way you can tackle massive amounts of reading with ease. ***Survey = Creating an Outline of The Content*** Dont laugh, but I literally only read the first paragraph of any material and simply read the first sentence of each paragraph until I finish that section. The first sentence is the limited topic and the authors controlling idea (opinion). This lets you know what to the subject is and what to expect if you keep reading. Surveying or scanning the material allows me to quickly understand an overview of the problem. ***Question = Make sense out of the material*** Now that I have a general idea of what Im about to read, I know where to focus my time and energy. As you start reading a paragraph, make quick bullet points of the main problems. This will assist you in creating your own why, when, where, who, what, and how questions. This method ensures that you dont get writers block. **Read =** In My Opinion, Optional Typically, I only read material that it is very relevant to my career or if Im very interested to me, therefore. well you catch my driftlol. Im not about to read 35 pages of fluff just to figure out the top ten things wrong with the assignment. Instead, I look for keywords like **wishes, wants, considering, fails, tries,** and more to identify the core problems. **Review** This is where I take all of the bullet points I created for the overview and then add them to the outline I created in step 1. Each bullet point/problem should have a home in the rubric. If it doesnt, then it is probably not relevant or conducive to the evaluator. **Recite** This step is good if you are taking notes from your reading to take an objective assessment but not if you are trying to draft a paper for your performance assessment. Performance assessments typically introduce a very specific issue that they want you to solve. Although the recite step is great for self-learners preparing for other types of exams.  For more information on SQ3R, I totally recommend you all look at [**The Science of Self-Learning: How to Teach Yourself Anything**](URL &amp; [**The Science of Rapid Skill Acquisition: Advanced Methods to Learn, Remember, and Master New Skills and Information**](URL from Amazon. These are one of the few books in my life that Ive actually read from cover to cover. Additionally, these books put me in the right headspace while going through the masters program. ### Step 3: Gathering Your Resources/References WGU does have a few good resources in the Course Information section of your assessment. Many students such as my best friend also says that the course instructors may have additional resources. However, Heres my advice on where and how to obtain resources to help you throughout your journey. ***Reddit, Well Im mean youre here already***.  First of Reddit is the number one recommended source that I can provide you. It helped me out tremendously and there are tons of other students just like you and I who are dealing with the same issues with these assignments. Surprisingly, everyone also exercises a fair amount of tact and professionalisms when sharing their thoughts and ideas. ***IT Resources*** The content in WGU is pretty good, although as an IT professional you are probably already fairly resourceful. Here are some additional resources that I use specifically for performance assessments *Resources for compliance, legal, policiesetc.* * URL * URL (this should be your go-to source) * isaca.org * OWASP.org * ISC2.org * URL * URL (for the legal stuff) * IT-specific training resources * URL * URL * URL * youtube.com (yeah thats right good ole YouTube) Im simply summarizing some resources you can leverage at your own disposal, however, please do not view this as a complete list. Dont forget to reference certification guides too. There is a ton of useful information there too. ***Social Media (Well, Just LinkedIn)*** Im not big on social media at all, but LinkedIn and LinkedIn Learning have been extremely helpful for me. I suggest looking for students that are in your same program or already completed it. Similarly, in the same way you found me.  ## Draft the Damn Paper &amp; Stop Procrastinating Listen everyone, its not going to bite you I promise. Well, youll probably get a bite or two from the evaluators once or twice . Like I said earlier, WGU is simply trying to obtain your level of competence of the subject matter. With this in mind, as long as you write against the grading rubric &amp; the requirements and ask yourself the questions you created earlier in Step 1, I promise youll be fine. ### Dont Sweat the Resubmissions So, my best friend and I use two different approaches. He will overwhelm them with tons of legitimate material, so they dont have a choice to send it back. The approach is very sound and has worked for him. However, Im a path of least resistance guy. Once I got a whiff of how strict they were on grading papers, I started to write in an extremely concise manner and gave them very straightforward and focused submissions. Dont get me wrong, all objectives were met, but I did not add any extraneous graphics, charts, plans, or processes unless absolutely necessary and conducive to the paper. My strategy, if you think that more is needed, just dont. Let me repeat that. If you think that more is needed to meet the objective, just dont. But, Blake why would I not just give them everything I can so they cant return my paper for review?. Heres my simple and straightforward answer: The review and resubmissions help you understand exactly what is missing! Why would you spend hours of your time and sanity to add to parts of your paper that may not contribute to your grade at all? I mean we just get a pass or fail folks! If youve tailored your paper to the rubric, created your assessments objectives, and understand the problem; youll be fine. Turn it in and see how well your approach worked for you. If you only had one or two areas you needed to improve, then you did pretty good and have a solid understanding of the material. If you have multiple problems, then your approach needs improvement. No matter how good you think your assignment is, dont go thinking that a random evaluator wont find something wrong with it or ask you add something that may not seem useful at all. Remember, you are writing your papers for them, not for you. # Conclusion Keep in mind that I put in some ridiculous hours to study during this program. I literally study for 8 to 12 hours on weekends and maybe 4 to 5 hours on weekdays. Funny thing, is that I finished my last four courses, including the Capstone in the same week. Theres a funny story of why I did this, and Ill mention that at the end. ## Tips Any classes that only have one type of assessment should be added to your current term. WGU is constantly improving its program and adding more tasks and assessments to their courses. Be proactive and identify all classes that only have one assessment and knock those out first. Especially the assessment objectives. If youre not careful, and dont activate the easy classes, you could wind up with double work for taking too long to complete your program (although theres no such thing ) ## The Funny, but No Funny Story After spending all of Labor Day weekend tattooing my brain with CHFI material, I was ready to take my exam. I scheduled, drank a ton of coffee and was more prepared than ever. After I entered my voucher code, the Proctor attempted to login in with their proctor ID several times. They stated that somethings wrong with the voucher and that they would be unable to continue. The folks didnt even try to contact EC Council or WGU over the phone. So, Im extremely mad right? I just took off half a day of work and wrecked my brain with study material. More importantly, Im totally lit off a triple shot of espresso! Lol,  So I send a nice lengthy and tactful email to WGU and EC Council. Meanwhile, Im still extremely jittery from all the caffeine. So out of frustration, I decide to go ahead and take both pre-assessments for Cybersecurity Management Strategic and Tactical. I didnt even care if I passed; I just need to put this caffeine and frustration to use lol. Surprisingly, I did pass. I actually felt like my day wasnt wasted then lol. So, I went ahead and created my Quick Reference Guides for both exams and took one after another on the following days. That weekend, I was finally cleared to try and take my CHFI exam again. This time everything worked, and I successfully passed the exam. Im very hype now, and all I could think about was going ahead and getting a head-start on the Capstone. Within two days, I finished the Capstone. Honestly, I was so motivated from day to day by constantly pushing myself. Im so glad it is over though, and this is probably the hardest Ive worked for anything during this short amount of time. I hope this strategy helps someone out there. Always feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn if you have questions about any how to approach these assignments. Even if they are not specifically within this program. Find me @ [URL"

So I have Sec+ and CCNA:Security. And I work in DoD contracting, which hammers a lot of security concepts home by its nature. I studied for about a month, average of 2-3 hours a night and up to 8 on weekends. Some days I did less, some days nothing at all. I read through the first five chapters of the EC-Council text before deciding that I didn't like it, and there must be a better way. However, my PM wouldn't approve a voucher without showing a 90-95% passing score on a course material practice exam (these are actually Kaplan tests, and they're five times harder than the actual exam. So if you think they're hard, you're right, but don't worry). I just took them enough times to where I could answer enough correct answers through repetition to get that &gt;90% score. And this paid off, actually, because there were a number of things I had to memorize or look up that helped me out on the real exam. The bulk of my studying came from Matt Walker's AIO 4th edition. Just buy it, it's $30 on Amazon and comes with a code for Total Tester practice exams which are what really helped me pass. This book is ON THE MONEY. Read it through once, do the end-of-chapter tests and the Total Tester stuff, and look up what you don't know. I started getting interested in pentesting and OSCP throughout this process, so I watched and followed along with the Zero to Hero series from The Cyber Mentor on youtube -&gt; [URL This was awesome for getting me hands on, building a lab environment, and just learning about the pentesting field. He spends about half of each video on his material, and you can skip the last half of each video if you want because it's just a Q+A with his subscribers but I found that content interesting as well. IPPSec is another youtuber who is great at walking through HackTheBox CTFs and I learned a lot by watching him. Could I root a machine now? Yes, actually, I was able to do some really easy retired boxes through HTB. Am I a pentester now? Fuck no. But it feels good to get this cert out of the way, and a cursory search of LinkedIn is showing some great potential for work in the DoD Cyber field. YMMV with this, I happen to have a clearance already, but I don't think anybody who completes an MSCSIA through WGU would have a problem getting one. Just for your awareness, CEH checks the box for all of the CSSP positions on DoD 8570.1, which will cover most Security Analyst and CyberSecurity Engineer positions. Happy to answer any questions."

What did your schedule look like? How many credits did you have to take a semester? I'm strongly considering WGU after my associates degree and am liking what I see. I want to do the BS in Network Operations and Security and then the MS in Cybersecurity. Has anyone done a similar path? Is it possible to get it done in less than 4 years?

Here's My Experience &amp; Tips,8,bo8svp,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/bo8svp/completed_mscsia_in_just_3_months_heres_my/,2019-05-14 06:32:08,"What's up everyone! I'm excited to say that I found out that I passed my capstone for the MSCSIA program this morning. That being said, I am finished with my degree! I started February 1st 2019 and finished May 13th, 2019! I also applied for graduation today as well. It's an awesome feeling. I also want to share my experience to help you all out a little more with your journey to getting your degree. I will honestly say WGU and this degree changed my life forever in just the 3 months that I attended. I got a new job that I just started today as a Senior Cybersecurity Engineer before I even finished the degree! I wanted to change my life in 6 months and fully committed myself to this and this was the result! A little background on me: I started my degree February 1st, 2019. My background is not too extensive. I got my security + back in 2014 and it expired a few years or so later. I have been working in IT since about 2012 and cyber security since 2015. I have been an information security analyst for a little over 3 years now. I will say though, my career did not influence my knowledge much prior to this degree. Maybe a little, but not a lot. Most of the information I have learned for this degree has been new or much more in depth than I ever have gone. I would say that I honestly just have a great work ethic, learn things pretty quickly, and put a lot of time in to my work. I was in a very unique situation with my job where I could literally spend most of my time there studying. I used to work Saturday-Tuesday overnight. I did 4 10 hour shifts each week. I spent anywhere between 4-12 hours (sometimes more) studying about 5-6 days a week. I made sure that I kept myself sane by taking my weekends to relax and spend time with my GF or watching anime when I got bored of studying or in my free time. I wouldn't say I rushed this degree. I did not try to. I just had so much time to study it might seem that way. My general strategy was to take the pre-test, read all of the material for the class, and then take the post assessment. Everyone learns differently, so approach the textbooks and studying however you learn the best. For me, I just had to read through the material and it stuck with me. It's a combination of me liking information security and being able to remember things easily as well. I would say that the longest classes for me were the CHFI course, the CEH course, and the Cybersecurity Architecture and Engineering course. This course has two projects and takes some time. My favorite course was secure network design! I studied for the CHFI for about 3 weeks while the other two took me 2 weeks. I made a write up on the [CHFI here](URL as well as on the [CEH here](URL Check those out for my tips on those. They definitely will help! For the cybersecurity management courses, be sure you are prepared for the tactical objective assessment! This was the hardest OA in the entire curriculum in my opinion. Go over the material and make sure you are ready for it! As for the capstone, I recommend following the advice I got from others here on the WGU reddit: write to the rubric. This makes it so that the person who grades it has an easier time locating each rubric requirement and makes it so that you do not miss anything you need. It took me about 8 days to finish it. I also put in an insane amount of time for it. I do recommend the paper having some type of flow/structure to it, but I have heard other say this does not matter. Also, do not be afraid to over achieve! The more you do for the capstone or any project, the more of a chance you have to pass. Mine came out to 55 pages double spaced, so I would use that as a reference. I have seen people do 90+ pages, but I do not think it is entirely necessary but of course it depends on your project I suppose. Also, tackle it slowly. It is so daunting at first. I remember before I started wondering how I was going to finish this. But I just chipped away at it and before I knew it, I was done! Overall, if you put time into it and are genuinely interested in the material, you will be able to pick it up pretty quick. I'm assuming that most people don't have the opportunity that I did with my job so my advice would be this: if you want to finish in 1-2 terms and you work a normal shift, then spend at least 2-4 hours after work during the week studying. Add as much as you can while you are at work too if it is possible. To supplement this, give your studies 8-12 hours on the weekend days. Depending on your personal life situation, it might not be possible but you should try to do as much as you can. There were plenty of times where I just had to stop after a few hours or that I fell asleep reading because it was too boring (CHFI and Secure Code Design were the most boring classes for me and I fell asleep or lost interest quickly multiple times for each). Just take breaks, fight through it, and give it an honest effort! Let me know if you have any questions. If you want to kind of imitate what I did, it just takes discipline! I would love to help anyone out going through the program as well! I hope this motivates you to get those classes done! &amp;#x200B; URL"

The problem is i'm 26 and have zero experience with cybersecurity and I'm honestly not even that handy with computers in general. I was thinking of going to the local community college however I feel like I'd be wasting so much time in a traditional academic calendar setting, especially since I work full time so I wouldn't even be able to go to traditional school full time, making that degree even longer. I know the time it takes to earn a degree at WGU varies by the person, but do you think WGU would be a good choice for a beginner? Or would my best bet be taking some introductory courses at the local CC then maybe transferring to WGU when I have more experience?"

It was my second to last course and for some reason, the most stressful of them all. This class provides four resources that should prepare you for the test. The resources are a number of ITProTV videos, the notes for those videos, practice questions, and then about 700+ pages of reading from EC-Council. If you end up with this at the end of your last semester, you really shouldn't need to study too much to pass this class. A lot of the information is repeat from other classes. There is a little bit from the Project+, the in-house CCSP, some information that you will notice was covered in C844, and even some from C840. For me, I personally took all of the practice questions, the practice exam offered by EC-Council, read about 150 pages of the vitalsource material, and I also read the \~34 pages of ITProTV notes (who has time for videos anyway). &amp;#x200B; I had little to no interest at all in this class. After my experience with the ECES, I kind of lost all interest in the EC-Council certifications. It took me a week to even take the test as the first test available for me after getting approval for the OA was 3 days away, and by that point I had already studied 3 days planning to take it that same day. If you want to accelerate with this course, I highly suggest registering the class and receiving OA approval same day. There really isn't much else to it than that. The test wasn't too difficult, I can't really say much about the actual exam except that the quality control for it was absolutely awful. I wouldn't say I'm an expert in English but there were some spelling errors in the test questions. How could they miss something like that? &amp;#x200B; Anyway, off to finish my capstone.

I have an AA from over 15 years ago with many GE credits that should transfer, however i only took English Composition I and didnt take any math other than the minimum to graduate. Im also not sure jumping into English Composition II is a good idea after such a long break. Math requirements list Applied Algebra and Applied Probability and Statistics. I remember zero algebra (not even basic first year algebra). I also have concerns about Integrated Physical Sciences. Does that course assume math skills beyond basic math? Does it assume you took high school physics? Im looking for ways to prepare for any of the GE coursework that I wont be able to skip based on my community college transfer credits. I dont want to commit to enrolling in this program if theres much of a chance I wont complete graduation requirements in 1 full time term due to spending too much time struggling with completing the GE courses. In that case, I would be better off just spending the time and effort on getting industry certifications without a degree. Should I repeat English Composition I so that knowledge is fresh before taking English Composition II? Whats the best way to prepare for this math classes so I can get though them quickly once enrolled?"

255,cybersecurity,WGU,Passed CHFI 4/19 After 3 Weeks Of Study!!!,7,bhhkdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/bhhkdh/passed_chfi_419_after_3_weeks_of_study/,2019-04-26 13:13:50,"Hey everyone! I made a post similar to this one about my experience with taking the CEH exam after studying for 2 weeks. [Check that out here.](URL A little background on me: I am a student in the M.S. Cybersecurity and Information Assurance program here at WGU . I started my degree February 1st, 2019. I got my CEH March 17th, 2019 as a part of my degree. I have 3 classes left right now (1 of which I'll be finishing this weekend) until graduation as well so I'm excited! I'm hoping to be done mid May and have my degree done after just 3 months! My background is not too extensive. I got my security + back in 2014 and it expired a few years or so later. I have been working in IT since about 2012 and cyber security since 2015. I have been an information security analyst for a little over 3 years now. I will say though, my career did not influence my knowledge much prior to this degree. Maybe a little, but not a lot. Most of the information I have learned for this degree has been new or much more in depth than I ever have gone. I would say that I honestly just have a great work ethic, learn things pretty quickly, and put a lot of time in to my work. The CHFI exam is not exactly easy, but I wanted to let you guys know very quickly that it is possible to pass with the material provided by WGU. It is just a matter of how well you retain information and how hard you actually study. I have ready so many threads here and on the course chatter about people failing the exam multiple times and actually was pretty worried. As a result, I over prepared myself for the exam lol. I'll start by saying I had no prior knowledge of forensics other than a course I took in undergrad maybe back in 2013 lol. So it is safe to say EVERYTHING was new to me. The material is extremely broad and goes into a decent amount of depth, but if you approach it correctly you can pass the exam the first time. I honestly think it is a difficult exam and you cannot pass just by understanding information security. You are more likely to do that with the CEH. This one you actually have to dig into forensics and at least understand it at a mid-high level. My approach was simple. First, I simply read through the book. Some of the later chapters I glossed over or did not read cover to cover because I felt the material was pretty dry in all honesty and took a chance by telling myself they could not be THAT complex. Do not make this mistake lol. Be sure to read all of the chapters at least once because you need to have at least seen all of the material. It took me almost 2 weeks to read it. The hardest sections to get through were the Operating systems chapter and the hard disk chapter. They both put me to sleep 3 times lol I'm not much of a note taker or flash card guy. I kind of just read things, understand them, and remember them. I don't take many notes because I honestly don't see myself going back and reading them. The exception is the study guide I made a few days before I took the test. If you are a note taker though, feel free to still do so. Everyone learns differently. After I read the chapters, I played around with the 150 pre test and 150 question post test. I got in the 70s for the pre test and the 80s for the post test. I took them again after going through what I got wrong and looking up the correct answers in the book. If there was something I felt was important, I would write it into a simple word document to reinforce it. After passing the tests, I went to cybrary and quickly watched the CHFI course videos there. It is free and very helpful. The guy actually tells you a good amount of what you need to know EXACTLY. This is most likely because he is a test reviewer for the CHFI. I took notes on things he said to remember for the exam. Some of the questions from those exams on the WGU site are also on the test, so be sure to go over them a couple time. After I finished that, I decided to look at the chfi blueprint v2.1. Honestly, this was the best decision. It literally tells you the exact topics and what you need to be able to do for each one. I went through and literally created a study guide based on the blueprint. I wrote down the categories and what you need to be able to do provided by EC-Council, and added relevant notes to each. This is where reading the book comes in handy. You will know exactly where to find each referenced section. Going back through the book and pulling out this information will also reinforce your reading. I finished the guide in a few days, studied it for one day, and then took the test the next day. Beginning to end, it took me just about 3 weeks to start studying for the exam and then pass it. I did not study tools at all. You can honestly figure it out by the names. There are like 300 tools in the book which is ridiculous. The test barely asked any tool questions from what I remember. There were a couple that maybe I didn't know, but most were obvious,especially if you have at least seen the main ones from the text. You should still look over important tools and their basic functions, but do not spend time trying to memorize the hundreds of tools they list. I'm sure that's just advertisements they probably get paid for lol All in all, it wasn't easy. But if you apply yourself and over prepare like I did, you'll be fine! I wasn't a forensics professional or cyber security guru with 10+ years of experience before this class or this degree. I'm just a normal guy who wants to master infosec, so most of you out there can do the same! I went into great depth because I know a lot of people fail this test and do not even know how to approach it. I wanted to make a guide to help you all out so you can get through it the first time like I did! If you have any questions, let me know!"

I wasn't planning to post one of these, but I wanted to put one up for us 'average' folk out there who aren't superhuman or don't have all day to study. I'll be 35 next month and the last time I was in school was 10 years ago, finishing up an AAS I took 5 years to get. Underwhelming to the say the least. Unfortunately, I didn't realize until after I had my first kid that I should probably get back to school for a Bachelors if I wanted to get out of my dead-end job into something I actually enjoyed. I researched local B&amp;Ms and couldn't find anything that wouldn't require quitting my job and taking out massive loans to get there, so I shelved the idea and hunkered down where I was at. Fortunately I was able to work my way up into a much better situation where I was working 'IT adjacent', so to speak, and actually enjoyed the work but loathed management. Around this time I found out about WGU and jumped right in knowing it had been just what I was looking for, fully expecting to change careers once I was able. I knew it wouldn't be easy working full-time and having a wife and two kids (now three!) at home, but I wasn't going to let that stop me. Nearly every commute on the bus I was studying on my iPad and at least an hour each night once the kids were in bed plus long sessions on weekends. Shortly after starting I finally got a new job with some actual opportunities and management I can trust and that supports me, so now I might not make a career change like I originally planned, but I don't regret any of it. In some respect I can still apply my degree to my current job and cybersecurity will always be of interest to me. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I might actually consider pursuing a Masters at some point in the next few years, if my wife doesn't beat me to it! To even be able to consider something like that makes me excited and thankful, coming from a point not long ago where I thought formal school wasn't even an option anymore. The one thing I can't stress enough to prospective students or those looking for advice or struggling... **use your resources.** Whether it's the course instructors, program mentor, tutoring resources, Facebook groups, this sub, or the Slack channel... get yourself out there and get help if you need it. I cannot recommend this enough and found **this sub** and **the Slack channel** ([wguit.slack.com](URL to be invaluable help in finishing this degree. I also can't recommend enough u/jwawa's posts. They were some of the most comprehensive course recaps I could find; very beneficial for accelerating some of my classes and ultimately helped shave my initial degree plan of 3 years down to 2. So a big shout out and thanks to the users of this sub and the WGU IT Slack channel. Really... it's been great being a part of this community and I hope to keep contributing and give back some in return of what I got out of it. Honestly, at this point... I'm almost not sure what to do with myself. I think it'll take a while to get back into the swing of things and 'normal life' without having to think about the next chapter or OA or cert exam. Part of me thinks I may miss it, but I'll still be here pitching in where I can and rooting for those of you still pushing forward. Best of luck, fellow Night Owls, and thank you!"

I graduated last year with my Bachelor's in Information Technology Management. I chose this program because I had gotten into IT management, but still had technical duties. I thought, well, why not go for my Master's here? I was rejected on the basis that my degree wasn't ""technical enough"". Literally all WGU looked at was the major on the piece of paper. They ignored 3 years of technical classes prior to my enrollment at WGU. They told me I could try to get in with my resume, but such a black and white judgement on initial enrollment left a horrible taste in my mouth. After this experience I decided to just apply to different programs and see where it got me. I applied to five different Master's programs in Cybersecurity. I was admitted into all five. All five, the most esteemed being Georgia Tech and Carnegie Mellon's. WGU really needs to rethink their Master's level enrollment process. If two famed engineering colleges can accept me, then I'm pretty sure WGU can too. but the exciting news is that despite what some people say, a WGU degree does not kill your chances of continuing in a prestigious academic career."

I did apply two years ago, but then Hurricane Irma hit, we lost power for a week, and when power was restored, I was offered a new job. I would be coming in to do one of the IT degrees. My questions are: 1. Which certifications are useful for transferring in? I have an A+ now, but have been studying for Network+ and Security+, and may be able to pass those, and my coworkers who have project+ and linux+ seem to think I could pass those with limited additional studying time. Should I take those prior to starting, or just take them as part of the curriculum? 2. What is the class pacing and grading like? The thing I hated about traditional school (which admittedly was 10+ years ago) were the assignments given on short notice, several times per week. Do you take multiple classes at once, or one at a time? Are the grades primarily exams, or are there tons of small assignments that eat up tons of time? 3. I was interested in the cybersecurity and information assurance bachelors, but I notice it doesn't list the certifications gained in the description. Does anyone have a list of those for that degree? 4. What degree is generally the fastest to finish in IT? I have about a year of general college credit as well as my A+. I have about 7 years of legit IT experience, and nearly 5 as a Windows Sys Admin, Is there a mechanism to speed up the earning of the degree? maybe something similar to CLEP? &amp;#x200B;"

Just want to say, for anyone on the fence and considering this program: DO IT. I have nothing but good things to say about WGU, particularly the M.S. Cybersecurity and Information Assurance because that's my direct experience. Program mentor was incredible. Classes are great overall, despite a few being feeling a bit dated. I heard they totally revamped the MSCSIA curriculum in January 2019, so I have a feeling that's all been addressed. The certification exams being included in the cost of the already-low tuition is definitely a plus, and the value is kind of unreal if you really think about it. (I know EC-Council stuff is a bit controversial in some crowds, but I really learned a lot in both courses.) Cyber Warfare was dope. Not sure if it's still included in the new cybersecurity program though. The most difficult part of the program for me was the EC-Council Computer Hacking Forensic Investigator (CHFI) exam for Network Forensics course. I actually failed the first time as I was unaware of how wide and deep the course material truly was, and how it was represented on the exam. The SUMO material was okay, but not enough. Kenneth Underhill's Udemy course was a great supplement, particularly in regard to memorize the millions of forensic tools and their uses. 99-percent of the answers come from the EC-Council textbook that's provided, but that's over a thousand pages and there's no easy way around it. It was easily my biggest setback through the program (I was on the six months plan until I encountered CHFI). There's just a huge lack of study material out there for it. (I'm actually in the process of launching my own Udemy practice questions for CHFI this week based on things I felt were important, so if anyone wants a free code in the next few days, hit me up). I thought Cyber Warfare was particularly dope. Not sure if it's still included in the new cybersecurity program though. I heard it was much more management-based. That's probably for the best honestly. Anyway. Just wanted to bask in this victory for a minute. Good luck to all of you and happy trails! &amp;#x200B;"

Assume you already have non-security IT experience and a BSCS. Pretend you are out-of-pocket for costs with either option. I'm having a hard time finding a situation where the MSCSIA will tick a checkbox (DoD, other government, etc???) while it's easy to find situations where these specific certs tick the checkbox. Unfortunately, the BSCSIA only has the Sec+ and I already have a BSCS. The Sec+ can be paid out-of-pocket for $200-ish. To me, it seems like the CISSP and Sec+ is much better than the MS degree and the certs it comes with. I really wish the MSCSIA came with the CISSP voucher because that would make it much more worthwhile. So am I right that the CISSP is much more valuable than getting the MSCSIA diploma? "

273,cybersecurity,WGU,Enjoying the WGU difference,49,b6hfhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/b6hfhz/enjoying_the_wgu_difference/,2019-03-28 22:06:25,"I just started with WGU at the beginning of March (BA - Network Operations and Security) and am already enjoying the difference between WGU and other schools. My previous school was a state community college that primarily provided online programs / degrees to students who lived in the outer reaches of the Southern California desert region and didn't have regular access to a brick-and-mortar school. I joined up with them because, as an older student, single mom of 2, living in a 4-generation family home, and caretaker of my elderly mother, I didn't have the time attend classes in a real classroom. I worked my butt off in those classes and graduated with three associate degrees - Computer Information Systems, CyberSecurity, and some basic ""Science and Math"" thing. The community college's program was very much tied to the regular ""Community college"" ideas and calendar. We had 4 month long semesters with mid terms and finals and expectations of carrying and keeping up with 3-5 classes at the same time. There were weekly deadlines and no opportunity to speed up or slow down the schedule to accommodate your personal schedule or life. It didn't matter if your kid ended up in the hospital, your house burned down, or you had a car accident and spent 2 days in the hospital - if you didn't turn things in on time, they were instant F's. And though I can understand their reasoning (my classes were filled with 18-20 year old students with low work ethics and had no problem with lying), it made life very stressful for those of us who were older students with other responsibilities. After taking a few months off (my last cybersecurity class was so demanding, I was bordering on a mental breakdown - I needed the break), I started with WGU with a resolution to get stuff done. I blew through ""Principles of Management"" within the first few days and just passed my A+ 901 with a score of 818 last Thursday. And then everything had to come to a screeching halt because my family decided to have tile installed throughout our family house. (I'm not complaining - it was very much needed! 1/3 of the house was down to concrete foundation after a big flood a few years ago.) All of our personal items had to be packed up and out of the house before the work started on Monday and sleeping / living arrangements would have to be fluid for that week while different parts of the house were tiled and furniture was moved around. If this had happened while attending my previous school, I would be stressing out trying to meet assignment deadlines and keeping up with classroom discussions in all this chaos. It's totally different with WGU. I warned my program adviser a couple weeks ago about the week I'd have to take off and he agreed to my push to take my A+ 901 exam before the chaos began. My goal was to get to the point where I could take the week off, deal with this mess, and not have the ""School"" albatross hanging around my neck. And though I am dabbling in the ""A+ 902"" curriculum as I have time this week, there is no stress or push associated with it. I know that once this chaos is over and the house put back together, I can jump right back into my degree plan with no pain or detriment gained from my week long break. Thank you, WGU, for not adding to my stress levels with week! ;-) Obligatory photo of new flooring...for those that might be interested. ;-) [URL"

So in April of 2017 I signed up for WGU. 3 terms later, I graduated with a bachelor degree in Cybersecurity along with a handful of extra certifications. I also will admit that while studying for these certs, I learned quite a bit along the way. 3 months after graduation, I started applying for jobs again. This time, I was actually getting calls back! In the end, I ended up getting several interviews. Many of the interviews asked questions about topics that I actually learned while studying for certs at WGU. I ended up with two job offers. One for $90k and one for $105k. Both were Cybersecurity positions. I ended up accepting the offer for 105k. As an interesting aside, the manager for the first job was WGU alumni and the manager of the second job said that he heard great things about the school. So for those who are wondering if WGU is worth it, it was for me! TLDR: I paid 10k for a degree which landed me a job that paid 40k more per year than my previous job. "

290,cybersecurity,WGU,Completed and done 5 months - MS Cybersecurity and Information Insurance,4,awkgcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/awkgcs/completed_and_done_5_months_ms_cybersecurity_and/,2019-03-03 05:08:27,"I finally finished the program after a little over 4 months. When are they going to change the program to just MS in Cybersecurity. According to doctrine, information assurance was dropped years ago and it was added into cybersecurity as a whole. Anyways... I had to wait until yesterday to submit my last task due to funding and had a family vacation at the start of OCT when my term started. If anyone says you can't do it, its possible. I have a family, several small kids (14 months - 4.5 yrs old), wife works different shifts, and I work full time with some weekends depending on the cyber threat environment. I might have had an upper hand due to working in about every cyber field for a while. I've worked cyber exercises, multiple roles as a cyber operations planner, cyber threat analysis, targeting, written and edited cyber policy and doctrine, and technical roles to include pen testing, ethical hacking, hardening, coding, and network design infrastructure . I only read one book in the entire course and that was for C702 -CHFI, which was my longest class - 30 days (they changed the course test with a huge pool of questions and some outside study courses will not help you). I found the WGU material to not prepare me at all or out of date. I had one paper returned due to being actually academic and cyber correct but the grader didn't agree and wanted it 80s style with outdated technology - I guess that was in the course material. I contested to prove it was wrong, but in the end, I know what WGU graders want and that sometimes doesn't mean factually or currently correct. One thing I would change about the program is to update some of the material which I had hours of conversations with multiple senior level people at the school. Im glad they did change secure software design as it was maybe 10-15 years out of date - dont get me started on the CMMI levels. My easiest class was VLT2 as it was just read what they wanted and write it out. VLT2 took 3 days and then on to the next. My favorite part about this journey was I could do it at my own pace and take multiple classes at the same time while waiting for other papers to pass. I started out at a big name brick and mortar school and two semesters with a 4.0, but none of the professors would grade my papers until the whole class turned them in on the due date. I got bored and after taking Advanced Python Coding, I applied to WGU, and the rest is history. Glad I made the journey and I am finally done. If you have any questions on study methods, let me know. Always write to the rubric and forget the templates or worthless videos on how to structure a paper. I watched about 1 minute of a course video in my 2nd class and never watched or read any more. I used about 3 sources for all of my papers combined. I believe they were all NIST since the class required documentation of controls and I new which ones to use and went with that. Good luck and on to the next chapter in my life. "

Just to be safe, i scheduled them 90 mins apart with the larger one first. ( i gave my self 90 mins to take the first exam, make sure you over estimate your time) I ended up finishing the larger one in 33 mins, but i'm not you If you're a thorough test taker, and need the full 2.5 hours, use em. I planned on doing the 11 question DPA1 first, but it had a 90 min wait to take, and the Longer one had a 20 min wait. The reason i think this is, is because they are proctored from two different companies. The long test is Examity (Like every other one) The second Lab one is ProctorU. On that topic, I HATE proctorU's format, The Proctor was very nice, and it went smoothly enough, but they have a LOT more control over your PC, and as a CyberSecurity Professional, this really irked me, they shut down programs, and to get to the exam, I had to log into WGU again, not sure if i wasn't still logged in, and that's why, because it used the old log in window, but typing in my credentials means they may have been able to see it. Bothered me a lot. Also it was definitely a WGU url, so be sure to check that. But enough of that &amp;#x200B; **FJO1 Large Exam Notes** The main LARGE exam, FJO1 was basically the Pre-Assessment, but with a few changes. From what I remember, here is a list of differences &amp;#x200B; **topics that were different** 1. types of constraints 2. ER Diagrams were a little more complex 3. Normalization was tougher 4. ALTER Command 5. indexing candidates 6. Joins was more in depth 7. Indexing and Query Optimization 8. Deleting indexes or parts of them I scored an 88 on the pre-assessment, then went through the labs till i could do them with out notes. And i got a 90% on the final. I guarantee a couple guess were needed, but if you can get a 90 with out confusion on the Pre-assessment you will pass just fine. &amp;#x200B; **Small Lab Exam Notes** As for the OA 11 Question DPA1... This was near IDENTICAL to the LABS, there were a few differences, and one question i could get the info with 4 words, but since the exam said to do it a certain way, i did it that way. I passed with a 100%. As others have said, know the labs, pass the test. Please also note that if your EXECUTE doesn't work, then you messed something up. So at least there's instant feedback if you got that question right. Also a few times going to a different question i got The ""Session is over"" message, and in the labs, if this popped up, it would close my window after a few seconds, but if you hit next, and previous when you see this, you will eventually clear the error out. DO NOT LET THIS MESSAGE HANG AROUND... Finally i don't know if it's true, but others noted that if you go to a question, and don't RE-EXECUTE IT, it will count as a fail, so i was sure to execute it. And the ER Diagram type questions don't have a submit/execute button. So they were the most nerve racking. Just FYI, the test tells you on some questions what commands to use, there are variants, and you have to know where it's wrong, like it might say the TYPE of field, but not the ACTUAL name. So read everything. Some questions literally give you the answer, you just have to type out all the field names it wants etc..."

I have an AS in IT from a community college and a BS in IT from WGU. I am trying to choose between the MS in Cybersecurity, MS in IT Management and the MBA in IT Management. Initially I thought I wanted the Cybersecurity degree, but I'm not crazy about the Ethical Hacking certificates. I feel like there are better certs out there at this level, but the prerequisites are likely the reason why they aren't an option for the degree program. I also believe that with the certs this is the most time consuming option for me and that would make it the most expensive. I am wary of the MBA because someone in my associates program had an MBA and returned to school for an AS in IT. This made me feel like the MBA was not worthwhile, but I would like to hear from anyone who has an MBA from WGU. Was it worthwhile for you? That leaves me with the MS in IT Management. I am now leaning towards this program. I currently work for the government and supervise 20 employees. I feel like this may be the next logical step for me, but I am having trouble seeing the difference between this degree and the MBA.

A little background about myself. I currently have an Associates degree in IT, as well as a year of IT experience in a support analyst role. &amp;#x200B; I've read up on how the higher tier certs of CyberSecurity aren't as well known in the industry, as well as needing a certain amount of experience for the CCSP that I won't have come graduation. As well as reading that if I come out of this program I may lack in networking knowledge that I could really use.. &amp;#x200B; On the flip side of things, the Net Ops degree will no doubt give me plenty of networking knowledge, but I feel it will be drastically less on the security side of things. This to the point of wondering how marketable I would be in terms of a degree/certs/knowledge once finished in regards to (hopefully) getting straight into security, rather than potentially taking a networking job first and then transitioning to security. The other concern I had was I've heard this degree can take drastically longer to complete than the CyberSecurity one, is this true? Or worth the extra time? I'm looking to push myself through my bachelors pretty quickly if I'm honest.

I decided to do a job search for the area we will live in and Software Development jobs are not in high demand in that area but Cybersecurity jobs are plentiful. &amp;#x200B; I guess my question is, is it crazy for me to jump into a cybersecurity degree with next to no experience in I.T. just like it was crazy for me to go ""I never had Calculus but I can figure it out"" and then jump into a CS degree?

Basically, I'm looking for opinions from people who have been through a program update or change for their degree that had the option of sticking with a new one or staying with the old one -- what their experiences were with switching, program completion, or why they made the choice that they did. An example of the situation I'm thinking of would be when the MS Information Security &amp; Assurance changed to the MS Cybersecurity &amp; Information Assurance -- the two programs were fairly different. I'm mostly wondering what things people weighed when making the decision, and what their experiences were if they did switch. I went through similar things with the brick &amp; mortar undergrad degree I earned, and taking even a semester off put you on the new degree plan, often to your detriment. I was hoping the experience with WGU was better/different, and thought I should ask while I'm still planning all of this out. :)"

Also, some advice if you please... I'm 35+ years old, and have been messing around with computers since I was 10 years old (Commodore-64!) I know enough about computers to get in trouble. I've built around 30 computers (a lot easier these days than it used to be) and have setup perhaps a dozen home networks (again, easy beginners stuff.) I've installed all kinds of operating systems; anything from DOS/Win 3.1/Slackware Linux (back in the 90's) to Windows 10. I took a few CISCO classes about 20 years ago, but never got a job working with the equipment so I've forgotten most of it. I've always been good with computers, and I understand how Bitcoin works (lol!) but I admit that I've been out of the game for a while. I'm the guy that fixes all the techie stuff in the family, but the last actual tech job I had was in high school working at CompUSA in the back. Back then I was A+ certified (which was the bare minimum requirement.) I'm not married, no kids, and I have about 3-4 hours I can dedicate to homework every night. I have access to CBT Nuggets, and whatever textbooks I need. I believe my job will pay for my education, as long as I have proof I passed my classes. I might even quit my job if this looks like a good opportunity. Do you think I could start a Bachelors of Science in Information Technology, Network Operations and Security, or Cybersecurity and Information Assurance? I do not have access or exposure to the actual hardware, and would have zero hands-on experience with the physical components (although I suppose build a ""Cisco Lab Environment"" depending on the cost?)

They require me to get a certification to get accepted (A+) I started studying for it but the whole program seems not that easy to complete and I am a bit worried if I will be able to do it on time (I am a little pressed to complete it asap) I know people who work in Cyber security and some of them told me that their degrees are in Computer science or Informational technology.. etc and later they just got certified in Security + and got the jobs they wanted. I have been looking at the classes in Business IT management (which doesnt require a cert to get into meaning I can start asap) and they seem easier to pass and I have a few college credits from before that can be transferred. Im an overthinker and I know the second option would be way faster and easier (also cheaper) to complete but I still wonder if employers will accept it along with the security + for an entry level job. I dont want to take the wrong path but on the other side I havent met anyone who works in cyber security and has a security degree... The people I know all got certified after completing a different program. So basically I need some advice and personal opinions that would help me overthink more before I take a decision. P.S. I know there are other IT programs in WGU. I consider the Business IT management because the Business college has no requirements of experience or certification to get accepted.

I would do every single SL course I can for maximum transfer-ability in to WGU. &amp;#x200B; Also I'd like to complete this in 1 year (a max of 2 terms at WGU) for the cost savings and the challenge of it all.

I have a bachelors in Communication and I currently work in account management, but I don't like the high turnover rate in the field, along with not being a specialist in anything (I am a ""generalist.""). At the time when I got my degree I wasn't wise enough to really think about my future as I am now after working a few years out of school. I had an internship in digital marketing which introduced me to tech, and right now I work in healthcare tech and from the combination of the two jobs/industry I'm having a change of heart and I think a fresh start would be best for me. I am starting out pretty fresh and I would like advice in choosing a major. I am certain I want to go to WGU because it is affordable, online, and I don't have to take a ""break"" in my career and cut my paycheck/hours to go back to school and physically commute to classes(I live in a high-commute region). &amp;#x200B; Programs I am looking into: Health Information Management: This degree attracts me because I worked in healthcare for 4+ years on the clinical and business side, so I have a advantage of knowing the industry already. Plus, i've taken many of the classes required for the degree too. It also combines tech and healthcare, which is secure in terms of finding a job. It would most certainly be the ""easiest."" &amp;#x200B; Software Development: I like this option because I know HTML and CSS already, and this really allows me to be creative and a problem solver. The job opportunities and projects are lucrative right now in it. I am worried though on its competition, but it is definitely an option that I can strengthen some of my current technical skills and experiences. &amp;#x200B; Computer Science: From what I am seeing, it is the ""gold standard"" of any IT/Software Development job. It provides a broad and comprehensive education for anyone looking to go into computer technology and allows you to explore some options in tech. I am concerned though that it could possibly be too broad because it can mean you want to do anything from AI, Cybersecurity, to Software Engineering. I have always been good at math so thats not the biggest issue, I just haven't taken Calculus in at least 5 years. Hah. This would take longer for me to complete because I have not taken as many of the classes required for the program. &amp;#x200B; Advice would be greatly appreciated. "

Currently, I am a at the director level and have built two small security ops/compliance teams for two separate companies. **Certifications(some expired):** GIAC GPEN, GIAC GCIH, Security+, Network+, CISSP, CCNA, MCSA, and several other vendor certs (Fortient, Tenable, Aruba, etc..) **Future:** Option #1: BS in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance This will allow me to earn several more certifications to add to what I currently have including two from ISC. I see this as a potential path to earning my Masters and opportunity for teaching. Option #2: BS in Network Operations and Security This would allow me to re-visit much of the networking architecture that I've lost over the past 5 years and potentially open up opportunities for network engineering/firewall engineering. I've always enjoyed firewall engineering. Option #3: BS in Software Development I've done some penetration testing in the past, but haven't really dug into software development. This path would strengthen a weak area for me and open some doors for penetration testing (especially if I also get my OSCP). &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

You take one, get the certification and are awarded both (if you apply for it). * CCENT is on there for completion's sake, but once you complete your CCNA it goes away. It's one half of the CCNA certification process. * Just because a degree gives you *more* certifications does not mean that the degree is *worth* more. In my personal opinion - * Cybersecurity, Cloud, and Networking offer the best (most valuable and useful) certifications out of all the programs. CCSP/SSCP, Amazon AWS, and CCNA are all *extremely* valuable and useful in their respective plans. I think the reason these are so good compared to the other programs is mostly because ISC(2), Microsoft/Amazon, and Cisco have completely dominated their respective areas, so their certs are worth that much more. * Just because these are the most valuable programs doesn't mean that everyone should go for them. If neither Networking, Cloud, nor Security float your boat then don't torture yourself by going through these programs. * The uselessness of CompTIA, CIW, and EC-Council certifications cannot be overstated. They're there because they're cheap and convenient ways to ""add value"" to the plan while still checking your understanding of the material. CompTIA Linux+ and Security+ are the only exceptions. HR may think they're fancy, but no employer will care. * The **Computer Science** degree is the more traditional Comp Sci offering by WGU, while the **Software Development** degree is more IT with a focus on Comp Sci. To be quite honest, I'm not sure the WGU educational process is sufficient for computer science overall, but there you go. "

Pen testing and cyber security stuff sounds very interesting to me as does robotics but I'm open to more than just that. I am having a hard time deciding if I should stick with the Computer Science degree or switch to the CSIA degree. From what I've seen, employers typically value a Comp Sci degree more than the other more specialized IT degrees. On the other hand, there seems to be really good value in the CSIA program due to getting all of the certifications included in the curriculum and I would have a tiny head start since I have my A+ already. I'd love to hear any opinions on pros and cons for choosing one or the other to see if there is something I may have missed in my own searches or maybe get insight from someone that went through a similar decision.

I am trying to figure out what to do next in terms of education and/or certifications. Right now, I have the Amazon AWS SysOps Administrator - Associate (a mouthful, I know) exam for C924, and then the three courses left that culminates with earning MCSA: Server 2012 certification, after which I will be graduating. My goal is to finish this entirely within my first term, which ends in October, so after that I am unsure about how to proceed. I thought I would ask for input from the community to see what your thoughts are. Here are my thoughts thus far... I am considering going back to WGU to do their CyberSecurity &amp; Information Assurance Master's Degree. I hesitate because it is quite a bit more work than the Bachelor's, and by comparison, involves much more in the way of writing essays/proposals. I am just having a hard time convincing myself that this would be worth it, especially since I am more interested in server and cloud administration than the security side (which does interest me, but not entirely sure I would want to do it as a career path). Another option, and one my program mentor suggested, was to do some additional certifications post-degree and broaden my options in the IT environment. I was already determined to do an additional Microsoft cert to upgrade my MCSA to MCSE, but beyond that was not really sure. My mentor suggested CCNA, but I really find networking painful and do not enjoy it at all... So what are you plans after graduation, in terms of furthering your education and/or additional certifications?"

From one side, the remaining classes (A+ and a bunch of other easy-medium certs) will allow me to complete the degree a bit faster, but on the other, the prestige of CCNA and CCNA Security obtained on another degree would allow me to learn a lot more skills that I desire to possess: Linux, firewalls, advanced networking skills, etc. I could, of course, just obtain these certs on my own, while fast-tracking the degree which I am currently pursuing.

My Undergrad was BS Cybersecurity and my Masters will also be in the Cyber program so this is pretty good apples to apples comparison I did 93 credits in Undergrad of which required papers and had approximately 31 artifacts in task stream. Of these a couple were one page source lists, 2 graphics and 2 powerpoint, which I am not counting because I don't feel like it Including my Undergrad Capstone there were 210 pages written and approximately 44,000 words across 29 credit hours worth of classes that required a paper out of the 93 totals. This means an average of 7.25 pages / 1500 pages per credit hours For the Graduate Work, (not including my capstone) I have written 270 pages and approximately 54,000 words. I expect my capstone to be arounds 100 pages at an average of 200 words per pages, so that will put it around 20,000 words. knowing there were 18 credit hours that required writing, that brings average of 20 pages /4000 words per credit hour for the Graduate work TL;DR Graduate classes took almost 3 times as much writing per credit hour and more then twice as many words per credit. This is only my experience, but it may help someone in knowing what to expect for their Masters Degree."

As a 19 year old female, it is unknown when exactly these issues will be fixed, and my age creates and will create an experience barrier and a difficulty in securing certain types of funds even after graduation. However, I would very much like to apply to WGU, but I need to know whether what I wish to do can be accomplished if I graduate from WGU instead of a brick-and-mortar school. Basically, if I were to graduate from WGU, **how would I find WGU Alumni/faculty and contact them to see if they're interested in collaborating or at least helping in any way they know how, such as referring me to others or spreading the word to friends?** This Reddit forum exists, but I'm betting that many more WGU alumni exist and aren't active on Reddit. A summary and description of the reasons I'd like to contact such persons is given below. Also, please pardon any typos or grammatical/syntax errors. Currently, I am experiencing one of my current health issues that creates fatigue unless treated with steroids to suppress systemic inflammation, and I have no more steroids to take right now. :) Summary: I've spent much of my time since 8th grade looking at and developing various business ideas that would be hard to begin as a one-person startup after graduation. As such, I would like to gather many students and alumni to collaborate together to generate the best ideas and use specialized skills to quantify how those ideas would impact certain segments of society and the economy. As a startup, there would not be enough money to give everyone a standard salary and benefits straight off the bat, but once the business is established, if all goes well, it should be much easier to generate enough income to employ more persons or allow them to make their own money, compared to traditional businesses. The ideas I have are supposed to lower costs of both average, wealthy, and low-income Americans, so I'm hoping to find WGU alumni who would be interested in making the world a better place to volunteer their time (even if it's only five minutes) like many coders do for open-source projects, StackExchange, Quora, and other knowledge-sharing sites since they will benefit from the result as well (For example: 1) lower consumer healthcare costs as if the U.S. had a national health system, with no deductibles/premiums, that doesn't exclude pre-existing conditions but manages to improve physicians' quality of life, remove hectic work schedules and stabilizes their hours, removes the fee-for-service plans that are demoralizing both patients and physicians and turning into focusing on patient outcomes and physician satisfaction/health. Also 2) an idea that ultimately, if executed properly, would result in virtually no student debt while reducing costs for a variety of services provided by professionals for their time, such as coders, music lessons, CPA accounting services, and so on, while employing traditionally-hard-to-employ graduates of certain majors like English, History, Art, and so on. Through this method, freelancers and authors/artists/musicians would be able to bypass their traditional struggles and gain access to large corporate benefits, retirement packages, sick funds/paid sick leave, and so on while being able to start freelancing after graduation by getting mentors free-of-cost, which isn't really available currently, since people prefer to charge an arm-and-a-leg for non-accredited coding schools and at least $60/hr, if not more, mentors.) ***I'd need to explain how the above could help them if they helped me, but I'd also need help to begin with in order to generate enough financial information to allow persons to make an informed choice about whether to participate in collaborating for a startup.*** Also, I dislike the idea of traditional corporations. As someone with illnesses myself, who dislikes the idea of corporations focusing on profit and tacking on social responsibility as an afterthought, I'd like the businesses to not be all that hierarchical, but instead, focused on employing and providing products/services to persons with disabilities, single parents, victims of domestic violence and other forms of trauma, and so on. These people often find it hard to predict their work schedules and may often be sick or have to leave a lot. Sometimes they may not be able to pursue specific projects that standard/regular companies would force them to take (such as being in accounting but getting sick and not being able to perform accounting for a few days, but they can pursue other projects that they wish to or can do better. Or a boss who says ""Do it because I said so, or else you're fired."") I've found ways around those problems that, at least for me, as someone who's gone through all of the above (disabilities, many different kinds of trauma, and certain types of abuse), except being a single parent or a parent at all, would allow me to succeed in the workforce and improve my quality of life. I think it should be commonplace, and my structure would make it easier to cross-train employees when one is off sick while keeping workloads/hours manageable and providing fall-back skills for persons with various issues or those who want to change careers within the parent company. ***Given that no company current has this structure at a large scale, obtaining advice from those with experience, both legal and managerial, would be incredibly useful.*** 1) I have multiple business ideas that I wound like to work on, but I lack expertise in some necessary fields. For example, I've been diagnosed with a variety of physical illnesses that require me to see a variety of specialists. Throughout the years, I've been asking my doctors and treatment team about various ideas I've had over the years to improve or fix the U.S. healthcare system, cost of drugs, cost of treating sick people like me. I've used the feedback they've given me, along with my various diagnoses' support groups, and patient feedback plus my own experience dealing with the medical system to fine-tune this particular business plan. I will hopefully be getting EU citizenship soon to experience and study various EU country's healthcare models, and ultimately have decided it would be easier to just begin a national or multinational insurance company to serve the U.S. and convince employers and consumers to switch the my insurance provider in order to fix our medical system rather than to do the same amount of work necessary for starting the business and then convince Congress, their lobbyists like the pharmaceutical industry and device manufacturers, and stakeholders like doctors and patients that the CBO report is accurate and will benefit the country. Although I have the plan, I'd people with the following types of education and contacts within their industry: \-Analysts, finance and economics majors, insurance actuaries, and other persons who can forecast budgets and estimate the impact of different financial decisions for healthcare decisions. Examples: Health Analysts, financial modelers. \-Persons with experience in healthcare management (like WGU's MBA in Healthcare Management) and nurses who can interpret, provide feedback etc. on what the above group determines and collaborate to help fix major problems on the doctor's side as well as the patients' side (like pre-existing conditions), as well as getting input from hospitals and large practices about issues their facing, and once everything gets done, the plan is made, the business is funded with stop gap insurance and what not, ***I do not have the experience or the expertise to run an insurance company or establish the required financial information and estimates as to the number of claims and their costs, but I'm guessing someone from WGU either has the experience and expertise so I can appoint them as the CEO or knows someone through their professional contacts who does and would be interested in such a startup.*** 2) I have more ideas complementary to healthcare that involve telemedicine, tele-education (like WGU), and other digital services mixed with in-person services and would like to collaborate both with WGU faculty themselves after graduation and the education majors, particularly curriculum designers, and a digital platform would require taking cybersecurity seriously and I am unsure of whether or not using the cloud or an offline structure would be best, but either way, software developers and cloud administrators and DBAs would all eventually be necessary, and those who understand computer algorithms would need to work with the other IT/CS staff and the education majors to complete the job. Afterwards, those with non-WGU degree or knowledge would also be needed after the business is established and has steady revenue and needs to expand to certain markets (logistics and supply chain management plus retail knowledge would be required). ***Requirements are explained in the preceding paragraph.*** Thank you."

I won't be enrolling immediately, but I will enroll at Saylor.org to earn around (25?) transferable credits from 7 exams for $20 each and then $25 to get the transcripts for a total of $165 while also hopefully getting my Comptia A+ cert using a voucher (apparently need a .edu account to get it though) for $97 and study material for $49.50 and using Straighterline to take English comp 1&amp;2 and using another voucher to save $50 on my first month totaling to $148. If I can do all this before the end of 2018 I will be able to knock out at least 39 competency units along with being able to apply to a higher paying IT job after my move out of state and having the requirements to apply. I will be saving my money until then. I hope that this can crunch 1 semester's worth of tuition and put a decent dent into the rest of my workload of 122 credits for the course. I don't know what scholarships/grants I could apply for at this time. I am hoping that I can work in an IT capacity for either UPS or Verizon, (they both offer tuition reimbursement, UPS @ $5,252 per year and Verizon @ up to $8000 per year.) I want to graduate with 0 student loan debt and I was wondering if this is a good enough plan or if there are other programs or credits that I could earn before applying to WGU that would allow me to more easily get my degree in only 1 year with $6,380 in tuition (plus $459.50 prior to applying to wgu to get CUs). Is the first phase of taking that many courses(7~8) at Saylor.org, taking my CompTIA A+ certification and using Straighterline feasible in 6 months or less? I saw a wide range of salaries for Cybersecurity degrees which I know accounts for experience and raises, what can I expect coming out of WGU? Thanks for reading this long-winded post and for commenting any advice that would help. I have enough saved up to take phase 1. I just want some feedback to see if it is possible."

On Monday my student mentor began the graduation talks with me and after 3 terms, I can finally say, it's over! That being said, I know a lot of people are asking questions about this program so here is my two cents &amp; feedback. To WGU staffers, if you happen to feel this is too negative, I am sorry. I only ask that you use my feedback in the event you remove this post. I am posting this not as a gripe or complaint, but as helpful feedback. I promise not to include any names. This post isn't going to help me as I likely won't be a student at WGU again. I have been working IT since 2000 and specifically with penetration testing on the architecture exploitation side of the house for 10 years. I've worked in every domain of CISSP since at least 2005 or earlier. I completed a bachelors in 2005 (EE from Maryland). I hold about 12 current IT certifications and have let probably every bit of 20 expire since I don't need them (Security+, Net+, CCNA, CCNA Wireless, CCNA Security, JavaRE, GSEC, MSE, LPIC-1, LPIC-2, etc.) I enjoyed my time with WGU and I am happy I completed this program. This was the only masters program for me due to my very heavy work and travel schedule making a normal college impossible. I am on the road for over 200 days a year and many nights are in hotels with very poor wifi or no internet connectivity at all. I could not attend a college that required multiple nights of mandatory webinars or sessions. I also do not have the time to hang out on student forums, write X-number of posts on topics each week, respond to X-number of other students posts, and respond to the professors comments on your posts. I absolutely refuse to take part in a group project through an online based college where the entire group shares the final grade regardless of input or effort on the said project. UMUC, I'm looking at you!!! I worked on a project with 5 people and 4 of them stopped helping after week 1. The professor more or less forced me to do it by myself if I wanted a good grade. How much time did I spend? - Not once did I ever spend more than 10 hours a week on WGU homework. I finished my entire capstone, prospectus, written project, and presentation w/ video in two weeks start to finish. This is a slight smack in my own face because this means I could have finished sooner had I spent more time each week. As previously stated, I have 18 years experience in IT and have held CISSP for nearly 10 years. The vast majority of this was a review for me. Your time and effort will likely vary. Pros: - CEH and CHFI are worthwhile certifications. I hold higher, more difficult certifications, and my employer still wants me to maintain CEH because that's what his clients know. I hold GXPN, GLEG, and GSLC and I am taking GSE later this year in Vegas. GSE is considered by many to be the most difficult IT certification. I'm personally nervous as hell and think I'll fail the hands-on part of it on my first try or two. If I tell a client we are working on vulnerability assessments for that I hold GXPN most times they wonder what it is. I have even had a fellow IT person ask ""is that as good as CEH?"" even though CEH is leaps and bounds easier. That goes to show you how well CEH is known outside. - This program puts you well over halfway on the material covered under CISSP. I recommend you don't stop here but you keep going for CISSP, even if you must settle with the Associate level until you meet experience requirements. - My student mentors: I had 3 of them due to no fault of my own, that I know of! I was told one retired and one quit though neither of them said anything about it. My third SM did OK and he left me alone most weeks unless I asked for help. Cons: - Feedback on tasks, even passing items, was very poor. My student mentor could not understand the feedback sometimes because they would copy and paste ""does not meet requirements"" over and over. During one course, the course mentor reviewed my work, said it was great, and it still got returned. I set up a meeting with the course mentor, he talked things over with me and confirmed he could clearly see the rubric requirements they said did not meet requirements. He manually marked my task as completed within minutes of me resubmitting it. This has me wondering how many students this has impacted. How many students are spending hours, with no feedback, no help, but have actually passed the task? - Some of the course mentors in the Course Chatter are blatantly rude. If WGU is going to use this course chatter system, WGU staff should be responding in a helpful manner (and timely) not saying ""you didn't read your directions did you?"" as a response. - A few courses used very old material. I'm talking 20+ years old material. I recalled one of the task scenarios when I was in high school back in the late 90's. I pointed it out to the course mentor and she said she was unable to update the course materials due to internal issues. WGU should be updating their course materials periodically to ensure they are somewhat current (less than 10 years old would be a start). We should not ever have to explain why a bank running Windows 98 SP1 is a problem. - Some course tasks were unable to be completed if you used the most current references (NIST, ISO, etc.) I don't remember which exact course or reference as it has been a year or so. I think it might have been TFT2 or VLT2. The task required you to have a reference that was removed when the ISO or NIST reference was updated. The version of the task required you to use was over 10 years outdated (meaning it was updated over 10 years ago). I struggled on this task because we own the most up to date references through our license at work so I used them. It wasn't until I struggled with it for two weeks and got the task returned 3 times with a ""does not meet requirements"" canned response, that I reached out to the course mentor. She responded, ""go to this page, this reference number"" and when I told her it was not there that was when we figured out you had to use the ~2002 reference for an ISO/NIST. Recommendations for future or current students: - They aren't overly strict with APA or MLA styles. You can probably tell by my writing style here that I am far from perfect. Make it easy to understand with a clean layout. My references were not correct to APA standards most times but not once did they get returned. The only citations I used were (name, date) at the end of the line and made an input on the references page for it. Every reference all the way through the program was a web-based reference too. - Write your tasks to the rubric and only to the rubric. Do not include anything else or it might confuse the graders. Make clear and easy to see navigation tabs in MS Word which point to Rubric requirements. If it happens to be a heading, mark that heading as, for example: ""Justification (A2)"" where A2 was the rubric item number. I found if you don't leave the graders looking for your topic and you quite literally spell it out, you'll do well. In my normal college classes, this would have got my papers marked down because they did not transition well. - I highly recommend you use Grammarly and if you have the funds, pay for Grammarly Premium. All risk management tasks and both Capstone tasks made it through on the first try using Grammarly."

As much as I like the idea of getting exposure to a little bit of everything through the BSIT degree path (as well as its less demanding cert requirements), I'm concerned that it would be viewed by recruiters and hiring managers as a generic degree and may not be taken seriously when compared to a CIS, Cybersecurity, Computer Science degree, etc. What are your thoughts on this? Do these managers typically distinguish between different degree majors or is it more of a check-the-box degree requirement to make it through the HR filter while they're reviewing potential candidates?"

I tried to get into WGU for years before getting a good Enrollment Counselor. I was instructed to get a CompTIA A+ cert to get into WGU. I studied and studied. I used the ExamCram book to work from. I read that it was best to do both tests one right after another. Well it didnt go well. I failed the first test and then I had to muddle through the second test, failing that one too. To say I was disheartened is an understatement. After this disappointment my EC recommended I try the Network+ since it was only one test Well this was met with the same results. Barely failed it. After this I gave up on IT. I got into a different program at a different University. I know someone who works for WGU and they had worked with many different ECs in their job and highly recommended that I request a particular EC and just hear her out. She recommended I work on the MTA Networking Fundamentals cert. She explained it was not as in-depth as Network +, and she sent me a list of free resources. I spent about 3 weeks studying and found I could take the test with a free retake for $58. Bonus! I had purchased a book to study from, but I also used ITPROTVs series available on Amazon. I passed!! From there things moved very quickly to get me in on the next start date. I started in the Security program and then moved into Cybersecurity a few months later. The reason I say all this is I have seen quite a few posts of ECs saying you have to get CompTIA certs to get into WGU. I want all of you to know there is an easier way. I think the ECs use this as a weeding out process for prospective students. Ive now completed A+ and am working on Net+, I will test the beginning of the year. The resources I have now have made all the difference. According to my EC as of Oct WGU will accept MTA Software Development Fundamentals, MTA Database Admin Fundamentals, MTA HTML5 Development Fundamentals, and MTA Networking Fundamentals. If youre EC only tells you about CompTIA certs know there are other options. "
438,cybersecurity,WGU,What happens if you don't complete a course but change majors?,3,784ewp,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/784ewp/what_happens_if_you_dont_complete_a_course_but/,2017-10-23 12:16:02,"Hi everybody, I was wondering if anybody has been in a similar situation: I'm currently in the (soon to be retired) BS IT Security degree plan, but planning to change to BS Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at the beginning of my next term (December 1st). The only course I have left for this term is C246 -- the Cisco ICND1 course. As I'm approaching the end of my term, I feel increasingly that I'm not going to be able to pass this exam. The material is tough, and I haven't devoted enough time to it. I would need to schedule my first attempt for next week and a likely necessary second attempt by the end of November, but I'm nowhere near ready. My job (I'm in IT for a retail company) has been extremely demanding for the last few months. I've often ended up working weekends and sometimes overnight, which obviously cuts into my study time. I'm on call at work this week and again right at the end of November. These weeks will be very disruptive to my studying. On a personal level, I'm just not as excited by this material as I once was. When I'm studying I feel as if I'm just going through the motions. It just doesn't ""stick"" the way a lot of the other courses did. The only other course I've felt this way about was the mind-numbing Project+ one. The difference is that Project+ is easy... The Cisco certs are not. And that brings me to my primary problem, and why I'm changing majors -- the Cisco certifications (CCNA R&amp;S and Security) just aren't relevant to my career anymore. I entered into the BS IT Security degree plan early last year, and have made a lot of progress, but a lot has changed since I started. My current job primarily deals with application security, and I don't have much desire or hope to enter the networking field. The material covered in the BS CS&amp;IA courses matches up much more closely with the stuff I do on a daily basis. In fact, switching from IT Security to CS&amp;IA will almost double the number of CUs I need to finish, but to me it's worth it to have more relevant courses and not have to slog through the Cisco stuff. So, that said, what would happen if I do fail the ICND1? I realize this is a worst-case, and I'm not actively planning to fail, but it's a definite possibility at this point. I am anticipating having to take a second attempt, but that will put me right at the end of my term, without a lot of additional time to study or follow the CM's suggested second attempt plan. Will having C246 incomplete preclude me from changing majors? Will I be placed on academic probation? I wish my courses hadn't aligned this way. By the time the new CS&amp;IA degree was announced, the only courses I had left in my current plan were the Cisco courses, the second half of Linux+, and the technical writing and capstone courses, none of which will transfer. I thought about sticking it out in Security, but the CCNA certifications would be a boondoggle for me. Thank you for reading! For me, it's back to ICND1 practice exams."

I finished my other courses in 6 months but I definitely bit off more than I can chew with my Capstone. My final paper was 96 pages and after reading it, I realized I probably could have easily added about 20 more pages. I chose to write about creation and implementation of a vulnerability management program. The topic alone seemed pretty great, but the fictional company I wrote about never had one before, so I went into great detail of the technical path to perform a vulnerability assessment as a baseline. For those of you who are almost done, keep going! You are almost there. For those of you who are thinking of starting? Do it!

Which would you pursue if you were interested in a cybersec/infosec career and why? &amp;nbsp; **BS CSIA Certs** *A+ (CompTIA) - Shared across both programs *Network+ (CompTIA) - Shared across both programs *Security+ (CompTIA) - Shared across both programs *Project+ (CompTIA) - Shared across both programs *ITIL Foundation - Shared across both programs *Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP)  Associate of (ISC) designation *Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP)  Associate of (ISC) designation *Certified Encryption Specialist (EC-Council ECES) *Certified Incident Handler (EC-Council ECIH) *Certified Internet Webmaster  Site Development Associate (CIW-SDA) *Certified Internet Webmaster  Web Security Associate (CIW-WSA) **My Opinion** All of the certs shared across both programs are good. They're entry level, but provide a decent foundational understanding to build upon. With the exception of Project+, I actually see the A+/Net+/Sec+ and ITIL Foundation certs being required or preferred on job postings. ISC2 is more respected than EC-Council from what I can tell. However, the SSCP and CCSP aren't really asked for on job postings. They also require experience or else you're just an Associate, which doesn't mean much. The CISSP is great and renowned, but you require at least 4 years of full time infosec experience. It makes sense this cert wasn't included. EC-Council's CEH is definitely sought after at least by HR, but a lot of folks seems to think they're a crappy organization. CEH is also not included in this program. It is however, included in the MS program. ECES and ECIH aren't exactly sought after in the job market either. CIW certs. TWO of them! Maybe WGU got a great deal or something. &amp;nbsp; **BS NOS Certs** *A+ (CompTIA) - Shared across both programs *Network+ (CompTIA) - Shared across both programs *Security+ (CompTIA) - Shared across both programs *Project+ (CompTIA) - Shared across both programs *ITIL Foundation Certification (Axelos) - Shared across both programs *Cloud Essentials (CompTIA) *Linux Essentials (LPI) *Certified Internet WebmasterSite Development Associate (CIW-SDA) *Cisco Certified Network Associate (Cisco) *Cisco Certified Network Associate  Security (Cisco) *Cisco Certified Design Associate (Cisco) **My Opinion** All of the certs shared across both programs are good. They're entry level, but provide a decent foundational understanding to build upon. With the exception of Project+, I actually see the A+/Net+/Sec+ and ITIL Foundation certs being required or preferred on job postings. Cloud and Linux knowledge are nice to have. Linux+/LPIC1 might have been too far down the rabbit hole into Linux sysadmin tier? Not sure. CIW? Jesus christ. At least there's only one of those. CCNA R&amp;S? Great! You'll know networking for sure. Wait, there's more? CCNA Security, okay! There's **ANOTHER** one you say? CCDA! Sure, I guess. Cisco must have gave WGU a pretty good deal. &amp;nbsp; **NOTE:**I know that the knowledge you gain by studying for and passing these certs is important as well. However, this is someone's time and money being spent to earn the certs and degrees. Some of these certs are definitely more marketable than others, but the know-how is important as well. I'm not just basing my opinion on a purely financial standpoint."

Not discounting myself at all, but one of the major reasons I've made to where I am is due to an ""in"" I had with my current employer (they were a client of mine at a consulting company I worked for so I had a huge hand in shaping their IT landscape). They knew me, I knew them, etc. My concern is that I can see myself getting stuck here, or worse I can see myself having a hard time getting the same or better pay should I ever have to seek another opportunity. I've enjoyed the management side of things honestly and the WGU program looks to be in-line with where I want to go (director, CIO, VP of IT, etc.).

I want to thank everyone for their contributions, they were invaluable to me. Completing in one term would not have been possible without the information here. I will be staring the MS Cybersecurity July 1st and wanted to share my success and experience before getting started with the new classes. I started this program with no prior knowledge of the IT industry, aside from the A+ certification that I completed in order to be admitted to the school. I am in my mid twenties and have always worked in the banking industry. I have always been interested in getting into the field of cybersecurity. Having the interest and passion for what I was learning in this BS program was the biggest factor in avoiding burnout, because believe me their were days I wanted to shut down and take a few weeks off(linux classes come to mind here).. below is a breakdown on each of my classes, how long they took to complete and any other information I think might be helpful. Intro to IT -2 days after having completed the A+ I had a pretty good understanding of the basics here Intermediate Algebra - 4 days. This one wasn't bad. I hadn't taken a math class since high school so I had to brush up on things but most concepts I found simple. Introduction to Geography - 1 week. This class had a lot of information you needed to know. Having traveled a fair amount I was familiar with the basics but the the pre assessment made it clear I would need a deeper understanding of the specifics. The pre assessment was also a great way of knowing I was ready for the final assessment. Elements of Effective Communication - 2 days. I don't remember much from this, it was a straight forward easy class. I believe I gave a recorded video presentation for the final assessment. English Comp 1&amp;2 - 10 days to complete both. I think I wrote a total of 5 essays. Not much fun but not difficult. Follow the rubrics exactly and stick it out you can get through quick. Web Development Fundamentals 1 week. This class was interesting and I enjoyed the project. Pretty simple stuff I had taken a basic HTML class when I was in JR. high so I remembered the basics. Critical Thinking and Logic - 1 day. I cant remember any specifics. The class was an easy one to get through. College Algebra - 5 days. This one wasn't easy but I was determined to get through. Lots of new material I hadn't seen in high school math or had forgotten. after 4 days studying I did alright on the pretest and just lightly studied the last section. I remember that last section being much more difficult and I would have needed to commit several more days to master it. Integrated Natural Science -4 days. Interesting material I enjoyed this class and didn't find it very difficult. Introduction to Probability and Statistics -4 days. Most of the concepts were easy to understand and intuitive. The vocabulary was important here. Network and Security Foundation -10 days. I probably spent more time here than I needed to. I knew I would be working on the network+ after this and wanted to make sure I had a solid understanding. Lots of new material for me but I found it very interesting and easy to stay engaged. Networks(Network+) -7 days. I believe this was my third comptia test so I had a good idea of what to expect. The Network foundations class gave me a good idea of what I needed here. I believe I used Prof Messer Videos and lots of practice testing with Ucertify had me well prepared. Project Management(Project+) -10 days. I used only Ucertify for this class. Meterial was very dry and hard to stay engaged with. Not particularly hard but very dry.(I started watching Dexter while studying for this one.. So turning that off to study wasn't easy.) Business of IT Applications -3 days. I believe this one was similar to the content in the project+ not as much to remember here as in project+ Organizational Behavior and Leadership -1 day easy common sense stuff. Principles of Management -1 same as above, common sense stuff. Introduction to Physics -4 days. I enjoyed this class and found the material interesting. The project took a good bit of time as did the timeline. Scripting and programming Foundations &amp; Applications 1 week total. These two classes I enjoyed but found difficult because I had no experience in programming. Foundations you work with and learn Python. Applications is on Java and I found Java to be tedious and hard to learn quickly. Applications I would say is in the top 5 for most difficult classes. Data Management Applications &amp; Foundations - 1 week. These classes both focus on SQL and general database systems and their functions. Foundations wasn't very difficult although I remember the ERD being difficult to understand. Applications the test wasn't to tough but certainly not easy. The project was very difficult for someone with no background in SQL but not as bad as JAVA. The recorded webinars got me through applications. Operating Systems 1 &amp; 2 (linux+) -3 weeks total. Ohhhh how I HATED these classes. I was excited to learn linux going in. The first of the Linux+ tests was the only test I didn't pass 1st try in my entire degree. These classes required pure memorization and I felt I finished with a great understanding of terms but not a lot I could really apply. Operating Systems 1 was for me the most difficult class in the entire program. Fundamentals of Interconnecting Network devices(CCENT) -10 days. This was my first Cisco class and I enjoyed it. The material was all new but I found IOS to be simple and easy to understand for the most part. Cisco tests were much more difficult than the CompTIA ones I had taken, and after having not passed my first attempt on the Linux I really studied hard for this one. I would say this was the 3rd most difficult class in the program.I used Boson to solidify what I was learning and studied with CBT Nuggets. Interconnecting Network Devices -10 days. I enjoyed this class. I found this test a little easier than the previous having just finished the CCENT, but still very difficult. Very broad focus on routing protocols.I used Boson to solidify what I was learning and studied with CBT Nugets. Designing Customized Security -10 Days. This class I would say was the second most difficult for me. I wish I could have spent more time on it as I really enjoyed the huge amount of content, but I was nearing the end of my term and preparing to leave the country so I was really cramming. I used Boson to solidify what I was learning and studied with CBT Nugets. Technical Writing and Capstone -1 week total. I literally submitted my capstone 4 hours before the end of the term while in Paris on vacation. These classes go together and technical writing becomes the core of your capstone project. I enjoyed the flexibility in being able to choose the topic. Not incredibly difficult but very time consuming. My final capstone project ended up being around 50 pages long. So I think those were all my classes and hopefully this helps someone. Please let me know if anyone has questions Id love to be able to give back. URL"

However, I am finding myself INCREDIBLY bored at my current job. During my first 2 weeks, I was able to successfully address all of the interesting tickets/issues that my team had open, and I quite literally have nothing to do at the moment. More importantly, I have found that I do not find the administration side of IT interesting at all. I initially got into IT through programming, and I took C++, Java and Python classes through my local community college. I held out hope for security though, thinking that something like pentesting (yeah, I know, I know) or blue team duties would be more technical and thus more enjoyable for me. But after reaching this point with my sys admin job, I don't think that I can handle anymore work that doesn't involve coding or CLI work at the very least.

Should I have a difficult time meeting the requirements for transfer?
480,cybersecurity,WGU,"Currently in BS - IT Security, considering switching to BS Cybersecurity. What do you guys think?",3,691d7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/691d7e/currently_in_bs_it_security_considering_switching/,2017-05-04 02:21:19,"Hey everybody, as the title says, I'm currently enrolled in the BS in IT Security degree program, but I'm looking at the guidebook for the BS in Cybersecurity and I find it very interesting. Academically, I have 40 credits remaining until my degree, most of which are the ""big"" courses -- CCNA, CCNAS, Linux+ (will be completing the first half of that certification this month), obviously the capstone, and a few others. I transferred in an associate's degree, so there are no general education courses to worry about (thank God). If I'm doing my math correctly, transferring to BS in Cybersecurity will require another 15 credits for a total of 55. That's essentially another academic term at non-accelerated pacing, but a couple of these should be fairly trivial to complete quickly. Professionally, I currently have a position as an ""Application Analyst"" with a major retail company, which is essentially an administrator position. I work closely with our IT security department and intend to transfer to one of their teams at some point in the future. Most of what I deal with on a daily basis seems to align more closely with the competencies of the BS in Cybersecurity than those of my current degree plan. That doesn't mean that I want to stick with the topics I know, and I absolutely love all of the networking material in the BS IT Security program, but it seems to me that the BS Cybersecurity represents more of what you see on the front lines. Anybody who works directly in IT security can definitely correct me if that's not an accurate assessment. There are a couple of other practical considerations. First, if I change majors at the beginning of my next term, I'll have only half of the Linux+ certification completed. I don't want to leave that hanging as I use Linux machines on a daily basis and it's a great skill to have. Second, I do want to get the CCNA. I studied for the CCENT for a few months before starting at WGU and really enjoy the material. And, as we all know, the CCNA is an eminently marketable certification. So, I think I have three choices: 1. Finish one more term of BS IT Security in order to complete the Linux+. I think it would be possible to find two or three more courses that would overlap with the requirements of the BS Cybersecurity. Then, transfer programs. This would leave me to study for the CCNA after I complete my degree. 2. Transfer to BS Cybersecurity at the beginning of my next term. If I were to switch, this would be the most efficient route in terms of CUs, but would leave me to study for Linux+ and the CCNA after I finish my degree. 3. Stick with BS IT Security. This is the most efficient route overall. I don't think any of these choices is a bad one, but at this point I'm not sure which would be the best. I'm sure there are other considerations I haven't thought of. I would greatly appreciate any input. Thank you for reading!"

Cybersecurity and Information Assurance (and ""Associate of (ISC)2"" explained).",32,63vwzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/63vwzw/why_i_wont_be_switching_to_bs_cybersecurity_and/,2017-04-07 07:17:58,"WGU released the details of the new B.S. Cybersecurity and Information Assurance program this week: URL Just a quick overview: (* = new) * A+ (CompTIA) * Network+ (CompTIA) * Security+ (CompTIA) * Project+ (CompTIA) * *ITIL Foundation * *Certified Cloud Security Professional (Associate of (ISC) CCSP) * *Systems Security Certified Practitioner (Associate of (ISC) SSCP) * *Certified Encryption Specialist (EC-Council ECES) * *Certified Incident Handler (EC-Council ECIH) * *Certified Internet Webmaster  Site Development Associate (CIW-SDA) * *Certified Internet Webmaster  Web Security Associate (CIW-WSA) ***** The first thing you'll notice is the inclusion of (ISC)2 certificates. This is a good and bad thing; I'll explain why. (ISC)2 is highly respected in the industry - one of the main reasons for that is most of their certs require verifiable employment in the security industry (covering particular domains) ranging from 1 years (SSCP) to 4 years (CISSP), respectively. What happens if you don't meet the employment requirement? Instead of the CCSP and SSCP, you are an ""Associate of (ISC)2"" - and no, not an ""Associate of (ISC)2 SSCP"" and ""Associate of (ISC)2 CCSP"", just ""Associate of (ISC)2"". It would be the same as if you took the CISSP without meeting the requirements. They are indistinguishable, and thus, worthless. This is directly taken from [(ISC)2's Certfication Policy Guidelines](URL &gt;Associates of (ISC) are NOT certified and may not use any Logo or description other than Associate of (ISC). Under no circumstances may they identify which exam they have successfully passed or use any Logo, other than Associate of (ISC), in any manner. Failure to abide by this rule may result in the candidate being prohibited from ever attaining any (ISC) certification. Being an Associate of (ISC)2 essentially means you have no certificates from them until you meet the employment requirements. Revealing which exam you've taken to become an Associate of (ISC)2 will result in banishment from (ISC)2. ***** Along with the (ISC)2 certificates, you'll see some additional EC-Council certs and a couple certs from CIW. I found these particularly underwhelming. Why might you ask? First, I'll go into the value of certificates. What determines the value of a certificate? Certainly the knowledge you gain and the relevance of that information to the field you want to go into, sure. But the ***value*** of the cert (regarding employment) is whether or not employers ask for it specifically, or even know of its existence. Go to Indeed.com and search for (ISC)2's SSCP and then their CISSP. The difference should be night and day. Putting aside the fact that the SSCP is essentially the CISSP Jr. - it seems like the SSCP doesn't even exist. It's even worse with EC-Council with their one-hit-wonder, the CEH; their other certs simply don't exist in job listings. That's what this programs lacks - that one grand slam certificate that employers are looking for. Many of the other programs have one: IT-Security has the CCNA. Network Admin has MCSA. The M.S. Cybersecurity and Information Assurance has the CEH. All of these are HIGHLY desirable. Even if you have the requirements to acquire the SSCP and CCSP and not an Associate of (ISC)2, they simply don't have the marketability as the MCSA, CCNA, and CEH. (Although the CCSP is picking up momentum, maybe this argument will be irrelevant a year from now?). ***** That being said, maybe you have no interest in configuring Cisco firewalls/routers/switches, or dealing with Windows Server, and perhaps your interests align closer with what this new program has to offer - go for it - the knowledge is more important. Just make sure you're informed moving forward - especially with the Associate of (ISC)2 shenanigans. I have several years in IT personally, and I probably cover the required domains needed for (ISC)2, but I'm sticking with the IT-Security program anyways, and eventually moving towards the M.S. Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. I think the marketability is better. Perhaps I'm too critical. What are your thoughts? Let's stimulate some discussion."

I was originally going to get into the B.S. Information TechnologySecurity degree. My reason being was that based on the certifications it seemed like a better Networking degree than the actual Networking degree due to it including the CCNA which is highly valued as an intro cert for basic networking. Whereas the B.S. in Network Administration doesn't have it. The basic IT degree seems too lacking/broad in terms of material, but would serve a good purpose for people who just need a degree for HR or require base knowledge for an entry level help desk/desktop support position. Now I see that they have released a new B.S. designed for Cybersecurity, which I assumed is even more in depth in terms of security related material. After reading what this person had to say about it URL I am not too sure anymore. I understand that Security isn't something that you can jump into right away. Most people do Networking as a career and then end up specializing in Security later on. So basically, with that all said, do you fellows think that it would be better for me to pursue the original Security degree for a stronger foundation in Networking, and later branch out on my own into the Security field? Or Do you think that the new degree is worth it despite its certifications being not as ""valuable"" in comparison?

I understand how they determine the cut score, so with C700 having a cut score of 51%, it must be a monster."

You can can also get in by holding one of the listed certifications, but I don't have any of them. However, I do have an OSCP certification. Would WGU grant me an exemption because I hold the OSCP? It is a tough exam."

514,cybersecurity,WGU,Questions from attorney looking to get BS or MS in IT-Cybersecurity,5,4a0av7,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/4a0av7/questions_from_attorney_looking_to_get_bs_or_ms/,2016-03-12 06:28:16,I am seriously considering refocusing my career path to information technology/cybersecurity/privacy. I am currently studying to take the CIPP-US certification exam. Now I have a BA (in Spanish) and a JD. I have been working as an attorney for almost 10 years. The job market for attorneys with general skills is not that great and salaries are stagnant (I have never made more than 65k/yr). Many of my friends at this point have either left the law completely or have eventually opened their own law firms. I have worked with solo attorneys and have no interest in running a law firm myself. My thoughts are I could either work in IT or go more the privacy/cybersecurity consulting route or even take the patent bar (which requires a science degree). Most people I have talked to say I'm crazy to go back to school or to refocus. But I feel like I need to be competitive in the coming years. I know it will be a challenge. But money and time is not an issue for me right now. My issue is whether or not I can learn the technical material. I didn't really focus on science or math in college. I was able to test out of the math classes from my high school AP courses. I took two generic CS classes and I think that was it as far as science. So anyway I'm looking for advice from people who are doing this program or who have made a similar career change.

I am still undecided when to start (more than likely Fall). Currently, I am studying for the CISSP exam and also the Cisco CCNP 300-207 Exam: Implementing Cisco Threat Control Solutions."

Just curious to how it's been going and how it matches up to what you expected or how it compared to your BS course (if you completed one through WGU). I completed 60 CU's in 3 terms (two months into the 3rd term, technically) and I doubt I ever spent more than 3 hours total in a week on homework or reading. I'd like to try to get this all knocked out in 2-3 terms but that's going to depend heavily on my work schedule. Been doing 50-60 hours a week lately ... Also thinking of rolling straight into either MS IT Management directly after pending how this course goes. Supposedly 3 courses get completely waived if you do. The CEH and Forensics certs look like they'll be fairly simple. I already have OSCP, OSWP, &amp; OSCE as well as GIAC's GCIH/GXPN/GCFA but never considered trying CEH due to most the field respecting GCFA and GCIH more than CEH ... and I didn't want to pay for something no one cared about! I have experience in 7 out of the 10 courses with roughly 10 years day to day experience on 5 of them. The courses look based around CISSP's domains which I finished completely self study this past summer and taking SSCP next week too before I begin the course here April 1st! Crossing my fingers but if it anything like CISSP, it's not ""hard"" but damn was it mentally exhausting ... In all, I'm looking for a fun challenge without killing me on 500 pages of reading a week! Insert the ain't nobody got time for that video here."
517,cybersecurity,WGU,Which graduate program to pursue?,3,433ifv,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/433ifv/which_graduate_program_to_pursue/,2016-01-29 01:31:50,"So I am about to graduate within the next month. I have one objective assessment (EZC1) and the capstone left and my Capstone is already written. My degree will be a B.S. in Business/IT Mgmt. I am trying to decide which graduate program I want to roll into. First a little background. I am a cybersecurity professional who has been in the field for over 15 years. I have also done time as a program manager as well with many years of overseas experience. All of my experience is in the DoD realm with little commercial experience. I am 37 years old and would like to go back into program management eventually. The options I am debating are: - M.S. in Information Security - This relates directly to my current field and would ensure me advancement within the IA community - MBA IT Mgmt - This is not solely focused on IA/Cybersecurity and would probably set me up well for being a PM within the IT or IA world in the future - MBA - Generic enough that i could go pretty much any direction within Program or Project management. I am worried this would exclude me from more technical management roles though So anyone who has been through any of these programs, please feel free to point out the good/bad and give me your thoughts"

All classes are being taken online. I currently have a 4.0 GPA. I also passed the English Composition CLEP test.

He informed me that I passed my readiness assessment. I had been contemplating completing an associates degree prior to attending WGU, as I have found an online competency based CC that has a partnership with WGU. Although, I really don't want another stop in between me and WGU. I am currently taking some classes at a local community college, but after this semester the majority of my classes are available on campus only. I want to be enrolled in an online school after this summer session is over. After speaking with my EC, I've decided, since I am currently taking a cybersecurity class, to try to get the Security+ certification, and see if that gets me accepted. I have absolutely no IT experience, but I believe I proved to him last night that I am determined, have given this a lot of thought, and have been motivated enough in my choice to watch videos and take free online classes in programming. So, my next step is to prepare for, and PASS, Security+. Fingers crossed. Although he couldn't guarantee it would get me accepted, of course, I figured it wouldn't hurt to try. Worse case, I go the other route, and get my Associates and apply again."
