0,vulnerability,Advice,My mom is not okay . Please help .,1,i441bk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/i441bk/my_mom_is_not_okay_please_help/,2020-08-05 22:02:26,"Excuse formatting, posting from mobile. I'm (18M) really feeling helpless as my mom has been telling me that she has some serious issues. My mom has been going to psychiatrist for the past four years and my parents still haven't clearly told me what she has been diagnosed with. She has OCD and has severe anxiety and depression and gets really bad panic attacks-the ones that incapacitate you immediately. My mom has been telling me for the past few days that she really needs help. She told me that she has been having these extreme panic attacks and urges to kill herself- like hanging herself. She seems like she's at the end of her wits. Every time she tells me this, I'm at a loss of words. I don't really know what I can do to help. Even though my mom and I aren't very close, i Love her very much and it breaks my heart to see her like this. I did tell her to go see a therapist, but I can't fathom why she hasn't. I really don't know how I can help her. Everytime she talks about her mental illness, I tell her that it will get better and we're going to get through this and try to comfort her, but I still don't know if this does any good. I'm also going through some very very tough times and me being depressed and ridden with guilt doesn't help. My dad rarely tries to respond to this or just laughs it off. My dad isn't the most expressive guy when it comes to talking about emotional vulnerability or anything sentimental. I want her to get better and see her happy again. Please help."
1,vulnerability,Advice,I do not know how to improve my relationship,1,i5qdb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/i5qdb7/i_do_not_know_how_to_improve_my_relationship/,2020-08-08 11:21:42,"So I am in a pretty serious relation that has been going on for about 3 years. I think for the most part we really hit it off. We enjoy each others company, have a lovely dog together, and have tried to motivate each other to be our best while we've been together. I have never been in even a good relationship, so I am still trying to find out what is healthy and what my boundaries are. And thats where I need advice. I am not physically affectionate, at least in a sexual way. Having been in circumstances that have left me uncomfortable with sex and not having a real interest or passion for sex, has left us both feeling very awkward a lot of the time. He is a very sexual person. He loves it. And most of the time I feel like I am filling an obligation rather than investing in my partner physically. He is so handsome and beautiful and I tell him this often, but I just do not want sex. There are times he has expressed his vulnerability to this, saying that he feels as though I don't like him physically. This is not about him, but I have tried working on it to ensure that his needs are being met. But it is never enough. There have been times on occasion he throws a bit of a tantrum when he has not been fulfilled sexually. I feel so exhausted in the end. There have also been times where he has demanded me to do things that I see no point to? Such as once when we had fought after having sex, he did not let me change back into my clothes and took the covers, leaving me to lay on the bed without anything. I don't think I have ever felt that horrible. Or sometimes asking for me to just spend more time together that I do not have to give him. Such as us going out (when we could lol Covid ) or even demanding which lane I am in when I'm driving. It is awkward and I have brought it a little to his attention but no changes or apologies gave been done or said. He always brings up past mistakes of mine, even when I have apologized and tried to work on them. Although I try, he never acknowledged that, only that there are no substantial changes. Even times where I have just felt sick from either being actually ill or drunk and will get mad for months about it. I haven't wanted to get drunk around friends with him since because of the last time that he still hasn't gotten over. He has also said some questionable things about my disability that I bring up and sometimes he really understands but when he is upset he says things that I feel are pretty ableist, but its only because he gets really upset. Not to mention I feel as though I do the majority in the relationship. I drive us around, I clean the dishes, I tend to the dog and pay for all his needs, I do laundry, and whenever there is an expense that is not just going out to eat I cover it (like gas, groceries, rent). I cannot even remember an anniversary that we haven't spent crying from being angry. That breaks my heart. But other days are so nice. But he is sweet, funny, and has made me the happiest I have ever been. I am known to be a doormat and a push over, and that is why I never have been in a good relationship before this. I think that these are just issues that couples deal with and can talk out. When I suggest therapy, nothing gets done and he never really agrees. He is a sweet guy when he happy, and he is compassionate. He will tuck me in when I am tired. But I am so sucked up with the bad parts, but the good parts are so wonderful. I need some advice. Typing all this out makes me feel so horrible in my stomach, but I just need some guidance from someone who maybe has been in my shoes."
2,vulnerability,Advice,I'm so lost and I just feel sad at this point,1,iahrzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/iahrzv/im_so_lost_and_i_just_feel_sad_at_this_point/,2020-08-16 09:24:50,"Preface: I just started climbing out of a brutal, two month-long OCD spike. I don't know if these two problems are related. I'm a gay 18 year old guy. Recently, I came across a coming out video in my recommended videos. It inspired me to think about coming out to my family soon, which I will. They will unquestionably be accepting. The problem isn't about my sexuality. I think it's waning now, but for the past few days I watched that video multiple times. I observed the pain in the guy's eyes, the way he stumbles and falters, and the catharsis when he finally breaks down after telling his mom. It was therapeutic, but also so deeply painful for me to watch. I mean PROFOUNDLY painful, it was almost to much to bear. Thinking about it hurts. I realized I developed an extraordinary crush on this guy. Not just the guy, but the situation--the beauty of him coming out, and how he finally felt happy afterwards. It was insane and still kind of is. I wake up feeling substantial physical pain in my chest and legs because I yearn to be around him so bad. I've become a hormonal thirteen year old girl. Every night for about three nights I tried to pinpoint the reason for my feelings, until the other day I hit the spot. I wrote the most nasty, hateful, bitter letter to myself and it felt so good. I wrote about how I will never be as good as him or anyone that I admire. I wrote about how the only way I'll find any happiness is by pretending to be other people, because I myself am worthless. I wrote about how I chase vulnerability and pain in people because the only way someone will (romantically) love me is if they're dependent on me for emotional help, and when they feel better they will slip away. I wrote about how I'm a burden to everyone and how, at my core, I'm missing something that everyone else has. I realize now that I have two feelings feeding on each other: longing to be around him, and longing to BE him. Everything about him was attractive. He's accepting, he's smart, he's kind, he's handsome, and he's better than me. I feel like I'm supposed to live a peripheral life and let everyone else thrive and enjoy themselves. I'm going to a therapist next week for the first time and I feel like I should bring this up. I just keep watching the video for emotional comfort but it's also so painful/wistful at the same time. Anyone else relate to this feeling?"
3,vulnerability,Advice,Struggling with spending time with terminally ill parent amidst COVID due to hostile and vitriolic older brother.,1,iays0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/iays0s/struggling_with_spending_time_with_terminally_ill/,2020-08-17 05:34:58,"TLDR - My older brother that still lives with my parents, is so unpleasant to be around that my SO and I feel like we can't visit my parents, one of which is terminally ill, if he is around - and he always is. How do I approach my parents about not wanting him around? &amp;#x200B; This is going to be a long one folks so sorry in advance. Part venting but also providing as much information as I can for clarity. So a bit of backstory for context - my parents are in their early 70's, and my father has stage 4 melanoma that has spread to his brain, lungs, and other organs. My brother is nearly 30 and still lives with them despite having a salary that would easily allow him to live independently. Due to my father's illness they recently had to sell their home (brother and I's childhood home) and move into a rental house; my brother moved with them too. My SO and I have a house about 10 minutes away from them and we're both 26. Given my father's deteriorating health, its really important to me to be able to spend time with my parents in a pleasant and joyful atmosphere. I've was always closer to my dad than my brother was, and I know he desperately misses having me around more frequently. So my brother and I have never really gotten along, and he has always had some social / behavioral issues, but the past few years he has become so unpleasant to be around that both my SO and I don't want to spend time with my parents because he is always there. He has developed some pretty extreme ideological standpoints, believes troubling conspiracy theories, and holds pretty clearly misogynistic / racist / generally hateful ideas. As much my SO and I disagree with his views / political stances, that isn't why he is so unpleasant to be around. We both are politically engaged and frequently discuss and debate issues with people that we don't agree with. Hell, the first time my SO and I spent time together it was with the intention to talk politics, she being a Republican campaign consultant at the time, and me identifying more with the Progressive movement. So I would describe us as being capable of being civil and discussing differing viewpoints. My brother is the type of person that drains all the energy from the room when he walks in. He is generally very sullen, contrarian, and angers quickly resulting in physical outbursts. When he is around it feels as though you are walking on eggshells in regards to what is said and how it is said to avoid setting him off. The way he ""discusses"" things is raising his voice, being forceful and hostile in tone, and genuinely insulting with the extent that he deflects or disregards other people. There is no genuine attempt to analyze what anyone is saying to him, no willingness to empathize with other's experiences, or consider how things affect people other than himself. What he reads from various websites and forums and what he believes are the absolute truth and always correct, and perceives any challenge / fact check / disagreement with those things as a personal attack or criticism of him - making him even more hostile and aggressive. Eventually after enough ""perceived attacks against him"" all semblance of communication breaks down and he begins shouting about how everyone thinks hes a terrible person and usually stomps back to his bedroom and slams the door. The obvious approach should be avoiding discussing anything political around him. But unfortunately he is often the one to bring up something that is politically charged, often conspiratorial or very controversial. Plus politics are a significant portion of our lives, and something that is really important to talk about given what is going on in the US / around the world. Another approach is meeting up with my parents somewhere for dinner without him, which we used to do. Due to COVID and my father's vulnerability that isn't really possible anymore. My father has been in and out of the hospital for months due to seizures caused by necrotic brain tissue from radiation treatments and surgeries, so its important that he has all his medications and walker / equipment around, making it hard to go out even if COVID wasn't a issue. As awful as he can be sometimes, hes still my brother and family, so it feels wrong to ask him not to be present. That is all I can think of though, I want to be able to spend time with my parents in a positive way. If you've made it this far, thank you. Please feel free to give any criticisms / call me out if you feel like I'm in the wrong on something. Tried to write this out as objectively as possible...but its not always easy."

I withdraw from everyone and I hate being social with a passion.

6,vulnerability,Advice,"My sisters mental health is broken. I'm posting this out of sheer desperation, because she's now worse than ever. Not a single one of the many psychologists/psychiatrists etc have been able to break through to her in over 11 years of effort. Is there someone out there who can advise or even help??",1,if6api,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/if6api/my_sisters_mental_health_is_broken_im_posting/,2020-08-24 02:36:42,"**TL;DR** My sister has been in and out of mental health services for 10 years in the UK. It's only made her mental health worse, or at least it seems that way. We can't afford private care. She can't live at home for various reasons. Mental health professionals are stumped. The system doesn't work for her, she doesn't fit into it. There must be someone out there who can offer advice or even help. Even if not, it's helped me a lot to write down and share a summary of everything that's happened (lots of things are not included though). Everyone else (if there is indeed anyone else who wants to read an essay by a stranger about his family issues), excuse the messy freehand textual diarrhoea. I probably could have structured the below better, but I just wanted to write it, or I never would have written anything at all. I hope you can read it all and let me know any advice you may have. **Why I'm posting this** I never thought I'd do this, but there's nothing else left to try. I'm so depressed by this whole situation. Counselling has helped a bit, but I'm really struggling to come to terms with what's happening. This post really is a long one. I'm looking for advice, help, and really just a way to get it all off my chest to strangers on the internet. Obviously, no names are used and no locations either aside from just 'the UK'. It's a bit of a shot in the dark too. There's always a tiny, tiny chance, that someone out there could actually help. In my fantasy world, there's someone out there who could step in and try something different. A charismatic specialist who can help everybody to manage this whole situation long term. More realistically, I hope there's someone out there who has some advice on how we as a family can deal with this situation. I have to try. After years and years, I've not managed to find the person who can really, *really* help. I'm actually beginning to think that no-one knows how to fix this or even improve it. Our whole family is broken because of it, and it's now been going on for 11 years, constantly. Hopefully there's some miracle worker out there who sees this post and can do/say something, anything, to make this horrible situation just a tiny bit better. Or at least understand it and give some advice which helps me/the family to cope. A man can dream, anyway. Anyway, I'm repeating myself. So far, my sister has been an absolute enigma to all mental health workers she encounters. None of them know what they can do, and many have said 'I've never seen anything like your sister before'. Psychiatrists across the country have failed to cause my sister to make any progress at all into at least managing her mental health problems. Personally, I fully accept that my sister will never be the same person I knew growing up. The happy, talkative, playful and sometimes annoying little sister I still remember. I get that. All I want is for her to be part of the family again. It's painful for everyone who loves her, watching this unfold again and again, time after time. Watching her become gradually more and more consumed by and trapped within her own mind. Not seeing her for months or years at a time. It's tough. At this point, you probably think: ""She sounds like she's very ill and she probably needs to be in a ward. That's just how it is I'm afraid. It's sad, but hopefully she will get the help she needs in there."" Or maybe, later on, you would say: ""she sounds psychotic and she won't ever be the same, ever. Even anti-psychotic medication doesn't solve the problem, it just controls it. It's just something you have to leave to professionals to sort out."" Well, as sad as it is, I almost *wish* things were that simple. They aren't. If you've got the time to read all of this, you'll see why. If the mental health of my sister was enough for her to be deemed as 'not having capacity to make decisions', then she would stay in a ward, she would get regular treatment and I wouldn't be here, baring my soul and begging strangers on the internet for advice. The long and short of it is, she can't be detained in a ward and she can't live at home. She is smart enough to win her tribunals against the NHS and be freed from enforced care, but she's unwell enough to completely refuse any kind of voluntary treatment whatsoever. It's at the point now where if somebody can't figure this out, nobody will. Maybe it's already at that point, but I haven't given up hope. The family and the NHS have been trying to 11 years, and it's only worse than it was. Hopefully it all more clearly later on. I just wish there was somebody out there who researches this kind of thing or knows a lot about very complex cases of Autism, featuring all kinds of other issues. Somebody who is finally able to really understand my sister. Make some kind, any kind of breakthrough. Someone who could put serious time and effort into this unique case and make progress where hundreds of other mental health workers have failed. At this point, I doubt that such a person exists. More likely, I hope that there's someone who can give that little bit of advice which might help my mind to deal with this mess, or might help my sister to get the care she needs. I don't know. I'm definitely not finding these people in real life so I may as well vent it all out on Reddit and see what happens, eh? So yeah... It's story time I guess. **Overview** The reason why this is so hard to resolve is because my sisters case falls somewhere in between 'an individual who lacks capacity and needs to be in a secure ward' and 'highly intelligent, top school grade achieving individual'. She's a case which constantly falls between the cracks in the (UK) mental health system. A case which refuses any voluntary help, whatsoever, but a case that clearly *needs* long term support. A case which won't, or more accurately, physically *can't* voluntarily engage with any support services. Despite long term efforts by both her family and NHS mental health services. She's a case who has taken mental health services to court herself, and won, just so that she can be free from hospital or any enforced care. But at the same time, she's also someone who has waited until everybody was out to smash up the entire house, including some windows, and spray paint the word 'bitch' all over my mums room. We've been stuck at what to do for years. My sister (lets call her Janet) has had mental health issues since she was 16 years old, and it's been getting worse and worse since then. Before this current situation, it's been realised that she probably always had high functioning autism as a child, but it was never picked up. My old school parents (mostly mum, my dad moved out long ago), didn't see this at all and neither did anybody else in the family. Like I say, old school. Old school attitudes (or more accurately, ignorance) towards mental health. Just like many other parents I suppose. This was never picked up by the schools, friends or anybody else either though. So, nobody gave her professional help when she was younger- she only got it when it had to be forced upon her and by that point, it was probably too late. When it did come, I don't know if it helped. But again, there's a lot more to this which I'll explain. Fast forward quickly to today where, at this very moment, she is in a secure ward for the 10th+ time. She's there after another episode. She has not moved at all since she got there, she's refusing to eat or drink anything (for days now) and she's going to the toilet right where she lays. It's almost like some kind of protest against being, yet again, inside a system she sees as the enemy - the UK mental health system. A system she has actually gotten herself into and out of many times. Previously, she's worked with her own solicitors, won tribunals, won appeals and even once taken mental health services to court. The mental health in question that she's been suffering with over the years is getting worse and worse with each foray into the UK mental health system. A system she's been involved with all parts of, from secure wards to 'care in the community' shared housing and social worker visits. Everything that could have been tried probably has been tried. As a side note, we've always really wanted to put her into expensive private care. But even with the whole family chipping in, we've never been able to afford it (it costs thousands per week). So it's always the underfunded, over stretched NHS mental health services who are left to try and work out how to fix this. After we've all tried yet again as a family. Needless to say, nothing's been solved. The fact is, there's been nothing but deterioration since she was 17. Nothing and nobody has prevented her from being trapped inside her own mind or even convinced her to accept that she needs help at all. Nobody has managed to unpick what's going on in her mind, so nobody has managed to make any kind of breakthrough and finally make any kind of progress. At least not for many years now. This one needs the history to understand why I've become so desperate that I'm posting a life story (names changed of course) on Reddit. Like it's suddenly going to bring the worlds greatest psychologist to my side or something. It clearly won't. But at least I might get some advice or other words of wisdom out of it. **History and context** When Janet was 17, she dropped out of sixth form. Nobody noticed for a while because she kept donning her clothes every morning and left the house every day until school finishing time. The school took a few weeks to notify my mum. Nobody knew where she went on those days. She kept it all completely secret from everyone. When the school called, there was a family intervention. There was a lot of family support, but it turned into her doing everything she could to avoid us and her life in general. Lots of things were tried at first. My mum was at her bedroom door every day, all the time. So was I. So were other family members. The GP was called for advice. But she withdrew into herself. She locked herself in her room completely and barricaded the door. She stopped seeing her family and started to be a ghost in her own house. She made sure nobody saw her. Anybody who tried to speak to her through the door was ignored. Anybody who tried to get in was attacked. It all happened quite rapidly. The whole time, everyone was trying to speak to her through the door and generally trying everything possible to engage with her. Nothing worked. With hindsight, we can be reasonably sure that she, already with a mental health vulnerability, experienced some kind of trauma which triggered this downward spiral. Nobody knows what that trauma was, and I doubt she even remembers what it was herself. That's what many of her psychiatrists believe triggered this sudden change. I know for a fact it wasn't my mum (single and working 50 hours a week to raise us all), my sister or me. I don't know whether something happened at school, with her friends or whether there was a family member we didn't suspect. There was absolutely no evidence of anyone in the family doing anything. I've searched at length for answers, but haven't been able to find one. Nobody knows. We'll probably never know. I've laid awake at night wondering, but I've resigned myself to never knowing what happened to her. Anyway, the GP came round not long after the family (particularly her mum) had tried to do anything and everything to bring her back. He turned up and tried to speak to her through her bedroom door. Nothing, no response. I think he might have mentioned what could happen (detained under the mental health act, because she wasn't eating or drinking), because late on that very night, aged 18, she went missing. She had no money, no phone and not much else. She ended up in national newspapers. The police saw it as a top priority case - a young, vulnerable young girl gone, with nothing to sustain her. They were searching everywhere. More money was put into her account, but she didn't touch it at all. She didn't take a phone. There was no trace of her until she was found in a woodland, many miles away, 18 days later by a concerned dog walker. To this day, nobody knows where she was for this 18 days. She was subsequently detained by police, then passed to mental health services under a 'section', which is essentially an enforced care order to protect her from herself and/or others. She ended up at a number of places, being passed around from mental health hospital to mental health hospital, nobody really quite knowing what to do with her. She didn't act like the stereotypical 'psychotic' individual and she wasn't well enough to just be left there in the woods. She refused any voluntary treatment too, so that wasn't an option. The first place she went to was an extremely high security, and there's no other word for this: asylum. The walls were padded and the doors were locked. There was lots of violence, you could hear screaming all day long, residents were regularly forcefully detained by staff, there was thick metal doors with scratches on the glass, there was banging, moaning and all the hall marks of your stereotypical strait jacket asylum. All day and all night. It was a place for the kinds of people who are given mental health treatment instead of a 25 year prison term, along with anybody else the NHS didn't have a place for elsewhere. Frankly, it was disgusting. It was no place for a terrified, vulnerable 18 year old girl. Even the staff at the hospital could see that and said so themselves. The Matron there made efforts to have her moved ASAP. My mum recalls visiting on the first day, to find her daughter, curled up, weeping and quivering in the reception area. Eyes darting around at every noise she heard, with her hands over her ears. She recalls calling the mental health services, angry and upset at the trauma this place was clearly causing, with the staff agreeing, and being promised that she would be moved somewhere more suitable. But once an adult relation is in the UK mental health system, it's basically out of your control as a family. This is because she was deemed to 'have capacity', i.e., the capacity to make decisions. But she was under enforced care to protect her from harm. She was treated as an adult, with full rights to privacy from her family, which is understandable. Because of data protection, they don't tell you much about what's going on. It normally takes a while to even be informed of where she has moved to next. After some pressure, she was moved around a few times until they eventually found a permanent place for her. Whilst there in this new mental health hospital, she found it extremely traumatic. She was intimidated by the patients there. She refused to engage with any of the workers at all as far as we know. She was diagnosed, through observations, as psychotic. Eventually, after they couldn't get through to her, they pinned her down and force-injected anti-psychotic drugs into her regularly. She continued getting worse though, and she cried about what had happened. It's still an open question as to whether this helped her psychosis or whether it caused it. It really could be either, because it got better and worse after the drugs. Better because she was now desperate to talk to anyone in her family, worse because she was terrified of the people worked at the hospital. We saw how traumatised she was every day. How she sometimes wept when we saw her, and begged us to help her get out. Now, her only goal was indeed to get out, however possible. It became a bit of an argument within the family as to whether her treatment was a good thing or a bad thing. She clearly wasn't well, in any case. We were convinced by Janet that this wasn't where she belonged. With hindsight, in reality, the psychiatrist was probably right. Equally though, she was definitely worse when she got out compared to when she went in. Using high-strength anti-psychotics can cause psychosis in some cases. It really is impossible to be sure. But anyway, it's too late to change that now. In any case, she got herself out by winning a tribunal. We supported the tribunal, with a view that she needed somewhere more akin to 'long term supported accommodation' than 'secured ward'. We thought that she wasn't in the right place to get better. Some of her workers agreed with us, which really didn't help anything at all. Anyway, since that first foray into hospital and every time since, her only goal is, and has always been, to live in my mums house. Back in her room. My mum has taken her back many times (she's been 'sectioned' many times over the years), but she simply can't live there any more. Over 11 years, it's become a mutually damaging relationship. That might seem callous, but hopefully I'll explain it in enough detail later on. When she lives there, with a few exceptions where there were very temporary improvements, she locks herself in her room, surrounded by dirty plates and filth. Pissing in a jug to avoid going to the toilet during daylight hours. Only coming out at night or when everyone else is away to eat and drink . Barricading the door at all times, refusing to come out at all despite long negotiation. Various family members have spent a long time sat outside her door, trying to speak to her. My mum spent every day speaking to the door, desperately trying to engage with her daughter. Nothing ever really changed this situation in the years she's been in and out of home past her first stay in hospital. Any efforts to break into the room and engage with her are met with extreme violence. Speaking through the door is wholly ignored, although we still think she listens when we do. Who know's if that's the case. After that first hospital discharge, and subsequent discharges, we all thought that if we spent enough time speaking to her through the door, making her meals, bringing her drinks etc that she might relent and come out again. We were all wrong. Any attempt to actually get into her room is always met with extreme violence, with Janet using whatever means possible to get you away from her. It's a clear 'fight or flight' reaction. The fact is, in the many years she's lived with my mum (on and off) she's been trapped inside her own head. She's done everything possible to control what happens in the house, to the point where my mum eventually became afraid to really challenge her because of what might happen. This is a big departure from the past. After some time and a few trips to hospital, my mum followed a 'clutching at straws' and 'policy of appeasement' approach. It was the only way she could cope when mental health services couldn't get her to voluntarily engage and she didn't 'tick the right boxes' for enforced care. She just lived at my mums house, at the food and was never, ever seen. It's worth pointing out that she's never voluntarily accepted or sought help, despite pressure/advice from family to do something over this whole 11 year period. She has voluntarily stayed as a patient in hospital, but she immediately left when she'd had enough and came straight back home. So why does she keep going back home then? Well, below is the general cycle which has repeated itself over the last 11 years. Each time, it's slightly worse than the last, and she is worse than she was before. It goes something like this: 1) She appeals her enforced detainment in hospital/living supported accommodation/whatever they're trying at that time 2) She wins her tribunal, completely off her own back 3) Mental health services say they can't do anything any more because she also refuses voluntary care or any kind 4) Because of this, she can't be housed or put into any kind of supported accommodation. The Council look at her loving family and go 'well, you'd better take her then'. 5) She moves back to my mums house, which starts off more positively, maybe actually seeing her family and cooking this time (she's been a mute for years, but communicates with writing etc) 6) Time passes. We think 'maybe this might be it! maybe we're actually making progress now!' 7) Then she regresses, usually triggered by a minor incident (last time it was because there was a moth infestation of all things), so she retreats back into her room as before 8) She stops seeing anyone or communicating; 9) She gets worse despite efforts to intervene/engage, so she starts doing things like banging on the inside of her door loudly and randomly, or leaving a defaced book here, a broken glass there, around the house 10) Then finally there's an 'episode' which normally involves some kind of violence or desruction on her part. Police are called. She's detained against her will under the mental health act. She goes to hospital... 11) Then she gets herself out, and it repeats. That's a very over simplified but you get the idea. It's an endless cycle. Once she wins her appeal in hospital, the services seem to play some kind of hot potato game, with nobody being able to offer her anything and eventually my mum taking her back home so the whole thing can repeat again. These episodes I mention include things like: trashing the entire house from top to bottom while everyone is out, throwing clothes out of the window and burning them, painting obscenities around the house (mostly aimed at my mum), cutting things up, smashing things and so on. When this has happened, normally my mum comes back to find the house in ruins. It ultimately results in her being sectioned under the UK mental health act by police. These episodes have varied in their intensity but normally involve the following at least: breaking things, painting 'bitch' on my mums bedroom wall, smashing furniture up, attacking family members, attacking herself and so on. We always try to negotiate but there's always violence when we do in this situation. The violence always kicks off when somebody tries to get into her room (I mean, you can't just talk through a door and be ignored any more when the house is basically destroyed). She attacks with whatever she can if anybody tries this. When that happens, the police/ambulance are called and she's dragged away kicking and screaming, then she's detained under the mental health act. Round and round it goes, again and again, like some sickening theme park ride you can't get off of. I'm really quite sick of it now, to be honest. It never seems to end. It's repeated itself 10 times or so, but honestly I've lost count of the exact number. This most recent time, my mum refused to take her back, because it clearly doesn't help her, so she was left to live in the garden. Nobody could do anything about it. It was horrible. More on that later. Psychologists, Psychiatrists and many others have spent a lot of time trying to break through and engage throughout all of this, but nobody has managed to. Hell, most psychiatrists have done the complete opposite, over simplifying what is clearly something very, very complex. Boiling the whole situation down to 'she's high functioning autistic' or 'she's severely bipolar' or 'she's psychotic'. The diagnosis seems to change every time. Barely any of them even seem to bother reading the medical notes or history, they just make snap decisions based on what they see in front of them. Then, over time, they start to realise that it's more complicated than that, by which point she's already got a tribunal lined up and she's almost out of there. In their defence, NHS mental health consultants are extremely overworked, so that's the only way they *can* work, I guess. One of the problems is that there's constantly new people involved. These different people (doctors, nurses, social workers etc), decide that it's something completely different this time. Police get involved too as mentioned, but some are better than others. Everybody who gets involved sees the situation for the first time and draws a completely different conclusion from the whole thing. Very few people have appreciated, at least at first, just quite how complex her mental health problems are. I don't think anybody has really fully understood them to this day. She's clearly a case where there are a lot of factors at play and most of her long term mental health workers eventually agree with this statement. They all have different opinions on what they can do, but so far nothing has really worked long term. She isn't just autistic (she's been officially diagnosed as autistic), but there's psychosis (officially diagnosed) probably ADHD (mentioned not diagnosed), bipolar (diagnosed), severe clinical depression (diagnosed) and much more. She's been diagnosed with all kinds of things, but every psychiatrist/psychologist has come up with different reasons for why she is the way she is and it's rare that they see the whole picture and deterioration. They see what's in front of them at that moment. Each of those diagnoses above comes from a different person. So they all have different ideas on how to help her, as do her family. I don't think any of them have had enough time to really get to the bottom of what's going on, because they're NHS workers in a underfunded system. I actually feel for them. How could they possibly pick this problem apart with 1 hour a week? As I said, we're far too poor to afford private full-time care (it literally costs thousands per week) and a weekly psychologist visit is something that simply wouldn't work in this case, because it would have to be voluntary. To be honest, the behaviours she exhibits really vary in a big way. I can't blame professionals, who have just one hour a week with their patients, for not being able to work out a way to help her. If the family can't do that after literal weeks trying to speak to her, then they have no hope really. The poor girl Janet has gone from smashing the house to pieces, to cooking dinner and baking, to choosing nice Christmas presents to everybody, to going back into her room and banging on the door every hour. It really has been all over the place. So yeah, she's been in and out of mental health services for about 11 years now. She's been 'sectioned' (detained for her safety and the safety of others), about 8-10+ times and every time is worse than the last. As mentioned, she won't accept or look for any help voluntarily either, despite numerous efforts. I now believe that she's actually physically incapable of accepting help. She's seems to think she's at war with her family, the NHS mental health teams, social workers and pretty much everyone else. She's also clearly at war with her own mind. She can't seem to improve any more, even a little. Despite a string of psychiatrists and psychologists (in the double figures by now), not a single person has been able to break through to her. Not a single person has been able to help her understand herself or even convince her to voluntarily accept any medication (any she's had has been forced on her). It's clear that she needs some kind of medication. The situation hasn't been helped either by the messy, underfunded UK mental health services, and the fact that she falls between the cracks when it comes to legal responsibilities. They can never keep her for more than 6 months. She won't voluntarily get help, but she won't accept it being forced on her either. It's been poorly handled by them in general. At one point, the head of NHS mental health for our region called up my mum to apologise about their care for Janet. It's worth mentioning supported housing as well. She's been to a couple, and there's too much to tell. The crux of the matter is that this hasn't worked either. The last supported housing (run by a charity specialising in the treatment of autism) was supposed to be the place. They refused to let her leave, even with a staff member, so she absconded. Twice. Both times, she somehow managed to make the 3 hour journey, during lockdown, right back to my mums house. And here's where the law gets fuzzy again. Because she legally has capacity. She's treated like a normal adult. That means that, after some attempts, they've (MH services) realised that they didn't actually have a legal power to detain her at this supported housing. All they can do is send social workers round who try and provide her with options. But she takes none of them, and does whatever she can to avoid them. So, before this last visit to hospital, she was living in my mums garden for weeks. My mum, being a mum, was feeding her daily, she gave her bedding and a tent, even though she refused to let her into the house. She really found this difficult, and frequently questioned whether she was doing the right thing. Because what kind of mother would leave her daughter outside like that? She was desperately begging for help from the mental health team. Surely there was something they could do? I mean, my mum is refusing a room to her own daughter. It sounds callous and disgusting to anybody who doesn't understand why. It's really, really heartbreaking for my mum. But hopefully I've outlined above why she can't let her back. She wants to in the future, she wants to care for her. But she can't. She just can't. Not until my sister makes some kind of progress. Because if something was to happen to my mum, who knows what might happen to my sister. And because of the violence if she tries to impose anything, she lives in constant fear. Because again, every time, the violence happens eventually. It simply can't be like that. My mum is simply not fit to care for someone like Janet any more. And that's really, really tragic and upsetting. But the really rage inducing thing is that nobody else is either according to the law. Social workers come and go, but they *leave her there* and *refuse to take her anywhere else*. Legally, they're in a pickle because she isn't at immediate risk. Morally, my mum can't leave her daughter outside in her own garden to starve in the rain with no shelter. So she was there in that garden for weeks, while her case was spaffed about. The support services and her family spent the time running about like headless chickens. I can't imagine how that makes Janet feel. Personally, it makes me feel sick that this was the last thing that happened before her current stay in hospital. When my sister has lived at home, my mum can't have visitors (aside from me and my other sister, maybe some very close family). My mum can't really do anything. She's constantly living in fear and anxiety. Treading on eggshells. She's completely controlled by this problem, and had to live with the fact that, when she did live there, her daughter is in the room right next to her, but she's also a million miles away. It's affected my mums mental health, as well as everybody elses. Knowing your sister/daughter is, to all intents and purposes, a door. It simply couldn't carry on that way, because eventually her whole family would end up in a ward with the stress and pain this causes. Janets siblings have certainly got some issues because of this whole thing. But anyway, she's in hospital now because she broke into the house. She didn't go into her room this time, but she was there. She refused to move. My mum begged her and begged her - 'all you have to do is accept help from the social workers. I want you back here, this hurts me, but it can't be like this'. So on and so on, for hours. My mum tried to get her to accept regular counselling, regular psychologist vists in a vain effort to take her back. Nothing was accepted. Eventually, my mum tried to take her out of the house. Janet attacked her, police were called, she was sectioned again. Now, here we are. Worse than it's ever been. So right now, it's come to this. She's currently lying on a bed in a pool of her own excrement, starving herself, not drinking any water. Refusing to move or speak. She's on 1-2-1 care with nurses who are cleaning and re-dressing her constantly. But she still says or does nothing. They are, again, at an absolute loss of what to do next. It really seems that there is just no place for her within or outside of the UKs mental health system. I try not to think that though, because it makes me cry when I do. The staff at the place she's in now are at a loss. They really don't know what to do. I've even had one of the nurses say to me today 'you know, I don't think this is the right place for her'. I thought, well... Where the fuck is then???? Nobody, and I mean nobody, has managed to answer that question. So here I am, venting to the internet, in the vain and deluded hope that somebody out there can give me advice. Or maybe someone out there can finally DO something to break this fucking cycle. Or maybe I can just dream that I did something to help. I don't know. It's this refusing voluntary treatment business which really messes everything up. The fact is, Janet is highly intelligent, and she knows exactly how the system works. She knows exactly what she needs to do to cause social workers heads to explode in confusion. She knows the gaps in the law. I or anyone else in the family would be willing to take her in, of course. We've tried. But it is always conditional on her accepting help as well. She has never agreed to do this. Without that assurance and agreement, she would just create another safe space in another home, starting another endless cycle of pain. I wish the family could provide a solution, but I really don't think we can. What I do know is that if somebody doesn't find a breakthrough, my sister will eventually either: 1) Die of starvation/dehydration 2) Kill herself 3) Snap and seriously attack/kill someone I hope it's not too late. I hope someone out there hears this and gives that tiny piece of advice that's been missing throughout all of this. Or even better (but probably impossible), someone who might be able to actually help. If you've got this far, thank you for reading and well done for making it through that messy deluge of facts, thoughts and feelings. I had to get it down and put it out there. Honestly, absolutely any comments, support, advice or anything is really appreciated. I'm really lost and I don't know how to deal with this. No one does."

Sometime it's hard to tell someone how much you love them because how obvious this feeling is for you but the most important words are often the simplest to say yet we forgot to say them out loud. Perhaps even more for men to men. The stigma on vulnerability and masculinity can make sharing emotion with one another a struggling experience. Nonetheless to share your appreciation of somebody is probably one the most beautiful and satisfying thing human being can do. Sometime the very line between life crushing loneliness and joy can be determined by the simple act of opening up to somebody. To tell your friends you love them, to tell your family you cheerish them or even some random person you've shared a tiny moment of grace with. i've been a confident for many suicidal people working on suicide-watch. People can die over the absence of a single word of appreciation or love. Please take care of your loved one, take care of those around you and please take care of your own inner self.

I spent most of my adolescent years suppressing any feelings of romantic interest in others due to low self-esteem (believing they might find me creepy or be made uncomfortable by my attention etc.) Now I'm in a healthier head space in terms of my self confidence but I'm still unable to allow myself these feelings. Whenever I'm presented with a romantic opportunity or others telling me their tales of love I'm unable to see anything but the potential negatives of becoming that emotionally vulnerable. I can't understand what possible positives romantic love might have because I haven't ever experienced it and have no way of relating to others descriptions of it. This would be fine and dandy if I was aromatic but the older I get the more I find myself becoming lonely and envious of others that have breached the threshold into this hidden land. Is there a way to become more okay with emotional vulnerability? (without therapy that is) Have I missed some key developmental stage and am now stuck like this? Am I just being a coward? Any advice or similar experiences would be well appreciated.

In my opinion this is a rather toxic trait born from pride, but he doesn't seem to be affected by it, which is why I have not said much about it. I know this is kinda borne from the culture surrounding males and masculinity in society, so in a sense I understand why he thinks this way. But his friends are more open to showing affection towards their friends, and don't see human connection, or desires to be around certain people more as some crippling need to be repressed. So in terms of social circles, no one would fault him for showing more appreciation towards friends. Yet he continues to do so. In my opinion it might hurt him in the long term*, yet i can't really do anything about it. I don't intend to change him if he really thinks this way, but i don't want him to repress emotions for the sake of pride* He's a good friend and I'd hate to see him hurt in the future simply because he has repressed all kinds of weakness inside himself without telling people about it.

I say this because all the frauds committed against me were committed in the same state as that hotel, which is not where I live and I only went there once.

I'm not a Christian, and if my family (fairly young grandparents, who are my legal guardians) ever found that out, they'd be so heartbroken. They would feel as if I'm going to hell and while I wouldn't be disowned, they would try to latch on and either convert me or subject me to constant emotional turmoil. On top of that, I'm bi (they're crazy homophobic) and politically, we barely agree on any fundamental issues--racism, sexism, homophobia, capitalism, choice, sex, children, religion, science, lifestyle, art, spirituality, or who the president is. I have a few family members I can trust, mostly my mom who has also kinda ghosted the family and has her own issues. I'm not abused, but they don't know anything about me.

I feel like an idiot constantly. I fear that my iq or other measurements of intelligence are far below average. I am worried that I will never be happy with myself. I am a junior in high school and soon I will be 17. what if all my life ever equates to is failed attempts at social interactions? What if I never experience deep and meaningful friendships that I carry with me for a lifetime? I havent had a friend since I was 12. Its not that I get bullied. My peers treat me normally, but I have the hardest time being vulnerable. I know that friendship, when basically analyzed is a swapping of information. You share intimate details with someone else, and in that way your platonic relationship feels, and is different than the ones you share with random people or acquaintances. But, I cant seem to commit myself to that. My lack of vulnerability with others leads them to get bored of me, and I completely understand. It is my fault, not theirs. I used to attend therapy a year ago, but stopped. After 3 sessions I quit. Its not because I didnt like my therapist. They were very kind and I actually liked them. But, the truth is I lied. I lied to save myself perceived embarrassment. I lied about how I want to kill myself. I downplayed my morbid thoughts about death. I downplayed my social anxiety, and how much it does interfere with my relationships and day to day life. Therapy became a game of, ""lets show the therapist I am ""normal"" and dont need therapy."" I have never had those hallmark teenage rites of passage. And I know it is stupid to get caught up in these, but I want it so badly. I want to feel normal. I would rather peak in Highschool knowing that I collected all the teenage rites of passage. If I have peaked(which I believe is true) I am absolutely pathetic. I dont know how to help myself at this point. This feeling of destiny is overwhelming. I feel doomed(which I know is so pessimistic), but I cant seem to help it.

I've known them since high school, and during those years we got really close. Like, almost a couple levels of close. They were really reliant on me to provide them with emotional support, and I was happy to oblige because I had feelings for them. However, it got difficult when they started talking to me about their depression and their suicidal thoughts. I tried my best to listen to them, show that I care, and direct them to a therapist. Despite my efforts, they didn't seek out the help that they needed and continued to rely on me for support. I never knew how this friend really felt about me. I had already told them my feelings, but they wouldn't give me a real answer, neither accepting or rejecting me. So being the naive teen I was, I thought I had a chance, so I stuck around. They would keep me close, closer than any ""friend"" should be, and with the amount of emotional vulnerability they showed me, I was hooked. They would continue to tell me about their intense feelings and I would continue to listen. We would spend hours of every day together talking, playing games, watching videos, and I would end every day feeling very drained but not understanding why. After a couple of years of this, I was getting very tired of it. So much so that I felt like their depression was starting to consume me as well. I felt like they were using me, so I began to withdraw and take more time for myself, but the two of us remained friends. In the middle of my process of getting over them, they called me out of the blue. On the phone I could tell they were crying and in a lot of mental anguish. They went on to tell me about how they were in a depressive state and had thoughts of suicide. I did my best to console them, again recommending that they see a therapist. They agreed that they needed professional help, and went on to talk about how I was one of their most trusted friends and that ""they think of me as more than a friend"". Frankly, I was shocked. But I felt really uncomfortable with their confession because I felt like it was something they said in the heat of the moment (which is something that they do sometimes). I didn't think their confession was genuine, but I didnt say that out loud. They already seemed really distraught so I didn't want to add any fuel to the fire. During our senior year of high school, they announced that they would be joining the Marines. I didn't know much about the military, but I was really worried at the time. Considering their mental health, I didn't think that would be a good idea. Nevertheless, they joined and shipped off to the other side of the world. I was honestly relieved to not have to spend so much time with them anymore. This might be terrible to say, but I felt so free the first few months they were away. I got completely over them and I started to invest more time into myself. In the years that they were gone, I graduated college, got a Masters degree, landed a great job, and threw myself into my hobbies. But couple days ago, I awoke to a message from them asking if they could call me. I thought it was strange since we hadn't really spoken in a while, but I agreed. Apparently, something happened which triggered their depression and suicidal thoughts, and they called me because I was the first person thought of to call. I wasn't able to tell them anything other than what I had already told them in the past. Much of what they said in this conversation was the same as what they said in the last phone call. They even said ""they think of me as more than a friend"" again. And like last time, I patiently listened to them, even though I felt very uncomfortable. I checked in with them again the other day and they said that they would see a therapist. I have yet to confirm whether they have or not. I care about them, but quite frankly, I don't want to help them shoulder their baggage anymore. I thought this behavior would be over once they joined the Marines, but that doesn't seem to be the case. How do I prevent them from dumping this on me again? Ever since that phone call a couple of days ago, it's been hard for me to concentrate on my work and other parts of my life. It feels unfair that they do this to me because they only call when they want my emotional support. &amp;#x200B; TL;DR: A depressed friend relied on my emotional support for years until they went to the Marines and stopped regularly talking to me. Out of the blue, they call me first thing in the morning saying that they had suicidal thoughts. I told them to see a therapist, but I'm unsure of whether or not they actually did. I'm tired of repeating this cycle. How do I prevent them from dumping this on me again?"
19,vulnerability,Advice,My dad (56M) and I (21F) aren't close but how can I show him I appreciate him?,1,hqd5tv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hqd5tv/my_dad_56m_and_i_21f_arent_close_but_how_can_i/,2020-07-13 20:52:20,"So, pretty much my entire life until I moved out at 18, my dad emotionally abused me. He's a complicated person because one half of him is a good dad, if I need something then he'll do it for me and he works really hard for the family. But the other is obviously the abusive side. He's a person who isn't self-aware or aware of how he makes others feel. I never allowed him to just treat me that way without standing up for myself or just allowing him to act that way without consequences. As a result of how he treated me, I never allowed him to have a father-daughter relationship with me like he desperately wants, I'm civil with him but I'm extremely uncomfortable just being in the same room as him. He has improved a lot and doesn't act nearly as close to how he was in the past and because he's improving, I want to show him I appreciate him for everything he does for the family because I know he doesn't feel respected or loved (which he isn't aware the reason for that is just the after effect of how he treated me for years). I'm extremely uncomfortable with showing any emotion or vulnerability in front of him, I even cringe when he hugs me. So is there any way I could do something for him without showing that side to me? I'm thinking of getting flowers for him but I'm open to any suggestions! :)"

I knew he liked me when we were younger, but I didnt feel the same way. Now, years later, I DO feel the same way as we started to grow up and he matured more (Im 19 hes 17). I told him, and he told me basically that he never got over me and feels the same way. Fast forward a couple months, things havent really changed, other than making out a few times. Hes shown interest in hooking up with me, but I avoided the topic for a while. Now though, Im thinking about it more and more the more I see him, and it seems more and more appealing. However, thinking about it as like, a REALISTIC scenario rather than just an IDEA kind of freaks me out... sex would be taking our relationship to a whole new level of vulnerability, which is something Ive never been good with. And the way you hear about these things going, there usually isnt a great outcome. Another big thing is that hes younger than me, and as a guy is at a different level of maturity than I am. I also am not good with vulnerability, like I said, and Im scared that such an intense level of it that comes with sex will scare me off and Ill end up hurting him. I dont know if Im just getting an impulsive idea in my head or if this is, like, a natural progression after whats already happened between us. Help?"
21,vulnerability,Advice,I need to know if I'm an evil person,1,i0q4yn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/i0q4yn/i_need_to_know_if_im_an_evil_person/,2020-07-31 03:23:59,"I'm writing this in an emotional state to say the least, and it's going to be a long one. I'm going to honestly describe my entire life for as much as I can remember, and if anyone wants to devote time to help me out, then I'd be forever in their debt. To preface the situation here's the gist of it. I'm a 17 year old guy who cheated on his girlfriend, completely devastated her trust in anyone, am unable to provide anything worthwhile to my psychotic mother and caused the death of two small animals because of my irresponsible nature. My ex-girlfriend insists that I'm irredeemably evil, and I had trouble accepting it until now, when the latest of those events happened. Now I just need confirmation. I want to also try to write about things as neutrally and in a considering fashion, especially towards her, so here goes nothing. To preface I'll have to tell you about my personal issues. I've always had issues when it comes to relating to myself in the past. I'm very quick to forgive everyone, including myself. This came apparent first time properly in upper secondary school, where I was practically a bully to a classmate of mine. We seem to be in good terms now, but I know that I caused awful pain to him because of an inflated ego, and a desire to not be abandoned, and to have something like a friend group that actually, properly wants me. Of course I had this sort of dynamic in primary school as well, with a multitude of friends around, who later all became active drug abusers. I'm not joking, I mean all of them except one, who still hangs around with the same group and most probably has no issues abusing alcohol. The only reason I never fit in there was because I'm just not very sociable in big groups, and never really liked the culture of ""let's get fucked up on weed to get even more fucked up on meds"" they had going on. This group slowly drifted away from me (probably to my good fortune anyways) as I was sent to a completely different class from them when transitioning to upper secondary (to clarify they became this way during upper secondary.) I felt quite abandoned because of the change of class, and combining that with my past of being the awkward kid who took even the mildest of insults to heart, and the initiave I took to start practicing Muay Thai on grade 6, I became a proper asshole during my first year of upper secondary (grade 7.) I was overcompensating externally because internally I felt weak, which culminated into the afore mentioned bullying from which I remember, sadly, very little. I never even considered it bullying until I started to think about the things I did. Being an asshole, and being awkward/generally different naturally left me sorta shunned from things the class did as a group outside of school. This feeling of just being ignored, having to ask the group to hang out with me and them not responding until they're done, after which they'll say ""sorry I didn't notice"" left me with a few realizations. ""Friends are not gained by being a piece of shit"" and ""fuck two-faced people who take others for granted."" Of course they were completely in the right to leave me out, though I'd have wished they would have just told me I'm a cunt so that I could have focused more on things I enjoyed. In High school I completely cut ties with this group after the first year (excluding a single person, now my best friend.) They still were in the same school to some extent, so I alienated myself quite completely from people outside the class. A part of this was my desire to work and become better on my spare time, a part was just that I held those people in low regard. I had a few crushes here and there and still hung out with a variety of people, but that all changed when I realised that I was completely enamored with a girl in my class. First of all she was fucking hilarious, beyond anyone I've ever seen par from maybe my best friend. She was also way smarter than anyone was in that class at the time, and had this badass aura of not giving a fuck. I cried a few times when I thought she fell for a friend of mine, but finally, after a school theater night I managed to sneak myself in her apartment. It was the most beautiful night I've ever had. Funnily enough we were watching Rick and Morty while she was laying on my chest. We didn't know much about how anything worked when it came to relationships, but in the end we slept in the same bed for the night. I was holding her an thinking that I'll never let this go. We approached the relationship semi-cautiously, both keeping in mind that we're two stupid teenagers. Still I couldn't but think that she's the person I want to be with. Our personalities matched in a way I've not seen anyone else match before, and we became inseparable. We never really argued, and I loved her ability to handle things maturely. She had issues with mental health, I came to find out. Depression, body-image issues and OCD, along with many other externalities that she so bravely, or not so bravely, hid from everybody. Irregardless my love for her just kept growing and growing by the day. We started transitioning into a phase of deep vulnerability. I could let her be the big spoon (a huge step for me, believe it or not), and I felt as if she always had my back whilst I had hers. Her sad moods and body image issues still troubled the relationship, but we were doing great otherwise. My issues with anger also got in the way a few times, since I was always a bad loser a she was great at school, though that was nothing major either. The thought of cheating seemed like an impossibility, although I wanted to at all times tell myself that I am in fact capable of doing something like that to make sure I understood what I was doing at all times. As the relationship matured, we began having issues with sexual chemistry and her insecurities. Every other aspect bloomed, though we disagreed on having kids (early as fuck so I didn't see it as an obstacle). I wanted to really please her, but she hesitated a few times, which in turn made me question whether I could. She's always had issues with orgasming, and that didn't help. In the beginning I even had erectile dysfunction because I was so afraid of not being enough, so I understood her position quite well and didn't want to pressure her. I was also incapable of trusting her when it came to telling her how much all of this bothered me, since she's had suicidal thoughts and a history of cutting. I thought I could keep it under wraps until she had more confidence, and I also thought that I could handle not being satisfied sexually for the time being since she was such a wonderful and amazing person otherwise. In addition she had talked a lot about wanting to be with a girl at some point, and we even talked about open relationships. She's also under a burden of trust issues, as her OCD was often targeted toward our relationship, causing her to question whether or not I loved her or vice versa. I seriously thought I was fine with all of this until I cheated. I went to an anonymous chat site to relieve myself, whilst also trying to figure out my apparent bi-sexuality. I was initially mostly looking for girls, but quickly transitioned to guys. I mosly was horny, and never really considered it to be cheating. After the deed I was cognizant of the nature of my actions, but shame, fear of losing her and the confusion I felt urged me to keep it under wraps. The worst thing is that I did it many times, over a period of a month or so. I just pushed it away when I was done, as I do with many things. I told her when I accidentally sent a picture of us to a guy I was chatting with. I panicked, but also realised that this shit had to end somehow, so I told her what I was doing, but in my cowardice failed to mention that I was initially going after girls as well, which she accepted even less that going after guys behind her back. She was still devastated, and uncovered who I truly was when I, bit by bit, unveiled that it was about girls, and told her that there were many instigating factors such as her insecurities and my lack of braincells when it came to processing that this was indeed cheating. Of course I realised it in hindsight, and am deeply regretful of stabbing her in the back, but also sprinking salt on the knife and twisting it around by not being honest in the beginning. I didn't want to accept I threw it all away because I was horny. I did not want to be someone who was two faced, and took someone like her granted. At the same time, maybe weeks prior the revelation, my mom suffered from a psychotic break. She woke me up early and told me to pack as she tried to explain how everyone on the internet knew her and how sexual material floated about in there while people were laughing at us for not noticing. I intend to become a clinical psychologist, and thus because of reading knew almost instantly what was going on. I called an ambulance, and a month of bullshit followed with her being paranoid, and me sometimes, rarely, being helpful, but other times being angry at her for not getting a grip. She's still in the hospital with no end in sight, and I'm moving to an apartment of my own in a few days. This process severely harmed our opportunity to work things out with my girlfriend, as I could not get a lot of time for myself during that month. We had an encounter once in between my mothers first episode and second. where she tore me up verbally because I was a piece of shit. My mom was listening, as she was supposed to go to the hospital tomorrow because she was doing unwell, and that she did, but this also led to the fact that now she thought my girlfriend wanted to ""make me kill myself/poison me."" My mom forced my 85-year old grandparents to drive 200 kilometers to where we lived so they could ""watch that I wouldn't be hurt"" by ""the people"" or my girlfriend. In truth I now had to watch out for five people instead of two. In the end we talked it out, went to have Dinner in a local restaurant, realised something was irreversibly broken, didn't eat anything, cried, and broke up. We would have therapy tomorrow. I told her about the fact that my sessions involved girls too, and as one would reasonably expect, she was devastated. I wanted her back bad, and wanted to be honest for her sake, but turns out that telling you betrayed someone once is better than doing it twice. We decided to have a month long break, and see what happens after. I went to my other grandmas for the meanwhile, studied, and thinked about her every fucking day whilst trying to keep up a routine to keep me sane. Surprisingly it worked to some extent. We decided to meet up today, but before that the third and final nail to my coffin lands. I've had three cats in the house that have won over the hearts of me and my girlfriend, and our common friend group. They're honestly amazing creatures, though one of them was pregnant as she's an outside cat. I heard tiny meowing in the bedroom closet (I set up a bed for her, though she didn't seem to care) and saw her protecting her kittens. I, for some unknown reason, decided against my better instinct that I shouldn't move them somehere safer from the closet. They might roll up and choke on the clothes, and the mother had a relatively hard time getting to her cubs. I decided to ignore it for a while as I was tired, and a day or so rolled by. I went to clean up the closet to prepare for my moving, and they were both dead. They were torn apart by my other two cats. The blood and visceral fluids seeped on the floor of the closet. I cleaned them up and proceeded to reflect for a moment about what I had caused. I melted crying on the living room couch, but here's the kicker: I never really did feel guilty about the things I did. Not a single one of them. In my head I very well know that the cheating was horrid, and that I could take better care of my mother, and that those two cats would still be alive if not for my laziness and irresponsibility. I know that, yet I feel fuck all. I'm crying my eyes out and am completely calm. I felt no guilt. I told my girlfriend when we met today, and she was expectedly destroyed by the thought. We talked for a few hours regardless, with her ending the conversation by saying that I'm evil. I believe her, but this is me making a case for myself. I want to believe that I could have her back and build something better from this broken trust, and I want to believe that there's something that can be done about my state of selfish existence. I want to feel bad, but I just can't bring myself to do so for long as I feel as if I have reasons for what I did. That feels cheap, and not at all just considering that she had breakdowns over thinking about other people. The one thing she didn't want was me to cheat, and I did it anyways. I want to know what's wrong with me, I really do. I appreciate all of you from the bottom of my heart."

It's a crazy story, but absolutely true. I won't tell it to anybody in real life. Not to Hannah, who inspired it. Not to any friends. So I'm telling it here. I am a 22 year old geek. Last year I was a 21 year old, glasses-wearing geek who was a senior in college with nearly a 4.0 GPA. And I'm still (blush) admittedly a virgin. I'm only about 5'7, a ""studies-while-eating Doritos"" belly on an otherwise normal frame. I told my friend Hannah about how I like to wake up very early on some days and head to the local nature preserve before class. I'm always alone, and it's beautiful. She told me that her and her boyfriend used to go, and sometimes, she would strip to the nude. My eyes bulged. She giggled and said it was not sexual at all. It allowed her to be ""one with nature"". She said ""You should try it sometime, if you ever got the balls. Literally haha"". Yeah right. I never even take my shirt off at the beach. Then, one Tuesday morning at 6:30 am on a bright, sunny, only slightly brisk early Spring Tuesday morning...I got the itch. I don't EVER do anything out of character. Why not just try it out? Nobody will ever know. I actually undressed. I took off my heavy boots and long socks. My sweater. My pants. My undershirt. There I was, shivering (it wasn't THAT cold, just a tad chilly, but the nerves got to me) in nothing but my light blue boxers. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and slid them down and kicked them off into the pile. Now, clad in only my glasses and as bare as a newborn baby, I cupped my package with my hands, and I timidly walked towards the lake, about 50 yards from where I left my clothes, and I looked up at the gorgeous view. The trees. The mountains. The beautiful, clear, blue lake. Without even thinking, I placed my hands at my sides. And there I was. Martin the virgin geek. Naked. Buck naked, in fact. More naked than the trees, which were ""clothed"" in leaves. More naked than Adam in the Garden of Eden, who at least had a fig leaf. I was exposed. Not just physically, but exposed to new excitement and beauty. Inspired, I even walked around the entire lake, as naked as the day I was born. My round, bare belly shaking. My white-as-a-ghost ""bubble butt"" that Hannah would also make me blush over that she said I was always ""hiding"" under my nerdy khakis jiggling behind me. And my small package (hey, it's a throwaway!) bobbing in the brisk air. I walked around the entire lake. The crisp breeze occasionally startling me by caressing my bare butt. The tickle of a few flowers on my belly and package as I walked. The feel of the fresh grass through my bare feet as I walked. Standing there, basking in the view, it was then that I heard it. ""Beautiful, simply beautiful."" It was a woman. About 43 years old. Pretty, with a slight hard-to-pinpoint foreign accent. She had a GIGANTIC, expensive, HD camera. And directly taking photos - OF ME!!! I stood there frozen in shock, eyes wide, mouth open, as naked as a newborn baby with my hands at my sides in the bright sunshine for about 5 full seconds. Then in a panic, I cupped my package with my hands and I ran behind a tree as she giggled and kept snapping photos of the scenery. I poked my head out from behind the large tree, hiding my vulnerable, naked body behind it, with the now colder breeze attacking my bald, defenseless white buttcheeks behind me. ""You can't take those pictures!"" She said ""I sure can, sweetie. We're out in a public space. Nobody forced you to go traipsing around in your birthday suit."" I replied: ""You can't share those photos!!"" She said ""Relax, and don't be so embarrassed. I've seen many men in the nude over the years. I'm no virgin here."" That made me blush beat red. She said ""For ruining my carefully planned shoot, I'm going to use these photos to create a painting."" As I spoke up, I felt my naked, white butt-cheeks jiggling as I was shaking in panic and anger. I said: ""A painting?! Of what?"" as I clung desperately to the tree shielding my body from her gaze. She smirked. ""A painting showcasing true bravery and vulnerability."" I said ""I'm no model for a painting."" She replied: ""Oh, but you are, nude boy. It's one thing for some confident, viking man to walk around here. You're not one of those types, with some big, silly penis flopping around to show off."" I subconsciously placed a single hand over my package, even from behind the tree. She said: ""But you. You're the true picture of vulnerability. Your lily-white skin. Your adorable chubby belly. A hint of a bosom on you, even with hard nipples in the cool air."" She giggled. And I subconsciously used my other hand to hide my nipples like a damsel in distress. ""And your little penis exposed for the world to see. Standing fearlessly, without cover, in the open. Clothed by nothing but your smattering of body hair, and a slight, endearing pink blush across your cheeks. I'm going to paint you."" My ""pink"" blush turning RED as I cried: ""But you can't!!"" She said ""I can, and I will. Google me."" She gave me her name. ""Your bare body will be in my gallery in a few months."" Defeated, I said ""Well I'm going back around the lake, the least you can do is give my dignity and avert your eyes."" She said ""I'll do no such thing. I have more photos to take. Now go run along, naked boy. Get that cute tushie running around the lake and get dressed, it's getting cold."" As I ran around the entire lake, with absolutely no cover, feeling my bubble butt literally shaking behind me, I turned to see her unflinchingly smirking and staring at me. And even snapping a few more final photos. A few months later, I did Google her, and sure enough, there I was. A sight that a girl had never seen before, my naked body. It was expertly painted I must say, with unfortunately exquisite detail. A lush greenery set against beautiful mountains, with my blushing, eyes wide, mouth open, naked spectacle, arms at my sides, standing in front. My small penis and balls prominently displayed right in front. With 2,000 favorites on her website. She displayed it in a gallery. It was sold for $5,600. And it's about to be hanging in somebody's home FOREVER. For all to see. Am I an asshole for asking her NOT to sell it?!"

24,vulnerability,Advice,Sexual abuse or child curiosity?,1,i1g6ou,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/i1g6ou/sexual_abuse_or_child_curiosity/,2020-08-01 07:39:51,"TW!!!! (nsfw) Ive heard a lot of people say that it is normal for kids to explore each others bodies at a young age out of curiosity (Not sure if this is correct or not). My sister and I (also female) are 2 years apart and shared a room for a long time. When I was around 6 or so she was starting to explore herself and commented on how it felt and encouraged me to try as well. This mutual masturbation went on for a couple years where she would pressure me into playing games that involved touching each other and talking about sexual things. I can still remember the games pretty vividly and I feel extremely guilty about them. We never went very far but it definitely felt like it went beyond curiosity. Sometimes when my cousin would visit, she would also get involved with the games (she is my age). Sometimes I wonder if she took advantage of my vulnerability at that age or if I was the one who kept things going. There were times we would agree to stop but always went back.

25,vulnerability,Advice,How do I get over my own ego?,1,gvl7wm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gvl7wm/how_do_i_get_over_my_own_ego/,2020-06-03 12:22:36,"Ego might not be the right word for it, but hopefully my explaining will make it more clear what I'm seeking. I've been at this acting school for 30 weeks now (it's a 15-month program for an Associate's so we're halfway to the end). Since day 1, I've had problems with grabbing my classmates' attention, being socially intelligent, and just overall someone that people would like to hang out with. Not that I don't have friends, but my main friends are people I've known for years, before acting school. I'm 24F, a few years older than most of my classmates but not the oldest person there (I already went through college but discovered this new passion later, like a later-bloomer of sorts). Some of the rules we've been taught at this school are letting go of self-consciousness, relaxation, and overall being vulnerable. I struggle with all of these. Especially vulnerability; my whole life I've had a hard time being 100% my honest self with strangers and letting myself go to make a joke, like I'm too worried it won't be funny enough. I've noticed though that when I'm doing exceptionally good in a scene or monologue, or a performance in general, I get confident and let loose, talking louder and talking more to people I otherwise think don't really like me much. But when I'm having an average or below average day, I kind of shrink into the background. I try to make plenty of small talk but it usually gets ignored for louder, more charismatic people, and the more it happens in a day the more I get tired of trying (for that day). I just, I don't know how to not be this person who struggles with normal conversations and is always held back by self-consciousness. My classmates probably perceive me in a way that isn't how I want my ideal self to be and I don't know how to close that gap. Any advice? P.S. I'm planning to audition for the school's improv group b/c I believe it could help me in the long run."

Both my dad and my sister are Bipolar (dad undiagnosed, sister diagnosed) and Im pretty sure I dont have that, but Ive started to realize I might struggle with anxiety and depression. Not in the way that most people would think because Im very social, and seem to keep it together. I will have weeks where Im feeling very confident, but then months where Im not. I have a very poor inner dialogue with myself. I quit playing sports (I played my whole life until this past year) and I think that did diminish my self esteem because that is what I felt I was best at. I have struggled with addiction issues since I was 15, but rarely do drugs anymore. (Aside from weed and alcohol). I feel like I do have that part of my life under control now, but I am dependent on both of those things to some extent. Sometimes I wish I could avoid social situations all together to not feel anxious all the time. Also, I dont know if I should label myself as depressed because its not like I physically cannot leave bed at times, and in general, I can talk myself off a ledge when I am feeling down. I make a lot of reckless decisions, and then feel guilty about them and wish I could do better. I kind of live my life in opposite extremes at times. There is a lot more to it, but this post is already quite lengthy. Mainly, I am just looking to see if i can handle this on my own, or if professional help is necessary.

Emotionally, I'm a mess, but only those closest to my know that. To everyone else, including all the people at my university, I'm able to concert a very persuasive facade of emotional fieriness and vulnerability, but not instability. I tend to get deeply involved with my male professors. They all tell me I'm an amazing student, but that rarely satiates me. I tend to go to office hours, talk to them after class, discuss current politics with them, etc. The problem is that my motivations for this aren't entirely clear. I think they just see me as a really enthusiastic and perhaps slightly lonely student. But for me, it's so much more fundamental than that. I fantasize about having them as paternal figures. I have a good relationship with my dad, by the way. I don't know why I continue to have these issues. The other problem is that most of my professors are really receptive to me and my behavior. I attend a small private school, and the professors are pretty caring and have a lot of time for their students. Or perhaps they just prioritize them. Regardless, they have never made me feel unwelcome. If anything, they've very strongly encouraged my behavior with them. Perhaps they see me as a normal student, and they are similarly enthusiastic about our connection. But I know for me it's more than that. I don't think some of them realize how much I think about them. Every time I'm sad, which is every other day, I imagine myself clasped in their arms, being soothed and reassured by them. Trust me, I am as disgusted by these words as you are. I'm 22. I fully realize the yucky implications of my thoughts. But I don't know where they come from and how to stop them.

Having too much time on my hands is a frustrating problem to have. A sense of shame comes with it because I feel bad for not doing productive things. I try to invent tasks to pass the time, but I'm left with a nagging thought that I could be spending my time in better ways. (even if the tasks ARE productive) My brain doesn't elaborate on how I could be more productive, so I'm left to guess and endure the guilt. There are many different types of productive tasks, and I try to remind myself of this. For instance, catching up with a friend over the phone is productive. It doesn't lead to a specific end goal, but it's still a worthwhile thing to do. I'm a reserved person, but I do have friends. I try to reach out via text and phone calls, but it feels so hollow and empty compared to seeing them in real life. I wish I could give them all a big hug, and yet I sometimes catch myself pushing them away. I've thought a lot about why I do this during my free time. I think that it's because of some messy family drama. I won't get into it, but I have a very hard time being vulnerable and open to other people - even with close friends that I love and trust. I feel like I have to force myself to be open with people. I've felt the consequences of my trust being taken advantage of too many times, and I'm scared to feel that again. As a single person I've felt a real conflict within myself. I've purposely stayed single for years and turned multiple dates down in an effort to wait for a right moment to find/start a relationship. I've accepted that that moment may not be for awhile. But the lack of human contact and intimacy I've felt during this pandemic is crushing my resolve. That paired with my fear of vulnerability is a bad combo because romantic relationships are inherently vulnerable. It's frustrating. Besides, even If I felt like I was in a position to date someone I think it'd be unfair to do so from a place of boredom. If you've read this far, I thank you. How am I supposed to deal with these unpleasant feelings? I exercise regularly, eat well, and drink plenty of water daily. I just don't know what else to do. TL;DR Due to the pandemic I'm stuck alone, feeling very bored and lonely. This has caused me to reflect on my aversion to vulnerability which makes me uncomfortable and nervous."

But as some point you should be old enough to have these steps of progression that lead you to avoid things, with good reason. Does a 35 year old, with no experience and no real talent, really need to pursue standup? Yet is it a wrong path for that person because it seems so out of line? Not my specific path, but theres many things I feel I need to open myself up to right now. To almost suspend belief within my brain of what I do know. Things I feel a 22 year old should seek, not a 30 year old like me, essentially. Ive had very difficult jobs, Ive lead small teams for a few years, I know work stress for sure. I have all this supplementary and synthetic knowledge, but the experience is entirely different. I have the years, but theyre not as filled in as they should be. Yet my brain works just fine at my age, I can handle the normal vulnerability we all go through to earn enough money/survive/friends/family, but it creates defense mechanisms to avoid these more unknown vulnerable experiences that are necessary to take in the full picture. I think things like standup are a good example because theres absolutely no guarantee of a path or strict rules to follow. Or a friend I have who did all these odd jobs in nature, for parks, animal rights, and so on, paths that you sort of make up by seeing whats out there for you. I get stuck in that feeling of, youre 30, that means things need to go a separate way now. You need to start slowing down, yadda, yadda, when I have more focus and energy than I did all through my 20s now. I more see it as a expenditure of the body, and a desk job, for me, is a path a few decades away. However you get there, who knows, but thats how I see it. Follow the decline of the body. Im ready and absolutely willing to let go of these ideas of have about my life and what to expect. But its almost like you need to drop everything within reason to get toward that next point, because the habits are so ingrained within the mind that want to stop you from taking a path that is mysterious and out of the ordinary."

Just a heads up, I suffer from anxiety, and with the stress of the outer world bearing down extra heavy on us all, it has gotten a lot worse, though honestly, having lived with this condition for almost two decades, Ive gotten it under control for the most part, and so this is a pretty rare flare up, and Im actually rather pleased with myself! (However, because I am very self aware/high functioning doctors often overlook how bad my mental illness really is because I can act normal very well.) Anyways! Heres the background, and the problem; I (19f) draw to cope. I draw almost constantly. Usually, my own silly made up characters, mostly zombies and animals and stuff, but recently with the um everything thats been going on, and being separated from my friends, I have been drawing my friends *waaaaay* more because I miss them so bad. I have a friend (22m) I work with (we are essential workers) so weve been hanging out there, but also outside of work, with proper precautions. Weve always been really close - people often assume were dating, not because of any kind of PDA (neither of us are the type for that) just our dynamic and perceived chemistry. Our relationship is strictly platonic, yadda yadda, but he *is* admittedly an attractive guy, but that kind of doesnt mean anything to me really. Because hes the only person I can hang out with, and vice versa, weve gotten a lot closer, and Ive been drawing him a lot more. Now, I do have his permission to do this, so thats fine. For the most part, they are silly comics and very cartoony sketches. Like just doing an illustrated, four panel bit for a funny conversation we had, or whatever. Me and him ended up talking about my art for a while the other day, and how I make deliberate stylistic choices to represent each person (fictional or otherwise) I draw. He thought this was really cool, and he was especially interested in my choices in drawing him, so last night I made a sort of brief guide showing all of these choices I make when I draw him, so I could show him! This led to a bunch of other related drawings, some of which some could see as kind of intimate. Not sexual, or anything, the main thing/embarrassment is just as a sort of reference, not included in the guide, that showed him shirtless. Its really rather tame, and was for a separate reference I didnt want to include in the very PG main guide (however the picture is just his head + torso, to get the right shapes down and body hair patterns.) I know that sounds fine, and *probably* is!! I just get super nervous about any form of emotional vulnerability, having been shamed and bullied very badly growing up (by peers, teachers, and parents alike.)

I'm not overflowing with moxie, but I can hide most of my mental iceberg and can talk to people normally. Rather than look for help, I used to save face and lie to myself and other people that everything was going according to plan. But out of the blue, I reached out to a couple old coworkers. I don't know them well, but I knew they were ambitious people with confidence that I wanted, and I was tired. I let them know that I was struggling finding my dream, and I wanted to know theirs. One of them even let me know she's been in my place, keeping everything inside, and that her anxiety was only relieved by being honest with people about her struggles. You know, that's the silly thing about this. I admire her for being so confident talking about her own struggles. I don't think any less of her for it. She made me believe that being honest about my struggles was the key to regaining my confidence. But then I read a comment somewhere on Reddit insinuating that men who reveal their insecurities lose their value and disgust people. That just augmented my anxiety the right way. In my head, it made a little sense. Who wouldn't want someone who seems secure about everything, someone who doesn't come off as a burden? And now, I'm not so sure, even though I know I wouldn't lose any respect for a guy friend who asked for my help.

38,vulnerability,Advice,Finding myself again,1,he4dn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/he4dn7/finding_myself_again/,2020-06-23 10:32:23,"This is my first post here. I apologize for the lengthy text, but given the particular subreddit, I guess some context is needed... I turned 26 yesterday and I'm currently sitting alone in my Airbnb in a city just outside Vancouver, BC that I booked for my solo birthday trip. As some of you may also experience, birthdays are not always as celebratory as some make them out to be. I tend to feel heavy anxiety the night before followed by deep introspection, which often leads to shame, embarrassment, and feelings of failure. This year has been no different- I have sat around and thought about how my life has changed, or rather, how it has stayed the same. I question my lack of emotional development, mental fragility, financial failures amongst so many other small details that make me cringe. I do however feel a small spark that tells me I need to change. To give some idea of my life thus far, I will do my best to summarize landmarks that have shaped me into who I am today. I am a mixed-race (half Black, half Japanese), gay, male from Toronto. I come from a family of four other brothers and my parents are separated with their own kids. My parents and brothers lived in my grandma's house (some of my brothers and mom still do). My brothers and I shared a room, my parents in another (before my dad left), and my grandma in her room. My father introduced my family to Islam around the age of 4 until 6 before my parents separated. I remember that time feeling fear and embarrassment practicing something different than the middle-class white families that I went to school with. I guess I could say I felt the tension and anxieties surrounding the race, class, and religious divide between family and the community we lived in, as well as my sexual identity battle. These feelings are still present to this day, though do not punch me in the gut as hard as they used to. Fast forward a couple of years, my parents have split, I no longer practice Islam, I studied Taekwondo for six years and achieved my black belt, quit and started dance. This is where I began to find myself. I had a safe place to explore my identity and channel my emotions into movement. From my athletic background and eager desire to please (to this day I seek validation), I began to excel in dance. It became my life to the point that I decided to pursue it in college. After receiving a scholarship, taking out loans, and receiving absurd amount of financial help from my grandma, I moved to NYC and completed my BFA in Dance from a liberal arts college. Throughout those years I pushed myself harder than I thought I ever could. I worked hard, but not smart. I suffered from depression, anxiety, bulimia, alcohol abuse, and OCD (I saw the school counselor throughout the 4 years and the psychiatrist a couple of times), yet I pushed through and graduated. I finished my dance career before it even started. I was experiencing burnout from training in a way that harmed my health, never feeling confident in my ability no matter how many times my professors told me otherwise, neglecting to network because it seemed ""fake"" and I attributed success and connections solely on hard work. Every day I wonder what I could have been if I believed in myself (not only my dance ability, but also my academic voice and confidence to believe and stand behind something), took the time to take care of my mental health, engaged in extracurriculars, forgave my parents rather than blame them for the lack of emotional support or finances that I so closely compared to those of my peers, and practiced vulnerability amongst the many character flaws and skewed mindsets I would replace. It's been two years since I've graduated, and one year since I've moved back to Canada. After poorly handling the reality of failed dreams, a shit load of debt, and an open relationship, I moved out West to start fresh. Since moving away to Vancouver, I've worked hard on improving my mental state, which I feel like it's one of the first times in my life that I've made progress on my own. I don't regret the past, per se... I've learned to see it has hardships that make me who I am but I can't help myself from focusing on it. I dabble in the Brene Brown, Oprah, Ekhart Tolle text, which I have found quite helpful, but I can't seem to ""get out of my head"". I have been accepted to NYU to pursue my MA in Food Studies. I feel a strong pull to that field of food writing through my eating disorder past and racial identity exploration, but I don't feel the same connection as I did to dance. I feel fortunate to have started a hobby to evolved into a passion. I feel grateful to have studied and been around creative, empathetic, and artistic minds. I am lucky to have found strong camaraderie. I am almost 100% I do not want to pursue dance - I don't enjoy long rehearsals, my partnering has been, and will most likely be sub-par, and I don't have the creative confidence to participate in collaboration or choreography that is so often required. What if my mental illness that was holding me back weren't in the way of acquiring those qualities of a dancer? What if all I needed to do was to work on my mind as much as I worked on my physical craft? I am eager to return to school. It's something I have valued being the first college graduate in my family. With my deferral request until Spring 2021 looming over my head and my return to Toronto coming shortly, I am asking myself, and the Reddit community who have made it this far, what do I want? How will I get there? How will I start believing in myself? When will I believe my experience and education are worth more than minimum wage? How and when will I return back to the city that once made me feel so alive with a different mindset? This has been a very chaotic stream of consciousness and may even be deleted in few hours, but thank you to anyone who read through and my heart and spirit are with you if you have experienced anything similar."

If I am depressed, its in a way Ive never felt before. But in as little words as possible, I have slowly, over the course of this past year, cared less and less about the things that go on around me and the people in my life. I do still have fun and experience joy, but Ive grown incredibly distant from all things that used to provide emotional stimulus. I try to act normal, so I dont concern my friends, but the constant effort required to be empathetic, or emotionally available is leaving me more and more exhausted each day. Ever since I went through a tough breakup and lost a lot of friends through the process, Ive felt myself become more and more cold. At first I thought I was getting better because the sadness and hurt was fading. My invulnerability gave me confidence and had totally transformed my life in seemingly positive ways. But now, Im starting to feel that this is all a reaction to being hurt and that I might need to go back to therapy. Is my emotional armor putting too much distance between me and the people I love and have loved. Does anyone have any experience with this? If so, is it something thatll go away on its own? Is this lack of vulnerability a bad thing? I cant feel pain these days, but my joy and ability to relate to others limited (maybe)."

That's not the case here. I'm not sure how or why my cousin imprinted herself so deeply on me, or at such a young age. I'm also not sure why those feelings have never changed or why I've been unable to shake them. But this love is unlike anything else I have ever experienced, and it's been with me most of my life. It is immensely deep, immensely personal, and it's permanent. She and I are very close. We talk almost every day, video chat multiple times a week, and regardless of how much she means to me, I know I mean a lot to her too. I could go into story after story about the ways we've bonded over the course of our lives, the memories we've shared, and the vulnerability we've had. Our history is very long, and very special. But we're cousins, and beyond that intimacy, there's never been any actual indication that there was any sort of romance between us. Sure, I could point to all the things my heart *wishes* was evidencethere's a lot (like I said, we are close)but at the end of the day, I know in my mind that's a fantasy. It's tearing me up, and as we grow closer and closer, it hurts more and more. I feel as though it's coming to a head, and I need to make a choice. ------ **I've identified four possible courses of action:** 1. Cut her off. - ""I'm so sorry, but there are things going on in my life I can't tell you without hurting you. We can't talk anymore. I know you don't understand and I know this isn't fair. I'm so, so sorry."" - This seems like a bad approach; I fear it would hurt her the most. 2. Fade her out of my life. - Never initiate conversation, and slowly talk to her less and less until she hopefully... gets bored of me? - This is a possible approach; it would hurt me a lot, but hopefully hurt her less. 3. Do nothing, suffering in silence. - This is what I have been doing for the past 17 years, but it's getting hard. - I'm beginning to feel as though this is unfair to her. It's not fair for her if I keep her at arm's length but never tell her why, or to not explain why I'm sad some days [if it's about her]. It's also unfair to her, I think, if I pursue a closeness with her if she does not realize we are on different pages. It feels dishonest and almost exploitive. 4. Tell her. - Possibly necessary for me to find peace? - Very slim likelihood of reciprocation; will potentially cause us both extreme pain. - Will potentially be neither good nor bad (e.g. acceptance without reciprocation). ------ Option #1 seems cruel. Options #2-4 are all better choices, with option #4 being the most extreme and risky. In truth, Reddit, I just need guidance. Because we're related, this isn't like a normal relationship. With anyone else, I'd tell them how I feel (or at least ask them out on a date). I don't know if I should take that same approach with her. I know cousin relationships are fairly normal in most of the world and throughout history. There is also a taboo today [in the U.S.], but I don't know *how* taboo because I'm biased and can't look at the situation from the perspective of a neutral third party. Neither of us wants kids, so genetics are irrelevant. The legality of marriage is also irrelevantit's legal in my state, but that's just a piece of paper anyway. My main concern is what would go through her mind if I told her the truth. Would she see a love confession coming from me the same way she might see it coming from any other best friend? Or would it destroy her? I don't see reciprocation being likely (one can dream, I guess) but I also don't know if reciprocation would be necessary. Is there a high likelihood of our friendship remaining strong if I told her the truth? Does it even matter? I just don't know. If you made it this far, thank you so much for reading. As far as advice goes, I just ask that you be nonjudgmental and honest as you share your thoughts on my dilemma. I'm in a lot of pain, as you may have guessed, and anecdotes and personal feelings are all welcome. **tl;dr**I'm deeply in love with my cousin, but we're very close. I don't know how to break it to her, and I don't know how to *not* break it to her. Thank you."

And I have ADHD witch doesnt help the on the emotional regulation front. I study social work, this is a study where you have to be emotional vunerable during presentations a lot. Which is something I am unable to do, seeing even the smallest amount of vulnerability during an assessment is enough to have me crying my eyes out. Now as you might asume, this sucks. Not only do I get major head aches after crying, the logical part of my brian doesnt even think what I'm sharing is a big deal! but the emotional part of me feels the need to start crying when I have to explain how a class helped me in my development as a social worker. It feels like my body is stealing my voice. Most of it only happens during assessments, when I'm talking about the same stuff to friends or classmates or even the same teacher that is suppose to be grading me in a normal setting I might get a little shaky but I can at least manage. How do I change or at least grow up from this part of me? I've tried therapy twice (not specfilicaly for this problem but similar issues) and up until now it hasnt worked for me. I have great difficulty opening up to therapist because to me it often feels like they are just doing their job instead of actually being interested in me. What doesnt help is that because of my study I often recognise the methods they are using and then instantly tune out. Does anyone please have some advice for me on how to deal with this part of me? PS, I am sorry if my grammar is bad, english isnt my first language"

A lot. And it kind of pisses me off. Let me just say that he is not a BAD person. Hes helped me through some pretty rough times and I like being around him because I can fully be myself, no walls up, total vulnerability. We can talk about anything which I appreciate. And hes so INTERESTING. I love to have deep conversations but I, sadly, dont get to have them often enough. But while I really like this guy, I dont like everything he says or does. It particularly pissed me off when he started rating a group of girls who are sisters by how hot they are (and dont worry, I always call him out on this behavior). This isnt the first guy that Ive been attracted to like this either. Im always attracted to the know it all kind of guy who just says and does what he wants and doesnt really care what others think. I think this is because Im naturally a really caring person, so in a way being with this kind of guy is my way of fullfilling that life that Ive never made for myself. I know Im a lot better than to be attracted to someone like this! Im smart, kind, thoughtful, and strong. I deserve someone who cares more. But its like I cant HELP that I like him! What can I do? Do I cut off the friendship even though hes the one person I feel like I can be myself around?"
43,vulnerability,Advice,I seem to be a magnet for sexual assault and people just being absolute creeps and I don't know how to make it stop.,1,hijng9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hijng9/i_seem_to_be_a_magnet_for_sexual_assault_and/,2020-06-30 18:57:33,"No one knows about this issue besides my husband and he doesn't know the extent of it. I'm a 28 year old female, 5' 1, 80 lbs, and have a condition that makes me faint a lot so maybe vulnerability is related to it. I usually can stop myself from thinking about it but something came up recently and it made me realize it's affecting me more than I thought so here we are. Backstory on this particular incident: My husband is my age but has heart disease and a blood clotting disorder. He had to have his 4th heart surgery last year in a specialty hospital out of town. Because I can't drive with my fainting, and since we didn't have money for me to stay in a hotel near the hospital, I was dropped off in a town where I had long term friends. Friend 1 agreed that I could stay with them until my husband was released. Because of schedule differences, I was wandering from place to place (and fainting way more than usual because I was so upset) while my husband was in surgery and directly after. Surgery was supposed to take 3 hours but took over 7 so I was absolutely losing my mind. While waiting on friend 1 to wake up and let me come over, I found friend 2 and they paced back and forth with me while me and the CV-ICU called one another every 15 minutes or so. My husband's condition deteriorated after surgery and they couldn't get him on life support, I was told to rush there to say goodbye but there was no public transit. Thank God that ICU tried so hard because after manually resuscitating him all night they managed to get him on a ventilator after administering nitric oxide. Before they got him on the ventilator, all I wanted was to kill myself. I had already taken 9x my prescribed amount of anxiety medication trying to stop the panic. Friend 1 eventually woke up and let me in. In the course of my stay while on huge amounts of anxiety medications, I'm fairly certain they took advantage then somehow got me thinking that didn't happen. This situation alone is horrible to me because I knew them 15 years and they were once my best friend. What happened that's gotten me upset now and deciding I need to fix this: Got a Facebook message from friend 2. Wasn't much of a conversation before they propositioned prostitution to me. Then they go on to tell me they've been fantasizing about me since the night I was there, panicked out of my mind and mentioned I was ""hot as fuck"" and ""barely wearing anything but that's normal for you"". They were there for every call to and from the CV ICU. They knew I was desperate to be okay and that my husband was fighting for his life that night. He also personally knows my husband. To make it even worse, he tells me that when we stopped at his house for him to rest his legs and get a drink (we were pacing for hours) he masturbated into his pants with me a foot away. What the holy hell? I can't fucking stand this. Him mentioning my attire made me realize that these incidents are probably why I can't seem to get dressed. Since my husband's 4th and 5th surgery (he needed another one once he was out of the coma a few weeks later), I've worn my husband's big shirts and boxers as clothes. I don't shave my legs. I haven't worn makeup in a year. I rarely brush my hair. I didn't consciously do this as self defense, but I think that's what it is. I kept thinking I would feel so much better if I just dressed myself but then I would lay the clothes and makeup out and go ""ehhhh nope"". Since realizing this I've put on my clothes, btw. Can't let THAT be the reason. Anyways, I need advice on how to stop this crap. I had these sorts of issues as a child (why can't I say it ugh), at 16, at 20, at 24, and at 27. Not to mention how many ""friends"" have been total creeps but didn't actually DO anything to me. They are all people who knew me well, and aside from being a kid, they all knew I was with my husband (we've been together since we were 16) and that I'm fiercely loyal so there's no point in trying to get me to leave him or something. Too open about sex? Give them a false impression because I listen to their problems? I don't know but it has to stop. I can't take this anymore.... I feel so damn vulnerable and paranoid always. I feel guilty and betrayed at the same time. It all sucks and obviously it's a me problem or it wouldn't be a recurring problem. I don't even know what to include to give a good enough idea of who I am for people to help me figure out how to stop being a creep magnet. I guess the my questions will be : 1) how do you identify these people so I can avoid this? They almost always seem great for years first. 2) What things make someone a bigger target so I can try to camouflage that target?"
44,vulnerability,Advice,I (F) feel I've been taken advantage of and husband won't acknowledge it.

A little back story... my husband (31) has a friend (M 31) that he has known since they were young teenagers. A few years ago husband brings up that he and his friend used to hook up. I am totally cool with this, I'm glad he tells me. Eventually this leads to wanting a threesome with me, to which I am reluctant because this man is married (we went to his wedding husband was best man) but husband is always saying how they don't even like eachother, get along, or have anything in common. I guess that was about 6 or so years ago now. I wasn't very good at saying no, and was a total people pleaser. Anyway, a few months after he started bringing this up, he invited his friend over. This is maybe the 3rd time we've hung out. We're drinking, and listening to music, and eventually we do end up having a threesome. I DON'T remember how, and hardly remember it. I wake up feeling like absolute garbage. I don't say anything to husband because I got myself into this situation, and I don't want to upset anyone. This same situation happens again about 3 years later. I end up finally saying I don't feel comfortable with this and I hate how I feel after. I feel sick about it, and guilty. I tell husband I can't do this anymore. Husband is defending the act, I guess thinking it's not a big deal but I think it is. Continues to bring up the possibility of it happening again and defending the situation. I keep saying no but I guess I'm not being stern enough. Husband and I get a hotel on the beach for a romantic night away from kids, he invites friend and I say I'd rather it just be us but since you don't get to see him often sure. Again, I am too nice. They both try and I actually stood up for myself and said no. Something like this happens again a year or so later. I say no but not without them trying first. I am really against it at this point, and probably feeling very resentful towards them and the whole situation. While also blaming myself and feeling immense guilt and disgust. Fast forward 3 years later. Husband has brought it up still a few times, I am still against it. Invites him over this past weekend , because he has a kid now and wants to play with my kids. We drink a few beers, and are hanging out watching funny videos and listening to music. He starts to rub my feet and I am making obvious ""please make this stop"" faces at husband . I don't think he noticed that's what I was doing, I guess. I get up and husband asks me if I want to do this, I say no. I don't really remember much of anything else... husband says he starts rubbing my shoulders and kissing on my neck and puts his hands in my pants (I vaguely remember being shocked by this) and the next thing I remember we are all making out and I have gone down in him. I also remember getting up and leaving saying it was too late, but really because I guess I snapped back and I was feeling awful. I woke up feeling so disgusted with myself, and still feel that way. I am saddened my husband didn't stick up for me when I was in a serious state of vulnerability. He keeps wanting to take about it saying things like ""what changed your mind"" I let him know I didn't want to, I don't know wtf happened and I felt like he took advantage of me. He got really quiet and wouldn't talk about it anymore, seemed annoyed I would say that. So i guess i want to know, should i even be upset about this? I drank, and made poor decisions. But i cant shake this feeling of being taken advantage of, and it's making me feel sick. Please be kind , I know I made terrible choices."

46,vulnerability,Advice,I nearly drowned 5 days ago... and now I'm struggling to move on.,1,hjwh13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hjwh13/i_nearly_drowned_5_days_ago_and_now_im_struggling/,2020-07-02 22:54:12,"Hi there - first time poster here, coming with a heavy load. Sorry for the long post. The accident happened through a string of bad decisions (we tied our floaties together, the guy steering reacted incredibly slow, super strong current in the river...). I warned the guy that we're in danger but he said ""he had it under control"". Then, our floaties crashed with a bridge pillar pulling half the people (me, my new BF and two friend's of his) onto one side and the others (my housemate and an old friend of mine) onto the other. I had to jump into the river in order to avoid a bigger catastrophe but was sucked in by the current and swallowed a lot of water. Anytime I tried to inhale a new wave would break over me and I was only able to breath in like a 10-20% of air before being under water again. I knew that my strength was rapidly decreasing so I took all I had to scream for help and my life. Luckily the string holding the floaties together ripped, freeing the floaties from the pillar, which is when my friends realised, that I was in danger and paddled towards me. When my friend reached me, I was able to hold onto their floaty and started crying and screaming - because I knew in my heart, that I had maybe 1 minute or less before I couldn't hold myself up anymore and the current would have swallowed me. Everyone played it down at first - saying ""nothing happened"". The other friend of my NBF is a rescue diver and she continued saying that ""She could have saved me"" - but I know that I was already in a huge state of panic and would have drowned her with me, would she have managed to reach me. It took them forever to reach shore (I have a feeling they were considering of finishing the tour), while I was still crying and breathing short. It took me like 2 hours to start breathing normally and for my sister to pick me up and bring me to the ER (I also had to ask for my phone and call her since nobody thought of it). My NBF tried to calm me down but was completely overwhelmed and only my old friend was able to calm me down a little, while waiting for my sister. Once my sister arrived she realised immediately that I was under shock (I was cold to the touch and talking really slow and and whispering). Everyone in hospital said how lucky I was - they checked my lungs and blood and yeah physically I am/was fine. However the shock and fear seems to linger in my body. I feel like the people involved didn't take it serious at all - maybe they thought I overreacted or that the rescue diver could have saved me (which I'm very doubtful about). But I've been in life threatening situations before (shootings, mentally unstable father who's nearly caused frontal crashes on highways and has attacked me violently, and once I had to run for my life while being chased by two men) - but I've never felt so vulnerable and scared and panicked in my life. I've been crying every day since the accident, sleeping a lot and feeling just generally super exhausted and sad. Also disappointed - because I feel that the people who should have taken care of me didn't really (also the guy who caused the accident didn't check up on me for 4 days). The situation made me lose trust in the people around me - also in people in general, because I feel that I am generally a person that acts fast in a dangerous situation and always jumps in to help/rescue others. (Maybe I need to give credit here first to my sister who's my hero and to my NBF who stayed in the ER with me until 3am, sleeping on the floor and my friend who's been checking in daily (he first thought I was overreacting, since he's seen me having drunk meltdowns before but when I told him that's not like the other times he took me serious, held me and helped me regain a semi-stable breath - he's also offered to gift me a life vest)). Now I'm struggling to move on and feel calm again. I am really worried that it's been yet another super traumatic event in my life that might crush me. I'm generally a person with a lot of energy, joyful and funny. My friends like to say that I'm the ""advocate of vulnerability"" - since I like talking about difficult/emotional things - an ability that has proven to help/heal others, too. But now I feel there's nobody but my therapist and sister ready to have that conversation. I know it's overwhelming and hard to digest. Has anyone experience with such a situation? Any advice on how to regain life lust again? Any ideas on how to heal and/or forgive? I also don't want to be a burden on my friends with such a heavy topic - which is why I'm reaching out to the community. TL;DR: I nearly drowned and feel like people aren't ready for a serious conversation on responsibility and life threatening risk, while also trying to heal myself from the trauma."
47,vulnerability,Advice,Whats the best way to get over someone?,1,gdouu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gdouu7/whats_the_best_way_to_get_over_someone/,2020-05-05 11:48:50," So fair warning Im not trying to give my life story or garner sympathy here but I feel like some of this is important for context. Basically, I spent most of my life dealing with mental health issues and being really afraid of vulnerability and people in general so I went to great lengths to never share too deeply or get emotionally intimate with anyone despite really badly wanting to. I was just really afraid of ending up in a situation of bad emotional pain I think and I also believed I wasnt worthy of that kind of connection or that I would wind up wronging someone in some way. Because of this, at 22 Ive never had a girlfriend or even a super close friend that I tell everything to. Anytime a girl expressed that they liked me in some way or wanted to get to know me better Id distance myself. However, after hitting a particularly low point, I ended up going to a mental health treatment center for two months and met some really great people there that I allowed myself to get close with and form close bonds with. It was awesome, best experience of my life and it taught me a lot about myself and the importance of having people like that in your life. Among them was a girl who was was the person I got closest with and was honestly to me was the perfect person. Very kind, empathetic, warm, I could go on and on about how great she was but she had this quality that I cant really describe, we just clicked I guess and she seemed to really like me platonically, though would mention often that I was attractive and compliment me on my personality or character. We got very, very close and she seemed to really care about me. It got to the point that I felt totally comfortable sharing anything and everything about myself with her. Once it got closer to me having to go back home she told me often how sad it made her that I was leaving, how much shed miss me, etc etc and we spent a lot of time together. I should also mention that she had borderline personality disorder. At this point I shouldve known better because my mother suffers from the same disorder. After leaving, she called me everyday for months and wed talk for long periods of time, hours. I cant even describe how great of a feeling it was to just have someone care about me on that level and actually want to talk to me so much. At one point, out of nowhere, she said shed have to stop talking to me because she had romantic feelings for me and she was weird with guys she was romantically interested in. I of course didnt understand this, I had feelings for her as well and to me it seemed like a good reason to keep in contact if anything and I wanted to pursue that feeling for once because I really liked her and had gone through enough emotional growth to not be afraid of it. Anyways, it really killed me. Looking back I shouldve just left it at that but she kept calling and texting me and I persisted because I was so afraid of being alone again and we kept talking. Months go by and all is well, she still calls me everyday tells me that talking to me is the best part of her day and I tell her I feel the same way. Then things start to break down, I start having to be the one to initiate conversation, she seems to start to be more distant, over text I start upsetting her without me even realizing what I did. Then we talk on the phone and shes happy, telling me I should come see her, that she wishes I was there, all this stuff. Eventually she calls me and tells me she got back together with her ex. I ask her if we should keep talking, if talking to me is a good or bad thing because I didnt want to be anything negative to her, etc etc and she responds that its up to me and that she feels neutral about it. I get the hint and it sends me into a bit of a breakdown, looking back Im a bit pissed off that I let myself get so weak but one of her main things was that she was afraid of abandonment and I have a very low sense of self worth and tend to feel like I have nothing but a negative impact on people so I felt that I had really wronged or hurt her in some way. I texted her and expressed that I was sorry if I hurt her in some way and was sorry that I had done something to make her start to dislike me so much seemingly overnight and that I didnt understand, and she responded simply with stop. Im so embarrassed about that now because looking back its so clear that at that point she simply didnt care about me at all. I dont want to seem melodramatic but that hurt me really, really bad. I spent the next month just drinking and taking Xanax and oxycodone and laying in bed almost every day after that. Its four months later and that was the last I heard from her, and looking back I realize that the whole thing was just unhealthy and I feel like Im making too much of it since we werent even really dating, but I just wish I would hear from her and know that shes doing well and that she cares about how Im doing. I told her things Ive never told anyone, and it was closer than Ive ever been to anyone. It just felt so good to have such a deep emotional connection with someone. Now I feel more alone than ever and its even worse than it was because now I know what Im missing out on. Again, I dont want to seem overly sentimental or anything, but I truly loved her as a person. I dont know that I was necessarily in love with her but its the closest Ive gotten. The whole thing has left me so confused. In one way, its a confirmation of my fears of being vulnerable with people and Im sort of mad at her though I realize she has mental health and emotional issues as well and its not her fault, if anything its my fault, but in another way Im also grateful to her for showing me how positive it can be to open yourself up to others and for giving me such a great experience when it wasnt tumultuous. Either way, I still find myself thinking about her often and I really thought Id be over it by now. The hurt has definitely lessened, but shes still on my mind often and I still worry about her. Ive never been in this situation before so I guess I just dont know what the timeline is for something like this. Is there a rough estimate of when I might get over this completely? Is there any way I can stop ruminating over what I couldve done differently or stop worrying about the emotional pain I may have caused her? I realize that she probably really dislikes me now and that makes it a bit easier, but I still hold out hope that she might check up on me at some point or let me know that shes doing alright. I dont know, at one point she expressed to me her general distrust in people and attachment and I feel like I made that worse for her and I wish I could make it right. I just wish I could be over this, its made me feel really weak and immature and uncertain about myself. And the the worst part is that this has been such a huge thing for me because of how much Ive distanced myself from people my whole life while it probably meant absolutely nothing to her. Tldr - Was very afraid of being emotionally vulnerable with people, met a girl at a mental health treatment center that I got close with, we dont talk anymore and I want to get over it"

No matter how hard I try to make myself disciplined, and to convince myself I am in control of my emotions, it just doesnt work. Instead I just have to lay down and try to prevent myself from hyperventilating while I sob. The harder I try to get a hold of myself, the more I lose control. Ive felt intense loss lately and its difficult to hang out with people without tearing up. A thought will pop up in my head and I just cant help but to cry. And I quickly and subtly wipe my tears so I dont have to explain why Im so sad. My problems are always the same, my friends are probably tired of hearing me talk about how I once again self sabotaged the good things in my life. I dont want to burden anyone with my sadness, make them worry about me, and because I am repulsed by my own vulnerability I dont reach ouch.

I thought I came a long way with my growth but now Im having to face the issue that Ive been avoiding my whole life- intimacy and vulnerability. Its easy for people to feel close to me but its extremely difficult for me to be close with others if that makes sense. I dont know, I just never feel comfortable with fully opening up with people. This back up of emotions is going to blow up in my face sooner or later because I can feel it and Im worried. Ive also become super detached and I was glad at first because I thought it was good thing to not be bothered and not care but now I think Im detaching for the wrong reasons. Ive dealt with depression before so I think thats what this is but it just feels so different than before. The minute I get worked up and want to cry or even work through how Im feeling to just let it out, my body literally stops me and I just dont! This usually never happens but since Im becoming more numb by the day and doing all of this pretending, its making it hard for me to open up. A part of me is scared that being completely vulnerable will scare people of or make them worried about me and I hate that feeling. I want to express my emotions without being scared Ill be looked at differently. Another part of me worried that being this detached will also make people leave too. Maybe Im just projecting how I think people will react. I really dont know anymore. What should I do?"
50,vulnerability,Advice,How do I make friends with people who genuinely understand me?,1,gh0qbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gh0qbw/how_do_i_make_friends_with_people_who_genuinely/,2020-05-10 22:35:47,"We all yearn for those friends who we actually resonate with, not the 'social media' superficial friends. The type of friend we can call up at 3am when we need help. The type of friend who stands by us at the highs as well as the lows. Do you have any more insight? So far, I have tried the following: **1) Be yourself.** It's all about vulnerability. It is less about changing yourself to meet the ideals of what you think someone else would like, instead try to be unapologetically yourself and you will attract people who genuinely value you for you. **2) Reach out.** Comment on people's Facebook posts or reply to people's Instagram stories - both great ways to reconnect with old friends in an engaging way. **3) Friendship apps.** These are so good! Everyone is actually open to making new friends! I have used a lot and my personal favourite is [Serendip](URL \- it matches you with people who resonate with your personality. Others include [meetup](URL but probably better for post lockdown! **4) Video calls.** Scheduling catch up calls with existing friends is a great way to strengthen your bond. When we can't meet in person due to lockdown, a voice or video call has much more depth than a text message. Please comment below if you have other suggestions :)"
51,vulnerability,Advice,I truly need some advice on my relationship. Please don't let this post die.,1,gi3yn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gi3yn6/i_truly_need_some_advice_on_my_relationship/,2020-05-12 14:23:00,"Please don't let this post die. First of all, this is a loooooong anecdote to read, so if you suddenly stopped whatever you were doing to pay attention to my story and hopefully help me gain some fresh perspective, let me tell you that I truly appreciate it and I'll take your answers into account before making my decision. Thanks in advance strangers. Everything started about three years ago. I was at home and suddenly I had the determination to start doing exercise because after finishing studying my engineering at college I just felt like I wasn't doing anything for my body (devoting my time and life to college resulted in not having the chance to have fun, especially because it was life-absorbing but worth it 'cause you know, it paid off). and I just had this crazy idea of going to the gym as soon as I thought of it. So I just got ready, grabbed some money, and headed to my target (that's the way I am, I envision something one day and if I really want it, I start doing it). So I met this man (oh yes, the source of my problems). At first glance, he didn't seem like a person you would trust, but I felt so attracted to him that I just overlooked my gut. Physically, he looks exactly like Jon Hamm but with a glorious body and beautiful arms. He was the first person I met there, he helped me register, we kinda flirted. He said that the owner wasn't there but he would do the paperwork in his place, but I responded like ""you look like the owner"". After I said that he smiled and silently gave me the ticket of my subscription. He made a mistake when typing my name on the ticket before printing it out as he was giving me information about how things worked there, I noticed that and told him about said observation, he replied to me by saying I made him feel nervous, I just ignored it and started doing cardio. After a few minutes, I saw a beautiful lady in her 40s coaching people inside; I rapidly assumed that she had something to do with the person I met. And I wasn't wrong at all. Turns out they were a married couple with three children, two of them were around my age at that time (I was 23), and a 12 year old girl. And of course, he was the owner of the place. As the days and months went by, I figured out many things about them. Since it was a family business, I got the chance to meet all of the members of what it looked like a strong and imposing family. I consider myself a pretty attractive woman; beautiful face, long hair, my body has always been desirable by many people including women (nice curves and proportions and everything is where it should be). And on top of that, I'm extremely good at talking to people, I have a certain magnetic vibe that allows people to talk to me and to feel comfortable when I am around them. I also see myself as a caring and loving girl, that's how my close friends and family describe my personality and I agree with them. I am very sociable but pretty selective. I know how to talk to people but that doesn't mean that I trust them. What I'm saying is relevant to this because of the way I knew almost everything about that family. They liked me, they trusted me, they talked to me a lot and we got closer. As I was forming a nice bond with all of them, I felt more and more attracted to this man (let's call him Joel). But again, there was this feeling of not trusting him so present inside that I tried to avoid thinking about him the way I was (you know, I wanted him to fuck me so bad). I always pretended I didn't like him and I tried to avoid talking to him more than needed, I would ask him a few things about they way I was lifting weights and that was it. And that's what had happened over the course of two or three months. That wonderful routine of working out and talking to nice people had stuck with me for quite a while and I embraced it. I loved it and didn't think too much about Joel. I used to go in the afternoons because I chose another career to study and started working in the mornings as well. So one night, I finished working out, said goodbye to my acquaintances and left the place. The good thing is that my house wasn't that far away so I just had the chance to do some cardio on my way home instead of driving. But before leaving, I noticed that Joel had left before I did. I started jogging and after passing by two blocks, I saw him standing and looking at me, he smiled at me I stopped to say hello. I got a little closer to ask him what he was doing there, but all of a sudden he wrapped his arms around my body to make sure I wouldn't escape and he kissed me. I didn't do that much because I didn't want to be kissed, well, yes I wanted to since the first day I met him, but it felt kind of awkward to me because I wasn't used to his wild and wet way kissing. So yeah, that shit happened. After kissing me, he asked me if I wanted to go inside his house (one of his houses). I just said no and told him I had to leave. We said goodbye and I continued my way as normal. The next day I pretended that nothing happened and worked on my routine as always. I talked to people like I normally did, and he was there, he was looking at me and I couldn't help but feeling kinda nervous because he was around. So I realized I sort of felt for him. I really wanted him to kiss me again. I really wanted to experience being with him and I wanted to see how everything would end. That's how this thing started. After a few days, I left the gym and I noticed that he was inside his car, he chased me and stopped to pick me up. As soon as I got in the car we started making out. He really wanted to fuck me and I got really horny, I just fell for it. Kiss after kiss, touch after touch. Everything felt so good, so wild, every frickin' time I remember that night I still get wet just by thinking about it. He wanted to take me to a place where we could have sex. But I said no. I was just playing with him but it was late and I had to get ready for the next day. So he drove home, he hugged me and left. After one week we were able to finally fuck properly. His pp is loooong and thick and his body naked looks even better than with clothes on. What can I say? We looked good together, and we did many things together without his wife even noticing. Without anyone around even thinking about it. It was perfect alibi for us. I truly enjoyed it. That's the way we lived for almost a year. I started feeling something towards him. I fell in love, I got to the point in which it wasn't only about fucking. It was about the conversations we had, it was all about feeling that he really cared about me and of course, his personality, which is pretty similar to mine. I have to point out that as our relationship (whatever the fuck it was) started getting stronger, his marriage started to fall apart. I would often see them argue or some times they didn't even talked. She started to behave in a very shady ass way (it doesn't matter who was in front of her), but she treated me well. And there was another exception to this behavior, it was one man of my age that was a good friend of that family. But they behaved in a strange way when they were together, they would exclude me from their conversations and he would give her many gifts like bracelets and cakes. At first I didn't pay too much attention to that. But their odd relationship made sense after a while. I also want to say that at some point I met Joel's mother and she was around almost all the time. She and I formed this beautiful friendship and we both loved each other. We would go out for dinner, or we would go to dance, I was usually kind of her secretary and I would help her with some stuff and vice versa, she would take everywhere and she would trust me her intimate and delicate secrets. She loved me and she knew about my relationship with her son. She would talk to me about everything in their life. She mentioned that Joel wanted to be with me, she also mentioned that he didn't want to have children again but when he met me I changed his mind. And I confirmed what she said because he actually asked me once about how I would take an unexpected pregnancy. I just said without even thinking that I would abort. But well, I gave that answer because what can you get from being the other woman instead of being in a formal relationship, right? After a while he insisted, he told me about his desire to have a baby with me, he started talking about living together with me. And his mother mentioned that she didn't like Joel's wife. In fact, she hated her. Thet had been together for more than 20 years but she never trusted her, not even once. And she wanted me as a part of their family. So, as I was telling earlier, this couple's marriage started to fall apart. He was suspicious of her and her behavior and his children stopped talking to him, in fact they started showing certain tendencies that a psychologist would detect as not normal and necessary to be treated by a professional in therapy. This gorgeous 12 year old girl really liked to be with me, and tried to avoid being around her mom at all costs. She even felt scared any time she showed up. Things started to be fucked up. I was just a witness of the fall of this family. And not only a witness, but I felt guilty as natural. After I saw how each other's attitude gradually started to change, Joel and I started to have some problems as well. We got to a point in which we stopped talking. We had our own problems, so we stopped. But his mom never stopped talking to me. She would tell me about their problems and how shitty the situation went in their family. Joel didn't want to continue living with this woman and she was just spending so much money on things he never saw in his house but were reflected in his credit card. As that was happening his children detected a monetary gap between benefits and the cash register. Joel and I stopped talking for a few weeks but then he approached me and asked me if I was able to find information from a cellphone he got from his wife (I'm a software engineer), and I said yes. I unlocked it, I saw that she deleted messages and many shits that I was able to get back after working on it. So I could find out that she was cheating on him with not only the man I mentioned earlier, but with other four or five men as well. I recuperated many recent messages, pictures and calls. So I sent the information to him. And that was it. That was the end of their relationship. But this shit gets even darker. She was torturing this little girl by raping her with this man who was supposedly a friend of the family. And not only him, but she would fuck with other men and take them to one of their houses along with HER DAUGHTER to rape her. And it was happening for YEARS. So she was traumatized but she never mentioned anything until the day that Joel discovered all the truth about this bitch. He forced her to leave his house, and nobody saw her again. She was also talking shit about her husband to his other sons and all of them were planning to escape thanks to all the shits that she told them about Joel. According to his children, she never mentioned anything about me. So at the end of this problem, he was looking for an excuse to leave her and vice versa. But this twisted bitch had a different intention and a REAL mental problem. She would also combine food recipes with some other shit when cooking for him. She apparently wanted to kill him? I don't know but according to Joel, he started feeling better as he stopped eating from what she was making at home, he would often feel sick and nauseous, and had some other symptoms after eating what she would make. That started happening that year. So this shit happened, and Joel just couldn't handle it, it was too much for the family to handle. It was too much for them to realize that the real source of the problems was his wife and not him. His thoughts were only focused on one thing: killing this woman. He really wanted to kill her. But since that day, nobody saw her again. He tried to contact as many people as possible, he desperately tried to find her. But she and her lover ran away together. So I was the only the person on Earth who could make him feel better and I was the one person who could calm him down for a bit during the day. I tried to help him as much as possible with all this situation. I told him that he should focus on his family instead, because all of them needed each other. Btw, that same day he found out about the truth, he closed the gym (he was getting tired of it and he just wanted to be free from that, and what had happened turned into the perfect excuse to do it). After one month, he kind of felt a little bit better, I mean, he was desperate to find her but I sort of managed to make him feel better. He also focused on his daughter because she really needed help. After some time he started talking to me about all the plans that he previously mentioned to me. That he wanted to be with me, that he wanted to have children, and that he loved me. At that time I started trusting him, and I realized that I wanted the same things. I really wanted to have a baby with him and I wouldn't mind if we spent the rest of our lives together. So we started making it formal between us. It was too early to talk about me to his children, so he didn't. And I didn't say a thing to my family either. It was just between us for now. The last day I saw him I discovered that he was in the house of a woman, I tracked his location and found out. So I called him many times until he got out of the house and told him to pick me up because I wanted to talk to him. I just got jealous and my trust disappeared. I asked him what he was doing there, he said that the woman he was visiting needed some help with a car that she wanted to sell. But the reality was that he used to fuck with her before we met. So what the fuck was he doing inside HER HOUSE when we started planning our life together? That really hit me hard. And I told him that if he really wanted to be with me that relationship with her and any other woman had to stop. So he said yes, he drove me home and he left. I never saw him again. Not even a call, not even a message, all the family left. They even changed their phone numbers, there was nothing, not a single trail. I couldn't even contact his mother. And on top of that, they don't like social media, none of them. He didn't even have a FB account. I was the only tech-savvy there. So what about our plans? What about all our future together? What about the formality? What about our future baby? There was nothing. He didn't say anything, he left and I just got depressed for one year. All that year was a mess, I just wanted to be at home, I didn't want to eat, I didn't want to work, I was just dead inside. And nobody noticed it because I am good at hiding those things. So I just had myself. I stopped seeing my friends. I just wanted to be alone. No addictions, nothing like that. I didn't even try to fight my depression. Probably one of the things that kept me alive was my family, my nephew and my niece that I adore, my loving mother and father and my siblings. They kept me alive. Nobody knew about what I had inside my head, but they really helped. And most importantly, there was this feeling inside of me of him coming back that helped get through this. There was still hope. I didn't do things wrong and the circumstances were awful. So I thought that all that shit made them move to another city o some shit like that. After that year of suffering and telling myself that he would come back, I just gave up on that stupid fantasy. And that moment I gave up on him, I started to do things for myself; I started going out, I started meeting new people, I traveled around the country, I went to concerts, I started working more, I earned lost of money and I started to feel better, I gave up on him but I really started to enjoy my life and I did many things that make feel proud of myself because I was truly successful at what I wanted to do. I also met other men and I gave them the opportunity to go on a date and to share a little bit of our lives. It was good, I'm not gonna lie, but I never felt anything, there was attraction, yes, but that was it, we would fuck (I had to fulfill my needs), but the next day I didn't feel anything except for sexual ""satisfaction"". Those men would contact me after because they wanted to see me again, but I said no and goodbye. Even with those good things happening to me I would just spent a good part of my time thinking about Joel. I gave up, but I was still thinking about him. I wanted to know if he was still alive, if he was ok, I wanted to know if his mom, his daughter and all his family were alright. The answer to many questions like why he left and why he didn't tell me he was leaving was never answered. I just wanted the best for him and I wouldn't have minded if he was dating someone else as long as I knew it. After almost a year, he found my FB account and sent me a message (I don't usually use FB but every month I check my messages, I don't even have the app installed), so after a trip to a concert (Muse was touring but they went to a different city in my country so my friends and I bought flight tickets last October and went) I checked my messages, and I just found out that he sent me a message, the thing is that he created an account and found me. We chatted for a bit and he told that he and his family were living in a different city (I wasn't really surprised). I was glad that all of them were doing well, specially the girl, they took her to therapy, and she started feeling much better. She's a badass girl. She's kicking it. He asked me if I was dating someone else, I said no and he told that he wanted to see me, to talk to me and share his life with me. I blindly said yes. So after two weeks he came to the city and I saw him, I saw his family (they attended a funeral), he introduced me to all his relatives as his girlfriend and his family I knew were happy to see me, and his mother was there, too. He told me about all those plans that we had together, he invited me to live with him and spend our lives together. And I said yes. That was all I really wanted. I'm young but that was all I wanted to do, and what a better person to spend my life with than him. So I talked to my mother, I told her the essential information (I mentioned the huge difference in age) but she was ok with that, my older siblings didn't agree with my decision but they didn't interfiere and my dad was ok. I asked him to give me some time to get ready (by that time I had gotten two jobs) and I wanted to leave things the right way. Months went by and I just started to sense his irresponsibility again. He didn't answer most of my calls, he disappeared for a month because he was working, I saw him twice and then he disappeared again. Then he would come back to say that our plans were still intact but he was busy. That's what happened until last March (this was days before the lockdown in my country), I wanted to see him so I invited him to a trip I was planning to take because I needed to pick some documents in a different city. He said that there was no problem with that and that he was glad that I invited him and that it was unexpected. I asked them to confirm because he was busy and I had to organize all my stuff before leaving, he said he would confirm in three hours. He had me waiting for more than six hours so I called him many times. He never picked up the phone. I texted him saying that I wanted to confirm if he was going with me or not so that we could buy the flight tickets together, I wasn't rude at all, but he took it the hard way and got pissed because all I wanted was to confirm and do things TOGETHER. He said that he wasn't going with me and didn't answer my messages afterwards. That wasn't my intention. I didn't mean to make him feel pissed. So we didn't talk for weeks. I tried to contact him many times but successfully failed. Then I contacted his mother, explained the whole situation to her and she said that she would talk to him. She did it, she talked to him, they went to the city to visit me and he told me that they were going to take a trip together due to some businesses but he would come after that to take me to his house in the other city where all his family lives. I said it was fine. They left and I waited for a month. We went to live together to his house but it only lasted one week. ONE WEEK. He promised me that we would do everything together, he promised me that we would work together. He promised many things. So when we arrived we had a blast the first day, they gave me a little tour of the house, I took my stuff to our bedroom, we got together, his family accepted me, we fucked that day. We had a wonderful time together. The next day he got drunk while I was working (yeap, home office, I kept my jobs just in case, it was the perfect time to work from where I was, and the perfect time to leave, thanks quarantine) and started to listen to music alone, he was enjoying his drinks. So I finished working and went to where he was, he was sitting and from what I saw he started getting emotional. He told me about how he felt and some other less important stuff about his life. But then, all of a sudden, he asked me about those almost two years without knowing anything about me. I was going to answer with all my honesty and tell him all I lived but then he stopped me to tell me that he asked a friend of his to watch me. He was told that I was dating someone else at that time (which is true, I dated like four men during that time). After he asked me, I was going to tell him what happened (I didn't really have to because it was my life and from the moment he left without telling me I was in all my right to do whatever I wanted, those two years would have been totally different if he had the responsibility to tell me that he was going to abandon me) he stopped me and told me that he didn't really want to know. Then he fell asleep. I was waiting for that exact opportunity to tell him how I felt, but unfortunately he stopped me and I lost my chance that day. Then he woke up, took a shower, we had dinner and went to bed. We talked, we fucked, and when we were doing so, he got a phone call from a WOMAN. He ignored it and we continued but he was kind of distracted by that call and he didn't cum. As a result of it I didn't cum either. I kind of ignored it as well and I didn't ask him about her. I just forgot. But the next day, his mother invited me some drinks and we got drunk. We talked about our lives, she had questions, I answered with honesty, then Joel came in and I told him to sit next to me so that I can answer to his question of what I did during that time skip. Everything you readers know is what I told him; how I felt, how I gave up, how I started doing things for myself, how I dated some other guys and how much I still missed him. He seemed to understand. And his mom was comprehensive and she even cried. I cried while telling them what happened. I actually thought that he was going to understand what I felt and love me even more. But that didn't happen. He didn't like what I said (he didn't like my FUCKING HONESTY for God's sake). So we went to sleep and problems started coming and coming. The first day we discussed about working on our own projects together, I told him about my vision and ideas, but he was thinking about another idea that he had. So the following days he would spend hours talking to people on the phone about said idea. He was arranging everything but he never included me. I tried to get close to him to support him in what he was doing but got mad and said that I was trying to dominate him and that I wasn't useful for what he was going to do. That hit me hard. We were going to make plans together but he just excluded me. That made me feel disappointed. I was just trying to lend a helping hand. That same day he started to act suspiciously. He was using one of his cellphones to text someone, and then he left the house to talk on the phone. After a while I followed him and saw that he was talking on the phone with someone, I didn't get too close and kept my distance. When he finishes talking I asked if he was talking to this woman from the other day and he got pissed. He really got pissed because I asked that. But he didn't even explain anything about her, he just got mad and started to talk nonsense. Then he calms down and we come back to the house. After that, we didn't talk too much. I got even more disappointed. I definitely didn't like that. It made me feel like he wasn't taking me seriously. The next day he woke up after me, he saw me cleaning but he asked ""what are you doing?"". I answer like ""what you see is what doing"". That just came out of my mouth (probably because I was still mad at what had happened the night before). And he took it like the worst response ever. He mentioned that if one of his children had told him that, he would have slapped him in the face. That intimidated me, I apologized but it was too late. He didn't talk to me afterwards. That same night I wanted to talk to him about the situation and we almost ended up fighting. As I sensed it, he almost wanted to kill me. He misinterpreted everything I had told him and he was pissed because I started crying. I told him that I would leave the next day and left the room. I basically ran to his mother's bedroom to tell her about what had happened and she said that if that was going to happen again, it wasn't convenient for me to stay. She also said I was being too kind to him and if it were her situation, she would have left already. The next day he drove me home, and he said that he wanted to take me to another place for a month, he also mentioned that there were many things that he didn't like about me and he would expect me to analyze it and then would come back to pick me up and leave where he wanted to go. I wonder what he didn't like about me. He didn't like the wonderful way I treated his children? He didn't like how organized I was? He didn't like that I helped everyone clean the house? He didn't like that I asked him to to tell me what he wanted from me? He didn't like my honesty when I got drunk? He didn't that I asked him directly about that woman that insisted on calling him? He didn't like that I wanted to support him with what he was doing? He didn't like my vulnerability of crying when I wanted to be honest about my feelings? He didn't like that I wanted to hug him when he was talking on the phone? I don't know what kind of shit he didn't like. I accept that my tone was rude when I answered him ""what you see is what I'm doing"". But that's it, I don't fucking know what else he didn't like... Since he left, he hasn't answered my messages (he just read them). And that's it. (He tends to avoid our problems and after a while he comes back). I would like to talk to him about how I'm feeling right now. I want him to explain to me me if we're still going to continue or not. I want to tell him that I want to give him another chance to do something better as long as he stops talking to that woman. I want to tell him how disappointed I felt with all this. I want to define if we still continue or not. If not it's ok, even if I get fucking depressive at least I will know that it's OVER and will definitely change a lot. I don't want to feel the same uncertainty that I felt when he left me two years ago. I can do whatever I want, and now I feel so capable of looking for him to talk about this. It's been more than a week since the last time I saw him. I don't know where he is, but I'm sure I can find him now. He cannot escape this time. I'm tired of waiting, I'm tired of letting him decide when I have the right to decide what I want FOR ME NOT FOR HIM. As I mentioned before, I will truly appreciate if you got to this point and take some other time to give me some advice."
52,vulnerability,Advice,"Am I being a crybaby about getting almost jumped, and any advice for me to get over an incident like almost getting jumped by a gang?",1,gi7inl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gi7inl/am_i_being_a_crybaby_about_getting_almost_jumped/,2020-05-12 18:54:22," What happened to me last fall was I drove to my girlfriends place. My girlfriends area is literally one of the most dangerous neighborhoods of America, and I was just some 18 year old college kid at the time. I wasnt stupid whenever I would visit the area, like always keeping my car doors locked, staying aware of my surroundings, not look like Im scared to death to be driving in that neighborhood. Usually, I stay in my car and wait till my girlfriend comes outside to open her front door for me, but one time her mom was waiting for me to get out of the car instead of waiting for my girlfriend to come outside to pick her up. I decided to start waiting outside her front door whenever I would pick her up or visit her place, Just to be respectful if her mother wanted to meet me or not. Ive done this a couple times since my girlfriend would only take like a minute to open the door and let me in. However, this time on a Sunday around 6pm, I was waiting outside for my girlfriend or anybody else in her house to open the door for me. This is at Chicago in the fall so it gets dark around 5-6pm, but either way I thought nothing would bad happen, I mean its only 6pm, usually most deaths or tragic events happen late at night. so I thought nothing bad would come up. As Im waiting outside her door, I hear a group of people walking at a distance from my girlfriends street. once one of them in the group yells: HEY! KEEP LOOKING AT THAT SIDEWALK!, I turn and see that theres around 6 guys and two girls with empty bottles with the main guy yelling at me holding something in his pocket. I was starting to get a little scared in my head which was the worst thing I couldve done, because I became frozen in fear looking down on the sidewalk. As they kept going closer I could hear their footsteps getting faster and the one of the guys in the group saying: Yeah we got em and the group shouting at me but not too loud where neighbors could hear them. The buff dude with a red doorag kept yelling at me the same thing about looking at the sidewalk and to not move. I started to panic and I started to think about calling the police, but I knew it would be no good because the police cant come in seconds, so I kept calling my girlfriend so she can open the door, she wouldnt answer. I kept calling her at least 3 times and was always left on voicemail. right when that group got at least a 4-5 feet distance from me, my girlfriend opens the door all happy and I storm into her house to get inside and lock the door. I was so scared they were going to try to bang on her door at that instant, but they didnt. They got all quiet, and walked past the house as if nothing happened. I was really scared even being inside the house after the group of 6-8 guys and 2 girls walked past the house. I needed 15 mins to calm myself down to even talk to my girlfriend about it. I dont know if I was panicking and maybe just overreacting to what happened in that incident I believe you always get that gut feeling that something isnt right and when someone or a group of people are being shady and have bad intentions towards you. Ever since this incident, I could never feel fully safe in my house, and I live in a very safe suburb. And everytime I see someone getting hurt really bad in real life, I start getting flashbacks to when that incident happened. Thankfully, I havent gotten any nightmares or flashbacks about the incident since February, but a lot of times Im still super anxious about my safety and everytime I have the feeling of vulnerability physically, I get frozen in fear or start to panic a lot in my head. I never had gotten into any incidents like fighting or confrontations ever since, so I think that might be why I havent fully had a big panic attack. However, nowadays I would not want to sleep because I would worry if someone ever would try to break in to my house. Any advice on how to get over incidents like this or am I just being a crybaby?"
53,vulnerability,Advice,How do I get better at letting go of grudges / mentally resolving past issues?,1,gj4rxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gj4rxg/how_do_i_get_better_at_letting_go_of_grudges/,2020-05-14 04:35:40,"TL;DR: title, but specifically in the context of a relationship where I keep holding mistakes against my boyfriend. Even if not directly, I still feel the bad feelings towards him in myself and I want to truly let go. How do I process and resolve these emotions rather than holding onto them? Ive always had the tendency to hold grudges. I dont know if the backstory is important but its rooted in abusive, controlling parents who would be nice to me when they wanted something then rapidly turn to cruel when their purpose was served. I was also gaslit a lot so it took some time but I had to learn to really be able to trust my judgement. I know I sound extremely arrogant and just me saying it makes it sound unlikely but I am a fair mix of rational and emotional + book smart and street smart so tend to have good judgement. This brings me to my relationship. My current boyfriend is my first serious adult relationship (early 20s). He cares a lot and were good at communicating but he lacks a lot of social and emotional awareness. Its a work in progress but unfortunately along the way Ive been hurt a lot. Hes never cheated on me but he has with ex girlfriends in the past, but he has also changed a lot of behaviour that led to such when he met me (when we were just friends). He can behave inappropriately with other girls but not be aware. He can be selfish without realising it. He says stupid things at bad times. He really cares and I do love him and think we could be good for each other, but because of these incidents I dont feel safe with him or like I can rely on him because I know Im waiting for the next mistake. At the same time, I know he has actually improved a lot (not for me, but for the sake of being a better person) so I dont want to hold his past mistakes against him. My nature is to be very guarded because vulnerability has hurt me in the past. So I rely heavily on my sense of judgement of right and wrong in fights to determine whether to trust someone (e.g. did they intentionally disregard me or was this a mistake). Every time he messes up my guard goes up and each time I hear the voice ringing in my head of all his past mistakes. It makes me feel angry and defensive. I want to just be able to let the past go. Any advice?"

I see no reason to not tell people what Im feeling. Since meeting this friend half a year ago (through mutual friends) Ive been going through a divorce, so obviously Ive been quite emotional. He and the people we hang out with are quite closed off emotionally, and never let themselves be vulnerable. I think he sees it as a weakness, and thus views me (someone not afraid of vulnerability) as weak. This obviously bothers me. He brings up me being overemotional and sensitive a lot. Id love some advice on how to counter this. If I get offended then I just prove his point. So Ive been rolling over and letting him say it, which is very stupid and against my nature. So, Reddit, how should I handle this?"

57,vulnerability,Advice,Help - How to Manage the Political Situation in my Family after being gone for over a year,1,fvqd2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fvqd2s/help_how_to_manage_the_political_situation_in_my/,2020-04-06 12:19:29,"TLdR; Went on an over year journey. A lot of areas of my old life fell apart before I left. Friendship betrayals, ex coworker put downs, family putting me down, no support. Lots of resistance for what I wanted to do. The theme of my journey was self compassion and taking my power back. A particular Aunt asked me to come over to her house before I left. Open up. I did. Then she took the chance to beat me down. Now I'm coming back. That same Aunt is texting me on Whatsapp. Do I bring up the past or just be ready to be assertive if it happens again? \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Many messed up betrayals and put downs occurred from family, friends and former coworkers before I left on my journey (no contact to anyone). One of them was an Aunt that invited me to her home to open up about what's going on in my life. Then she took the opportunity to put me down, call me a ""little boy"" and suggested I get a transgender surgery. I have a feeling the attack came about because I told my father I am keenly aware I am the last man to pass our name down the line. That Aunt is a strong feminist who thinks she is the ""patriarch of the family."" My father never admits it, but I think he told her. I never told any relatives I was aware of this . Very classic - Woman - ""I want my man to be more vulnerable."" Man - ""Okay strap in for this ride..."" Woman - ""You disgust me and I no longer respect you..."" Famed TED Talk Psychologist on Vulnerability, Brene Brown, had a man ask her why she doesn't study men. She said she didn't have data. He said oh that's convenient because my wife/daughters would rather me die on my high horse than see me vulnerable. Now I am isolated during the corona virus. I decided to go to a foreign country to take care of my grandfather who is all alone. Luckily, none of my family members can just barge in and see me (borders to US closed). Family is doing weekly Zoom meetings and Whatsapp. This particular Aunt solo messages me saying, ""thanks for taking care of Gpa. I am reading this book called ""Late Bloomers (link below)."" Every word reminds me of you...and me. I gracefully thanked her and mentioned all my above average achievements. I just burnt out. I was living the vision of someone else for me and not me. She hasn't responded in three days. It came off as really condescending, but that book she recommended looks great. Prior to this I confronted my Grandpa asking why the men of the family don't defend each other. He basically said that Aunt did a lot for him and I had to forgive. When I had the courage to ask that directly I realized how much hurt I was in still. Despite all the meditation. **Question** \- do I confront this Aunt in an Assertive way or keep working (meditation) to get over it and be ready to be assertive when she tries to power play put down again? Unfortunately, I was about to settle into a city, get a job then a therapist, but Corona threw that off. Therapists cannot practice with clients from another state. I feel like leaving everything behind no contact is the silent treatment. An ultimately passive aggressive move. You can only: A. Change the situation, B. Accept it, or C. Walk away. I chose C since it was shitty so B was a no-go. I had no energy for A. Now I am slowly coming back to the family but have trust issues. It's only a matter of time for a narcissist to resort back to their old ways once they feel like they are in control of you again. [URL"

I have a long history of relationship and social issues going back to early childhood. Ive always had a toxic relationship with my mother. She never showed much affection towards each or my sister, gave me body issues, told me no one like me, etc. My stepfather also used to make fun of me and my body. My dad had an anger problem and growing up was sometimes physically abusive especially toward my sister who lived with him. He married a woman that hated my sister and I. This woman also burned our house down for insurance money (but thats neither here nor there).He currently lives in a shed converted into a very small house and has a lot of financial issues. My mother and I barely speak. I have also been bullied for as long as I can remember. I read a books during recess and tried to avoid other children as much as possible. Kids would snatch my books, call me fat, tell me I looked like a boy, etc. I was very socially awkward (still am) and I did do weird things, ripped my pants at school several times, walked funny bc I was fat as a kid, never grew breasts, but also am very big-boned. My stepbrother molested from the time I was about eleven. Fast-forward to high school. I lost my virginity at 16, got really into drinking and partying and started having a lot of sex. I started doing drugs my senior year. I started popping atpills at 15 and graduated to bars, molly, coke, percocets, and hydros. Of course I smoked weed too. I got raped several times before I even graduated high school. Had several car accidents and a few arrests. This behavior continued in college. I was having 10 hour blackouts from drinking quite frequently. Woke up in houses and clothes Id never seen before, even went to the hospital once for alcohol poisoning. Toward the end of my freshman I got in with a group of drug-dealers that also happened to be satanists. I started doing acid. I dropped out of college despite having $70,000 in academic scholarships and a pretty good gpa, and moved in with one of them that summer. We did acid a lot and other drugs. This all culminated in a really bad trip that I had where I though I was dead. I destroyed this dudes apartment. Flooded it, ripped out all of the plumbing, put holes in the walls, smashed every piece of glass. I also walked on this glass for four hours, stabbed myself in the leg, cut out chunks of my hair with a knife. Anyway, I came out of that and wasnt the same. I moved back home for a bit and started going out to have unprotected sex with a bunch of guys to met on Tinder. They would pick me up and I would go with them. Eventually I decided I wanted to go to the city. I started looking for a sugar daddy. I met a guy thirty years older than me and moved with him after a couple of months of messaging and one meeting. He was swinger and we met a lot of couples and did a lot of things Im not proud of. The relationship was terrible. He was abusive, yelled at me all the time, not to say I was much better. I tried to leave several times and he always threatened to cut off my phone, plus I didnt have a car. I had a knee injury at the beginning that prevented me from walking for four months. During this relationship I also got hit by a car and witnessed a shooting. Eventually I saved up enough money from waitressing to buy a car, and I left. I also got saved at this time and started the process of turning my life around. I have come so far from where I used to be. Ive quit drinking and all drug and havent had sex in a year and a half. I have also been back in school for over a year. The problem Im having now is that I cannot shake all of these scars from my past. I dont know if this confession will help. I cant make friends. Im afraid of vulnerability. I have never in my life had a truly healthy relationship with a person. I dont how to express feelings and I dont know how to move my life forward. I just feel so stuck in life. I live with grandparents, my family is pretty poor. My mother has money but will not help me with college. We also live in a very rural area and I commute back and forth forty-five minutes to school. Im a history major and feel like all of this time and effort is going to be a waste because Im a senior now and I know I chose the wrong major. I also cant make any connections and have no pull in any direction. My greatest desire in life is to be in a place that I belong and I have no clue where to go. It feels like nothing matters if I no one in my life to share it with. Any advice would be appreciated."

(especially my family) i hate peoples seeing me vulnerable, it makes me sick. i know this may sound dumb, but i dont want people to see me upset because i dont want them to know i get affected by things. itll ruin the barrier ive created for myself. i rarely, rarely ever open myself up to my family unless i really have to, and even then ill try to make it as vague and brief as possible. opening up comes easier with friends. but no matter who i open up to, i always seem to feel sick and regretful afterwards. my grandma just passed today, but theres no way in hell in letting my family no im upset. i know they already know i am, and i hate that, but i cant let them see it. so ive just shut myself off in my room, eating what i have in here and only coming out when i need to. id also like to clarify that my family is not bad: we have issues like every family but they are caring. so i dont know why they make me so uncomfortable. whats worse, is that despite how awful vulnerability makes me feel, i crave it. but i cant get past my own barriers. i dont know where this stems from, i dont know why i developed these issues. i havent had major betrayls in trust. ive lost some friends here and there but ive never had a significant person (like a parent) in my life leave me. ive been trying to remember any type of source but i cant. now i dont know how to fix myself. if anyone could help in anyway id appreciate it, i dont really know who to ask about this."

Now this post might be a little long and sad at times, but Id like to give you a bit of context. Not to go into my sob story too much but I grew up in a very unpredictable and dysfunctional household. My father was an addict and my mother was severely depressed. I learned from a very young age that the only person I could count on was myself. Dont trust anybody, dont let people in, dont have expectations. I dont like being in any position of of vulnerability or intimacy and Im always on guard. I didnt really have friends until I was 17 and i met my best friend, we really hit it off. She was the closest Ive ever let anyone get to me, and after a couple years of friendship I was really close to being at the point of actually, genuinely trusting her and letting her in completely. I became a more confident, social, open person. I really felt like I was starting to overcome my trauma and giving life a chance for the first time. But we had a bit of a falling out that I still dont really understand what caused it. She stopped treating me the same and after that I didnt really feel like a part of her life anymore, I was begging for even the smallest scrap of attention. I know her life hasnt been smooth sailing either and I had all the patience in the world to give her time. But it completely decimated all of the progress I had made. My self esteem hit rock bottom, my depression worsened. I was again navigating life through the eyes of a terrified child. It was as if all of my instincts had been right. Two or so years down the road now and weve come around quite a bit, Im starting actually feel like her friend again. We are both doing better mentally. But I just dont know how to start rebuilding all of it. Theres this unbearable tension whenever we are together, I feel scared of her and ashamed of myself. She means the world to me and I really, desperately want to work things out but I dont know where to even start. All of the trust and security is gone and I dont think my heart could handle having that ripped apart again. I think abt how we used to be, and how close she still is with all our other friends, and how there must be something wrong with me since no one ever sticks around. And it feels like the harder I try the worse I make it. How do I begin to heal from this and work towards having a better relationship with her and people in general?"

While they had consensual sex a few times, their friendship had been otherwise platonic. One evening, he ignored her clear and repeated declination of his aggressive advances and raped her. Days later, she came to terms with the fact that her consent to previous encounters did not excuse his actions that night. She declined to report him to their program out of fear of retaliation. But I was proud of her incredible courage after she told him that he had violated her and that she wanted the future of their interpersonal relationship to be strictly confined to the classroom. He attempted to gaslight her, but nevertheless, she persisted. She distanced herself from him for most of the year. Today, she asked me if she should mend fences with him and cautiously return to their prior routine of studying together at his apartment post-pandemic. Hes the only person in her program with any fluency in her area of specialty; she once benefitted greatly from hearing his feedback. Were usually in a LDR but spending the duration of the pandemic together. Despite her very introverted personality, she has struggled with spending the overwhelming majority of her time alone during her semesterseven before the pandemic took her classes online. I fully, unequivocally trust her intentions. I believe that she truly thinks that they can resume a productive working relationship without putting herself in harms way. She and I spent a decade in very close friendship before I overcame my struggles with the level of vulnerability to which dating her would expose me. I subsequently embraced my deep love for her. Shes repeatedly expressed her desire to marry me; I dream of our future life together. That said, Ive observed in her a pattern of habitually excusing those who treat her poorlyoften months later. While I think her idea is terribly ill-advised, I fear that attempting to stop her could only lead to resentment. But it would break my heart for him to violate her again.

I wait around 2 hrs or so until i text him again and im like hey do u still wanna do something?. no text for the rest of the night and im like ight im just getting stood up and played and flaked on im done here lol. the next day (monday), i wake up to a text from tanner at like 8:30am saying i am sooo sorry, something came up i was super busy last night but im free today if you still want to hang. and, even though i told myself i was gonna drop it if tanner flaked again, i figured since HE offered plans this time and seemed genuinely intent upon hanging out i would say yes, despite still feeling the vibe that i was gonna get stood up. whatever, when people tell me they want to hang out with me i generally choose to believe them bc why stress abt people lying to you abt that. this is when tanner informs me that hes homeless. i had seen on his snapchat story that he had been staying in a house (again we lived close, and it is an upper middle class, generally affluent suburban neighborhood that a 20 yr old tradeschool drop out probably cannot afford, and there were children that ranged in age of almost definitely to definitely to old to be his) so i assumed the thing that happened last night was him getting kicked out for one reason or another. i told him im super sorry and im here for him and we didnt have to hang out that day if he didnt feel up for it but he assured me he still wanted to and he was just going to run some errands and then hed feel better and we could hang out and i say alright. i go about my business but as usual worried/checking my phone a lot bc im the kind of person who likes solid plans and i check in a lot until plans are solid (a lot of trauma involving unreliable ppl). around 3.5 hours later i text him to see if tanner still wants to hang out (3.5 seemed like more than enough time to complete what he told me he had to do). i see a few hours after that that tanner hasnt opened my text but posted on his story a video with a friend. i respond to it saying nice. i didnt really mean this to be passive aggressive i wasnt even mad just confused and i wanted him to know that i know he just blew me off. he later responded and said he was super sorry but he just needed to be with a close friend rn and then he said i want to send you a picture of this letter wait a sec and im just thinking wtf??? okay. he sends me a picture of a letter from his father to his mother that is really heavy and shows that theres a lot of family problems going on. he goes if we hung out today i wouldve cried in front of you and i barely know you i just have a lot going on right now im really sorry. i tell him i completely understand, and i really appreciate his vulnerability and honesty despite not knowing me well, bc i do. i tell him ive been through more than my fair share of family shit and general fucked up shit and that honestly if he had cried in front of me there would be zero judgement and im really just here to support him if thats what he wants. he responds with thank you. i appreciate you. i just tell him that im just the kind of person who gets stressed when people flake on plans or dont communicate, i honestly dont mind if you need to take time or cancel plans but please try your best to like lmk lol bc otherwise im just sitting around worrying and i also asked him if he actually wanted to hang out sometime that week and its fine if he doesnt and he said Itd be easier if I hit you up when I can actually chill cuz with how my shit is its pretty chaotic and i just responded yah bc i just took that as i dont want to ever hang out but im too much of a nice person to say it. imo when people say that they will text you to make plans, they say it because they wont they just dont want you to text them. tanner then said something that kinda threw me off Ill communicate more Im sorry i shouldve said something. like what kinda 20 yr old boy (or person in general) says that to some chick hes just met? not even in real life? but either way i say its fine i mean you barely know me lol bc its true like im honestly not mad i mean we have no commitment to each other im just confused. then to ease my anxious mind i say promise youll text though and tanner promises. i honestly did this bc i figured his promise would calm my anxious traumatized mind long enough to forget about him. and now im here. i honestly just dont know what to do next or what to think? like do i unfriend him? do i take this as a hint that he doesnt want to get to know me and just drop it? but why would he send me all of that personal stuff if he wasnt intent upon becoming closer? how long do i wait to text him, if i should even text him again?"

I live with stubborn family members who do not allow me to cook in the kitchen, therefore I cannot cook myself healthy meals. The main cook in the house is absolutely awful, she burns half of the things she makes and under-seasons everything. In essence; inedible. I have stores of food in the fridge and pantry that I keep for the rest of the week because I know I won't be able to stomach eating her food. The other members of my house constantly pillage my designated food. I've tried notes, asking them to stop, and getting not so nice about it. One particular family member has even faked eating certain food items just to see me get upset and close to a breakdown. He thought it was hilarious. Having an eating disorder is seen as ""weakness"", so I haven't told them about it. Showing vulnerability of any kind is looked down upon and used against you. It sends me into rages, panic-binges, and bouts of food-hiding paranoia when they take from my designated food. This can't be good for my body and their toxic behavior is fueling my eating disorder. I am constantly paranoid about whether or not my food has been eaten, I stash food in hiding places, and I'm tired of the blatant disrespect. They know damn well that they shouldn't touch my food. They don't care and they think it's funny. I'm at my wits end, I feel like some day soon I'll have some sort of meltdown. I realize food is a weird thing to get so bothered over but that's what an eating disorder does, not to mention other things in my life that have caused me to want to reserve food. I need help, how can I fix this problem??"
69,vulnerability,Advice,How to make friends with people who actually understand you,1,gcp4ru,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gcp4ru/how_to_make_friends_with_people_who_actually/,2020-05-03 21:34:38,"We all yearn for those friends who we actually resonate with, not the 'social media' superficial friends. The type of friend we can call up at 3am when we need help. The type of friend who stands by us at the highs as well as the lows. This is how to make those friends even after you have left education: **1) Be yourself.** It's all about vulnerability. It is less about changing yourself to meet the ideals of what you think someone else would like, instead try to be unapologetically yourself and you will attract people who genuinely value you for you. **2) Be proactive.** Comment on people's Facebook posts or reply to people's [Instagram](URL stories - both great way to reconnect with old friends in a direct way. **3) Use friendship apps.** There are many great apps out there which connect you with new people who are all on there for the same reason. They are open to making friends with you. I have used a lot and my personal favourite is [Serendip](URL \- it cuts through the superficiality and actually connects you with people who share your values. Others include [Bumble](URL but it is more used for dating. **4) Phone calls.** Calling your existing friends is a great way to strengthen your bond. When we can't meet in person due to lockdown, a voice or video call has much more depth than a text message. **5) Just ask.** This isn't dating, you don't need to worry about being rejected to find the 'one'. Ask people you have just met for a coffee or their number. ""I am new to the area and it would be great if you could show me around"". Put yourself at the receiving end of this - it's a very natural message. **6) Join local groups.** This is not advised during lockdown! Whilst we are under social isolation we can fall back on #3 for the meanwhile. Have fun guys! Please comment below if you have other suggestions :)"

I still wonder if it was justified somehow, and I really am weak. i think asking this must prove that i am. its not about whether its wrong to be fragile or weak, but more that it otherwise would go against my sense of self. hearing its ok to be makes it worse, like it proves it must be true. I have already tried the embracing vulnerability thing, and just got nothing out of it, i was just out of place. I dont know who to ask about this. how do i know if i am and if so is there a way out"

My parents noticed a loss of life in me a few years ago. The full context of that is boring and pointless to cover here, but the main point to acknowledge is they feel they've done a poor job with me because I don't seem outwardly happy. I can't deny that I'm not an expressive person, but I do truly appreciate my parents and what they have done and continue to do for me. On both of their sides, we have histories of bad health and diseases, so I believe they're concerned about dying with regret regarding how they cared for me. I don't want that, so was curious how to tell them they've done well in a way that is meaningful and appears genuine. Spontaneously giving hugs and gifts would be incredibly disingenuous to them since I'm not expressive in that manner. I could also tell them, but that might not convince them either. I do help cook, clean, and help them both with their work when I've completed my own so they can have more free time, but I don't believe this is special and only mention it so nobody suggests them and assumes I'm leeching off of them. I contribute to maintaining the household as I should, however I'm asking for unexpected forms of appreciation. I realize that I could start trying manage my vulnerability and trust issues, but I'm not seeking that kind of advice. If you are someone that just isn't very emotionally expressive, I'd appreciate suggestions on how you show people they're appreciated."

We talked about our past and growing up. We talked about our problems and dreams. And fast forward to about 2 months in, Idk if it was even right for me to ask ""What are we"" at that point. I just wanted to know. And then she turns out she didn't want anything, and we were just friends. Of course I respected her boundaries and her wishes. And we stayed friends, but we grew distant. We didn't talk like we used to, the other person doesn't reciprocate the same energy and the flirting wasn't reciprocated anymore. And I realized I caught feelings. She's in a rough patch in her life, getting through an emotionally and physically abusive relationship. Like she has her PTSD and had very traumatic experience with her ex.

We clicked immediately. We have some of the same mental health issues and daddy issues. We both have a dark sense of humor. I haven't had many close girl friends and my friend says it's because I'm intimidating and I'm the kind of girl that doesn't bullshit or sugar coat things. She loves the hell out of me and I love her so much. We both have so many flaws but we don't mind. Well, I haven't had a problem till now. My friend got a new job a couple years back and I was so excited for her. She was making good money, had benefits, and was able to support herself and her son with no worries. She liked her job and most of the people she worked with. She caught the eye of a fellow coworker. He flirted with her, she flirted back and they spent some intimate time together but were never in an official relationship. He had a track record for flirting with other girls in the work place before she was hired. A couple female coworkers started showing their jealousy. Soon my friend started complaining to me that he had an emotional wall and didn't want to commit. He's an immature playboy. Any time she distanced herself he would all of a sudden be interested and show some emotional vulnerability. It never became an official relationship. They went on a trip with his family. They spent time with her son. Her son adores him. Finally she got tired of the lack of commitment and dropped him. Then she started dating another guy in the workplace. He's also much older than her, divorced with no kids. The older man became obsessed with her. Trying to get her to move in with him. She didn't want to make things official and I think it was because she was still hung up on the younger guy. She asks me to meet the new older guy and I go to his house. The whole time if I mentioned something about myself it was like he wasn't listening. I realised he had me there to get Intel on my best friend. He'd ask questions about her and questions about their relationship. He would tell me things that she would do that he didn't like and about the arguments they would have and ask my opinion. I sided with her the whole time, brought up good points that ruined his argument and I'd shut him down immediately whenever he said something off about her. Only an hour into conversation and he tells me it's time for me to go home. It was so awkward I was stunned. After that night I find out he meets her other friends, gets their numbers and attempts to talk to them about my best friend and how ""dysfunctional"" she is. There were times he'd go to art performances she would participate in and comment on how sexy it was and how seeing exposed female bodies get him off. He wants all of her time and gets jealous when she spends time with other people. He has no patience with her son and is so insincere with the kid that the kid knows he's being fake. Her son has even recently asked her if they could not see the older man as much anymore.The younger guy starts texting her and flirting and showing more emotional attachment. She then starts seeing both men. This goes on for a while and they find out about each other. They proceed to talk mad shit about her to other people in the work place. They both took up a hobby of emotionally abusing her. She drops both of them and they cause such a stir in the work place that now she has female coworkers starting arguments with her, being difficult with her and they even start asking for meetings to discuss her ""bullying"" them. Soon many coworkers start to be nasty with her, even her boss. She decided for her mental health she should quit. She's having a hard time finding a job and both guys start talking to her again. Finding that she's conveniently vulnerable the older guy offers to help her financially. She's so desperate she takes his offer and starts spending time with him again. He demands more time with her and I don't get to really see her anymore. If we do spend time together he's texting her the whole time asking if he can join us. She starts resenting him and starts seeing the other guy again in secret. Recently the only times I have seen my friend is to watch her perform, babysit her son while she's at school, or when she needs help with school work. All of a sudden we get two days back to back, hanging out like before. Just us. She tells me the two guys got into a screaming match when she had one of them over and the other decided to stop by unannounced. They both like to do that. So she tells me she dropped both of them again. She blocked the older one but now I find out she's still talking to the other. These men are both so toxic (there's so much more harm they have done but I won't mention it because I think I've given enough info) and through all of this I have told her that they are both trash and she deserves better. I've also told her this seeing two people situation is no good for her or her son. Both men also get very jealous when they find out I'm hanging out with her. She's my best friend. I love her and give her straight forward advice but never judge her. She's had a lot of bullshit in her life and its left her damaged. You could say the same about me. What do I do or say to make her block the younger guy and move on? I'm worried she will waste so much time on him that Mr. Right won't come into the picture. I'm worried her son will figure it all out at some point and start to resent her, or even adopt his own toxic relationship habits when he's older. She's amazing and sweet and a good person. I can see this situation changing her behavior. When you have emotional issues from having a shitty/nonexistent dad and the right person/people with manipulative tendencies comes along your mind gets fucked with and it can turn you into someone you don't like. I've been there. Its hell. Any advice?"

This is actually my first post to Reddit, and I'm coming right out the gate with tons of vulnerability. I am failing my first year of college, and not because I'm not capable. I don't care, and I have a lot of really bad habits. I am coming to the conclusion that I am not ready for formal study, considering my insomnia and poor lifestyle. I want to form a plan, and I could use all the help I can get. The health class I took in high school says to approach everything from simplicity, to avoid overwhelming myself. My loose goals entail, writing reflectively, researching my interests to take my education into my own hands, establishing a healthy diet and sleeping routine, and most likely pursuing a job in the trades. I figure a good place to start is to turn to family and ask to be mentored. Before I apply for any apprenticeships and double down on my career, I want to establish a connection with the youth. My baby cousins are bastions of wonder and awe, and the best students I know. I think I have a lot to learn from them, and to teach as well. Their perspective should help me build a framework for my research. I am a skinny, but healthy 18 year old male. The basic framework for my diet in macronutrients look like 50% carbs, 25% protein, and 25% fats. I weigh 70 kilograms, so I'm aiming to consume 3,500-4,500 kcals to maintain a caloric overload. I want a training regimen that is functionally focused and that does not require equipment. Any educational resources would be appreciated. I have a lot of books to busy myself with, and when I was a little I read like 20 minutes every hour. My memory isn't as good as then, so I think coupling reading on my downtime with summaries in my journal should help me retain the info. I want to read historical narrative, short stories, poetry, mythology, and folktales for pleasure. I could use academic readings about childhood development and the brain. I have a bunch of anatomy and physiology resources to reference as well. Reflection is very important to me right now, because I have a lot of anxiety about my memory and ability to learn right now. I don't think there's anything wrong with me, but sometimes I obsess over details and never manage to understand the big picture. I feel that classical conditioning exercises could help a lot with the anxiety. Learning about the memory acquisition process might help put things into perspective as well. Anyways, to reflect I would like to take 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the evening to journal. I would love to hear some prompts, or advice in the area. Unfortunately, I am interested in a lot of things. I think I have a lifetimes worth of study ahead of me. It will be impossible to realize if I never get a hold on my sleeping habits. 11pm to 7am is my goal, but I will have to work up to it. That leaves 16 hours of wakefulness to balance all of this stuff with a full time job to pay for food and housing. I'm not sure about jobs, but I might apply for an internship on a farm with 8-10 hour work days. The other appealing option is to work as an apprentice with a carpenter/welder. My career interest right now is Environmental Engineering, and Data Science. My dream of dreams would be to build an environmentally friendly farm and analyze water systems in relation to ecology and agriculture. I know, it's lofty. But, 16 hours a day is quite a lot of time. Thank you for taking the time to read this, any and all help will be appreciated!"

He attempted suicide very recently and I dont know what to do to get him out of there. Weve been thinking of getting him into an independent housing program thats available in his area and we have evidence of the verbal abuse he puts up with daily but we have no idea who to present it to because he has no access to his school counselor or any medical professional because of COVID-19. If there is nothing I can do please give me advice on how I can keep him alive until he turns 18 and can leave to go to college or at least move out of mothers apartment. (Quoted because she is hardly a mother and is mostly dependent on him and what he can do and the welfare their country provides for the impoverished. Nothing against people who use welfare, just this horrible mom who doesnt give her child the love and care he needs. Instead she manipulates him with material items to keep him and insulted him in times of need or vulnerability, with the addition of hitting him but not hard enough to bruise.) Sorry for that little spiel, but if I saw that bitch its hands on sight."

I just got in a relationship and was actually the one reaching out to him since I had been secretly peeking on him for about 6 months before finally asking him out. I dont know why I'm not thrilled with joy at the moment, I was the first 3 weeks. But after coming out with an incident of sexual assault in october by my ex practically there's not been a whole week without feeling some pain from that again I guess, I'm not even sure. With corona going on and everyone in quarantine, the thoughts are appearing more and more again. I feel my emotion come out as totally new feelings when he's around instead of having to deal with the pain and process myself. He's the greatest when it comes to this, understanding, giving space, giving me time to heal. Thing is whenever we talk about us I get sad..almost teary eyed and I have absolutely no idea how that is. I sometimes don't text back in that same hour as you know new couples have that fire going on texting every second. It's a very strange and yet not right feeling to get when you're in a new relationship. Mainly this is what I seek help on trying to understand more. What could be the reason why? Lack of vulnerability to trust a male or because there's a feeling of finally being trusted by one? Is this a me thing or a him thing?"
79,vulnerability,Advice,How can I go about helping the elderly during this time?,1,fthbng,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fthbng/how_can_i_go_about_helping_the_elderly_during/,2020-04-02 17:26:41,"Hey Reddit! I was thinking lately and reflecting on all my free time. I am still blessed enough to have a job, however, from 6:00pm to 2:30am working hours. However, my morning and afternoon schedule is now freed up due to my college being closed due to the COVID-19 virus. I live near NYC, which is the known epicenter of the virus for practically the world. As as I drive through the streets, I see lots of older/elderly people walking around, naturally. They need their medication, food and other necessities. That concerns me in regards to their vulnerability to virus, as well as their potential to get mugged or robbed due to this time of desperation. I have free time, I have a car, I am healthy, and I am willing. What is the best method of helping the elderly during this time? Id like to collectively help a large number of elderly people by getting their groceries, medication and other necessities throughout the week. If this can work, Id possibly want to make this a trend, where we can prioritize helping and protecting the elderly during this time and get more people on board with this. Any advice is appreciated, because I dont know where to start. Thanks Reddit!"

81,vulnerability,Advice,I asked him out and he said yes. But some folks are saying I shouldn't go through with it. Details in post. Any advice?,1,f3xrnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/f3xrnv/i_asked_him_out_and_he_said_yes_but_some_folks/,2020-02-15 06:58:14,"I'm a female in my mid 20s, the guy I asked out is in his mid 30s. Here's the curve ball. He's my doctor. For starters, he isn't treating me for anything serious or chronic. He's my PCP. I go in occasionally for minor things. I'm a pretty healthy person, thankfully. The second time I came in to see him, we chatted about a lot of things and we just clicked. I've dated a lot of people and I know when I really like someone. It was obviously mutual. The whole thing was very smooth. He ordered a couple tests for me and said he'd call with the results. Later, he called me from his personal number. Towards the end of the conversation, it felt natural to ask him for tea. At which point he mentioned that this is his cell number and I was free to contact him whenever. I was impressed with my boldness, honestly. But as a wise man once said, YOLO (Drake, 2011). I am usually much more discreet with things like this but I knew I had to be the aggressor in this case. So here I am. Thinking about what/when to text him. More importantly, I'm wondering why so many people are saying it's unethical. I'm smart. He's smart. I'm mature, as is he. This doesn't feel wrong in any way. Neither do I believe there's a power imbalance. I understand that a relationship between doctor and patient is vulnerable, but again, he doesn't treat me for anything serious/chronic. I don't see any vulnerability at all. I guess I'm trying to reconcile not feeling vulnerable with people saying that I should absolutely be feeling vulnerable. Is it unethical if I'm comfortable with it? I know what I'm signing up for lol. Also, what should I say when I reach out?"
82,vulnerability,Advice,Should I treat my ADHD?,1,f45po6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/f45po6/should_i_treat_my_adhd/,2020-02-15 17:32:27,"ADHD medicine can either make you a zombie or overstimulate you. At least in my country, where psychology is on a low level, they either prescribe you benzos or strong stimulants. Last time I went to see a therapist and a psychiatrist I got prescribed medical amphetamines for concentration which I quickly grew addicted to and couldn't drop them easily. After taking them for a year I was paranoid about everything and everytime I tried not to take a pill for a day, that day would be absolutely terrible for me due to withdrawal: too much stress, terrible anxiety, headaches, I was also scared of anything and was terrified of talking to people. Dropped the medicine and left the therapy. Generally speaking, I don't really mind ADHD. The thought of trying to cure it came back to my mind only after recently a girl at my uni yelled at me for moving around too much during classes. ADHD obviously negatively affects my concentration (which is very noticeable), my ability to stay still, my ability to sleep well, my vulnerability to addictions (I get addicted to anything very easily, was already an alcoholic by the age od 16 for instance) and my short-term memory (which is also a big deal in my case). On the other hand, people praise me for always being energetic, cheerful and talkative and when it comes to me I don't really care if I cure it because if I try hard enough I can function kind of normally. I had just recently realised after the uni incident that I may be annoying to some people due to being allover the place all the time. I'm also scared of being pharmalogically stuffed full of legal drugs that will make me even harder to bear and most likely very addicted. In summary, I don't personally mind my ADHD, some people like me with it, but some people don't, and it obviously cripples me in at least a couple of ways. Medicine however is pretty much the only way they try to help you with ADHD in this country and is an addiction risk which could make me essentially a different person"
83,vulnerability,Advice,I want to leave my manipulative parents' house -- Need advice on a few things!,1,f55i3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/f55i3m/i_want_to_leave_my_manipulative_parents_house/,2020-02-17 19:02:31,"Hi everyone, please call me Moon. Full disclosure: I posted something very similar to this post on a law related advice subreddit here, so if you hang around there, you may have seen this post. I'm 24 years old. I will disclose my location beyond being in the United States ONLY if necessary, because I don't really want my parents to have the possibility of finding this post (although idk that they even know what a reddit is). I am an unusual case, and everyone has said this. In the mix of that ""everyone"" is my boyfriend, my university classmates, my Nurse Practitioner, and my lab instructor. First of all, as I've mentioned, I'm well over the legal age... But I can't actually drive. I have held a permit for the longest time, and this is my second time watching the permit expire. The reason for the expiring permit is because the only people that I am honestly able to get any sort of lessons from are from my parents. But with my mother rarely driving, and my father always busy with whatever else he is doing to put bread on the table, he also has no time. The only time my father has honestly offered this was whenever he was feeling heated about something (could have been about house situations, or about me and how I'm such a burden to him because everything has to be done for me). Secondly, another odd thing about me is that given my age, I do not have any experiences in ""adulting"". I do, however, have what I call a set of ""waifu material"" skills, in which I am well aware of cooking and baking (I've also been told I excel at those activities), cleaning, and just general housekeeping, if that makes sense. I have no idea how banks work, how loans/credits or any of that stuff works. The closest experience I can recall as of now, is that my mother insisted that I signed up for a credit card, so that I can start building up a credit score. Lastly, my overall ""freedom"" or rather, lack there of. I am unable to go anywhere by myself, obviously because I have no car. As I also mentioned, I do have college classes to attend to, and my dad is the one who takes me there. With that being said, my time on campus is strictly for classes. So once my class time is over (and yes, he has a list of my schedule and times), I am to immediately go back home. I will never be seen out anywhere in public aside from my time on campus, alone. If I am at the mall, you can bet your bottom dollar that I'm there because my dad or my mom is there with me. This next portion is where I will explain the need for legal advice. My boyfriend that I mentioned in the beginning of this post and I have been together for about half a year now, but he was someone I've known for many years prior to the relationship blooming. He wanted a job in my town instead of his (his town is very small and offers very little opportunities), and my family ended up housing him with us for the time being. Much like myself, his job was to make sure that he helped to maintain the household chores, which is not unreasonable at all. With my parents being very controlling of a lot of my aspects of life, one of the rules they put into place was that they didn't want me and my boyfriend to be up in my room during the weekdays, because they want my brother to focus on school work. I have no idea to this day the actual correlation between us and schoolwork, but it was an interesting rule that we had to follow. This is important, because this rule caused us to almost be strangers to each other while living under the same roof. So my boyfriend and I came up with a plan for him to come up to my room and visit me after hours (typically 1 am and on). Some nights, he would come cuddle with me and then leave once I fell asleep, other nights, he would sit on the floor and talk to me about things involving us and our interests. And of course, other nights, things got heated between us. Most recently, we made a mistake. With both of us being 24 and virgins (and technically still are...), we ended up wanting to release some sexual tension. This was probably around 2 am, and my parents have the converted garage as their bedroom, which is below my room where he and I were getting it on. My mother initially heard the noise before this day, and I guess finally on that night, asked my dad to sneak up the steps to go and see who was making all that noise. We were caught, sitting on the floor, and my dad was obviously in disbelief. Practically threw out my boyfriend, and as for myself, made me go downstairs to go and talk to my parents about all of this. Please, before you reply with ""well duh, this is normal"", this is not the part that I am seeking advice for. This part of the event, my boyfriend and I are full-heartedly responsible for, and we feel very embarrassed, apologetic, guilty and everything else in between. It's been at least half a week since this event has happened, and they keep asking me the same questions, I'm giving the same response, which by the way, are regarded as lies. And when I say they keep asking me these questions, think of it as like a twice a day tablet. They are never satisfied by my answers, and I am almost getting the sense that they are unable to believe this was a consensual meeting between my boyfriend and I. I am being honest here, as one of the things that was brought up in many of these conversations was the question of whether I was under the influence, and if so, what, and who provided them to me. Obviously, they are hoping that I would make a mistake and say that my boyfriend did that (they very well probably thought I would crack under pressure and just say stuff without meaning it), but I kept denying it. My mother on the other hand kept feeding me the whole ""this guy took advantage not just of us and our kindness, but your sexual desires and vulnerability-- a real man wouldn't have done that"". As I've already said, this was all consensual, so when I told her that her claims are wrong, she said that she was right, and she knows she's right, because she's been around that block before. Because of this event, they both made 2 very strong claims about my boyfriend: 1. I am not allowed to continue any sort of relationship/friendship with him, because ""he is not the right man for you"". 2. We (parents) will not bless our marriage, if this is the man that I choose to marry. I reached the point in my life where I am starting to see the abnormality of all of this. I talked to my lab instructor and Nurse Practitioner (separate occasions, but apparently, they went to school together) about the recent event in great detail. Everything you guys are reading, they are aware of as well. They both were confused as to why I was avoiding the term ""abuse"" and going to terms like ""inconvenience"" or ""toxic"", when it was very clear to them that this is a form of abuse and manipulation. On that topic, I would also like to let you guys know, I am Christian, and yes, my parents are using Christ as a way to manipulate me-- that if I don't tell them the truth, that God will not forgive me, etc. Long story short of this section, both my lab instructor and NP had issues with their lives earlier on in their years that prompted them to leave their house, because it was getting too toxic for them. Because of everyone's collective thoughts on what I should do, I have finally decided that I am leaving the house at some point before the year is over. For me at my age, it's not ""running"", it's leaving. They had to correct me many times on this word choice as well. Here's where some advice would be nice, given my situation explained above: Everyone told me that if I am going to commit to this, I should take the essentials and leave everything behind, and then call my parents in a few days to see about setting up a time to amicably pick up my stuff. However, I can see this go COMPLETELY wrong, and they claim that I have no right to pick up anything here, because the items I left behind are theirs now. Is this something that they can legally do, with what I had explained above this paragraph? Honestly, what would you guys do in my current situation? What do you guys even think about all of this? I like hearing from people who don't know me personally, because for me, it's the most sincere and honest set of words that I'll be able to receive. Thanks for reading all of this, I know it was a lot to read, but I felt like things needed to be explained in order to get the advice that I needed."

Anyway, I've been feeling really lost and empty in life and not really sure how to go about it. I know self diagnosing is a bad idea but just for convenience in this post I'm going to assume I have apathy. I'm not looking for anyone to solve my problem or anything like that, just curious as to what people think I should do or see what kind of tips you all might have. If you don't know what apathy is it's pretty much a state of indifference. I feel indifferent towards everything and up until recently I've even felt indifference to my indifference. But recently I decided that the way I feel isn't fun and I don't want this anymore... Which in my mind is the first huge step into getting out of it. But now I'm not sure where to go from here. My guess is the first thing everyone is going to say is to see a doctor about it as they're best suited to properly diagnose me and help me, but that's difficult for me. To go to a doctor I'd have to tell my family... Which sounds easy enough except my family isn't very open and supportive, and chances are they might even doubt me and even pick on me for opening up about this. It's honestly quite scary to think about showing that amount of vulnerability to them all and it makes me extremely anxious (can hardly type because my hands are shaking thinking about it lmao). And that's the dilemma I'm in. I hate feeling the way I do, but the most obvious way to fix it seems like another trap to get caught in. Any advice/tips?"

This post is not to draw sympathy, pity or anything other than solid and honest ideas on what to do or what not to do.... I'm 24, a virgin, never had a girlfriend, no education, about 10'000 swiss franks in debt, was involved in minor criminal activities for some time. Yeah, basically I'm a complete fuck-up. Only thing missing would be a jail sentence. I was just lucky to never have been caught. Oh, and please don't give me the ""don't talk about yourself like that""-crap. I have to be honest if anything is ever going to change. **Goals and life situation** I stopped my apprenticeship in the IT field 5 years ago. Since then I was in the swiss military and quit, tried some different jobs and quit, developed an app that didn't have any success and quit, tried to grow online businesses and guess what.. I quit. Quitting is a common theme in my life and I have realized that I was a quitter (Can I say ""was"" if I started not quitting just some time ago?) a long time ago. I quit almost every little thing but there was one thing I never quit and that was sports. I started Kickboxing when I was 17 and then later found MMA at 19. I fell in love with it almost immediately but I often didn't have any money to pay for training so I've had long breaks but in those breaks I never stopped training. You know... basic stuff, bag work, strength n'conditioning (lots and lots of sprints). It's the only thing I never quit because it's the only thing that keeps me sane and gives me some kind of... let's call it ""pride"". I dreamed of being a fighter (well, I still do tbh) but I sucked at managing money plus didn't have much of it in the first place. My kickboxing coach started to notice some of my strengths when I was about 22 and we trained more intensely. I had 3 amateur fights then I stopped visiting kickboxing classes because I couldn't pay the fee. I already owed him the fee from last semester and I just couldn't go there anymore being the jerk-off I am. I felt bad for not paying. My coach gave me a lot and I just couldn't live with me taking advantage of his generosity. I vowed to change my life by starting some kind of business so I could pay and spend my days mostly training as it is the thing that makes me most happy. I failed, quit and got depressed. Pretty much every time after I quit something and got depressed I started doing dumb shit like selling weed, burglaries or just stealing shit in general. I've always been kinda depressed and I have experienced heavier waves of depression from when I was 16 years old. You know that kind of thing where you think you're in excruciating pain and contemplate suicide. I'm fucking scared of death so every time I went to the train station to take the leap I couldn't bring myself to do it. Plus I got a niece (she's 13 now) and I love her very much. We're close. She's a good-hearted, highly intelligent kid and it really makes me happy to see her have success this early on. There's no reason why my selfish ass should make her life miserable... Anyways, after this ""wave"" I didn't experience any other kind of major low and I got a little better. I tried another online business, failed again, quit again but this time I was less harsh on myself. Fast forward to today I am starting yet another online business with my sister and I have never been this consistent. Been working on it for almost two months now. I never stopped training on my own and it helped me tremendously. I'm worried about failing again and I'm also worried about my sister giving up on the business. It's not that she did much (I did pretty much everything). It's just that her trust in me and me not wanting to disappoint her makes me actually do the damn work and it has been feeling good... So much for self-actualization. **Relationships** I find relationships to be extremely hard. It's not that I'm bad at communicating. I can be extremely social, funny and I actually care... It's my feelings of worthlessness that hurt me in every aspect of my life but in this one, they tear apart almost every chance of me connecting with others on a deeper level. So maybe this is the part where I am going to tell my ""sobbing story""... Obviously didn't grow up in a loving environment. There have always been outbursts of sheer hatred and violence.. I am Albanian and in our culture, it's quite common to hit your kids. It's also one of those cultures where strength is praised and weakness and vulnerability is something you can never show.. My dad used to beat the breaks off me. He used belts, his fists, sticks. He beat me, chocked me but what hurt most was actually the fucking psychological terror he used. During beatings, he would tell me so much fucked up things. ""You worthless piece of shit!"", ""You're never gonna be anything!"", ""I'll kill you!"", ""You're trash!"". He would often go on rants and he would talk shit to me for hours and I had to listen because if I dared to walk away he would say: ""Where do you think you're going? Come back or I'll fucking kill you!"" My mom was just as violent but she was able to show at least some affection. My dad also beat her and I was so fucking scared of him that I didn't say a damn thing when he did. As a kid, I was close with one of my brothers but he became schizophrenic and my parents put me into one room with him. He talked to himself nonstop at night and if I told him to shut up he would get bad and sometimes hit me. He was never the same again. I was lucky to have found some extremely good friends early on in my life and they really care. It's one of the reasons I'm not 100% fucked up. The mother of my best friend was very caring and she created an environment where I could feel safe and actually make friends. I learned so much from them and every time we get together it's not just fun but I also feel loved and understood. So yeah, my friends are fucking awesome! I love them to death. But friends can only be friends (not to say that it wasn't enough, it's more than I deserve honestly) and that brings me to one of the most problematic areas of my life: Romantic relationships. It's not that girls don't find me attractive. I look good. I'm healthy, I have a great sense of humor and I can have great conversations. I've even been approached by girls. My problem is that as soon as I like someone they become god-like. My fantasy plays scenarios so intense that I sometimes forget that it's not real. The girls in my friend's circle are all highly educated, talented, well-spoken and just awesome.. It's hard for someone like me to not put them on a pedestal since I already feel inadequate. I can't use girls that like me and that look attractive but that I don't want to get to know better for sex.. It would make me feel like a fucking piece of shit, especially when she would have some kind of hopes.. And as soon as I like someone I can't fucking be myself or try to get closer to her because I think I'm a piece of shit and any kind of rejection is a validation for my negative feelings about myself AND if she was to like me for any reason it wouldn't be a good one because.. Man, I can't imagine someone loving me. And if they do they're making a mistake... This is how I feel and I know that it's mostly bullshit or at least to some degree but isn't it the truth? I mean I am trying to be a good person and really care and I help without expectations and I want people to do good but does that matter...? I'm still a loser and that's not just me finding reasons on why someone will never love me it's just a statement of facts. I'm a loser.. But I'm working on not being one anymore. It's just that I don't know if I'm ever going to be confident enough to think: ""Now I'm ready!"", and that despite of my immense feelings of worthlessness I can't turn off the desire to be loved.. I often think about having someone now so I know they ""really love me""... I think that is very selfish. It also sucks that I seem to want to compensate for the love I never got from my family which is just fucked up... The first thing I stated when introducing myself was that I'm a virgin and the second thing was that I never had a girlfriend. These two things just came to mind first and I think it's because of my desire to fill the void. I just feel incredibly lonely in this world and I don't know what to do about it. I feel irreparably damaged. **Dealing with my mind** I think I've been or still am mentally ill. My thought processes seem poisoned by extreme feelings and maybe trauma... I know that dreaming of building a business and becoming a fighter is delusional. I understand that many people think I'm a nutjob when they ask me about what I dream about and I tell them. I just stopped caring. I didn't study in school so I was never too good. University was a dream of mine as a kid but it obviously remained a dream because of my laziness. I could still go to uni but 8 years of studying just to be able to get a job (4 years matura, 4 years uni) plus all the years of work to finance the education... Working on delusional dreams gives me at least 1% chance of succeeding at creating a life where I don't wake up wanting to put a bullet in my head... I'm stressed because I know about my situation and I really want to change it. And by want I mean want. It's just often hard for me to see the light at the end of the tunnel because I've been depressed since I'm a kid and I've experienced so much rejection in all areas of my life. I went to 3 different therapists and on Monday I will visit a new one. It helped me in the past but obviously whining about all the crap won't help. I need to stay busy. To quote Nietzsche: Die Hoffnung ist der Regenbogen ber den herabstrzenden Bach des Lebens. ""Hope is the rainbow over the cascading creek of life"" Now I want to know what y'all think. Please speak freely even if you think that I belong in a mental institution. I really don't know what exactly I should do and I often just go with my feelings and that ends up hurting me. I feel like I need some good advice and I feel like I'm finally at a point in life where I can implement it!"

But now shes dating someone whos ex left him because he was abusive, which he doesnt deny (just says that she was also emotionally abusive, and now my friend is even saying she was abusive back to her ex which I doubt is true, and even if it was it was at worst a defense mechanism for what she was enduring). Her close friends, including me, have expressed our concern, and that regardless of if he has changed or not, due to his history, we cant in good conscience support her decision to pursue this relationship, and she has basically cut us off. She feels hurt and judged, and I know she wants me to apologize but I am not sorry for what I said and for speaking the truth because I want her to be safe, and to heal. She was with her ex for 10 years, and has only left him 5ish months ago, and jumped into this relationship 3 months ago. Were all bothered that this new guy shes dating seems to have taken advantage of her vulnerability, and didnt give her time to heal outside of a relationship before pursuing her. I will be meeting up with her soon, where I know shell be expressing how I hurt her by telling her I will never support this relationship. I dont want her to continue to isolate herself, but I fear she will isolate herself from anyone who isnt happy for this choice shes making. What can I do to make it clear I love her and just want her to be safe?"

For a while I just dealt with the problems Ive been facing (which I wont go into detail here) without professional help, to no success, out of fear that my parents will think Im just another crazy person. I now think that my mental health is more important, because my problems have gotten so bad that I cant stand it anymore. The advice Im asking for is this. Im terrified of going to my first appointment. Ive never been good at explaining my emotions, at least not without bursting into tears. I guess Im scared of vulnerability, I dont really know what my problem is. The last thing I want to do is cry in front of a stranger after explaining just a fraction of my emotions. Even if the person Im confiding in is a professional. Im scared of a diagnosis, Im scared that Im too broken to be fixed, and Im afraid to be vulnerable.

No, I do not love them- but I have an overwhelming desire sometimes at just the sight of men aged 47-63. I calculate sums in my head about their age, I am generally dissapointed when I find out a man is 30 years old. I get disappointed with how I am around them, how stupid I seem- for it is not necessarily their appearance; I like their experience, their mind- irrelevant to whether they excel or not, it is the tone of voice they have! It is odd. I like their wrinkles, their clothes, the way they carry their self, the way they look at me. Obviously it is not guaranteed with every single older man, but those I don't think 'I want you to take advantage of me, but I don't' to, I think 'Please want me.' It upsets me sometimes. I look at 14 year olds, it is vexatious to me, I want to be them, I emphasise to myself, consciously- *they are only two years younger*, *why?*, ***stop***, naturally, the subconscious prevails the conscious! especially when your contradicting thought is forced.

Using an old alt account so she doesn't see. I'll also refrain from revealing identities, despite what people may say. It's a complicated story, so I'll try to keep it short and answer comments as I can. I recently became friends with a girl (20) on a depression-related chatroom. She was in an abusive relationship and was dealing with an eating disorder. She eventually left her abusive bf and told me she had become infatuated with another user from the same chatroom. Out of curiosity, or more likely, jealousy as I had started to develop feelings for her, I dug to find the guy, using the name she told me. (I'm fully aware I'm not the most stable person, I go to depression chatrooms for gods sake). What I eventually ended up finding were articles from three different sources (including the BBC news) about a man (same full name, same location, same mental health disorders my friend described) grooming a 14 yr old girl into sex when he was 20. Through a depression chatroom, using her vulnerability and his mental issues to manipulate and control her. He evaded jail by playing his ""autism card,"" something I've been told he does frequently with my friend. He is also about 10 years her senior. I dont think she knows, and she plans on flying out to him and meeting up with him soon. My friend knows I like her, has for a while. We recently got in an argument and she told me she wants to be left alone for a while. I acted like a creepy psycho to find this guy, the article was well-hidden. She's not too stable either, doesn't have really any friends beside me right now. How do I tell her? I dont want her to hate me or think I'm a psycho, but I'm scared for her and want her to be safe."

I didnt find any perfect subreddit for my post and I want to ask my question in different subs because I hope to get very different insights and perspectives on my struggle. If you know any subreddit thats more fitting for my question Id be very thankful if youd let me know. This is my first own post here, I hope it fits for you and the mods. Ok, so heres the thing. Im not sure wether I (m, 31) can grasp my situation exactly but Id appreciate any advise or clarifying questions of you folks because Im stuck. For quite some time Ive been struggling with game, seduction, flirting or whatever you may call it. This frustrates me beyond anything because four years back I had to start a fucking calendar to not lose track of my dates. Im not trying to brag here or impress anyone - I literally started my first organizer in my late twenties to manage my dates; oftentimes it seemed to me like the more women I was seeing the less I had to invest in any interaction because girls either knew me already because of stories (Im living in a small but very young city with lots of female students) or because of my own narcissistic charisma that I was radiating at that time. Cut to four years later. After making a wonderful person of the girls Ive slept with my girlfriend, endless fights about her legitimate jealousy and trust-issues, almost 150 sessions of psychotherapy for myself, a terrible but rewarding breakup, Ive not only become more aware of myself, my good qualities and my disfunctional behaviors, thought- and relationship-patterns but I really started to love myself step by step. What I mean by that is that I started to feel empathy for myself in moments of vulnerability and thus for almost anyone around me; Ive built great relationships with new friends and repaired the old ones as good as I could, healed the relationship with my father and siblings, focused on my career - like really the good stuff. I realized that I probably wasnt made for a monogamous relationship, made that clear to my then best friend who I fell in love with; we became a couple 18 months ago and have been building a wonderful (nonmonogamous) relationship since then Ive never even imagined was possible. The only fucking problem right now is that I seem to completely have lost my game; I am considered a self-confident and charismatic person by my friends and new people I meet. In group projects at university or at work I usually find myself quite naturally in a position where I actively listen to everyone and work towards a common goal while appreciating differences in perspectives and opinions. Still Im the guy who protests authentically when theres something going wrong in my opinion while doing so in a manner that gives my counterpart the opportunity to respond without being crushed. In short: I often act as something Id call a good leader. Four years ago I was kind of an asshole, especially to women. I always pushed myself to care less and it seemed as if I was rewarded for it. Now that Im really interested in women, their thoughts and feelings, hopes and fears, Im counting rejection after rejection. Probably one of my core questions might be: Can I be a respectful playboy? And if so, how? Sorry if this post might seem chaotic, its the first time Ive tried to verbalize my struggle and English isnt my mother tongue. I would really really appreciate help from you guys. Thanks alot in advance. Tl;dr: Lost my game with women after changing myself towards a more loving person. I dont want to be a nice guy nor do I want to be the asshole I used to be. Thanks for your help. Edit: I used a new account for this because I didnt want to use my real account (which is known by close people of mine) or my porn-account. I hope this is fine.

93,vulnerability,Advice,Partner lied our whole relationship; are my feelings even real?,1,eq1dwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/eq1dwj/partner_lied_our_whole_relationship_are_my/,2020-01-18 01:55:44," Hi, new Reddit user here. My ex (22, M) and I (22, F) just split after a little more than two years together and I was completely blindsided. About a year ago, we had a fight about being together after we graduate undergrad (we are graduating this spring). I was ready to be long-distance, but he said that he didn't want to be with me after college. We talked later and he gave a really good reason for why he said that (it's a bit private, but I'm a skeptic so it was a really sound reason). We stayed together and for the past year he has been subtly alluding to our lives together once we graduate-- we'll visit each other, etc. It made me really happy and so when we finally had The Talk last week, I was floored when he said that he couldn't see himself with me in the long run. It turns out that he's been lying to me our entire relationship. He said that he thought I was amazing when he asked me out, but he could tell that I'd had a rough life (I had a pretty tumultuous childhood and kind of toxic parents) and he said that at the time he thought that I was someone he could take care of. He said being with me gave him purpose and that real love meant that you just continuously gave to your partner. This whole time, he has been doing anything and everything to ensure my happiness to the extent that it eventually weighed him down because he felt responsible for my feelings. He said that this whole time he felt like a caretaker rather than a partner. He said he was scared to be in a relationship and to be vulnerable; and he thought that love was just giving but he eventually realized he was wrong. He realized a few months in to our relationship that he didn't want to keep up the pretenses, but he was scared to talk to me. He also told me that at the time of our fight a year ago, he wasn't ready to break-up with me, even though he knew I wanted long-term commitment. He just wanted to be with me for a little while longer and it was much easier than any confrontation. I was always so serious about keeping open lines of communication because my parents divorced after about 25 years of being together. But it didn't work. So all the times he said he loved me, it turns out he didn't mean it. All the times he alluded to the future were lies, too. He knew how much I loved him, but he didn't tell me the truth early on to spare me this heartbreak I am feeling now. When I found out I was stunned and I still am. For a bit of background, I have struggled with feelings of anxiety and depression for a long time (because of said childhood) and I threw myself into that relationship with everything I had. I wanted to be a part of something healthy and incredible and I think between the two of us, we ruined that. Reflecting, I can see unhealthy patterns in our relationship. We were co-dependent (last year, we essentially spent every spare minute of our time together), he was never vulnerable and always placed my needs/wants before his, and I focused too much on him because it made it easier to ignore my own issues I need to work through. But I was so serious. I thought I was working so hard and being a great girlfriend and crushing the relationship game. Even after everything I've been through, I made the decision to put myself out there and trust him, because that's what you're supposed to do. True trust comes through vulnerability. But he lied, never told me how he was feeling, and basically controlled our entire relationship. I thought I had it good because we got along so well and literally never fought, but now I realize it was just because he never told me what he was thinking. I put my heart out there and now I feel lost and alone. Because I lost my best friend and the man I thought was going to be with me for the rest of my life. So I guess I am looking for answers. I'm so hurt because he lied. We ended up talking seriously about why we split and I know that he is dealing with guilt and pain and shame, but that is it. Everyone makes mistakes and it sucks that I had to be his, but I really believe that he is the sweetest, gentlest boy out there. He struggles because he thinks that people don't like him, but he has no idea how much people like him. I told him I loved him, how amazing he was, but maybe it wasn't enough. He made me feel good, but treated me terribly, but I still love him because I gave him my heart. Is it wrong of me to still love him? Do I really even love him or is just a serious case of attachment? I know without a doubt that I care so much about him, because he treats people so well. I feel like an idiot because I look back on these last two years and I wonder if they were a waste. Every single thing was a lie; can I even count this relationship as real or worth it? Nothing he did was out of malice, but every mistake he made, I have to suffer for and I am so angry, humiliated, hurt, and betrayed because of it. I feel like an idiot because I treated this like a real relationship; I put my heart on the line while he hid his feelings and played it safe. He lost a burden and maybe a friend. I lost my partner, my best friend (because even if he wasn't honest, I was always so vulnerable with him), and a future with him. It hurts so much because I love him, and at the time I believed I was in a healthy, committed relationship. Any advice would greatly help. I originally posted this on r/BreakUps, but I am so desperately in need of some sound advice. TL;DR: My boyfriend betrayed me by lying the entire relationship. Was my love for him and was the relationship even real?"

We started off casually having sex until he told me he developed feelings and I told him I was working on things with my ex. We still hung out during that time and we became closer. I eventually started to have feelings after I gave up on things with my ex. By that time he had stopped pursuing anything further with me. We werent moving any further with our relationship so I told him I wanted to give him all of his things back and cut ties which caused animosity between us whenever we would see each other out (this was a couple months ago.) A couple weeks went by and we saw each other at a party and we talked. He picked me up from my friends house that night and we had sex. We didnt talk for a couple weeks after that and my period was late so I took a pregnancy test and sure enough it was positive. I waited a week to tell him. Whenever we had to talk about the baby, it was me who had to reach out because he was avoiding the situation. We argued about money when I decided I wanted an abortion because Im not in a great position for a baby. Its been a couple months since then. I saw him at our mutual friends house when there was a get together about 2 weeks ago, his best friend convinced us to talk so it would be less uncomfortable for us and everyone else. We finally had a decent conversation about everything where he admitted he was too scared to face me because he wasnt ready for a baby. We started hanging out again, started having sex again, in my vulnerability I started to regain feelings. Hes been acting weird and I realized he blocked me on some social media. I put two and two together and saw hes been spending lots of time with a girl back where he grew up and has blocked my friends as well to hide the fact hes been posting with her. I confronted him today and he lied saying hes just visiting friends from back home. Do I tell his girlfriend? Im very hurt, I dont want to cause anymore drama, theres been enough these past couple months but Im so aggravated. Im hurt and feel like an idiot for being so naive and letting myself get used. I know I should tell her but I dont want to look crazy."

We have gotten to talking fairly often. Im a really lonely person and dont have any friends, so it was nice to see him be interested in chatting, and I have to admit I was pretty flattered. He told me how is ex died in an accident, he values stable relationships, etc. but as he felt more comfortable with me he started saying really contradictory things like how he sleeps with women, relationships disgust him, etc. He was only interested in talking about painful things from my past, and I wanted attention so I forced myself to do so. The even bigger issue is, he has a girlfriend. The woman I saw on his older posts I figured was just a friend, I didnt know they were actually together. I guess they really didnt seem like typical photos of couples that Id think of. I feel really hurt because lately he hasnt messaged me much probably because I annoy him. Normally Ive sent nudes when I wanted to get his attention but now I feel really bad. I dont know if I should tell her, but he would hate me and I dont want that. I want us to continue talking so I was wondering if I should just ignore what I sound found out? Do I tell her? What do I do? I have liked this guy for so long, but hes even said weird bizarre things like telling me easy ways to kill myself and that hes busy and just to talk to him once a week. I sound over dramatic but I really dont have anybody in my life and this is just really devastating to me. I feel like he took advantage of my vulnerability, and I dont even think he cares.

I had a knife clenched in my hand and I was terrified. It was completely unnecessary but 8 year old me thought it was life or death. I can laugh at myself now and say oh wow this is so petty and stupid but when Im in the same situation now that Im older and the sun goes down I freak out. I have to do a sweep of the house every time I hear a noise, I turn on every light, and I lock or block every door I can. I still have my bat from when I was on the softball team at my high school and Im grabbing it every five minutes to make myself feel more secure. Theres no point in me having it, we dont have stand your ground laws in my country as far as Im aware. If I injured or killed an intruder, Id probably face serious jail time. Im interrupting whatever Im doing, every time the heating comes on or my stomach gurgles, to blockade my door and get ready to defend myself. Its reached the point where I can only sit in silence with a bat at a vantage point in the house for hours on end. It needs to stop but Im genuinely scared. Plus its really boring doing that. I know in my mind that theres nobody in my house. All the windows and doors are locked and closed, I wouldve heard it if anyone wanted to break in. Plus theres nothing worth stealing in my house really. If someone wanted to rob a house theyd go over to the next street where all the fancy houses are. Im tired of being scared all the time because it just gets me so worked up and upset. My heart beats at a million times a minute and it makes me feel sick. Even though my rationality is screaming at me that nothing bad is going to happen, I still hear voices and whispering downstairs and footsteps in the next room or by the door. I think I can see shadows moving in my TV reflection or in the corner of my eye. I really do know no one is there. I dont believe my fear, I know its crazy and stupid that I freak out like I do but I cant stop myself. If anyone has any advice Id really appreciate it. I dont want to be scared anymore and if it means showing vulnerability on the internet, then so be it."

I think my biggest fear is being vulnerable and desperate. When people dont text/call me I feel like they want to avoid me and I just cant text them call them again because Im too scared to seem desperate (in both friendships and relationships). After I meet someone, I go over our conversation a hundred times eventually making a conclusion that It was too bad and I looked/acted like a joke. Got a great new job? -I questioned my offer letter a hundred times thinking that they made a mistake because how could they choose me? Make mistakes at work? -I feel judged and automatically see myself as stupid. Someone laughs at me?- My self-esteem goes lower than it ever was and oh, I wouldnt be able to fall asleep the next night. Someone cancels our plans (friends/date)? - Im boring, unattractive, weird, a loner. I want to stop this and live a normal happy life. Some people tell me that I seem outgoing and happy but they dont know how many thoughts and self-doubt goes across my mind after every conversation.

She has been extremely unhappy because of her job (and other factors from her past) for the past 2 years. She comes home angry, tired, and lashing out, taking out her frustrations on me. Ive talked to her about it a few times and said I noticed she is unhappy. Ive offered support, encouraged her to take time for herself, and tried to be patient. Im reaching a breaking point, because we keep having the same conversations. I cry, she apologizes, but then we get right back on the hamster wheel. She lashes out, and she doesnt know how to empathize with me or be supportive. I dont care how old I am, I will always in some way need my mom. Over Christmas, we were supposed to set up the Christmas tree together like we always do. But I ended up doing it all by myself. When I told her it made me sad that we didnt do it together, she snapped and said Ive had to do it alone for a long time. Just one small example of many. Im sad about where our relationship is at. Its to the point that Ive accepted that I cant include her in the details of my life. She doesnt support me. She brings me down. She doesnt really hear me at all. And it makes me feel so alone. I have a wonderful fianc, but its still hard navigating without her. I want her to be there for me, but she isnt. So, what more can I do in this situation? I cant keep stepping into the vulnerability arena, because I end up getting trampled every time. I want to be patient and help, but I cant keep getting wounded myself. And in trying to preserve whats left of myself, I am sad and feeling guilty in the process. Am I in the wrong here? Do I continue cutting down communication with her?

I crave them to be near me, and they are in my thoughts for weeks after.I am a 17-year-old male teenager, and therefore it is often young girls aged 17 to 20 I suddenly can get very drawn too. I have seen my share of Bondage porn, but I don't enjoy that anymore, and therefore this weirds me out. It is not like I want to dominate them, but I still have a huge wish to be with them sexually WHILE they are sad or scared. There is something about a sad girl's scared face I really find attractive. It is weird, because it is not like i want them to be unhappy.... This can happen in real life, but also with characters from movies. A good example is the Netflix series ""The Witcher"", where I have been really drawn to Ciri, and the scenes where she is vulnerable. I am normally a person who is in control of my emotions, and always able to pinpoint the feeling and what it exactly is. I can't do that here, and it freaks me out that I might actually get turned on by vulnerability. Not physical, but emotional vulnerability. I hope you could understand my English and are willing to help me get to the root of this emotion, and why I find the sad girls so attractive. Edit: It is important to note that i am not only drawn to them sexually. I have a huge desire to get to know them, and just talk with them. Imagining them laughing and feeling safe with me is also something i can think off a lot, which is weird since it is a huge contrast to the other vulnerable scared state i also like them to be in in my head."

Weve cried and laughed and told secrets and assured each other that we love one another, no matter what. Then theres the flirting: constant. All of this could still land us in friendly territory, but she says things that make me do a double-take. Her: We should celebrate our anniversary! Me: Absolutely! A friendiversary. Jamie and I do that, we- Her: Ew, no, that sounds much too platonic. Me: *talks about my fear of commitment (in the context of going on dates with someone else, mind you)* Her: *talking fast* I know what you mean. Ive been in circles this past week, thinking about how intense our friendship has gotten, it feels like more, but I realized I could never- *I can barely keep up with her words, and then shes changed the subject* Me: ...thats when realized I had accidentally agreed to a polyamorous relationship. It took me two days but I finally called her and told her I cant emotionally handle that. We havent talked since, and we dont plan to for awhile. Seems like the healthiest option. :( Her: :) That sucks. Me: You dont seem all that broken up about it. Her: Shit, was it my face? Did my face do the thing? Let me try again- Me: *thinking Im very Daring and Edgy for saying this* Youre just jealous ;) Her: *genuinely, as if this is obvious* Oh yeah totally *quickly changes subject* Her: *alludes to having feelings for me* Me: Is that what you were referring to when you talked about fear of commitment? Her: Absolutely. But we dont need to psychoanalyze me... *changes subject* She told her brother to turn off the fire for like the 3rd time, and I exploded. Its actual wood! It aint electric! You dont turn it off, you put it out! Her brother said its an Arabic thing. Fair enough. Later I tease her about it, and she laughs and says... Her: I will fuck you up Me: *suggestively* Please do Her: *eyes widen and she blushes fiercely. Fans herself facetiously* I dont know what Im feeling but its not turned off *we both lose it, laughing* Her: *still giggling* Get off of my side of the couch Me: Okay *scoots away* Her: *whines, tone immediately changing* nooo !!!! what the h*ck I dont believe I am mistaken in saying this is not Ordinary Casual Platonic behavior The kissing isnt the important part. Its the elephant in the room thats infuriating. And yet still, Im reluctant to do a thing about it. For one, it would be utterly illogical. List of reasons we cant date: - Were both terrified of romantic intimacy - Were both perfectionists that like some semblance of control, and relationships offer uncontrolled variables - Shes Muslim - And follows a lot of the customs - Im a gal. Women dating women is not one of those customs. - Her family might disown her - Shes technically bisexual, but for the above reasons I dont think she plans to do anything other than marry a man - What if it ruined our friendship - Worse, what if it worked out. That would be terrifying - I dont even know what I want out of this. All I know is that ignoring it is killing me But heres the real reason I dont want to approach this: Vulnerability scares me. What if I let my guard down, and she puts hers up? I dont want to risk seeming foolish and embarrassing myself. That thought is unbearably humiliating. Were spending all of New Years Eve together. I suggested throwing a party, and she was willing to do it if its what I wanted, but admitted earnestly that youre the only person I need. I replied with You sure know how to romance a girl! Good Lord. Anyway, I could bring it up then. I could go in for a kiss, and face all the awkwardness that would follow. I could try to have a deep, open, honest conversation, which sounds much too mushy and full of risk. I could make it a challenge. Say something along the lines of what if you kissed me or what if I kissed you. Right now. What would you do and/or call her a coward because shed hate that. And hopefully through that, bring up the emotional stuff while still maintaining the upper hand and not seeming completely helpless? Or I could play it safe and avoid this altogether. Theres always the option of waiting (I do love a slow burn romance) but what if it dies down, or one of us finds someone else? She talks about the value of Feeling. Of embracing feeling whether its good or bad, reveling in the intensity of an emotion. Yet were both shying away from this, albeit for good reason. What do I do"

I have spent so long wanting a sexual experience or a deeper connection with someone that I have almost forgotten how it feels to not be resigned and self-loathing. My first and only relationship contained sexy times but not actual sex, and our chemistry and dynamic were not where they needed to be. I came away with the lesson that my simple desire for sex that was mutually vulnerable and novel made me undesirable and difficult to relate to. Since then I have not had anything to do with my painful emotions about sex, vulnerability, and inadequacy. Still, she &amp; I have remained close friends. I have had difficulty getting sexual with girls since then, and my mind keeps coming back to her in an unresolved way. I have massive insecurity about being with her or even being able to please her, and mixed emotions about being with other people. Im at a point where something needs to change. Part of me feels like I need to embrace the unknown and just try for some form of sexual validation, while another part feels I have missed my opportunity for what I actually need. I feel very alone and my self talk is at once pessimistic and desperately hopeful. I am so tired. I feel I have so little left and am still on square 1. Any advice is deeply appreciated "
103,vulnerability,Advice,Mentally Abusive Stepdad,1,ec899y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ec899y/mentally_abusive_stepdad/,2019-12-18 16:24:27,"Hi everyone. Before I start Im gonna give a little warning that my grammar is not the best and Im also on mobile sorry :(( I need advice about my VERY mentally abusive stepfather. Heres a little backstory, him and my mom have been together since about 2011 ish i think and then they broke up once a few years ago, got back together, and had a long breakup in 2016 or 2015 ish. Well they have a kid together (my younger half brother), and we were all doing good without him in our lives and he lived about 4 hours away from us. So like the summer of 2017 he started complaining about how he wanted to see his son so we kept traveling back and forth that whole summer so my little brother could see his dad but at that time we lived about a 2 hr drive from where my stepdad lived. This went on for awhile, my mom and stepdad still were very platonic and only spoke to each other because of my little brother. So around Christmas 2017, we moved back to where we were again 4 hours away. He started staying the night at our house for awhile then would go back and come back every month or so. This also went on into 2018 and into the summer. As summer was ending I had to do school, but my mom, stepdad, and little brother wanted to go see my stepdads father, my little brothers grandpa all the way in Montana around the mountains(we were about a 7 hour or more drive from there). So they go on the trip without me since I had just started school and couldnt miss that many days at the beginning of the year. I stayed with my grandparents at the time. They spend a good couple of days there until I get a text from my mom telling me that my stepdad got into a really bad ATV wreck. The ATV flipped onto him I think, details are a little fuzzy. He was in the hospital because he had a broken leg and some ribs im pretty sure. He took a long time to recover and was in rehab for about a month and a half. All while this is happening they are both very vulnerable considering the father of my moms second child was so close to death. So what do they do? They get back together of course because of all this vulnerability and feelings. Also at the time my mom was contemplating on if she wanted to move to where my stepdad lived so that we can be close with him and we can all live in the same house together and live happily ever after. After a good month of everyone telling her not to move away from all of our family just for one guy who had broke her heart so many times, she made us move to where my stepdad lived. Four hours away from literally all our family. I had to start at a brand new gigantic school (Ive only lived in small towns, but where my stepfather lived, was about 95,000 times more the population where we used to live). It was hard but I got used to it. But, my stepdad started going back to his mentally abusive ways always saying something about how i look, dress, who I hung out with. Anything imaginable. He was like this before they broke up but it wasnt that bad because I was younger (Im only 15 currently). After not even a year of living there, my mother decides she wants to move back to where we originally lived before AGAIN. Of course this pissed me the fuck off because I had just adjusted and made plenty of friends and she was making me move back to a shitty small town that I was bored of. This was all about 3 months ago that we moved back here and ever since then I have been miserable. I know some people will be like oh youre a young teenager youre being dramatic but I really am not. The insults and criticism I get every single fucking day of my life that come from my stepdad hurts. Hes always calls me ugly, fat, gross, insults my makeup, etc. And its the main reason why I struggle with self confidence. My mom hates him too but doesnt know what to do. She cant help me because she works an hour away, 12 hours almost every day. (shes a nurse) Today I came back from being at my grandparents for a few hours after school for my stepdad to tell me that I cant get my PS4 controller back until my room was all cleaned up and was threatening to also take my phone. I argued saying I need music to focus on cleaning (actually true not a lie). So, no biggie ill just go up to my room and clean. I go up to my room and find all my shit gone through. TOTAL FUCKING INVASION OF PRIVACY. I was pissed tf off. I know my room was a little on the dirty side but that doesnt give you the fucking right to go through all my personal belongings just to find my stupid ass controller. He could have messaged me asking where it was and I wouldve told him. But no, he decides to go through literally everything, no exaggeration. I started crying because of how angry I was I messaged my mom and told her about everything and she told me that she didnt give him permission to do that nor did she know about this at all. So fucked up, like youre not even my real dad dude you dont get the right to look through my shit and NOT EVEN TELL MY OWN FUCKING MOTHER ABOUT IT. What the actual fuck. I told her that I was done and tired. Tired of him talking shit about me, when hes a grown ass fucking man. Tired of getting yelled and cussed at for no fucking reason at all. Just tired of everything. I left to my aunts house. And my mom reassured me that she will think of something but she is sorry that she cant do anything. She cant do anything because in the past hes broken phones, tvs, many other things when the cops were called on him, or she wanted him to leave. Were scared and dont know what to do. She tried messaging his mom but she doesnt understand how much of a burden he is on us. His mom believes hes never done a wrong this in his life. We cant call the cops because he isnt doing anything so what would be the point in that? We just want him gone, but dont know how to get rid of him because hes an intimidating, 41 year old, 61 ish grown man. Please if anyone has a solution for me it would be greatly appreciated because I dont know what to do. Mentioned this earlier but I am not an adult literally only 15 so I dont know if that affects any possible solutions for me. If anyone at all responds to this I will be so grateful :(("

So this girl and I have been friends for two years, and have always been very close. I have trusted her with a lot over these two years and during that time weve been in and out of different relationships. In between them, I knew she had a crush on me but I never reciprocated because I was in a relationship. Before I was though, we had flirted at a party and she ended up sitting on my lap, but I became uncomfortable and realized I wasnt interested. This girl started dating this guy whos a friend of a friend, but Ive met him a few times and I would definitely consider him a friend. I mostly would have seen him at parties or when my friends friend group would get together and they would invite me. They ended the relationship after four months, and its been a couple months since. Five weeks ago, I left an almost two year relationship, and this girl has really helped me in terms of making the decision to break it off and advice on how to heal (The relationship was very unhealthy for me). However, I started developing feelings for her, yet I wrote them off as emotional vulnerability and me latching on to someone close to me. But tonight we texted and eventually the conversation became very flirtatious and sexually charged, and we ended up heavily flirting. I think she might not be over her previous boyfriend, and I regret not stopping myself from flirting with her, especially this soon after a relationship. I feel like Ive taken advantage or violated the bro code by flirting with her, and I plan to talk to her tomorrow to apologize. I have no idea what to do or say, to her or to her ex."

I have a few good friends but I struggle to feel like I could call anyone in a crisis or even if I needed someone to talk to. What I want to know is bearing in mind that I do try to connect with others - I encourage others to be vulnerable with me, I show affection, kindness and all the junk to others but I struggle to do that for myself - is there actionable steps to bridge the gap between me kind of feeling unworthy as a human and unlovable etc, etc to genuinely connecting and feeling loved by others? Its a basic human need and I feel its causing me a fair bit of distress. I dont want to go to a psych to talk about the problem because I know the problem, I want to take action and do something.

106,vulnerability,Advice,Having trouble figuring out when it is appropriate to be vulnerable with other people,0,ej4cxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ej4cxt/having_trouble_figuring_out_when_it_is/,2020-01-03 08:10:41,"Hi reddit. Hope you're having a decent day I am a very open and emotional person, have been for a long time. I recently went through, essentially, a best friend breakup. Which is pretty okay because it was very codependent and we have each outgrown one another Since this, I've really been spreading my social wings! More specifically, reaching out and hanging out with new people and nurturing past relationships that had been put on the back burner during the peak of that codependent relationship. As I said earlier, I am a very emotional person. This way of being expands into most every aspect of my life: how I communicate, how I think, my studies, my career. I am big on empathic and active listening. As I've branched out and met new people, I feel the need to be a twinge vulnerable with them, for example I texted a new friend that I really value how she deals with disagreements and that it is very new to me. It was a long winded text and I got no response which left me feeling a bit sad. The overthinking begins, what is she thinking? Is she ever going to want to hang out again? Is she going to talk about me to her friends (who are also some cool people I'd love to connect with)? A part of me feels like I want to apologize but the other part of me feels that I shouldn't apologize for being open and vulnerable. I also dont know if my message made her uncomfortable or not, though judging by the lack of response I'm inclined to think it did I do know that there are some solid folks in my life who I can be vulnerable with and fear I am overextending this vulnerability to people who might not want it or be receptive to it. Honestly theres times that I dont know how to talk to people without tapping deeply into my emotions. This makes me feel like maybe I should pick and choose where and when to be vulnerable and emotional with people, yet I do not want to negate my true emotionally driven self I want to add that I do use logic, I am not just a pure vessel of emotion though it definitely sounds like it as i read this back. If anything, emotion is just a very big comfort zone for me, which is sort of funny because I know a lot of people who have a lot of trouble being vulnerable. I dont really know how to get to a comfortable point in being my true in-my-feelings self. Should I only tap into this when i know the other party is willing to respond to that energy? I hope this makes sense TLDR- I am a very open emotional person who is hanging out with new people and am unsure when it is appropriate to tap into that vulnerability when i meet new people. Dont want to fully avoid it because that feels untrue to who I am, also dont want to make people uncomfortable. Would love advice"

Hes Norwegian, speaks very good English, and Im French-American (French being my first language). I was just totally caught off guard and since weve never said it in English I had no idea how to respond, since saying it in French reads essentially the same way for me. I ended up leaving him on read for 13m as I panicked and tried to figure out what to say, ended up responding with je taime encore plus (I love you even more) - and he just liked the message. That was it. I dont really know what to do or think at this point, Im quite confused. Its super likely that he also just panicked and didnt know how to respond, but I honestly dont know... Did he mean it the way he would say I love you? Or is it just some cutesy thing he was trying to say?"

I'll just give you all the run - down. Growing up I was super into computers and coding. Growing up I just became more interested and involved with the computer communities. I started learning more and more. 2017 I got into Crypto and some more-on-the-sketchy-side type stuff. My life was going pretty well up until them. I Graduated HS when I was 16 (I was homeschooled), I got my Eagle Scout, I did 2 years of college and then once I was 18, I Left for a two year mission for my church. I went to the Philippines and after a short time there I suffered from multiple mental and physical issues that resulted in me being sent home. After being home for a while (I had a job) I decided to go to school in Idaho which is where I currently am. The first few weeks here were awesome. I was having a good time meeting people and partying. The next few weeks got sorta boring. It wasn't classes or anything that was boring. It was just the routine that got very repetitive. I had all A's and 1 B. Out of curiosity, I started messing around with the Schools Internal System and eventually found some vulnerability that let me get in. Short story they figured out it was me and now im suspended here until Jan 2021. SOO - The advice Im looking for is what to do. I've thought about joining the AirForce because it would be a certain way to just move on and a path to follow sorta. OR I could go back to school somewhere else. But even then I'm not even sure what I would study. My whole life I've only really thought about studying Computer Security stuff but after getting into Crypto. I started getting into virtual reality also and started to develop a passion for that stuff too. I think that I'd rather get into that then Cyber Security but I just don't have a path to follow. I have a good work ethic and I think that I have some pretty good skills and an overall good skill set that would already be worth a lot to possible employers but it's the fact that I don't have a degree for this stuff that makes it impossible for me to get a job doing what I actually want to do. I'm not really not sure what to do at this point. My plan as of right now is to stay here in Idaho until Christmas and then I have a ticket to fly home. I'm trying really hard to figure out what to do in between now and then."

I recognize that this isnt necessarily an uncommon position to be in, but for a long time Ive had a lot of anxiety about employment. Id like to bring this up with a therapist but Im afraid of having my trust violated again. The last therapist I had was, for a time, the most positive experience Id ever had with therapy. After several months however, my therapist essentially gave me an ultimatum by telling me I had to give her permission to contact my primary care physician about my marijuana use (which I feared would jeopardize my adhd medication that I frankly wouldnt have graduated without), or she wouldnt feel comfortable seeing me anymore. Has anyone here ever returned to therapy after such a negative experience? I would like to talk to someone again, but Im expressly afraid of bestowing that trust and vulnerability in a new therapist. It is my understanding that without that trust and vulnerability, it would be rather difficult for a therapist to help me. Im just not sure how to overcome my fear of that being violated again. My last experience taught me that no matter how right the therapist-client dynamic may seem, my trust could still be broken at any point down the road. Except, I wouldnt know thats whats going to happen until it does, at which point Id feel like I wasted lots of time and money, and the odds of me seeing another therapist would probably approach 0.

With his first wife, he had my two cousins (Tanner &amp; John) . Jessica has 1 daughter from a precious relationship (Mary). Since the new marriage, he has become a completely different person. My Nana (his mom) has noticed such a shift in his personality (from getting belligerently drunk and, borrowing over $500 of my uncle Hs money on his wedding night, missing holidays / mothers / birthdays, not allowing my Nana to see the two boys, causing very unnecessary tension between him &amp; the first wife - who was adored by our family, and so on). The boys have shared custody with the parents. The new wife Jessica is very odd. She is highly sexual in nature speaking and behaving very inappropriately towards anyone and everyone, which very clearly makes the rest of my family very uncomfortable. She sits on Kens lap at the table, is constantly rubbing and touching him, saying suggestive things. At dinner tonight, she was telling everyone how Tanner has been an awful teenager in their house (taking extra long showers, claiming that he told Mary to come on in on him in the shower, being too sexual himself). That was a huge ordeal, with her claiming him to be a sick pervert. She puts him down, and treats him like hes disgusting. She claimed that one night around Christmas last year John had gotten egg nog drunk, and had managed to mistake which room was his, ending up in Marys bed naked, and unable to wake up or leave. He doesnt remember it, and was visibly uncomfortable and confused when she brought it up. Hes very soft spoken, and barely said a word. My Nana has told me additional stories including one where they went to a pool party with all of that family. Jessica was wearing a very revealing swimsuit, trying to climb on Tanners back, and play with him in the water. She made a comment to my grandparents about a romantic getaway they had for their 25th anniversary, and was asking questions regarding sex swings, making them wildly uncomfortable. She let Tanner take a sip of her cocktail (Jameson &amp; soda water if it matters), to which he responded that it tasted like medicine and that all alcohol even wine tastes like medicine. Now hes 16, so I get that its not absurd to let him try a sip at home in a holiday, but just very off putting for them to normalize it. Ken, Jessica, and Tanner were wrestling in the living room, trying to tackle each other, and give each other purple nurples - okay not necessarily outrageous on its own, but with all of this context... Ken &amp; Jessica live in Chicago and I have seen countless photos of them on Facebook partying and looking absolutely trashed. She made a joke stating big pharma will need to make a new pill to let me live through the rest of the teenage years with these kids. I may be looking into this behavior too far, but often predators have been known to groom their victims. Inappropriate touching, putting them down, instilling guilt, placing blame. Im extremely concerned about the possibility of them being drugged? I dont believe she would or could fully rape either of them, but it doesnt have to be that to be considered sexual assault. I think she may be preying on his sexual vulnerability for his age, and the lack of sexual boundaries with their relationship. Women predators go overlooked so easily, and I cant help but think if this was a man, we would have already called the police. Everyone has thought this is completely eerie. What should I do?"

Women predators go overlooked so easily, and I cant help but think if this was a man, we would have already called the police. Everyone has thought this is completely eerie. What are your thoughts? Are we overreacting?"

114,vulnerability,Advice,Heartbreak,2,dll29e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dll29e/heartbreak/,2019-10-23 04:18:01,"(27M) About 2 years ago, the woman with whom I've spent the last 9 years building a life with left me. I always took pride in having a communicative relationship that nurtures both of us. We never got mad when discussing hard-to-talk about subjects, we never told eachother ""no"" when expressing our wants or needs. We had our typical arguments which stemmed from foolish little annoyances, but they were few and far between. The difficult part was how she left. One day, everything was normal, the next was ""I need to be alone now."" As usual, we respected our feelings even though they weren't mutual and I let her go. The hardest thing I ever had to do. I mean, I fought for her...but in a way that wouldn't push her further away. That was until she blocked me on all social media, and my phone number. Funny thing was, for someone who wanted to be alone, she was on tinder a matter of weeks later, had a new boyfriend a month later, and has steadily dated many men since. She has effectively ghosted me from the day she left. I still don't know what I did, and have had absolutely no closure. I haven't slept with, kissed, or even flirted with another girl since. I am, increasingly, depressed. The hardest part is that I am an extreme introvert living in an extroverts social life. I am a front man of a psychedelic band, and an artist. This depression creeps into these realms, and as much of a spiritual, mindful, and self loved person as I am, I can't prevent this from taking its toll. Life is so grey. Nothing makes me happy, angry, or enthused. No matter what comes my way I'm just...numb. A few weeks ago, after I played a show, a girl who I've known for a while approached me. Every time we see eachother we get into the best conversations that last for hours. I went home with her, we talked until 5am. I didn't even try to sleep with her, but we kissed and it was special. Following that night, I attempted to navigate the waters of courtship for the first time in 9 years. Things were well, we hung out a few times after. The conversation and emotions shared were increasingly intense. For the first time, I had hope that I could move on. This morning she broke things off. Atleast I got a reason this time...the whole ""you're an incredible person but I'm really busy"" bit. Which, again, I respected, thanked her for the moments we shared, and let her go. But I just feel this crushing load of sadness. I am an extremely closed of person, but I shower so much vulnerability around her because the conversation called for it. She never showed any sign of being put off by it, and always reciprocated. Now I'm left with this feeling of emptiness again. What did I do? Does it always hurt this much? Am I taking things to seriously or personally? These are the questions I keep cycling through, but I'm just so damn destroyed by it. I really don't know why I'm choosing to post this, I don't even know what advice I seek. I think I just needed to express it. The people I'm closest to, my bandmates, are all in amazing relationships with their soul mates and I just can't express this horrible sadness infront of that. The heroes journeys I dabble in once or twice a year, and ""hard"" psychedelics I choose to learn from, the methods of sobriety, meditation, mindfulness, positivity, Zen, every method I use to maintain a unique outlook or promote positive mental health just don't work in this realm. I mourn every day over the woman with whom I've spent 9 years. I was offered a window into what it looks like to be free from that, through this new woman, but that too was stripped. I like being alone, that isn't the department of this topic that makes me so sad. It's the lack of companionship. I have so much love to give...but why is it always a delusion of a constructed reality from the other? I am being deceived into opening up, into letting myself love, only for it to be stripped."

I've seen her before but never like this, I ran into her twice today and I'm very worried and sacred, her vulnerability is extreme. I have contacted the local civil office but they say they know her and she won't go anywhere or won't listen to them and that they can't do anything. I refuse this. I want to know what I could do, but then I want to be completely honest and I disclose that I'm seriously afraid to get close to her, because: 1) I'm afraid I'll have no idea how she'll react and how I could handle any possible reaction; 2) I'm afraid I might offend her -I have no clue how to treat someone mentally disabled nor someone in extreme poverty; and the most terrible one, 3) I'm afraid I'll be damaged for life to see someone so helpless so closely. I'm also agraid she'll want to touch me, this is someone who seems to have never showered in her life. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I live such a comfortable life just because I came out on this isde of the system, and even though I've worked in slums in educational programs, this is another level of helplesness and I think that's why everyone just walks by this woman; it's really terrorific to look at such abandonment of a human being in th eye.

I could do with some objective, impartial, friendly advice from strangers on the Internet. I'm 32, and currently in recovery from being poisoned by a prescription med. It's been 3 years so far, and I've just started feeling able to go for 10min walks round the block. I'm currently in trauma therapy as a result of the range of symptoms and effects it's had. I was living independently but had to leave due to my housemate and moved in with a parent. In this time both parents have became ill, and fragile, and lost all their money due to a messy divorce. I now have to leave as the flat we were renting will be sold. I have 3 months. I should be able to just do it with the money I have, but, in general, I need to get on my feet. I am currently surviving off disability benefit and I want to fight my way to a position of financial security and independence. Also because I have a younger brother who is very vulnerable and want to be able to provide for him. I need to decide on a serious career but I don't know what, and I don't know when I'm going to make a full recovery. So I can't do work shadowing or internships to figure things out. I crave security but feel like I can't commit to a full time job (right now) because of health. I'm very creative and make some money as a part time illustrator and artist. I don't really feel like this a secure career though. I like helping people but realise I could do this on a voluntary basis. If I'm being honest with myself, having always lived paycheck to paycheck and now having experienced intense vulnerability, I'm drawn to status and financial security. Partly for the obvious security, and partly for the feeling of self worth in the world. And yeh I know you shouldn't attach that to external things but let's face it - working on something worthwhile, such as providing for yourself, your brother, and future family is I imagine, deeply satisfying and significant in our sense of self. I need to find a job/career that either: 1. pays well or 2.pays enough but leaves enough time to build up my creative work which I feel has potential to push annual earnings up. I'm a qualified teacher, but, it's probably the best job at NOT fulfilling either of the above criteria  (I qualified when I was young, idealistic and invincible). Here are the other criteria: Essential Job that I can actually do without hindering health Pays well Desirable Potential for growth and progression Intellectual stimulation Autonomy Big picture aspect (fighting for justice, social issues) Geographically flexible (if I moved abroad in 5 years it wouldn't take much to retrain for that country) The complication Don't know when I'll recover Don't know when I do recover and am well enough to work if there'll be some vulnerability with my health indefinitely. Therefore high energy, high stress jobs possibly a risk to aim for. Any thoughts or suggestions appreciated."

English is not my first language and I'm on mobile as well, excuse mistakes. This will probably sound really fake but please believe me. I can't believe myself how insane this actually sounds. So my (20) big brother (35) is married for 8ish year's to his wife(~33); they have 2 kids boy(3) and girl with autism(6). He lives 500km from us and no other of our family members live anywhere close; only sister of wife (35) and her mom live in the same area. My mother always suspected something wrong with wife and her mom and they indeed behaved strange but nothing too out of the ordinary. My mom ALWAYS exaggerates and panics really quick, we even made jokes about her paranoia concerning his wife. Her mom for example is involved into some scammy pyramid scheme for over 20 years and she still believes she will become a millionaire one day. Her sister always appeared to be normal, she is really beautiful and has a diploma in business studies. Only thing is that she's always single and when she eventually gets a bf he breaks up with her withing a couple weeks/months. My sister in law was always quiet and just introverted in general (she's an engineer in architecture). But that changed in the recent year's, she began to talk more and more gibberish from Einstein's relativity theory to some kind of psychological enlightenment. The worse it got the more everyone except her family ( sister and mother) acknowledged that she's not mentally stable. 3 days ago my brother called us and told us that sister of wife was sent forcefully into a psychiatric hospital. Why? Because she was literally handing out all of her saved money and belongings to strangers on the street. Why? Because she was/is convinced that she'll be a BILLionaire and in order to archive that she has to act like one NOW because the money will only then come to her by itself. Bro also told us that the mental health of his wife got worse after that as well. Until this point no kind of authorities, mental institutions etc. were ever involved. My mom talked then to wife and told her we're coming over the weekend. And she fucking tells my mom to not come else she will die. When mom asked her why. She tells her she knows a word and when she'll say it out loud my mom will drop dead. My mom packed her things the next day and took me with her because she's scared of what wife might be capable of. Now I'm writing this at 2 am. Before we arrived we met our brother in public to talk to him without his wife knowing. He told us the crazy things that have happened the last couple of months. How it escalated from normal motivational videos to his wofe watching some psychiatrist on YouTube who will show you the path to real happiness. His full course costs 500 which she desperately wanted despite their huge debts. How wife's sister held a PowerPoint presentation for him, wife and her mom about how to get rich with her own developmed business strategy. At first he actually believed her since she's working for a decent broker company. She might have some insider knowledge or special algorithm or something right? The presentation started at 7pm and ended at 1am. Apparently every couple minutes more and more useless bullshit came out of her mouth. Never once mentioning her ""system"" but only talking about how to change your ""mindset"". And many many more crazy interactions between the 3 women. Now to the real bummer. They had a huge fight a couple weeks ago because he demanded that she went to therapy. She told him ""if you don't change your mindset, the person you love the most will lose his life"" knowing his little autistic daughter is his one and everything. First he thought it was just something to hurt his feelings but now he believes it was an actual serious threat. I feel so incredibly sorry for my brother, I've never seen him cry but when he's talking about his situation I see his eyes watering which is the closest thing ever in terms of showing his vulnerability to someone. He's a construction worker doing extra shifts to pay of debt. And when he gets home he has to cook, take care of the kids clean because wife did some other bullshit besides driving them to school/kindergarten. He wants to get seperated to protect the kids even when he loves his wife to pieces. And even when wife gets hospitalized kids might get into foster care because he can't handle the while doing his job to pay off debt. And moving back to home is complicated too because construction workers get really shitty pay in our region. My brother is literally the smartest and best human being I know. He deserves better. How can we help my brother? Is there any advice someone can give? We are already encouraging him to move back home. I tried to let out as much detail as possible. Tommorow her sister gets released and we want to talk to the doctors there about the whole situation."

I was out at college for 4 years and I missed the 4 years of her life when she turned from a child into a teen. But I had always envisioned to build a strong relationship once she was old enough to understand a mature sisterly bond. This year when I moved back home because I found a job in my hometown, I was set on rebuilding a relationship with her. However it's increasingly hard because she keeps her life a secret from me and doesn't indulge me in conversations about herself. It's always me talking and her barely listening. We take a few shopping outings and eat out once in a while and she's perfectly fine then. I view these times as the times that we get to bond and unfortunately, I feel that she doesn't. Not to mention, she is extremely pampered by my parents so getting chores, errands, or basic tasks that were expected of me when I was her age are not expected of her. This infuriates me and just fuels her snarky attitude. I have tried bringing this up with my parents but they just say that ""she's different and not as tough of a person"" so she can't deal with the same things I did. So in some situations I have to play bad cop to get her to do basic tasks and chores which is probably making her steer clear of me as I think she views me more as a parent and less as a sister. We have small quarrels over stealing clothes and and the piece of cake in the fridge but it's not anything I've not seen other siblings have. I try discussing boys and other PG13 topics with her with confidence, vulnerability, and maturity so that she knows that nothing in our relationship is out of bounds. However, she doesn't reciprocate or continue the dialogue. I am afraid that we will be those siblings who do not have a relationship when we grow older and it bothers me. I have seen it happen to my father and his brother and it was disheartening. I don't know if this is just her being a teenager or if our relationship is ruined for good. Is there any way to salvage this or working through this feeling? Any advice would be helpful. TLDR; Trying to build a relationship with my sister after being away for 4 years at college but she doesn't seem to reciprocate."

Weve always approached him on it and just kept an eye on the situation and made plans to avoid having him around when our female friends are around. We have a pretty tight group of 7 friends, 8 if you include him... we go to university and live close to each other. So weve come to find out that he really crossed the line with one of our female friends, call her (D), at one point a few months ago... she was vulnerable because of a family situation and he claims to have also been, having just recently had his relationship of 4 years broken off. They both tell two different versions of the story. Ive been avoiding talking about it because it makes her feel very uncomfortable to relive the situation and she suggested we dont bring it up, so Ive just treated him kind of normally. Until last night. He brought up the situation when we were out at a bar and it just spiraled. I ended up talking to him about it and I dont believe a thing he said. I believe he has some serious issues with his behavior around women, but Im not sure he knows it. Ive also never really seen it happen. My dilemma is that he has adamantly denied what happened and says stuff like he will forgive me when the truth comes out and that weve blamed the victim and treated him unfairly. I dont believe him but the possibility that he is being truthful is always in the back of my mind. When she talks to him, she seems very normal. I think this is because she wants to avoid talking about it and reliving that night so she just shrugs it off, but that becomes something for him to reference when he says everything is ok. The conversation we had was him using excuse after excuse, talking about how drunk and vulnerable he was, when she was the one who told us she told him no multiple times. The end of the conversation was borderline psychotic, it was 2 in the morning and I told him to leave, but he refused to leave my room, so I had to forcefully push him back to close the door, which seemed to make him aggressive. The whole thing just seems like he thinks he can lie his way out of whatever he did. He sort of admits he did something wrong when you talk to him about it, but he also blames alcohol, his vulnerability, and the close friends/housemates of the woman he took advantage of. So I dont believe him. Im sorry this is so disorganized... Im rushing off to work now. Ill leave with the two main questions I need advice on. How do I handle this without making D feel uncomfortable? What do we do about M living with us? What do I do about him guilt tripping us, and what if were wrong about it all?"

One of the questions asked what problems may I face abroad other than language and I am aloof and shy. So I kind of touch out about it but didn't because Ive never really told anyone my experiences and hardships of being that kind of person. Long story short my sister pushed me to get it critiqued by her and I am basically overwhelmed with myself. I hate hearing her read it aloud because I was a bit vulnerable. I put a bit of vulnerability in that paper and I hate it. She said it was too broad and in specific and she now thinks I cant take criticism because I kept on stopping her from reading it when in reality I hate hearing that side of me. She now thinks I'm mad at her and I basically dont know what to do. What should I write? Should I force myself to open up?

And yet, it was 5 years ago and I still haven't told a single person. He used the pretense of ""wanting to get me out of my comfort zone"", because I have a problem with vulnerability. Don't know why he thought that taking advantage of my trust would HELP with that, but that's the reason he gave. And I did it, because for the 4 years previous to this, he was like a father to me. I come from a really fucking dark past, and he was the first person who actually listened when I talked about it. He let me stay for hours after school was over so I didn't need to go home, he made sure I was eating enough (which I usually wasn't), etc. He was even the reason I wasn't straight up expelled after skipping class for a full month. But one day, about a month after graduation, we met up to have breakfast. And after talking for hours, he brought up the aforementioned ""therapeutic exercise"". I said I didn't want to do it many, many times, but he wouldn't let it go. Eventually he resorted to guilting me into it, saying ""Well you don't *need* to do it, but I really think it would be a good idea. You want to get better don't you?"". So we went inside my house, I took all of my clothes off in front of him, and I waited. He told me to look at myself in the full-wall mirror thing next to me (it's a sliding door to the coat closet), which conveniently gave him a side profile of me. After what felt like years, I glared at him and asked angrily if I could put my clothes back on, and he obliged. So my question is, am I overreacting or is this whole situation as fucked up as I think it is? He's never tried anything like it since, but I still don't think I can ever look at him the same way again. He also apologized the next time I saw him, to which I responded ""it's fine"" and it was never brought up again. I just can't stop thinking about what could have happened. Is this what he does with all of the kids he mentors? If I hadn't been so resistant, would he have tried to take it further? So yeah, thanks in advance for the help."

So my (22f) bf (24m) ex contacted me. I know who she is from what I've heard from other people (not good things) though we've never met, though she has seemed to always know who I am. A few months ago she reached out to me on social media, warning me that my bf is a violent, entitled abusive rapist (of several girls) who is only interested in me for my emotional vulnerability and how easily manipulated I am, and that I need to leave him. I didn't know what to believe so I just ignored the message and blocked her. This might make me sound bad but I remembered everything I've heard about her and put it to the back of my mind. I mentioned it to my bf, not what she had said but that she contacted me about him, and he didn't want to hear it. However, recently my mental health has been very bad. I live with depression and AvPD, and my anxiety has been through the roof to the point I'm on sleep medication now bc I wasn't sleeping. I've been going over the messages she sent me repeatedly, and sometimes it's all I can think about. I wonder if he did any of the things she said he did, though I honestly don't think he did. I was raped 2 years ago and while it's a very private matter and something I haven't come to terms with, my bf does know about it and has been nothing but supportive with everything that sexual trauma brings. Should I reach out to the ex? Just to explain my side and experiences? I really am clueless about what to do, and it's really starting to affect me. I go from wanting to ignore it completely, to confronting him about it, to confronting her about it. Has anyone been in a similar situation and if so, how did you deal with it?

I have worked at a Starbucks for going on four months now. To be entirely honest, I'm not well liked there. I don't blame the people. They have good reason. I am completely sleep deprived. Every second I'm not working at Starbucks I am working elsewhere. Door dash, dog walking, etc. Little side jobs like that. At the end of the day I come home, walk my dog, eat, and catch a few hours sleep. Even on those nights where I manage to work in a healthy 9-7 hour time frame to sleep, my sleep cycle is off because I am literally that stressed. So I end up waking up, unable to go back to sleep. I used to have no problems sleeping. My insomnia is stress induced. So I am completely stupid, and yes, I make a lot of mistakes. I would be annoyed with me. But I'm a college student and I need the money so I have no other option. There is one girl who especially dislikes me. The first day I worked without someone training me I was customer support. I spilled ice by accident. She excused herself for a ten and went to the back. I followed her, because hello, spilled ice, I need more. She bursts into the back room- had to know I was behind her, because hello, spilled ice- and immediately begins talking about me to a guy. Let's call him Tyler. Tyler is a cool guy. He puts his fingers to his lips, she acts surprised, I act like I have no idea what's going on, I get ice and leave without comment or glance. From there it escalated to snarky, passive aggressive comments all of the time. Literally all of the time. To the point I dread going to work and breathe a sigh of relief when she's not there. And she holds onto things so she can make comments about every little thing I've done wrong in the future. For example. In a lack of sleep induced blonde moment, I called one of my supervisors, let's say her name is Matilda, Madeline. Rissa immediately and loudly began talking to her, using her name repeatedly. ""Hey MATILDA, yeah you, MATILDA. My supervisor MATILDA. Could you help me, MATILDA? I just need help, MATILDA."" Two weeks later, even though I have had no problems calling her Matilda, anytime Matilda, this girl, and I work together, she does it. She did it again the last time I worked with her. ""Hey, MATILDA. Not Madeline, but like the movie MATILDA. I need help, MATILDA. Could you help me, MATILDA?"" The supervisors never say anything, both because they don't understand what she's doing and, in most cases, because they don't care. Because she is liked, and I'm not. Today was the final straw. I made a mistake. I did something today in a way that usually works, it did not this time. I adjusted and repeated it and it happened again. I coworker got a little wet with water. I felt terrible. I went to apologize. She immediately started apologizing for me, then walks away and says loudly to my coworkers, ""Why would she do that twice? Why would you even do it once, nonetheless TWICE. Someone should be fired."" (Mind you, she asked a coworker today in front of me who should be fired, and we all knew who she meant.) But this was the final straw. And a shift was standing there and literally didn't do anything. Because it's alright. It doesn't matter that yes, while it was a stupid mistake and I regretted it, I had feelings. Because she is liked. And I'm not. So it's okay that you make someone feel completely alone and worthless. I have tried to ignore it. I've tried to stand up for myself by fighting back where I can (bumping into her when she stood quietly directly behind me so I didn't know she was there, then, instead of apologizing, saying, ""Oops, didn't hear you standing there,"" so she gets the point). I'm worried about showing vulnerability by asking her to stop. But at this point it isn't healthy. I've struggled with mental health throughout my life. I've had issues with depression off and on. I haven't self harmed since I lived with my biological mother, but I am honestly about to, it's gotten that bad. Because it's constant, and I'm already in a highly emotional state due to all of the stress I've been under and the fact that I'm running on 4 hours sleep average the past 4 nights, not going back any further. I just don't know where to go from here, but I have to do something, because when you're driving home and seriously consider just driving full speed into a tree because who the fuck would miss you anyways, that's not good. I just don't know whether I should approach her alone, or involve a manager. I'm scared if I talk to her one-on-one she'll know she's getting to me and it won't stop. I'm scared if I go to the manager there will be retaliation or I'll lose my job, because, again, she's liked. I'm not. I just don't know what to do. I need help. I need this job, so quitting isn't an option. I honestly just don't know where to go. Please."
125,vulnerability,Advice,I'm getting to the point of getting addicted to a game... in an extremely weird way.,1,cp9jr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cp9jr7/im_getting_to_the_point_of_getting_addicted_to_a/,2019-08-12 18:29:33," I've been playing WOW since Warlords of Draenor, and had a great experience. I've played World of Warcraft on and off. I've gained experiences as I played along. I had rude players, and some friendly players. I loved playing the game because I can be friendly with other players. We had so much fun goofing around, and laughed off silly. Some tried to help me how to become a better player. But schooling and horrible situations I faced led me to not to play the game. I go to a college with some intimidating professors in South Korea, and it can be tough (I'm a foreigner in South Korea). They scream and curse at you for mistakes. Plus, I have an unhealthy expectations for a relationship, and have awful fears. Here's an example: I want to fall in love with someone. I yearned for it for decades. Especially who likes to share hobbies with me (Anime, computers, etc.). I want to date with a girlfriend who loves cosplaying and watching anime/reading manga. I yearned for them for years, but I live in a place where this is near impossible. Even if it did, how can a spouse like that deal with family issues (such as marital problems, raising a child, etc.)? She is too darned passionate about her hobbies to have any kind of relationship. Heck, I've even heard of rumors that otaku girls have unhealthy expectations from men. Even if my ""soul mate"" isn't an otaku, it'd still bring problems. I'd be worse off because with an otaku girlfriend, she might at least have fun with me. Others, meh. They might yell at me for my hobbies (anime, computers, etc.) And what about divorce? How can I raise children alone? How can I keep up with my child support. If we split, how can our children cope with the pain? But the bottom line is this: there is NO such thing as a person who is right for me. Lots of religious media and philosophers blabber this out. If you look for the right person, you end up in divorce. But you see, the opposite happened with my family members. They weren't right for each other and lived a broken life. I don't want that. But some say that there are methods that can turn around a wrong marriage, and it's better off than looking for the right spouse. I disagree due to what happened to my family members. I went through environment filled with verbal abuse and I could do the same to others, and I'm afraid. Especially if my girlfriend is hot-tempered. Hotheads make me super-furious. Thus, I'm gonna be single for a long time, I guess. And I have no ways to cope with desires to date a girl of my dreams. At least if I live alone in peace, that'd be good. However, the economy is SO screwed up that I have to stay with my parents. I talked to someone on another subreddit, and freaked someone out. She said: ""You want to fall in love with this dream girl who you've already built a life for. What are the chances of you finding that girl who will magically fall in love with you and fit perfectly in your narrative. No one will ever be able to live up to your fantasy. You already have these ideals of what women are like, have you ever spoken to one? You have so many checklists from what your partner needs to do, what do you bring to the table? Are you funny, are you kind, are you empathetic? Are you a good listener, are you able to show vulnerability? Are you a hard worker, are you honest and giving to those around you? It doesn't sound so, so before you even look for a partner you need to become someone worthy of one. There is so much more to unpack but please see a therapist. This is too much to untangle online or with a non professional. The longer you wait the longer it will take for potential happiness."" And I pondered this for a moment. I'll never have a girl of my dreams. By the way, in South Korea, therapists are poor. I tried therapists from A-Z, and none of them helped to solve my issues. And some other Redditors said the therapists only listen, nothing more. But I came up with a solution that is awful. **I decided to fall in love and date with my lvl.120 Blood elf. Even consider marrying her.** She is a mature, beautiful paladin who serves as a hero of Azeroth, a setting where Warcraft takes. I can dress up sexy, and go on to heroic quests. Although I don't play well, I might eventually. I am considering to play much as a regular addict would. But unlike dating real people, I become one with her. I move as her, I fight as her, I speak as her. It's a different sort of interaction, rather then talking to people. But if I have a need for a friend, I can fantasize her. I know she is not real (bunch of pixels), but I am fed of of this life, and I am losing my sanity. I have weird desires. Please help me, and don't be judgmental..."

I have never coped very well with the situation because I, myself, was dealing with behavioural and emotional development issues. I didn't have very strong relationships with anyone because I put up defensive walls and saw expression, other than anger and humour, as a sign of weakness and vulnerability. Super long story, short, in the midst of my own journey, I had a childhood friend pass away. I had no social media and I was very limited with my social outings at the time of her passing. This girl was someone I had contact with, but admittingly, she probably had closer sources. I knew her since we were 4. We were never best friends but we spent time together and I was very conscious of her struggle. She would reach out to me, exchange stories, and was also aware of my struggle. When she passed I got a phone call, or a text message. I can't remember. Regardless, it tore me. It's been some years now and it has never been something I got closure for. I can't really talk about it, I have done a lot of therapy for personal reasons but this is something that occasionally surfaces and it just crumbles me. I don't really know why, I can't seem to process it. Last night I was drinking and someone significantly older than me, made a comment that she wasn't THAT significant in my life. In all honestly, I bought up the fact I had lost a friend. I was shocked anyone could say something like that but it also raised super conflicting feelings about my own self validation. I insisted that I didn't like the comment and it would make me cry. They persisted, telling me I wasn't that significant. I cried. The tears just rolled down my face and I completely shut down. ""This is just a teenage reaction"", they said. I need advice because I do feel super conflicted. I'm aware I wasn't that important, I wasn't a best friend or a relative but I have memories, fond ones. Am I wrong for being upset over this comment? It's true to some extent. Does anyone have a similar experience? Does anyone else struggle with the feeling of overreaction about a death? I need advice and validation."

She's told me stories of her tragic childhood before (which I don't fully trust now) and she knew I've always had a soft spot for her, even when we weren't that close. We got into an argument on Saturday, after which I was ignoring her a bit. Not outright, but enough to notice that something is off. We're both in a very stressful state, because of the exam with hers being yesterday. With her history of depression and abused childhood, I was always bound to take something like suicidal thoughts seriously. It probably started out as a joke but after seeing how uncomfortably it made me, she just went on with it. I was really freaked out to the point where I had to namedrop a friend of mine who had died recently to try and dissuade from it. I gave her at least 5 different outs in the conversation and she took neither of them. In fact, she doubled down with statements like ,"" you should get detached from me"" and ""I'm not going to promise I won't do anything stupid"". She refused to pick up any of my calls and I was genuinely worried to the point that I had to wake up my parents in the middle of the night(which I'm extremely ashamed about). The called bullshit the minute they read her chats, and now, from an objective view, it's very very obvious that she wasn't suicidal. She played me like fiddle. The next day she went back to acting normal, tagging me in memes and shit. I didn't completely ignore it on the small chance that she was serious, but after flunking the test yesterday and still not giving a shit, I'm very sure that all of that was just a nice way of getting attention for her. This sort of drama isn't worth it for me with my exam 20 days away, but at the same time it hurt me a lot because I genuinely belived that she was a good person and I don't open up to people that easily. I thought of confronting her, but it's a situation that can go either way and will definitely end up taking a lot of my time, mentally. There a good chance one of us cries, if not both. How to do I proceed with this issue if it's bugging me so much? She did hurt me pretty badly.

I was told and experienced myself in the past that in order to show people that you care about them and want to keep the friendship alive, you occasionally have to invite them and host a dinner or party, or else people will think you dont care for them and will stop inviting and caring about you too. Thing is though that I'm absolutely terrible as a host. I'm not good at organising events, really bad at keeping conversations going and overall just bad at showing vulnerability and emotions of affection. Basically, I'm the introvert who has to be dragged along, the thought of having the responsibility for someone makes me physically sick.

They just tell me to accept myself irregardless and no person can look perfect and that I should be contempt with looking normal.

My parents never took care of me except financially, its like they gave me a roof, food, and an education, and that their job as a parent was done, they never cared to raise me and my sibling in a friendly environment where we could be honest and have open conversations, where I could invite my friends over or have a sleepover, where not every single family dinner ends with screaming and fighting. I feel like I never had a parent present to help me in my time of need or when I'm having a personal crisis. I have no friends and spend most of my time at home alone, I feel like the best years of my life are passing me by and that the way my life played out has prevented me from ever feeling like I can be myself and be happy at the same time. I feel like the rest of my life won't be any better, as a person who cannot accept the way they look and the way they are how am I supposed to live a productive life and do something that matters or at least be happy?

Here goes. BACKSTORY: I have a friend that I roomed with for a pretty decent period of time before moving back to my familys area to start a new chapter in my life. I only met this person when myself and a girl I was living with needed a third housemate to help cover the rent. The topic of this post, B, responded to our ad, and I had a long conversation with B. We seemed to have a lot of very similar interests, and I was pleased when the other housemate agreed that B was a good choice for our new roommate. Things were pretty ok for about a month - B professed to having a great deal of anxiety, and we got in a few minor (from my perspective) spats, mostly when one of us would misunderstand the others intentions. For example, I once got up from the dinner table and walked over to the sink to wash my dishes while B was talking at said table. B interpreted this as me cutting off the conversation abruptly, I interpreted it as me trying to stay productive while listening to them. B started talking to me, or at me, a LOT in this time. Venting about literally anything and everything. It could go on for hours at a time. I had a lot of trouble handling this appropriately, as B said they wanted me to respond to what they were saying but tended to feel like I was interrupting when I did. (I will say that A) I probably was interrupting at least some of the time, probably because Im bad at reading pauses in conversations - Im working on it and B) I realize I should have set specific boundaries at this point in time.) I really dont mind listening to people vent most of the time, but this was exhausting - it kept me up for hours after I would have normally gone to sleep and shit like that. Still, I wasnt wildly perturbed or anything at the time. We had a lot of very positive interactions too. We went out with the other housemate, cooked dinner together, talked about fiction we both liked, all that jazz. I think I fell short in clearly and accurately expressing my needs as a friend, though, and its coming back to bite me in the ass now. Things went to absolute shit after a period of relative normalcy. B became convinced that the other housemate hated them, and though I thought this wasnt the case initially, the other housemate did, in fact, come to be angry about literally everything B did, from leaving a little bit of hair in the sink to putting extra food in the freezer. That housemate started out just ignoring B flat out, but escalated to leaving snippy notes and such. B, in turn, undertook a campaign of being a passive-aggressive dick as often as possible, taking wet laundry out of the dryer and shit like that. I tried meditating between the two, since I thought both of them were wildly overreacting to fairly minor issues. This is one of the places where Im sure I overstepped my bounds out of sheer desperation. They both took offense at me putting myself in the middle, while I felt I had little choice because I literally lived in the middle. Still, both of them expected me to be on their side and I tried really hard to be neutral for a long time. Eventually, I got to the point where I would end up venting about one to the other and vice versa because I was so tired and I had no one else to talk to. This is another place I fucked up - I know this fed into the conflict and I shouldnt have done it. This came about at a time B brought in and subsequently ignored a major allergen for me for about a month. I wont specify the allergy since that would really give me away, but it sat around the house for ages. One of the times I tried asking B to deal with it, they said something to me that really upset me, and I mentioned it to the other housemate and left to call a suicide hotline for an unrelated issue. That turned into them having a screaming match while I was crying hysterically and dry heaving over a sink in another room. B accused me of giving the other housemate reason to have them evicted, which wouldnt be the case for a normal person but was the case for this housemate since she was VERY controlling. The housemates attempts to have B evicted went on for the rest of the year. Meanwhile, B and I had a very weird up-and-down relationship; wed get into a lot of arguments about the housemate, mostly to do with Bs feelings that I should be defending them more, but we also got drunk together, went on a lot of outings together, etc. And still had the whole venting-for-hours thing going on with me saying very little. I paid for most things requiring money due to differences in our financial situations. I also shared some very personal information about my life with B, and B did the same with me. END OF BACKSTORY We also had several pretty intense arguments about how we interpreted each others sense of caring. That leads into the now, several months after we all moved out. I do not speak to the other housemate at all due to her behavior behind my back (claiming to my boss that I was hungover when I called in sick to work, telling people that I stole her food, shit like that), but I do still speak to B. Our relationship got considerably more positive once our housemate was out of the picture, but. Every time we have a disagreement I get sick to my stomach. I say a lot of stupid shit when Im angry; I dont typically make malicious personal attacks or anything of that ilk, but I have a tendency to say things that are only adjacent to what I meant, not actually what I meant. Either that or Ill bottle everything Im feeling up until something flips the switch and I just blurt out things that are true but relate to things that happened in the past, not the current conversation. Basically, I have a lot of trouble focusing on the issue at hand rather than every single thing leading up to the issue in an argument, and I struggle to be specific about my feelings in a lot of situations. This leads to a lot of misunderstandings or generally hurt feelings and I know its primarily my fault and my responsibility to fix. Im doing my best to work on it, and I know I havent gotten over it yet. For example, when I feel like an argument is coming on I may prematurely jump to defend every single thing Ive done pertaining to the possible argument, even when its really not necessary or my defense is baseless. That being said, I DO still tend to recognize and concretely acknowledge when Ive done something like this. It takes me a little bit to work things out in my brain, but I always do my best to acknowledge, verbally or in writing, when Ive fucked up. Heres my current issue, and Im sorry it took so much backstory to get here. I needed to make it clear that this friendship has always been contentious, and I had a role in making it that way. Every time I disagree with B, regardless of subject, its always framed as being my fault (regardless of subject), and they always tear apart my every action trying to get at my true intent, get upset if I dont understand what theyre getting at, and blame me for feeling like they \*have\* to respond if Im messaging them at a time they feel like they need space to cool off. B always considers themself the most objective person in every argument. I want to emphasize here that I KNOW my behavior has been the cause of some of these arguments, and that B was right to feel upset about some of it. However, I am exhausted with being the only one expected to communicate to high standards in this friendship. If I dont respond the way they expect, or try to respond the way they expect but miss the mark somehow, theyre upset. If I dont know what it is they were expecting to hear, theyre upset. If I dont think to ask in any remotely emotional conversation what theyre looking for, theyre upset. If Im not the one giving an explicit apology every single time, theyre upset. I recently had an argument with them that did start with me being primarily at fault, by dominating a conversation about an issue they have and I dont. I got defensive when they pointed that out, told them I needed a break to cool off, and asked them how they were doing once I felt better. They took that as me glossing over the issue and things spiraled from there. I got defensive again but admitted that I handled the whole thing poorly and that I should have respected their experiences several times over. They still dissected the entire multiple-day interaction over and over, and no matter how I apologized and tried to clarify my understanding of their feelings, it still ended with them saying I was never going to get it if I didnt get it by now. During this whole shitshow, and throughout several arguments in the past, I asked B if they could tell me if I was stepping over the bounds of what they wanted (i.e. giving unwanted advice rather than comfort, things like that) and to explicitly let me know if they need space and time away from contention. They have refused both on multiple occasions, saying that its too hard for them to make themselves vulnerable that way. I KNOW I have fucked up many times throughout this friendship and I will probably continue to do so, but I dont understand how Im supposed to understand and respect their boundaries to the fullest extent when they refuse to tell me. They say I should ask what they want but refuse to tell me when I do. A number of our arguments have sprung out of situations where the whole vulnerability idea kept them from saying anything to me that explained their actions until it got to the point where it was very, very hurtful for me. Im so, so tired and I feel like all they really want from me is for me to agree with their feelings, whether theyre about me or their job, and never provide any input of my own. Generally speaking, I think B is a good person struggling with a lot in life, and I know that manifests in interpersonal interactions in a lot of ways, but I dont know what to do. I want to be a good friend, but Im starting to think were just really, really bad for each other. I dont know if I should keep trying to work through our respective communication issues or just walk away. This person has had a lot of bad experiences with losing friends and family, and I really dont want to just drive them further inside their walls, but Im so lost at this point. I get that its not my responsibility to fix B as a person and its not Bs responsibility to fix me. Do I walk away or keep trying for both our sakes? I honestly dont know what the healthy or right option is at this point. I will emphasize one last time that I am in no way innocent here, but I am still a human person with feelings and I dont feel like a friendship should make me feel this terrified of slipping up. If I walk away, I dont know how to do it in a way that wont make things worse. Sorry for the stupidly long and probably largely unnecessary block of text. TL:DR I have a friend with a really tumultuous shared history that crucifies me every time I say something I shouldnt, regardless of whether I admit I did bad or not. We dont really understand each other emotionally, and Im at loose ends as to what to do at this point. Should I walk away, and if so, how?"

Fucking up isn't traumatic for me, I fuck up all the time, it's just that I am kinda weak you know. I tried keeping a stiff upper lip and putting on a stoic face, but I broke down, with tears being shed uncontrollably. And the people who critiqued my fuck up were doing so in an advisory manner mind you, and they viewed me with pity but decided not to comment on my state of vulnerability. I broke down mainly because I believed I did the best, which in hindsight was but a small failure. I learnt from said mistake and have tried to better myself from then. But I always get triggered nowadays whenever I see someone crying, be it irl or in media. I then proceed to start wiggle or writhe in pain, whilst cursing my state of weakness then. Any ideas how to cope or forget said incident, I tried forgiving myself, but it doesn't make the urge to hide in an isolated corner away from the rest of the world any better."

I literally log into a virtual computer when I arrive anyways, which I can do from anywhere with an internet connection, and it's not like there's some special security vulnerability, because they allow us to work remotely when there are emergencies. Our team is composed of four people total, including myself. One of our members left a few months ago, and we've been training a new guy for about a month. My best friend (who is also supervisor in our team) is generally seen as being irreplaceable to the company, even beyond our department. All three of us (I don't know about the new guy) want to be able to work remotely, and the VP of the company has supposedly pushed for it as well. One person in the company gets to work remotely, although I believe it was brought on by a family emergency (as I understand it, he approached management to put in his two weeks, they offered remote work as a way of keeping him). Our team is small, but we have a growing presence within the company, and will likely only continue to grow. My friend has only been supervisor for a year, so I know he wants to make sure he doesn't ""rock the boat"", so when I've mentioned possibly approaching management about remote working in the past, he was like ""let's just wait until things have evened out a little more"". My thinking, though, is that the power is kind of in our court right now; if the three of us forced the issue, I feel like management would *have* to grant us the ability to work remotely. Because otherwise, our division would have to close, and it would leave a pretty huge impact on the company itself. But maybe that's being a little too ballsy? And obviously, there's a possibility they could call our bluff and we lose our jobs. I dunno. Curious what you guys think?"

I turn 19 in July and I still live with my mother as opposed to a college dorm. I'm thinking of looking at some residence halls, not because I'm immensely irate with her, but because I've been with my mother my whole life and with everything we've been through, she still invalidates my criticism against her (actually anything i say bc of my age). I pay half the rent so I'd like to think she'd respect what I have to say just a little.. She has a hard time being vulnerable with me (she views vulnerability as weakness). I tried to explain to her that sometimes I wish she would be more vulnerable with me because there are times where I feel like I don't know her that well despite knowing her my whole life. I'm sure she's vulnerable with her boyfriend so I'm just confused as to why she feels like she can't be that way with me. She's even said in the past (not long ago) that she appreciates me and feels like we're a team. I would describe knowing her well as knowing what she likes/dislikes, knowing what she would do in certain situations, and knowing her past experiences and what has made her into the person she is today. Anyway, when I explained this to her (in a calm and relaxed manner), she joked and chuckled it off as she always does. In response to her laughter I said ""I wish you would take this seriously."" She was on the phone with her boyfriend at the time (she had answered it briefly after the start of our conversation) and she didn't say anything. I followed up with ""This is another issue I have with you. You joke around too much. It's like you don't know when to turn it off."" I don't remember exactly how she replied but she said something along the lines of ""you don't know what you're talking about."" I said something like ""and why is that?"" and she tells me ""It's because you're down here and I'm up here. (she gestured on the wall) I have 20 years of experience on you."" And I, clearly not joking was like ""what does that have to do with what i said?"" And she laughs again saying ""You don't know what youre talking about"". How do I get my mom to take me seriously? Should I have even said anything? I feel like no matter what I do, she doesn't have enough respect for me as a person. She's very age-ist and scoffs at the idea of me having 'a life' because I'm too young. It sucks that someone I care so much for is like this. I have a history with bullying and cripplingly low self-esteem. Now that I'm starting to know my worth, I'm wondering why my mother thinks it's okay to invalidate me this way. The worst part is that she may not know half of what I've beeb through because she's a terrible listener (distracted,cuts me off while I'm speaking, etc.) How do I get her to see my POV and respect me as a person? TL;DR: My mom invalidates my criticisms against her because I'm young. How can I get her to stop looking down on me because of my age and show me some respect?"

There was a day when the director overheard me saying that I thought he didn't like me and he came out of his office to tell me that wasn't true."" My boss then said, ""Oh. Maybe she(the employee he overheard it from) was joking."" This is bothering me a lot because I'm having a particularly difficult month.

I feel like he's trying to kick me while I'm vulnerable and make him seem like the only reliable person in my life. I'm naturally super insecure and doubtful of myself and I have opened up to him way more than I should have. I regret showing any vulnerability to him as I feel like he is using that to his advantage. I know the obvious advice is get a new job and believe me, I plan to do so.

151,vulnerability,Advice,I'm too emotionally attached to tragic incidents involving sexual violence towards women,1,bswdf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bswdf2/im_too_emotionally_attached_to_tragic_incidents/,2019-05-26 02:24:51," Hello, I thought Id try and get something off my chest, a haunting issue within me which Ive kept bottled up for a long time which It involves my experience reading the manga( Japanese comic ) called Berserk by Kentaro Miura. It might be quite a read so please bear with me. To be very honest, I must admit that I have a lot of resentment to the mangaka of Berserk. My issue with the manga is based on the amount rape in it, it is a theme in the story as I am aware of, mixed with gory violence and other dark themes, it is not for the squeamish of course, which I myself regret. It's just that ever since I read Berserk, its like as if my world has changed. Do not get me wrong though, even though I expressed my resentment to Miura, the problem is more of my own, Miura is indeed a talented person ( sigh ). I have a problem. I take incidents involving rape extremely personally ever since I read the manga, something that I didnt have personal issues with before. I have become too emotionally attached to the tragedy of rape. It just fuels me with so much frustration and rage. Before reading Berserk, I use to take rape incidents as any other usual tragic happening, like a stranger dying, for example, youd show sadness and sympathy, and then youd move on, life goes on. I was not so attached to such tragedies, but now, I've become fixated, mindful, fearful, enraged with everything to do with rape, I've become overwhelmed with anger towards rapists and their cowardly acts, and yearn for some form of revenge ever since I read the manga, and this is specifically to do with the Eclipse scene in the story, mostly that is. Its like every incident involving rape brings flashbacks of the horrific episode of that scene, with every perpetrator being spawns of those Apostles and Femto. On the other hand, it did teach me to respect women more and acknowledge their struggles. If Im to be even more honest, its made even more fearful for myself and my future, I fear of what happened to Guts happening to myself, i.e. a loved one ending up in such a foul act, someone you care about and someone youre willing to protect, because thats what I felt from Guts in that horrid scene, him being unable to protect, as a man. I mean this world is an unforgiving world, and with art imitating life, there is a real-life incident that happened to the celebrity Fran Drescher, an incident that haunts me, similar to the eclipse scene in which burglars broke into Frans house, beat up her husband and tied him down while one of the burglars raped Fran in front of him! Such a cruel act! It makes me wish all rapist could be eradicated from this world! The feeling of weakness, vulnerability and fear, the inability to protect, thats what that scene did to me, thats what made the scene shocking, Miura has a way of always making the rape scenes very horrific and imaginative with an artistic touch. The rape of Casca was such a dreadful sight to see, and it was explicit. The sever sense of desperation and urgency from Guts, which you could strongly empathize. To make things worse it's even debated that Casca was raped beforehand by the Apostles which to me is even much worse (just add, I always found it very disturbing how many times Casca ends up in situations where she is about to be violated). Seeing Casca raped by Femto while Guts desperately struggles from being subdued by an Apostle, and forced to watch. The worst then happens, to show how grave and desperate the situation was, we see Guts perform such a dreadful and painful sacrifice, him hacking down his own arm. The determination, the eagerness, the pain tolerance, all in one, is just so overwhelming to see. Youre rooting for him to win, to save the woman he cares and loves, to beat the shit out of Femto and the vile Apostles, you just want the rape to stop. But it doesnt, the rape goes on and on, Guts sacrifice was unsuccessful, hes pinned down by more bloody Apostles, with one of his eyes gouged, what a truly evil ploy. In seeing Casca being violated, the next worst part happens which was the worst part for me, and that was seeing Guts in tears. You could truly empathize his feelings, the feeling hopelessness, and powerlessness, such a strong sturdy man being reduced to nothing, such an evil ploy. I was almost in tears myself. After that, after everything that Id tolerated from the manga, I decided to stop reading it, it just became too much for me. And so here I am, I decided to write this to just express myself and hopefully seek answers. Truth is I feel trapped and invulnerable, the same feelings from Guts. Hopefully, by opening myself up, I could a new perspective and grow. Cheers."

I don't know how to move on or grieve and it happened last year.,3,bt7dy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bt7dy8/moved_to_a_different_country_to_work_study_and/,2019-05-26 22:31:23,"This is way longer than intended, sorry. I'll get some relevant history out of the way. Family moved from home country to neighbouring country when I was 7. Parents divorced when I was 10, dad moved back to home country when I was 12. Not a great dad but a genuine and hard working man so I still respected him. During that time, both he and I were separately diagnosed due to behavioral issues. Someone my dad was seeing encouraged him to get help, where they identified depression. Anyway, when I had just turned 20, I moved in with him, leaving behind my support system (family) because of my toxic friendships and self destructive cycles. Essentially he offered me employment and a chance to learn some things my mother never had the time to teach (single mum with three kids in an expensive city can't be fun). And I did learn a lot. I hated it a lot of the time for a myriad of reasons but I focused on forming a relationship with him, working my ass off and learning as much as I could. We got really close, he could still be extremely obnoxious but was ultimately a genuine and well-intentioned person who pushed aside all of his pain throughout his whole life and coped through alcoholism and deflecting angrily to avoid vulnerability. But there were some times where he really opened up to me, and I think he gained a lot of comfort from that and so did I. After being there for a bit, he and his partner split and I think that was the end of another bad cycle for him. He kept repeating finding a home, having a partner, having the toys he wanted and every time it would somewhat fall apart and I know he was getting tired of it all. I tried to help him and encourage him, I tried to be there for him without acting like his parent but I guess nothing I could have done would have been enough. He believed his brothers would move and and they mostly did pretty quickly, he thought my siblings and I would be better off without him and with a little bit of money but apart from when I worked for him at minimum wage, 70 hours a week, we didn't care about that. I know I'm not responsible for his death and hell, I gave that man more of my time than he ever gave me directly but I still find myself wishing he was here and I can't move past it. Not a single day has gone by since where I don't think about it. I've tried counselling and I have a supportive family but they're mostly overseas. As with all of these stories people tell, to me this is the TL;DR version but I tried to keep it fairly concise and so I've missed out a lot. Just don't really know how people deal with grief and actually live with it. Right now it feels like it did when I was growing up, it feels like he's around but I'm busy trying to forget that because it's easier. Guess the difference now is he's actually gone and it would be easier if I could just see him."

This may seem like Im complaining over nothing when you compare it to those who dont even have functional families, but Im desperate for help. Growing up in an Asian immigrant household, I (25F) struggled with being recognized with positive reinforcement. I remember so little of my childhood and I cant tell if its by choice or that I truly dont remember anything worth treasuring. I was not allowed to hangout after school, go to sleepovers or even have friends come over. I was not allowed to have friends that werent family (cousins Id see a couple times a month), and I feel like Im socially impaired at this point. It was pretty common for my parents to make fun of me for crying, show vulnerability, or have anything to complain about. Id be criticized about my weight and laziness even though I wasnt allowed out of the house after school. I now constantly look for validation in all things I do from the few peers I have and cant keep myself from worrying about what absolutely everyone thinks of me. I am obligated to be grateful for how much my parents raised me, at least putting me through college, but I was socially isolated. I feel like I grew up in a bubble and now I cant function properly from day to day. I cant help but somewhat blame them for my incapability of interacting with people face to face. I feel resentment towards their parenting and now that Im older, I want to avoid hating them for something they likely didnt do intentionally. What can I do to keep from damaging my perception of them further? TL;DR - I grew up with strict, loveless parents. How do I keep from blaming them for my deprived childhood and social awkwardness?"
155,vulnerability,Advice,I lost my last close friend yesterday. I'm so lonely I don't know what to do with myself and I'm starting to think it's my fault.,1,bwyc84,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bwyc84/i_lost_my_last_close_friend_yesterday_im_so/,2019-06-05 14:06:24,"Hello everyone. This might end up being stupidly long, so I'm sorry if it is. I'll try to keep it simple. All names will be changed to King of the Hill characters for simplicity's sake. So, some backstory. I'm 21F, living with my boyfriend, called Dale (20M), for the time being until I move back to my parents' house in my hometown in like a month. We will probably break up when that happens. When I was a young, I was sexually abused for about twelve years (ages 6-17) by my mother's brother. He died in a car accident just after Thanksgiving in 2017. None of my family know about what he did to me. I'm planning to start therapy for it in August. I'm also pretty depressed, but have been feeling better lately. I am unemployed and dropped out of college just before last Christmas. I was picked on a little bit in elementary school, and a little worse in the beginning of middle school but that eventually faded away for a few years. In high school, I had a 'friend' group that was mostly very petty and mean kids, but they never treated me that way (yet), so I didn't think much of it at the time. I tried my very best to be a good friend to everyone and to be kind. Just before junior year started, I began seeing this guy that a friend of a friend had a major crush on, and from then on, everyone I knew started picking sides, mine or this other girl's. Most people picked hers and I started getting bullied for being a 'whore' and 'stealing' this guy from her, even though he didn't like her at all. It was a sort of ""if she can't have him, nobody can"" type of deal. Really nasty rumors started flying around, the guy broke up with me over it, and I tried to kill myself the summer before senior year but botched it and survived. I had one friend, Khan, who I had been close with since middle school, who was also friends with a clique of girls who were the ringleaders for all my bullying. Khan would occasionally try to set me up to say things over text that, if taken out of context, would look really bad. He would then screenshot and crop this, send it to that clique, and screenshot all their messages that were picking on me to send back to me, in the effort of causing drama. He was my only close friend at this time and I had absolutely zero self esteem, so I put up with it. After we graduated (he made me walk at graduation with the two worst of these girls and him for the ceremony, got picked on then too), I went across the state for college. I started trying to do a sort of slow fade from him to minimize any drama. I finally went no contact completely in February of this year. In college, I met Dale and my two awesome dorm roommates called Luanne (20F) and Connie (20F). I started smoking pot to help me cope with all my abuse, but that year was one of the best I've had since elementary school. I'm not exceedingly close to them anymore, Luanne and I still talk occasionally, I don't really hear from Connie much because she has a new friend group in her major that she unintentionally prioritizes over the rest of us. I'm happy for both of them, and have no problems with either. We just aren't close at all anymore and I go weeks between hearing from them despite reaching out about once a week. I try not to be annoying by spamming them. My other friend, Boomhauer (26M), is a different story. I met him the summer after senior year at work and we got close over the next year. Boomhauer is a good and sweet guy deep down, but he's selfish and doesn't really think about how his actions make other people feel. He has habits of blowing me off to go meet up with his tinder fuck buddies and saying mean things at my expense as 'jokes'. In the last six months, he started getting really cold and distant. I wouldn't hear from him at all if I didn't reach out. But he also had some shitty things happen to him when he was a kid that he's never really worked through so I try to be extra patient and kind to him because I know firsthand how much that can mess you up. About a month ago I stopped hearing from him completely, and he'd open my messages without replying and still staying constantly active on social media so I know he isn't dead or something. Yesterday I texted him and flat out said ""are we still friends?"" He responded by saying ""uh I don't know"" so I asked what he meant and said that if he didn't want to be, he should just tell me. He responded ""don't get all emotional but no, Im sick of u"". So ouch. I asked him why, he opened my message and never replied. Double ouch. My mom says I'm a good kid and a really good friend. I know she's biased, but I really don't think I've done anything to merit the way I've been treated my whole life. I'm starting to think that, since I'm the common denominator between all these cases, I'm the problem. I try so hard to be thoughtful and helpful and supportive, but get kicked in the teeth every time. Even my own boyfriend is mean to me. I cry myself to sleep most nights after he goes to bed over how lonely and isolated I feel. I've started to think that it won't get better. I see my family members and their friends all happy together and staying friends for years and it kills me. I feel doomed to be the odd man out for the rest of my life, and I'm so ashamed of my misery that I'm even afraid to ask for advice on reddit. I feel pathetic and unlovable. I don't want to be that sad girl in the office at 40 whose only friends are her parents. As pathetic as it sounds, my sister and I got little picture frames from our aunt for Christmas that say ""friends forever"" on them, and my sister has hers set up with a sweet picture of her and her friends in it, while mine is hidden in the back of my closet so I don't cry everytime I look at it sitting empty. Am I doing something wrong? Do mean people just smell vulnerability on me and seek me out to hurt me? I just want a friend and nothing I do seems to be enough for anyone that isn't related to me. Thank you for reading if you made it this far, I appreciate it immensely. Much love to all."
156,vulnerability,Advice,"Old trauma, new relationship",1,bbkznc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bbkznc/old_trauma_new_relationship/,2019-04-10 21:40:29,"Ive just started seeing someone I really like. Hes kind, attractive, all that good stuff! But I have a pretty major problem in that I dont know if Ill be able to sleep with him. It all goes back to when I was ten: I was raped by my pediatrician, and then groped by another doctor. Both doctors were dealt with, btw. It left me both horribly triggered (I am diagnosed with PTSD, so I mean that in a legit sense, not just oh, Im triggered) by both sex and doctors. Sex, Ive made headway with. It took about thirteen years of therapy, but I think Im okay with at least the concept of sex now. Doctors? It depends on the context. I know there are a couple things medically that I cant do yet. Like, have had panic attacks so severe I entered fugue states and apparently tried to punch someone. Umm, one of those things being a pap. Even the word is honestly super unsettling. Even despite thirteen years of therapy of various sorts, this is one of those things my psyche just wont budge on. Ive been abused by two doctors. One took away my innocence entirely. So, Im obviously not going to willingly put myself in a position of that much vulnerability on purpose. Like, I do want to explore sex at least, but I know Id be at risk of HPV if I did, and Im vaccinated against it, sure. But Im not able to do a pap and be safe like I should be, so I dont want to put myself at risk. If they had some sort of test I could do at home, Id do it. But I cant be that vulnerable around a medical professional after what happened. I know not every doctor is a sexual deviant, but doctors havent exactly been kind and understanding about the trauma associated with even being in an office at all. Ive often been treated like Im just a hysterical woman and my issues have been more or less brushed off. Eye rolls are common. Ive been thinking that if I could test alone or with someone I trusted (like a partner) at home, it wouldnt be a problem. Pain I can handle. Its just the issue of being exposed in front of a doctor, who yes, I find inherently untrustworthy and dismissive. You dont get sexually abused or assaulted twice before your eighteenth birthday by doctors, if theres nothing wrong with the medical establishment. (Not saying all doctors are bad, just that uhh, thats a problem). Ive even considered maybe Planned Parenthood, since its not a hospital and some of the women there are explicitly trained to screen survivors of rape. Maybe theyd help make it so it was something I could get through. Granted, Id still probably need to be heavily sedated to avoid going all Incredible Hulk and trying to punch someone in that state again. Its my absolute greatest source of worry. And because it is, I havent really allowed myself or been able to explore my sexuality freely. Id like to; I like the person Im seeing. But, like, HPV screening is this hanging specter all the time that makes me not want to bother with sex. The only thing I know myself to be willing to do is something at home. A stretch would be Planned Parenthood (less terrifying than a hospital, but still terrifying). Is there a way to do this at home? Or if I had to go into PP, how do I essentially knock myself out to actually go through with it? Nothing in the world terrifies me to the same level. I would rather be repeatedly stabbed in the face than do it, but I know if I have sex, Ill need to. So, how can I make myself oblivious to the fact its happening? Can they legit knock me out/put me under? It might require that, tbh. This is something Ive never talked about out of therapy, and its an extremely vulnerable area. So, I just ask that things stay respectful in the suggestions. I really am trying to take care of myself and my health, but youve got to understand theres some deeeeeeeep-seated trauma there. Just be respectful, thats all. Thank you in advance for any help here. I wouldnt be up at 4:40 to type this if it werent bugging the hell out of me."

We were best friends sophomore year, things were mostly great, junior year I finally realized I felt like shit around him sometimes because of the way he spoke to me (talked down sometimes/when he felt superior, dismissive of my feelings, just felt unacknowledged and disrespected overall) and slowly, slowly began to create the distance. At first I was sad, which also crept into this year, senior year. From second sem junior year to end of first sem this year, I confronted him maybe three separate times about this behavior. Nothing changed. I finally realized I didnt want to put up with someone I felt like shit with, and it didnt make sense to let him know because hed already clearly demonstrated in his actions that he didnt care to change anyway. This realization was mostly second semester senior year. I began to move away from him, when we talked, I was careful to keep things surface level because I was trying to move on. I guess things were normal to him. We have a period together-office assistant-where its just us two sitting at a desk, teacher at her desk, small room- yeah, the chances of just us two ending up in that class was crazy to me also. Some days I wouldnt feel like talking and we just wouldnt talk at all but he didnt question it. I didnt say anything this semester because not only did he not change, I realized maybe this wasnt something he Could change, at least right now, at this point in time. It isnt something hes Willing to change. So Ive left it alone, and actually, the past few weeks I had started to really feel good about my decision and Ive been a lot less down about it. I had really started to accept everything and I felt like I was moving on. Last week though, we were having a pretty good class period (as in nothing hurtful), and we were laughing about a joke (Im not rude, I try to treat him like I would a normal friend/acquaintance/whatever) when he gets this like really nervous look in his eyes. He kind of does a few pauses, leans in to whisper something in my ear, which btw I thought was a joke but after a longer pause I realized was not, he leans in and after a few seconds he whispers the question. At this point Im confused, shocked, he steps back and stands up, Im looking at him, hes kind of just anticipating but also with this vulnerability and nervousness and maybe fear (lol) but Im just looking at him because Im so shocked, it came out of left field for me, in my head all of this was long gone. There were so many questions going through my head at this point while we were just staring at each other, I started blurting things out about the girl I know he used to like, why didnt he ask her, he told me he wouldve asked her but she moved, I asked if I was second choice and he said yeah, I asked how long this had been in his head at this point his talking has gotten way faster, he talked about hos he needed his friend to hype him up a bunch because he was freaking out so much about it, how he was freaking out about it in class today, didnt know how to say it, the bell had already rung at this point but he was still there because of the question, I was confused and I know I keep saying this but shocked was the best word to describe how I was feeling, and because I was just staring at him, shocked, he starts saying out loud oh god oh god I just made things weird I knew I shouldnt have said this to you Im gonna see you tomorrow I have you in my classes I see you everyday Im gonna see you tomorrow oh god, and all I can do is look at him because Im literally speechless, and hes just looking at me waiting, and I realize he was waiting for an answer, and finally I just tell him we should call later can I think about it please and he leaves and were just exchanging this look of like wtf is happening. I consult two people, close friends, I tell them this, both conclude with say no. He texts me, I call, he picks up, his tone is way different, more sturdy and solid and no vulnerability or nervousness at all, I say hey, I dont think this would be a good idea, he says ok. Cool. Not cold, but just, accepting. Im confused. He talks about how, yeah, I was gonna ask other people, I had some other people in mind, Im like oh Ha Ha Okay, but maybe that part was to save face. Anyways, we havent discussed it again, just acted like nothing happened. And thats it. Im confused, help"

I even explained the relating trauma and why I am not interested to her, I dont know if her husband is talking to me without her knowing. I am also super open about my mental health and stuff and I feel like I'm at a very vulnerable point in my recovery. I believe that vulnerability is very obvious so it makes me really uncomfortable when people hit on me, it makes me feel like they are preying on me. He was definitely trying to flirt today. His wife and I share the same name and we are both short. He messaged me asking me how tall I was and that he was into short women, and later sent me a message talking about a nude bnb but ""oops that was meant for my wife!

This is by far the healthiest and most mutually beneficial relationship I've ever been in, yet there is a part of me that doubts the longevity of this relationship. I generally try to live by the rule that if I don't see myself being with someone for a long time, then I should probably just wait. Fast forward to the last week, I've just been so unsure. He lacks some things that I feel like I really value in a relationship, but at the same time I don't want to seem like a picky bitch if I doubt our relationship because of them. I am a decently emotional person, and I really value reciprocated vulnerability because it helps me feel more deeply connected. He just doesn't like that, it really makes him uncomfortable to be emotionally open. This I can't blame, but is it fair grounds to leave even if it's only been a few months? Is it too much to expect so early in a relationship? Finally, I think I'm in love with somebody else (Our mutually best friend). Not only this but I think he's in love with the same person. I did the big dumb and looked at his reddit, in which he admitted to loving another girl (I think it's that friend) just previous to our relationship. I know it's stupid of me to do that, but it doesn't remove it from my mind at this point. I've honestly loved her from the day I met her, but certain circumstances have led me to believe that she might not feel the same. But at some points I think she does? Should I tell her how I feel?

Everytime she told me it was ok, and she was perfectly fine with everything that happened. &amp;#x200B; My fear is, that because of her traumatic past of being abused/raped multiple times before, that she was maybe afraid to say no? These events were way in the past, but I can tell that they still have an impact on her today. &amp;#x200B; When she opened up to me she got very emotional, and very vulnerable, I didn't want to take advantage of that vulnerability then, it wouldn't feel right. Afterwards she was kind of telling me that she actually wanted to do stuff with me; I mentioned that she was very vulnerable, but she replied ""I'm always vulnerable"" &amp;#x200B; When she seemed reluctant during, I asked her if this was ok, and she asked me if I was sure I wanted to do this. Afterwards when asking her, she stated that she wanted to make sure I wanted to do it because she didn't want to get me sick (not STDs, she just was a little under the weather). &amp;#x200B; Did I do something wrong? Should I have said something different? Is there anything I can ask/tell her now?"
166,vulnerability,Advice,How can I start showing more emotions?,1,b9bp0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/b9bp0v/how_can_i_start_showing_more_emotions/,2019-04-04 22:49:37,"(I'm not good at writing, am not sure how to structure things and will write abit about my short past for explanation so please excuse for that and if you need further explanation please ask, thanks.) First abit info about me and my current state. I'm 19, stopped school abit ago and am currently looking for what I'll do with my life (whether I'll try school again, find an actual job (currently working part time)...). Oh and, not that I'd forget, I also have mental health problems that make me even more miserable than I am already (I've got depression quite surely and possibly some anxiety things and I also might have aspergers but idk). To my recent history (I feel like it's kind of important to know foe the actual question). I've always been pretty introverted and I only really express myself (not emotionally though) much when I'm really comfortable with the people I am with and all, otherwise I'm pretty much silent. I've also never had many or really good friends (I've luckily had some nice friends for sure, but no where near to the extend I see others have). And the only topics I ever talk about / discuss deeply are phylosophical, politic subjects but never ever myself how I am doing and all. Now after having had 2 really great years on a school with a nice class and all, when I finished that one with 16 and went onto a new one it really changed, I didn't know anyone there and didn't make friends. Thats also around the time I think my mental problems got abit bigger and so I started to isolate myself even more than I did already and eventually (after one and a half years actually) I stopped going to school. Whenever someone asks me why I did, I always say ""I just didn't have the motivation because I had no goal that I was going for"" etc. but thats not even close to the truth. I just couldn't go there anymore, I was embarrassed for always being alone there and being strange and isolated, I didn't have many things that I liked there either so wasn't paying much attention to what was going on. Me not going to school anymore was a few weeks after my parents split up actually and they also knew that I didn't have an easy time there so while they would've liked me to continue school they we're like ""its ok make a break"". And now I've had quite a bit break and am working part time but am still miserable and have no clue whether I'll eventually find a great job and have no problems anymore or I'll just end it all. For the latter I know I won't be able to do it. And for the former I feel like I need to do more and also need more help to fight my mental problems and become a normal human being. I should also mention that I'm visiting a psychologist for a while now (same time when I stopped the school) but while I do learn some things I never speak about emotional things so theres huge problems that are unsolved. So finally regarding the question. How can I start showing more emotions? Because what I've shown until now (watch out sarcasm) a colourful palette of 2, anger and some happiness. Other than those 2 I'm just a rock that doesn't talk much. It's just so incredibly difficult for me, I've never really shown much and over some years only isolated myself more. The most emotional thing I've done in a long while is express that I really like ""La La Land"" (which, and I find it horrible to admit that thats a reason, is also partly because 'men don't watch musicals..'). I appear to the outside very different than I actually am (and/or want to be), and I hate it (or as I would say if I wasn't afraid to use words showing vulnerability ""it breaks my heart""). I want to be kind and nice and smile, I hate anger and bad things etc. I think I'll stop it here, I hope this all makes sense and thanks alot for reading through even if you don't have advice. Hope you all have a lovely day! with best wishes, Fowl "
167,vulnerability,Advice,"So this guy that's been blowing me off suddenly has a change of heart, should I decide to give him yet another chance?",1,b9ztmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/b9ztmu/so_this_guy_thats_been_blowing_me_off_suddenly/,2019-04-06 13:31:26,"Tldr: guy that's been a FWB is flakey, so I lost interest. New guy who works with him comes along, but then guy resurfaces, saying he's been so wrong and really likes me. New guy magically disappears. Is fwb just marking his (lost) territory, or is he being honest? Does he deserve a chance, and if not, how do I find new guy? Some context: So I got out of a pretty long relationship, that was punctuated by my having feelings for a fellow redditor at the end of the relationship. I call this my prebound. I believe you can't be in love with 2 people at the same time. So I think it's safe to say my feelings for my long term relationship were pretty dead at the time I had feelings for the prebound. Obviously, I was painfully unaware of the problem, or I would have left the relationship before prebound had occured. However, I *really wanted* to have feelings for my man, so I tried to work things out, but in the end, he left me, understandably. Ok, so that hurt every bit as much as if I had been madly in love with him, because I wanted, very badly, to rekindle the feelings, and blew up things with prebound for it because that's what you do. I chose him, he waited for me to chose him, then said ""naaahhh, haha!"" So if your here to judge me on this background, please, remember, it's just the background, not a portrait of my character, and it's also a mere summary of the story. Point is, I was pretty wrecked over it all, bruised ego and all. BUT I feel that I was almost already rebounded out, as far as love goes. I was in a hell of a pickle financially, mentally, spiritually, emotionally, physically, you name it! Not much time passes, and I am putting one foot in front of the other as far as getting my life back- an effort that is being sabotaged, mercilessly, by the now ex. I'm in no shape to be dating, but I needed *something* to pull me out of my funk. So of course, -enter the opportunist- I meet a guy who starts coming into my store, give him my number, we hang out a few times, long enough to leave no mystery of my level of trauma. So I figure, eh, what the hell, may as well sleep with the guy, I'm unable to hold a decent conversation, and I gather that only leaves one reason why he's still hanging around. I do, it magically makes my attachment bonds to my ex melt away quite a bit. Seriously glad I did because I didn't think it would do all that! So guy is a Marine recruiter. Which is hot, I know, but also pretty cool because he's busy as hell. So am I. Also, again, I'm not really about dating yet, remember. This was back in November. We continue to sleep together here and there, but as time goes on, I begin to think the job can't be the only reason he's as flakey as he is, so I write him off, after he does a does a bit of a disappearing act. So then I get the inevitable text asking what I've been doing lately. I responded by saying that I wasn't really interested in this kind of booty call relationship, especially since it seemed pretty one sided. It was never me who could call him up for sex, only him who could call me. Anyway, he's pretty receptive to my grievances, so I give him another shot after he really tries for it for about a week. Then I promise you I don't hear from him for a whole 5 weeks. Suddenly, the text. I tell him I'm getting a different job, I'm celibate anyway, it was nice, but go away. He says ok. 2 more weeks go by. Now he's doing walk bys of the store front, that I still work at currently (we are now at last Monday). The very next day, one of his ""associates"" was in... He was cute. Very cute. And nice. And funny, we'll call him bad-timing-guy. Next day he was again... But so was the opportunist- a few times- who by this time I've taken to smiling politely at, buy largely ignoring. At one point, they even greeted one another as they passed each other, as of yet unaware of their shared objective, I believe. Anyway, so the next day, no bad-timing-guy to speak of. But the opportunist comes in, tells me I'm all he's been thinking about for the past 5 weeks, he's been wrong to be so flakey, he likes me but he doesn't know how to date with his job being so demanding, he sees me as more than just a hookup, and he doesn't blame me if I won't give him another chance, but he'd like it if I did, then asks if he can take me to lunch the next day (today). This conversation transpires in the recruiters offices where he was alone... But he kept looking at his watch, I had joked about him being worried he'd be caught in there with me, but he said no, he wouldn't be. But of course another one of his associates came back, so we were, which he ""played off"" by acting like I was asking for my brother about the Marines. The associate is one who I've seen around, and knows who I am and where I work... Today comes, and he gets called out for work, and doesn't make it back in time for lunch. Also I don't see bad-timing-guy again for the second day in a row. I ended up texting him later saying that I had been surprised to get relieved of my responsibilities for the evening, to which he replied ""awesome."" But I've not heard from him since. Though he technically hasn't done anything wrong, I have some trust issues, and it seems like maybe this is a pissing game? Like he saw bad-timing-guy holding something from my store on his way over to lurk around it... I've always gotten the idea that he liked me, but then I've also thought that he, perhaps, just likes chasing me. Because it always seems like, as soon as I open up, he goes quasi indifferent. When I'm indifferent, he pushes a little more each time. I usually just walk away from this situation entirely, but I feel bad now, because what if all those things were really true? If he finally showed some vulnerability, and I just was a fucker. I mean, if I didn't like him, I wouldn't have kept sleeping with him. I'm not built that way. But on the same token, I've got no problem walking at this point either, if it's all bs. I refuse to sleep with anyone at this particular stage of the game. But even so, what should I do? I really liked bad-timing-guy, he seemed way more secure, and I had a neat little vibe with him. I may never actually see him again though, if the opportunist scared him off. And does the opportunist even deserve the time of day?"

Even at these events people found me to be really attractive but I just froze. If they knew my secret, how in almost 30 years I am still a virgin, I would have most likely been shunned from the community. How big of a red flag is it to be a virgin at my age due to my insecurities? I am also not religious, I live with my parents, and I have no job. I am just so insecure about someone finding value in me for me. It doesn't make sense. However, I still would like to face my vulnerability and seek out a romantic relationship.

169,vulnerability,Advice,My (26F) ex (26M) fled the country 2 years ago. childhood trauma. Do I deserve love?,0,auge6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/auge6m/my_26f_ex_26m_fled_the_country_2_years_ago/,2019-02-25 14:31:36,"PSA: this is long but please stick with me. A little background: Im 26 years old. Im the only child to a single mother who died from cancer when I was 11. After her death I was forced to live with my father (whom I didnt know well). He spent my entire childhood ignoring me and became a workaholic to bury his grief. He paid the bills, and put groceries in the fridge but other than that he wasnt present. I was alone 90% of the time. When he was occasionally there that time was spent either yelling, or throwing physical objects around the house for minor offences committed by all teenagers (not doing dishes, leaving laundry in the dryer etc.). After he would lash out, he wouldnt speak to me for weeks. This emotional abuse has certainly left some scares, along with the massive trauma of loosing my mother and sole caregiver at a young age. Fast forward to my 20s: I fall in love for the first time. Its my third serious relationship, but my first really loving relationship. The first person I can picture spending my life with. I never thought I wanted children for fear I would somehow relive my mothers life. I would be a single parent and die to leave a child behind. This was the first partner I had where I felt if I died at some point I would trust this person to raise and take care of our children the best way. This person changed a fundamental belief I had. This relationship ended abruptly. This person was staying in my country on a working visa and applying for a PR when they suffered a sudden and severe mental breakdown. Without communication or warning they fled like a thief in the night. Literally, here in a relationship one day and gone the next. I was only made aware of their leaving the country the next day by their dad who wrote me a facebook message essentially ending our relationship on behalf of his son. I didnt hear from my ex for 3 weeks, then he reappeared through social media to harass and be verbally abusive towards me. He spent a lot of time blaming me for his mental breakdown, and for ruining his life. He had the expectation I should have known something was wrong (which I did not) and that it was my fault for not supporting or saving. He often said, as he was the first person I really shared parts about my mother with that I was so fucked up from her death no one would ever love me. At the time I felt such guilt and heartache over being abandoned I couldnt understand how it could be anyones fault but mine, even more so when he was directly blaming me for his mental health and having to leave as he did. It was my fault, not his. Fast track to now: Ive been single for two years now. Ive been in therapy working through both my childhood trauma and my last relationship for nine months. Im not unattractive. I work hard on my appearance. Im successful in my career and entirely independent. I felt like I made progress, and finally learned that the situation with my ex was not my fault or my responsibility. That being said Ive had a really hard time dating. I tried dating immediately after he left, mainly in a self-destructive way trying to fill a hole but that only did more damage. I landed myself in some bad situations with some bad people. So, I decided to take a year off from dating entirely to build myself back up. I thought I had successfully done this. I felt good, had taken a vacation by myself, spent a year focusing on my career and spending time with my friends. I was feeling very fulfilled in my life and happy with myself - but I was lonely. I decided to try dating again recently. I met someone amazing. They checked every single box I was looking for in a partner. Empathic, kind, intelligent, passionate. The list is really long so I will spare you. This person was direct and clear with me about their feelings being mutual and matching mine. We were smitten with one another, but taking things slow. After seeing each other for two months I asked if they saw potential for a relationship in the future. They kind of blew off the question in an attempt to postpone the conversation - and I panicked. I gave them a big shove out of my life because I was afraid of a) letting someone in (though I already started to do that b) be rejected or abandoned by another person. What followed was a very bad cycle of learned behaviours from my trauma. I kept pushing this person away, would regret it, try to reel them back in (which they had no interest in anymore), panic again, and push them back out. My main learned behaviour that comes from a fear of abandonment is to push people away. It feels safer to do that than to suffer the pain of being left. It establishes control over a situation I dont have control in, and protects me. Its a learned survival technique. I recognize when I do this, and do have the ability to stop myself before doing so (though not always - Im still learning to catch the signs in myself before acting). This behaviour is as painful for me as it is to the other person. I feel awful for treating people this way, as it often happens to the people whom deserve it the least. Second would be taking responsibility for all parts of every situation (even parts I am not responsible for), low self worth and self inflicted guilt for these learned behaviours to further fuel my low self worth. Throughout this process I was very honest about what I was doing, and why I was doing it. I explained about my mother and past relationship. I explained the panic, the push, the fear, the regret. Therapy has taught me a lot about myself. I am very self aware, but not always constructive yet. Im still learning that part - but was honest and open with this person throughout this cycling. All this honesty was met with a lot of judgement. When I asked why they werent interested in a relationship after being so interested in me they said it was the initial push that changed everything. I have apologized many times, and explained everything in detail but it didnt make a difference to their opinion about me based on the initial push. This went on for a few weeks before I asked them to block me out of their life to end the cycle. I explained I thought this was best for us both, but I couldnt handle the responsibility of that decision (given how many times I swore them off, and then came back to discuss the topic again and again). He did lock me, and we dont have contact now. Overall, this recent. situation has brought be back to square one, and has erased any good feeling I made about my worth and process in therapy. I feel it has confirmed my fears, and the haunting voice of my ex boyfriend saying my past has fucked me up so badly that no one will love me. Even more so when I feel this most recent person really liked so many things about me, but didnt like this one part I am working so hard to change. I guess I want to know: does all this trauma, circumstances outside of my control - deem me undeserving of love? Will I always be judged by my learned behaviours? Does honesty, vulnerability and taking responsibility mean anything against this behaviour? How do I trust to share these parts of my life with someone again seeing how it has backfired, and caused judgement many times? Will someone love me, and have appreciation for the good things about me over the bad, knowing Im working really hard to change the bad into something better? "

Management wasnt great, and staffing was dangerously low (hospital setting). I had worked 76 hours already that week and got roped into staying for 3rd shift (7p-7a), despite only agreeing to stay for an extra 2 hours to help. I was afraid that walking out would end up with me losing my job so i put on my best face and tried to be a good sport. Ended up falling asleep around 645am and the 1st shift supervisor immediately terminated me. 2 weeks later my car had an electrical fire, Insurance deemed it undrivable. I used the 1200 check they cut me to pay bills. Im now driving a 1994 hooptie. By the grace of god or whatever goodness is in the world, it was gifted to me by a close friend. Then i found out i was pregnant. I continued to persist, landing a similar job in a general hospital, however the staff there was incredibly rude and hostile. My first day on the floor, not knowing anyones name, a coworker confronted me about "" going around telling people they had assalted a patient!?"". I was in shock, not only would i never share information like that as casual conversation, i especially would never make something like that up. Things of that nature persisted to get worse, and ended up with me quiting about 4 months later because the staffs attitude towards each other, the patients, and the direct harassment towards me became umbarable. One woman continually offered to ""buy my baby"" while a few others insisted that i wouldnt be able to care for it. No one took the time to get to know me. So i spent 4 months getting confronted with things like that by ultimately strangers. Whenevwr i tried to initiate conversation, and take the time to get to know them, i was ignored or given a one liner and then they walked away. The one time i tried to stand up for myself i was met with peirced lips and a quick, ""i dont have to listen to this"". ( i said to them: ""listen i really dont appreciate having these things said to and about me. Im just saying, i havent worked with half of you so i dont understand where that half has the right to make these claims in the first place."") I worked like hell to get out of food service, 10 years experience including management, to land a career in an area that meant more to me than a title or a pay check &amp; actually had opportunities to grow... having both those opportunities fall through in the same year, losing the car i paid off in my name, has left me feeling considerably inadequate. I dont even have the confidence or forsee myself doing well in food service. Not even as a cashier. I feel hopeless, i cant stand living in my own skin. I was always a bit awkward and quirky, but the risidual anxiety and low self esteem from this blow has made it difficult to even go to the grocery store. I am weaving together all my failures with all of my flaws and drowning in shame and inadequacy. I have fought and failed and faught and failed, time and time again. I do live with some mental health issues, and it has taken me a long time to get to where i am now, where most people end up on disability. I know there is no shame in that, because i know the struggle of this illness, but as inadquate and humiliated as i feel on a daily basis, i do believe i have a level of self awareness that deep down can help me be a functioning member of society. Most of the perpetual humiliation i feel from simply showing up some where, and then the magnitude of it when i try to interact with others, i struggle to balance between me inherently being defect or over sensitive, with them simply being assholes. I try not to play the victim. I think blaming everyone else for why things happen the way they do for me, is petty. I know i should have walked out of that first job instead of ""being a good sport"" (and setting myself up for failure), and i know i chose on some level to let the people at the 2nd job effect me, and i know if i took better care of my car that it would still be running and functioning in my posession. I cant blame anyone else for these things but myself, and even when i take that stance i cant help but to feel like im still playing the victim in some way. I dont want to go out into the world until i can resolve this but i need to have a job. But the veil of inadequecy leaves me aloof as to what job i should get? I dont know how to explain myself, or let people get to know me or be understood or viewed as worth having a little patients towards. I dont know how to take responsibility without completely roasting myself, i dont know how to find the balance of circumstances and personal sabotage without feeling this uterrly powerless victimy dissapointment. I dont know how to keep handeling that disapointment, it chips away at me a little more each time. Im running out of fight. Im tired. I dont know that i can fairly fight back without playing the victim or being irresponsible socially by not taking inventory of my own involvment. Everywhere i go i have this overwhelming feeling that people take 1 look and think ""she doesnt belong here."" I never had this problem, not in elementary, middle, or highschool. I never let the weight of others opinions effect me and if it did effect ne i used it as fuel to prove them wrong. Over the past 7 years its only gotten worse. I have but 2 friends that ive held onto for the last 5 years. I am so paranoid of things going wrong that i dont do anything anymore. I used to just laugh it off, point a finger, barrell through whenever i messed up pr something didnt work out. Never letting anything weigh on me for more than a day and it seems now im being hit with this back pay of low self esteem. I feel so defeated. And this post is just covering the most recent year of my existence. The 10 years leading up to this have been a cycle filled with death and truama and moving back in with my parents and moving in with roomates and fucking up the roomate situation or being to depressed to work and landing at my parents. I do good for 7 months and i take 1.5 years backwards. At this point i dont care about getting ahead, i just wish i could get past myself enough to stay consistent. But i dont even feel adequate to return to my back up plan, which is food service. And i cant go to my back up-back up plan of temp agency warehouse, because im pregnant. I cant blog, im mortified anytime i post anything. I cant sell things, i have 0 capacity for sounding perky, and i have 0 ability to bullshit people and i think selling anything to anyone is bullshit. I can go on listing all the things i cant do, and why i cant do them. And when i stop to think of things i can do? I cant think of anything. Not a damn thing. I need advice, reassurance, resources? I am on meds, i do go to counceling. I have dine this for years. The cbt has lost its effect. I continue on just to prove i havent given up. I do try to stick to what is fundamentally useful/effective in these situations. I hate being that person who wines and wines and when someone continually offfers suggestions is just continually shut down. Ive had friends like that. They dont try. They are stuck. I dont want to be stuck. I am willing to try. But eating healthy, exercising, yoga, nature, meditation, being around people i love and that love me, and reaching out to them, yadda yadaaa- Its beating a dead horse. Im still there for all those things, Im still fucking those things up. Im still hating myself for it. I watch brene browns vulnerability and shame videos, and they used to set me on fire with inspiration and hope and faith and now, much like porn, really has no effect on me. Like at all. I cant enjoy anything. So i couldnt tell you what i enjoy doing. Im not good at anything, because of all this bullshit, so i cant look towards what im good at. I never thought someone could feel like this gargantuin of a dissapointment and failure and this inadequate. Someone please, offer me something i can hang onto, plant some kind of seed and pray with me that it grows. This is not the type of mother i want for my child. I need to figure this out in the next 4 months. "

I guess like a lot of people in their 20s, Ive reached that weird phase in my life where I dont know who I am or what I want. Out of the million thoughts that race through my mind as I attempt to analyze them, theres always that one that comes up that I cant make sense of; Relationships, Romance, and Love. I was sheltered when I was young teenager. I never had a talk about sex with my parents. I learned about it through curiously searching the internet. I never received any dating advice either. So Ive never been good at flirting or expressing my romantic interest in someone (at least in a way where I actually appear attractive, ha). Still, I somehow managed to have 3 serious relationships in my life, as well as a few flings off to the side. I feel pathetic saying that none of those relationships lasted any more than 8 months, but I digress. A part of me wants to believe in true love. The kind where you get married and grow old together, never getting tired of each other. However, a much BIGGER part of me refuses to believe that is possible. Through observation and experience, my perspective on love and relationships has warped drastically since I was a kid. I grew up with parents that were at each other throats over every little thing. They both claim that the other had changed ever since they married and had kids. It took me over a decade to finally convince myself that its not my fault that they dont love each other anymore. I have been surrounded by friends and peers who have cheated or have been cheated on. Even my older sister, who I used to look up to, has cheated on a previous boyfriend of hers (shes now married to somebody else). Hell, I ended up cheating in my relationship over a year ago, when I thought that I wasnt capable of doing so. Dont worry. I got what was coming for me, and were no longer together. Ive witnessed seemingly happy relationships end for no apparent reason. Just the other day here where I work, a workers wife had just started to push for a divorce, after 19 long years of marriage. There was no sign of it, besides another worker noticing that she had seemed detached at some point. I witness people choosing to stay in relationships (including my own) when they dont even love the person theyre with, for months or even years at a time. Because they feel trapped, or are scared of being single? I honestly dont know. I see women flock towards men who are in committed relationships, and then I see them ignore the same man once he is single. This behavior can be observed in many places in the animal kingdom. It makes sense on a biological level. A male that attracts a female is worthy of mating, and thus attracts more females. A male that doesnt have a female must not be worth mating, and so he is left alone. So all of these things occur, and despite it, somebody says To live a fulfilling life and truly be happy, one must find their soulmate, get married, raise a family, and be together UNTIL DEATH DO US PART. Its a romantic ideal, to find love that could last a life time. Sounds amazing in fact. Who the hell wouldnt want that? Im already excited. I cant wait to find that perfect person for me. I wont even question WHO came up with the idea. Society, Disney movies, the Bible, a guy that really likes to watch penguins? Who cares!? Everybody else wants it, so I want it too. Dont want to be that one weirdo that cant find a soulmate, because that would mean there must be something wrong with me... Let me get things back on track before I get too carried away. My point is, long lasting relationships, and arguably monogamy, both seem unrealistic . Dont get me wrong. I believe in love, and passion, and intimacy, and I enjoy them just as much as anybody else. But being with the same person day in and day out, of course things are going to become stagnant. The passion fades, and suddenly a relationship that used to be fun becomes work. Hard work. One partner ends up changing in some way (or the problem could be that they *dont* change), and the other partner has trouble accepting this. One partner becomes the chaser, the other becomes the runner. The runner is becoming overwhelmed, second guessing what he/she wants. The chaser is desperately trying to keep things together, which seems to only be pushing their partner away even more. Ive experienced being both the runner and the chaser, not just in my relationships, but also in the romantic interests that never bloomed. Theres always one that becomes more invested than the other. I hate that I view relationships the way that I do. But I cant help it. My observations speak much louder than the fairytale in my head. I now see every relationship as a time bomb. Yes, theyre fun while they last, but they will all end, messily, with hurt feelings and the occasional Whats wrong with me? What did I do wrong? Why am I not good enough?. I dont think theres anything wrong with anybody! Yes, different personalities will get along better or worse than others. But EVERYBODY DESERVES TO BE LOVED. Instead of questioning our own value, maybe we should be asking: Are we forcing ourselves into doing something that is unnatural, and thus doomed to fail? In college, I shared a room with one of my closest friends from high school. Sweet setup right? Sure, hes a bit more energetic than me, but we have similar hobbies and get along great! What could possibly go wrong? Fast forward a couple of semesters later, and were having the awkward discussion of wanting to room with different people. Years later, to this day, he is still one of my best friends. I would also never dream of living with him ever again. So what makes romantic relationships any different? Well, the romantic part I guess. More intimacy, more vulnerability, and a lot more sensitivity when things dont work out. And Ive course love - you know, that one word with 1000 different meanings depending on who you ask. Is it a feeling or a concept? The answer: Yes. I love all of my exes. I still think about them occasionally. I care about their well being and hope theyre doing well. 2 of them, I would never want to date again. And 1 of them I can no longer stand being around. I may no longer be *in love* with them, but I still love them. I realized that my parents ended up the same way. They love each other, care for each other, but they *fell out of love* a long time ago. I wish it didnt have to be this way. I wish they could still be together and get along. But they cant, and I dont blame them. So to wrap this all up, my big question is, how do all you people do it? How can you dive into a relationship knowing whats to come? I think almost everyone would agree that the perfect partner doesnt exist. But if youre consciously choosing to settle for less than perfect, then isnt that the same thing as admitting that you *know* its not going to last? Im starting to no longer see the point in dating, and I cannot ever EVER imagine myself getting married. But at the same time, I know I want intimacy and love in my life. Everything seems to contradict. I want intimacy, but I dont want to date. I want love, but I dont want commitment. Is there a compromise that exists, or am I doomed to be alone because of this mentality?"
173,vulnerability,Advice,How to make it work with an avoidant partner?,1,axjeig,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/axjeig/how_to_make_it_work_with_an_avoidant_partner/,2019-03-05 20:47:07,"Hi, &amp;#x200B; I've recently been studying the fascinating attachment theory in relationships. I found out that my relationship is one between an anxious lover (needy, clingy, lashes out, low-self esteem, not trusting, smothersome etc.) and an avoidant lover (shuts down emotions, cold, preoccupied, afraid of intimacy and vulnerability, doesn't speak up, wants independence etc.). I am the anxious boyfriend and my girlfriend is avoidant. We are two individuals who love each other dearly, but sometimes, our quirks get the best of us. She either keeps being distant and cold or I get smothersome or even angry at times. This almost had us breaking up a couple of times, but we sorted things out. I know I cause her pain when I verbally attack her and pull back from her, but I want to get over this. It hasn't happened much lately and we've been doing really well, but I do get these impulses from time to time. I am inspired to always try and be the best version of myself, and I want a life with her someday. So, people who are avoidant or have avoidant partners, how does one keep their avoidant partner happy and in love with them without hurting them, scaring them with too much closeness or smothering them?"

I don't know how.I cover up my vulnerability because I'm so ashamed of myself sometimes, like I don't want people to pity me, I don't want to show them my darkest moments.. I don't want them to know.. Im struggling in the dark.. I don't know why.. I just don't want to be viewed as.. Weak.. Pitiful.. Sad of a human being.. Lonely.. I know.. As a friend if I found out them feeling this way, I wouldn't view them like that at all so I don't know why I'm not trying to be rational for my own sake. I do know that being vulnerable is not bad at all.. I don't know how to ask for help. I dont even vent to people because I don't want to be annoying them, and other reasons I stated above. Its nuts. I hide things about myself such as my family are not in a good relationship.. But I don't tell them anything.. I always act everything is just fine. Its fine but.. Also not. Though im in another city now, Im try to be more vulnerable to my new friends bit by bit but If u ask me to do the same with my old friends I don't know how. I don't. It makes me think, if I get in a relationship one day. Can I be vulnerable? I'm so vulnerable I don't know if my future SO can handle it. I'm a mess really.I get anxiety so often, overthinking, stressed, depressed to the point I don't take care of myself.. Im working towards it though.. I cry just thinking about this. How do I not care about not being viewed as weak and etc.. Fuck. I don't even know how to jumble all my feelings and thoughts in this paragraph. "

In 7th grade I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and moderate Depression. I feel so fake. I mean, when I laugh, I'm truly laughing and feel happy in that moment, but almost all the other times, there's always a sense of...dissociation, I guess? Like there's cracks in the wall where my true self can seep through, but I still keep up a persona. This person I've created and shown to the world is tough and cynical and doesn't like people. She doesn't like hugs or romantic movies and books and hates dresses. That's just not true. I'm not very tough at all. I'm really sensitive, and am easily hurt by people even when they don't mean any harm. I'll feel horrible if I hurt someone because that's the last thing I want to do, normally. Even through my skewed vision of myself I can see that I'm very caring person. I love hugs. Especially my mom's. I'm actually a romantic at heart, but no one would ever believe me if I told them. Part of me likes watching and reading romances, but at the same time that and people around me being in relationships makes me sad. I love the idea of true love and soulmates and stuff, but I'm terrified of rejection and vulnerability. Here's an example: I'm 18, about to turn 19, and I had my first ""real"" date a few months ago. For some dumb reason, I thought I was ready for a relationship. We met on Tinder and we go to the same college, and he was perfectly fine. But, he kissed me at the end of the date. Nothing crazy, it only lasted about 3 seconds. But once it was over I remember scrambling out of his hug and into my residence hall, impatiently waiting for the elevator to take me to my room. I was high on adrenaline, and texted my mom and a friend that I had just kissed a guy, and then it started to sink in. *I just kissed a guy. Oh my god, I just kissed a guy.* Granted, he kissed me, but I could've pulled away. I should've pulled away. I broke down. Thank god my roommate wasn't there. I was frantically texting my mom while crying. This going to sound stupid as hell, but I felt...dirty, in a way. I'm not exactly sure why. There's was nothing really dirty about it, but even thinking back gives me the same feeling. I was freaking out. I'm surprised I didn't have a panic attack. I had become vulnerable in front of someone. It makes it worse because I barely knew him, and also, I think part of me wanted time to build up the wall for him that I had already shown to everyone else. Needless to say, we didn't have a 2nd date. I'm so terrified to destroy that wall. That effing wall that I despise but also don't tear down. I'm petrified to get into a relationship and one day my boyfriend wakes up and realizes that the girl he's dating is fake and ugly. I'm scared to be vulnerable in front of others because I think they'll use it against me. I don't want to continue to be fake, but at this point, if I start being true to myself, everyone around me is going to question me. I'm just scared."

I was brainwashed and he tried to have me committed t so he could keep my family away from me because we lived on a military base. I know these events have taken a mental toll on me. In order to combat some of my new social anxiety after being isolated for so long I figured an app like IMVU would be a good way to talk to people again and try to feel normal. You know, to just get away from everyone who knew what happened. So flash to a little more than a week or so ago I meet this guy on there who I am immediately dazzeled by. I've Literally never felt anyone just click with me not even my ex husband. I asked on here before if I should tell him about my weight (which her doesn't seem to believe me for some reason?). Anyway, we're still getting along great. I don't think he's interested in a relationship because he lives 5 hours away but we had phone sex anyway. Ok so here's the problem part. He was planning on visiting at some point and we were planning an adventure of sorts for a completely wholesome YouTube video. So I thought it should be ok to tell my family about this guy just saying I made a friend that I really like but I think we're going to stay friends. Well, my mom was concerned and doesn't think we should meet until the divorce is final. My sister, however, lost her shit on me and said I shouldn't even talk to anyone for a year because I'll be dazzeled by anyone who is vaguely nice to me. Which I don't believe to be true, and I'm fairly certain my ex wad seeing someone when we were still ""happily"" married (and he's now trying to expedite the divorce because of it). So now I'm second guessing myself and my feelings. I'm scared. Should I back away from this guy? Am I making a self destructive choice to try and get closer to him? Could he be taking advantage of my emotional vulnerability without my knowing (he only just found out abbot the divorce yesterday but was very chill and understanding)? Am I just being stupid?"

However, I'm really not comfortable with the concept and I'm very suspicious, like does counseling/Therapy actaully helps ? and more importantly why would I trust a counselor-whose interest is to have me as customer- to actually help me with my issues thus not being their customer anymore ?(instead of just leading me on in circles that don't really lead to anything other than temporary comfort but no real progress) or perhaps taking advatage of my vulnerability somehow ? or maybe steering me to a direction that's not benificial to me accidentally or on purpose ? how would I verify a counselor's credibility and competence for example ?

We have addressed some of her behaviors in the past but maybe not forcefully enough. Today I wrote a letter that is pretty strong, short, to the point but also says I'm writing it because I know she does not mean to hurt us and she is only trying to help but it's not what we want. And that our relationship is important to me so I dont want to damage it by staying silent. I have a really hard time saying how I feel and what I think due to childhood emotional/verbal abuse. So i think writing it was a good idea to cut to the chase but I'm feeling incredibly vulnerable in writing the letter specially not knowing how the she is going to react. Really she could go on the defensive or she could understand. Should I send the letter and if so how do I cope with these feelings of vulnerability? "
179,vulnerability,Advice,"Trust issues, identity issues, I [22F] think Im driving myself crazy..",1,ai4kt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ai4kt9/trust_issues_identity_issues_i_22f_think_im/,2019-01-21 11:52:36,"To keep things short, Ive been dealing with severe trust issues for as long as I can remember and I dont know why. I come from a happy and reasonably stable/supportive family, but since age 10 (if not younger, idk, I dont remember a lot from my childhood) I havent trusted by parents. At that age I was bullied by my best friend for two years (10-12) but I have zero concrete memories of anything majorly upsetting happening and in general struggle to remember most of that time period. Around age 12 I started experiencing dissociative episodes where I felt disconnected from my body/identity. As the years have gone these episodes have seemed to happen less frequently, but I dissociate entirely from my identity every few years. For example: I struggle immensely to connect with/remember my perspective from any events in my life that were more than a year ago. I often cant understand how I used to behave or what my personality was like more than a year ago, even though I try to remain present in the moment and I have been told for years that I have very good insight into my mindset/motivations. I feel like Im a different person every couple of years, even though I can point out many consistent personality traits/behaviors that have been present since age 10. Lately Ive been feeling even more unsteady and ungrounded in my identity. I dont trust anyone, even though I have deep relationships with people in my lives. I feel like theres a physical barrier keeping me from ever being actually vulnerable with the people I love. Ill tell them about intimate/personal details of my life, but only in ways that require no trust in them. Like, I wont reach out when Im feeling extremely depressed, but a few days/weeks/months later Ill fill them in on what I was feeling and the way I was thinking in that moment. Even when I try to tell people what Im really feeling or thinking, I twist it at the last second without even trying to so that Im not truly vulnerable. I have been trying to overcome this with my current best friend, and this is definitely the most trusting relationship Ive ever had. But anytime I reveal even the tiniest detail of a vulnerabilty to her, I experience extreme emotional backlash. I isolate myself, become consumed with self-loathing, and obsess over/overanalyse her every interaction with me for weeks. I have only ever managed to share these minute scraps of vulnerability when intoxicated, and I cannot imagine ever doing so sober. I also never actually express my emotions with her (ex. shes never seen me cry, the few times weve fought Ive avoided any in person confrontration and used text instead, shes never seen me anxious/depressed). Any time I share something with her I feel dissociated and identity-less for days afterwards. Shes the only person Ive managed to get this far with. Despite having a loving relationship with both my parents, and them being very supportive of both my siblings (who go to them for advice), I cant share anything with them. Despite both my siblings actively reaching out to me with specific questions about my emotional stare, I lie to them when Im struggling. Despite my other friends sharing all their problems with me and trusting me to help them, I never reciprocate. I have never dated, because I have no trust in potential partners. Never had sex, because I dont trust anyone who is interested in me. I struggle to make new friends, because I have no idea how to form a mutual connection with people. I have major control issues regarding my eating habits and self-harm, because I dont even trust my own body. Im just at a loss for what to do or why Im like this. Its so hard to believe that two years of forgotten childhood bullying could rattle me this bad, and it doesnt explain why during that time I never trusted my family enough to tell them what was going on. I constantly yo-yo between obsessing over my childhood, and trying not to think about it at all, because I dont trust my own mind not to give myself false memories. I dont even trust that I didnt purposely make myself mentally ill as a kid for attention, even though I dont remember trying to do that. Im driving myself crazier and crazier. I want to see a psychologist (Ive been in psychotherapy before for depression and it was very helpful), but I cant afford one unless I went like once a month, which would be basically useless seeing as it takes me 6-12 sessions just to begin trusting them enough to start talking about these issues, let alone actually be fully open about them. I cant use a cheaper option like a therapist or counsellor, because Ive tried that before and they ultimately couldnt provide much help regarding my dissociation and potential trauma issues as it was beyond the scope of their expertise. I just feel so stuck. I dont want to be like this anymore. Im so tired of being alone, but trusting doesnt just feel like something I dont want to do, it feels like something I fundamentally dont understand HOW to do. Any advice? **TL;DR: Cant afford the therapy I need, cant get help using the therapy I can afford, cant trust people but cant keep living without trusting people. Please give me advice. Im so lost.**"

Last week my half brothers wife died while delivering their child. The whole family went out of state to visit him and support him. While I was there for the past 3 days my brother was behaving more or less normally: joking, playing games, watching football, etc. The only times he really showed any vulnerability was when talking about the future when everyone has gone home and when we were at the service for his wife. I noticed that he was perfectly normal with his kids from a previous marriage but not once did he interact with his newborn son, he didnt change him, feed him, or even hold him; the baby was always being cared for by someone else (usually my brothers mother). The only exception was when he drove to his now deceased wifes daughters to drop off the baby for the night. Does my brother resent his baby or possibly even blame him for his wifes death? Should I ask him? Is it just part of the grieving process since he has all his normal responsibilities plus new ones now?"

I'm in therapy but I need some outside, objective input. So it's a long story and a half, practically a bio, and I apologise. Excuse me while I pour my guts out. I was diagnosed with Aspergers as a teen, if that helps. And I'm female, 25yo. &amp;#x200B; At 18, I had been in a very codependent relationship for around 2 years. The guy was 20ish, and had a pretty terrible reputation for drugs, dealing, lies, theft and cheating. He smoked weed all day every day and would occasionally go on drug benders lasting up to a week or so- on which he was hard to contact. The whole relationship I had felt responsible for keeping him safe and regulating his mood. His mood swings affected everyone, but himself the most. I never felt consciously intimidated by them, but I would shut down. I'd lived at his parents' house with him for around a year. A lot of nights, he would pressure me into sex with consistent whining, and touching me when I said no until I would give up and let him start having penetrative sex. He called it 'getting you in the mood'- yes, bleurgh. I'd usually give up and lie still and let him- if I just wanted him to stop during it, he would tell me to wait (maybe act like he couldn't hear me the first time, too), and just keep going. I remember at least 2 occasions that I tried at that point to squirm out from under him, but he was a LOT heavier than me and I'd give up and feel paralysed from doing anything more. Extra pressure came from the ways he'd react the times when I could project enough confidence into my voice to get him to stop- he had rejection issues and it clearly made him feel terrible, and would be moody the next day, yell at his siblings (aged 4-14), smoke a lot more and be generally distant. It almost felt like we had an unspoken agreement that I would let him do whatever and regulate his mood, and he'd avoid destructive behaviour. Though I'm sure that wasn't particularly conscious on his part- it was my codependency. He was himself a victim of serious and repeated sexual assault and rape as a child. In regular daily life I wouldn't let him physically touch me at all. Some weird unconscious thing, I guess. Anyway, I was 18. He'd cheated one too many times and I dumped him. A few weeks later, I told a friend that I thought he'd been raping me- I was hesitant to use the word, but I even did some googling and I got the message pretty conclusively. I still felt like it was half my own fault, but I wasn't ready to talk about that- in fact, I didn't give any details to the friend about the pattern. I told her he'd raped me a few times, thinking in a couple of flashes of the times when I had tried my best to get it to stop, but mostly I wasn't thinking. I was just feeling. He had made me feel like dirt, I was a fairly happy, functioning person before I'd met him, and I knew I had been taken advantage of and treated like I didn't matter. I didn't turn my thoughts to his intentions yet, I just said how I felt: raped. She convinced me to at least make sure people knew, if I didn't want to go to the police. I had just wanted to tell someone that the relationship had been worse than the drugs and cheating everyone had long come to know about him, but I agreed. Largely because I was angry and hurt and wanted him to feel hurt, too- I felt like it couldn't just end there, with me a wreck and him zipping off into the sunset to do a line. In retrospect- very obviously- we both needed therapy. I didn't even try to talk to him about how I felt- he wasn't known for accountability and I couldn't face it. It all kicked off. She told a couple of people, I told a couple of people and it spread like wildfire (small town). I hadn't come to terms with what he had done and I felt very quickly that people were viewing him as far more vindictive than I believed (and still believe) he was. He had always been far more self-destructive than anything else- he made poor, selfish, short-sighted decisions and others got caught in the crossfire. I became seriously angry when I found out he was telling people who didn't know me, and had heard nothing about it, that I was making it up- but also guilty, since I felt the situation was being interpreted as violent rape, or somehow more... legitimate? And that this was due to me not wanting to talk about what had actually happened, and not wanting to be victim-blamed for not doing more (which I already had plenty of guilt about). To my merit I guess, when I did speak with those few people about it, I made it clear that all I wanted was for him to get therapy. That's when it took a truly downward turn. I felt so much pressure when a family member of his demanded to know why I didn't tell her or shout for her (her room was next door to ours), I didn't have an answer. So I said 'he told me not to'. It was completely untrue, as we had never discussed it, in that moment I just couldn't face what I felt was going to descend into a lot of questioning and picking me apart. I had enough self-torment about not leaving a lot sooner or finding a way to get him to stop- the true answer was that if I had told her, I felt he would have inevitably broken up with me, and that answer seemed pathetic. 'I don't know' seemed pathetic. It haunts me to this day because of what it obviously suggests about his intention. Since then others have suggested to me that he deserved it (he's not well liked) and that my self protective instinct was completely understandable, but my regret is strong. I then felt I had to repeat the lie, and did so to a mutual friend and to one of his friends who later came attacking me, saying that he wouldn't hurt a fly. The ironic thing is that I think I agree with her that he doesn't intentionally hurt others most of the time- he's just a mess. From then on I agreed with and encouraged those who suggested his actions were intentional rather than reckless, and felt that people believing that was safer for me than having to go into the whole story, which I had only become more afraid to discuss, and which I felt made him less culpable just due to our relationship dynamic and the lack of violence/threats. I don't recall any further lies about the specifics (and I believe I would, given that that specific one haunts me), but I certainly feel that I was manipulative in not discussing the whole story including codependent factors or my freezing/giving up, which I felt shifted some blame to me. I also felt/feel guilty that I failed to mention any of my own faults and mistakes in the relationship- I didn't do the things he did but I certainly wasn't perfect, and my codependency had led me to lie to him about things before to make him feel better on a few occasions. I now swung ferociously between extreme guilt and extreme anger. I had carried on seeing him and having sex. In person he would say he'd get therapy and that we could fix things and potentially get back together, but when I wasn't there, he was denying all. Apparently its very common for people to keep seeing an abuser to feel a sense of control, but I couldn't understand my own actions and neither could anyone else. They told me I was being manipulated but in truth despite still loving him, I didn't believe that he would actually take accountability like he'd tell me he would. I actually got the sense when I saw him that he didn't have much awareness of what he'd done and was still seeing me in part for sex and in part was hoping to get me to retract everything. He'd look at me like I was the devil sometimes, which made me feel like I was. I had realised more and more that he had been reenacting past abuse with me (likely word for word) and that it being wrong was just not something he had the capacity or emotional maturity to notice. My self image suffered to extremes. At times I felt evil and tried (and failed) to embrace it so I could feel like I had some kind of power. I even went to a distant friend who I'd had a very teenage bravado-relationship with and said that I'd made it up from the start, then took it back when I realised it didn't make me feel any better and I couldn't own the picture of myself as just bad and my ex as innocent, which I'm sure made me look crazy. I couldn't integrate the fact that extreme anger was normal, I thought anger along with my guilt and stupid mistakes, made me bad. I was gaslighted as a liar and manipulative by my (NPD) mother as a child despite being extremely naive and generous, which obviously worsened it. A lot happened over the next six months or so. I found out there was another girl who said the ex had raped her at a party, but she didn't want to go into detail, which makes me think that she was potentially in something of a similar position and didn't want to be blamed for not doing more to prevent it. I went with him to a therapist who said that he had Borderline personality disorder. He faked going to intensive therapy when I said I was considering going to police if he wouldn't. His brother in law was a cop and wanted to report it, causing huge issues in his family, who kicked him out but did nothing else. He had to leave our small town for a while due to harassment. All more guilt for me. He 'dated' someone else while I was still meeting up with him and I didn't care that it was cheating, at that point i just wanted to hurt him and was glad. It at least made me feel powerful, and it felt like a small fuck you for all the times he'd cheated on me. And then my next mistake- I messed with a pregnancy test for a positive result which I sent to his family member. Oh dear. This was partly to make him feel like crap and harm his relationship to hurt him. And partly to try to elicit a change in his behaviour- we'd had a pregnancy scare previously, during which he had stopped all drugs and started to get on track. I knew that his constantly smoking weed was not helping the situation. I do understand now that this was my codependency acting out again- trying to control the situation, like when I'd try to keep him at home to stop him going out to do drugs during the relationship. I was constantly angry that (I felt) I was suffering more than him and he was moving on with a new relationship. I actually haven't felt able to date again since. But obviously I feel like complete shit about this. I didn't have any real understanding of how bad this was at the time, though I knew it was stigmatised. I only said it to his family member, himself and I think one other person, and I didn't keep it up for long. It had made me feel even more that I must just be a bad person, I knew I needed to start actually working through this by myself and I cut all contact. We had no contact for around 4 years other than a barrage of messages blaming me when he was dumped shortly after we cut contact, as the girl couldn't trust him after cheating with me. Since then, I've changed a lot. For a while, I was very aggressive and would lash out a lot, and frankly I was allergic to vulnerability, and lived in fantasies in my head and on the internet. I was unable to keep jobs, stopped going out and seeing any friends whatsoever, avoided human contact and spent almost all of my time sleeping. I was basically your typical borderline personality for a while, minus the self harming traits. I saw myself as manipulative and kept away from others so that I couldn't hurt them. I was diagnosed with 'attachment disorder' (complex PTSD) and put on a short stint of antipsychotics, which actually helped a little, though they caused weight gain. I experienced another incident of coercion by a family member. A few years later, I was diagnosed with PTSD, moved out of my family home and started learning how to process my feelings. Like actually letting myself feel guilt and anger instead of being scared of them and ramming them down into numbness and unconscious reactive behaviour. I learned and enforced proper boundaries, which I shared with my family and which helped them to grow and change along with me. Even my NPD mother. I learned gradually to trust for the first time ever, and grew an understanding that so much of my behaviour was born out of defence mechanisms to avoid rejection and anger. I have learned to be assertive and to recognise codependency in myself and others. I've learned how to be a good friend, and my friends tell me that I have helped them. I went to college (UK), and am now in my second year at a top university. I saw the ex recently, who apologised for his actions whilst half trying to downplay them, which made me feel moreso that I had caused something huge out of something small. He said that his actions were 'partly drugs, partly just me \[himself\]', and that he now understands that no means no. He had some scrapes with the law since, but went to anger management, though I still feel he needs in-depth counselling as his issue is triggers and emotional regulation in whole, including his own guilt, and past trauma. He thanked me for not letting him continue constantly taking hard drugs, suggesting that he'd otherwise be dead. Which I don't like- it just reminds me of how I shouldn't have been put in that situation with that responsibility in the first place, and how it was my feelings of obligation in part which led to the trauma. I confessed about the pregnancy- he was shocked but said that he forgives me, and I made clear that I was extremely sorry about having outright lied about the 'not telling' thing, which he doesn't seem to feel was a big deal. He is in a stable job and relationship and says that nobody even brings up what happened between us anymore- which I'm thankful about, and have said that if he gets trouble from people, he can direct them towards me and I will give them my view on it. More than anything, I wish I had broken ties right away, sought therapy immediately and only discussed it with friends in confidence if at all- hopefully leading to being able to discuss it with him in a way which would make him more self-aware and not treat partners the same way in the future. I swing between believing he didn't even notice when I would try to squirm him off as me, as I would give up so soon and he was, well, preoccupied, and believing that he did notice but instinctively rammed down the awareness. Either way, I do understand that it was wrong, but I still haven't gone into real detail with him about any of it, as it would be morbid for me and I don't think he is ready to deal with it himself, so it wouldn't be productive. I never found out if he did any of the same with his previous exes, and whether they registered it as wrong, and what this says about me. I went to the mutual friend who I had originally told about the assaults and explained much of it, that I'd lied about detail and gave a brief outline of the pattern of our relationship RE assaults. She forgave me immediately, said she understood and apologised for the pressure on her part to tell people, saying that it was because it's what she wished she had done in her own case. I gave her (and him) full permission to tell what I had told her to anyone else who brings it up. I don't live there anymore and don't plan to, and I can't face doing some public statement about it. My therapist and friends have said that I certainly don't owe it to anyone to dump my guilt and full explanation on them and have any negative reaction make me feel worse about myself right now. Yet I cant seem to get past this, six years or so later. My self image is still pretty bad, and my lows can be pretty damn low. I struggle to socialise as it all feels like some awful secret that people don't know about me (which also prevents me from processing what actually happened to me) and I worry frequently that it will haunt me into the future, in the form of accusations and character smears. I want to be able to own my story and my growth but it's complex and the notion is petrifying. Please throw out some honest opinions and advice. As I've mentioned, I'm in therapy and I talk to friends, but my fear of judgement from people in general, and from those who could feel duped by me, is huge and heavy. I have learned to be flexible and open to change and will take any suggestions seriously. Way too long;didn't read:I was repeatedly sexually assaulted by an ex who was himself a trauma victim. I publicly made him seem more vindictive and intentional than he was, tried to hurt and manipulate him, and ruined my self image in the process. I have grown and done work to put things right but it still haunts me. What do?"

It feels like there's something about me that either repels people or prompts them to judge me unusually harshly. &amp;#x200B; It was in my friendships. Throughout middle and high school, I 'rivaled' with a couple of friends in a few hobbies (mostly academics and an extracurricular activity). In our tiny school, we were considered to be the 'best' at those particular things. But no matter where we were in life, our friend group always preferred cheering those friends on over me. I once won a schoolwide contest - and somehow 'beat' my friend - only to have someone in our friend group approached me to ask why I got an award that that friend clearly deserved. When friends noted how good my grades were or how talented I was in my niche, it was usually as a comparison: ""*If you think DrawingThin is good, wait until you meet X.*"" Even in high school, well into my senior year, a school counselor repeated the sentiment: he told me that while my writing was 'good', my friend was simply out of this world. I was just a benchmark - my friends weren't interested in celebrating successes with me, but they were always pretty happy when someone else beat me. I could never figure out what I was doing wrong. &amp;#x200B; I see this in my family. A few weeks ago, when I was back home, a relative noticed that something was bothering me. In a rare moment of vulnerability, I decided to open up and tell them what was on my mind. The response was literally this: ""Life's like that sometimes."" Nothing else. They lost interest. They returned to their seat, sat down, and started eating again. It was as though I'd said nothing. But the second my younger sister walked into the room, that same relative came to life, began joking with her, and asked her about her day. Any argument or debate can start in a family by anyone, but the moment I begin to say something, people lose interest and shut the conversation down. Family members greet me with tight smiles and unsure looks, but they loosen up when they see my sister and squeeze her. &amp;#x200B; I see this in my other relationships. I might tell a mentor, for example, that life has been feeling particularly hard. They'll smile and say ""You have nothing to to be worried over!"" and the conversation ends there. Days later, I'll overhear that same mentor consoling a friend and reminding of them of the deep conversations they'd been having - the conversation didn't end at 'You're worrying over nothing', they actually sat down and talked. My roommate and friend has stopped talking to me at home: when I ask her how her day went, she flatly replies that she doesn't want to talk. But she very happily and gladly reaches out to our mutual friends, and even arranges plans that might slightly impact me (e.g., she once was planning a henna party) without telling me last. &amp;#x200B; When I mentioned that I missed my deceased mother, I got a 'Well, at least you had a mom' from my mom's older sister. When I told the professor who reached out to me that I didn't understand why my lab group hated me (spoiler alert: I found out later that at least one of my labmates actually had an issue with black people), she told me that I struck her as 'angsty' when she first met me, and that maybe that's why. My friends hug and greet each other so naturally - they'll hold hands, talk, lay in each other's laps - but those same friends seem hesitant to even to touch my shoulder. &amp;#x200B; I just want to understand what's wrong with me. I just want to know what I can fix about myself. I'm tired of being invisible."

Or it is a weird feeling that someone can see something wrong with me I cannot see myself. I would like to believe I know myself better than anyone else and that I am fully self-contained.

These would be people who I will have to spend a lot of time with. Would it be a bad move to disclose my problem to them in layman's terms? No diagnosis or oversharing, just something like ""Hey, if you notice me acting awkwardly around you, please don't take it personally. I just have a lot of anxiety talking to people who I'm not very familiar with. I'm not good at small talk."" Obviously, I'd want to get to the point where I no longer send awkward signals in the first place, but that's going to be a very slow process, so I'm thinking of this sort of disclosure as a stop-gap solution in the mean time. I'm very reluctant to disclose personal things like this for fear of them being used against me, but I've realized that that fear is mainly because I'm still stuck in a high school mindset. I would hope that now that I'm an adult dealing with other adults, everyone is going to be a lot more mature and understanding. Finally, are there any other hazards to making such a disclosure that I might not have considered? For example, is there a risk that showing this vulnerability might be misconstrued by certain people and taken as an invitation to make romantic advances? Thanks."

Stephens night my best friend cheated on his girlfriend with an old crush he had back in our hometown. This is a girl who he has consistently dismissed his gf's concerns over and has said she was being controlling in wanting him to distance himself from her. That night he was all over her, cuddling and hugging her. 4 of his friends including me went to try and intervene earlier in the night and he basically fucked us off, even palming me off in my face to ""leave them alone"". Now at this point, I'd been stressing the whole night about him ruining his relationship over what could be, so this complete disrespect for his oldest friend who was trying to help him, set me off. I left to calm down, it didn't work and the next time I saw him i smacked him full force across the head and started roaring at him for being a gobshite. I know that was an over reaction and I apologise less than a minute after I slapped him. We haven't spoken to each other in the days since, but I've been getting updates on how he is dealing with this from another friend. Apparently he is trying to blame his gf for what he did, and without getting more into it, is trying to minimise how intentional his actions were that night(I kept him in my sights for 90% if the night, I was disgusted with him). Idk what to say, I'm meeting him tommorow with our mutual friend to mediate but I know I'm not gonna be able to keep myself calm. Is there anything I can say/ anyway to phrase my dissapointment and anger at what he did without him taking it and crawling into a shell. Also, it seems he is lying to his girlfriend about what went down that night, like I said, he's trying to pass off the whole thing as this girl having taken advantage of his vulnerability due to his gf. I think that's extremely manipulative, should I contact the gf and say that he's not giving the full story? She's a lovely girl, I just don't think she deserves to deal with the shit my friend is doing, at least until he improves himself. So yeah, two main questions from extremely angry, conflicted individual. How can I best avoid my friend from shutting me out to avoid guilt? Should I tell his gf what actually happened that night? And we're all 20 years old here, they've been going out for a few years now, if that changes anything. Any advice is much appreciated, my head is in bits the last few days from all this."

188,vulnerability,Advice,I Harrased a Co-Worker,1,abg6si,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/abg6si/i_harrased_a_coworker/,2019-01-01 18:21:15,"Im not proud of this story but please read the whole context before responding. Its quite a long one so bear with me. Im a 23 year old male who works in a retail store. I am planning to leave this job in April to travel overseas and have been sinking all of my disposable income into paying for the trip over the past six months. In July last year, a new girl started at work, 19 years old. She is very attractive and very flirty. We started to hit it off, so I asked her out and she said yes. However, over the following days, she started brushing me off and then txt me out of the blue to say she was in the middle of a bad breakup and wasnt actually ready to date. Im a pretty emotionally vulnerable person (father and brother both committed suicide and consequently Ive developed real difficulties allowing myself to be vulnerable. Which Im working on.). So this hit me pretty hard; but I think handled it reasonably well. I did really like her and kept talking to her over the following weeks but in the end she went back to her ex. So I had to give it up. Ultimately we stayed friendly at work and I confided to her my emotional vulnerability. I spent the following six months focussing on me. I let go of my attraction to her and put my energy into working out, planning my trip, learning languages and practicing guitar. Ive had a really good year in the end. Then two weeks ago, this girl (who has now been single again for a few months) txted me out of the blue and asked if I wanted to go out some time. I was absolutely elated because, as I said, Im really into this girl. So I went out with her and, aside from a few awkward moments, it seemed to go well. She even txt me not fifteen minutes afterwards and said she had a good time. But the cold shoulder started happening and it became obvious she was backing off again. I confronted her and she revealed that she was really unsure about things. Sometimes she really likes me and sometimes she has doubts. She also said she thinks being single just works for her at the moment. I was a little hurt and reluctantly reminded her that Im not in a good emotional state for her to play games with me. Which, I knew would pretty much close the door on this relationship ever happening. But I felt I had to be honest. A few days later, her friend tells me shed just spent her day off driving to another town, two hours away for a Tinder date. I was pretty annoyed considering what just happened. In my frustration, I sent a passive aggressive txt letting her know that Id been told about what she was up to; and then I decided to just ghost her going forward. I wasnt giving her anymore of my energy. Well that mustve gotten to her because two days into ignoring her, I came out from my lunch break to find her new Tinder friend waiting in the store. They immediately went off together for about half an hour and mustve had a good time because they decided to have a little make-out session in front of me. I was seriously furious. I mean, it really, really hurt. Just a week ago Id been on a date with her getting excited about the prospect of finally getting to the next level. And she was encouraging me the whole time. I caught up to her as she went into the back room and I really lost my temper. I mean...I was out of line. I raised my voice, swore at her, told her I thought she was a cruel, bad person and, probably, in the heat of the moment I mightve come across as pretty intimidating. She ended up in tears. And when I saw her crying, it really struck me how I was behaving; so I relented immediately. I apologised as profusely as I could and did everything I could to calm her down. But, of course, she was mad at me. Im really ashamed of how I acted. I mean, I cant reconcile myself as being someone who would harass a co-worker. I feel morally abhorrent. But Im still angry at her for fucking with my head. And as well as the guilt, Im now worried about my job. If I lose it before April I wont have the money for my trip and its gonna really create a hard situation for me. I talked to two mutual friend of ours (who are also fellow coworkers) and theyve both surprisingly backed me up in the situation (thought not condoning my outburst). Apparently the girl had been telling everyone that we went out and that I was the one who had asked her to go. Im known to be an extremely honest man, which is thankfully working in my favour, because both of my friends believed me immediately and are telling me that it isnt okay for her to be making out that Im instigating everything. Anyway one of the two co-workers sat down with the girl and apparently shes agreed not to go to a manager about it, so long as we move on and I leave her alone going forward. But Im wondering if I should be nervous? I have to work with her tomorrow and Im concerned her new man might show up to confront me, or she may even change her mind and pursue action against me with management. Im conflicted because Im genuinely sorry for the way I acted towards her and Im also wanting to protect my job. I know I fucked up. I know I cant take back what I did or justify it. I guess if management ask me about it, all I can do is be honest about the circumstances and how I behaved; then try my best to express my guilt and desire to repair the situation. What do you think? To what degree is my job really at risk here? Is there anything I can do to make this girl feel safer and less resentful of me in the aftermath? Do I even deserved to be forgiven? This has to have been the most mental things Ive ever done. Tldr; Coworker asked me out, knowing I really liked her and have major emotional hangups. She then proceeded to mess with my head and made out with another guy in front of me, causing me to snap and chew her out, reducing her to tears. Now I feel like a monster and also dont know just how worried I should be for my job."

190,vulnerability,Advice,I Feel Broken,1,acuxx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/acuxx1/i_feel_broken/,2019-01-06 02:17:27," I don't know even know where to start with this one. So, I'll start where I think this started. Around April/May last year I was quite low about leaving university and not having anything to do after I graduated. I mean, really low. Obviously, I applied for jobs/internships, even amidst the last stretch of my dissertation piece, so I would be prepared. Side note (this also becomes relevant to the story): my parents are really terrible when it comes to understanding my emotional wellbeing. My Father is void of emotion and I've never once spoke to him about how I feel about things (whether big or small), my Mother engages but often turns things into an argument. Like, she doesn't think I should show emotion or vulnerability, and turns it back on me as if I don't have a right to be upset or feel low. During my job application process, I received a few rejections, and a couple of interviews. One that I focused on in depth was a three-month internship in Amsterdam. During my break, and just before I left university completely, I had a Skype interview with the company in Amsterdam and they got back quickly and told me that I'd been accepted. The only thing is that it would require financial support from parents to live there. Cut a long story short: my parents never gave a clear answer as to whether they would help. There was a lot of gaslighting from my Mum's part and essentially silence from my Father. Literally a week before I was meant to start, even after arguments and going back on promises, my Mum said she'd support me if I found somewhere to live. Giving me a short amount of time to look, which was incredibly difficult. Obviously I was beyond grateful, was never told where the money was from, but was really grateful. To add another difficult layer to the story, I also heard from a company in London who I progressed with to a final stage interview for a full-time job, the catch was that I needed to be in Amsterdam at the time of the interview. I really wanted to hear what my parents had to say about my options, since the job wasn't solidfied whereas the internship was. I didn't want to be in a situation where I literally had nothing. Personally, I felt like my parents were both really bad communicators and always tiptoed around giving a clear answer that I needed to hear. At this point, it sounds like I am being needy, but parents are all I have and I needed there advice on this situation. All in all, it came down to me going to Amsterdam and skipping the interview. The internship was great and the experience was nice, but only three months. I was back to square one when I came back and had to start looking and working hard on creating CVs and looking for jobs. There are no opportunities where I live, it's a small town and it's a horrible place to live quite frankly. Both my parents know I don't want to live here long-term, even saying things like 'you can move to London when you get a job' and 'commuting to London is easy, everyone does it' to help me with decisions in the past. Basically, after a few interviews (outside of my hometown), my Dad did suggest that it would be hard for them to financially support by moving away instantly. My Mother, however, would often contradict him (though I'm not sure if she was telling me what I wanted to here). The fact is that they both let me go to the interviews, with one in London being the one I was ultimately accepted for. Afterwards, silence from both of them. My Mum basically told me to forget about looking for a place, that rail prices were too high, etc. To enjoy the Festive period, I put into the back of my mind. This past weekend my Mother, again, gave straightforward insuinations that I could move to London. Even looking at hotels and pricing things up for me. I spent the past two days (when I start on Monday) looking and contacting people about rooms, when I queried her about being able to find a place. What I feared would happen came true, she went back on her word, told me she wouldn't be able to pay, and that the budget was really low (a budget, she and I both knew would not be able to provide accomodation). I literally broke because I couldn't believe my emotions were being played with. If the answer was always no, all I needed was a firm and straight forward answer. Instead my hopes were up and then they were trodden on at the last minute. I'd put SO much effort in arrangng viewings and literally taking an early mroning train so I could make this work. I feel grateful for what my parents have done for me, but I despair the emotional toll it's taken on me and how much of a burden I'm made to feel. What I needed was clarity and understanding, but instead my Mum likes to kick me while I'm down nd make things difficult. Even bringing things up like how I have no money (which this job would've helped with and I obviously would've paid any money I owed them, including the Amsterdam trip back-as she's used this against me in arguments, telling me I have to pay it back when it was never said that I would have to (again, I would, it's just the inconsistency and lack of clarity that fucks up my mind) and that I can't go back to my university location (as I would sometimes when arguments got too much) anymore. My mental state broke last night, I'm over-analysing this whole last year. About how I should've went to the job interview in London instead of Amsterdam. How my Mother is using my as emotional playtoy to raise my expectations and drag me down at the last minute. I can't bare to look at her or even speak, and my mental health is at an all time low. I can't speak to anyone, I don't know what to do about this job that I'm supposed to start on Monday and I can't see any brightness in the future. I genuinely don't know what to do. Also: I 'd like to add that My Mum had also told firends of mine, and family members, that I had got this job. So, basically revealed that I had a new job to go to, which surprised me because I knew there would be a chance it might not be able to work out. So, now I have to face the embarrasment of telling family and friends that it didn't work out, when it could've been kept quiet by my Mother. We're currently not speaking at all, since my Mum always tries to one-up in playing the victim when, I personally feel, that she's the one who is being emotionally abusive and dragging me through the mud instead of providing straightforward answers. She has a horrible tendecy, and dreadful past, of big lies and dishonesty. Pretending that conversations assoicated with this situation exsisted when they never, telling me last-minute information that she knew would mean this wouldn't work out. This is also the woman who said she couln't attend my graduation because the dog couldn't be left alone, which means I couldn't go as my Dad was the only person who could take me. Again, he was silent on this. All I wanted was to be successful and do people proud, but what it's caused is emotional anguish and a terrible relationship and outlook on my parents, where I feel like I've seen the worst of them and want nothing more to do with them. Which is horrible in a situation where I have nothing else. Just makes me want to give up on life."

I'm wondering if anyone would wanna give their 2 cents on a predicament I've found myself in. Background story in a nutshell: In high school I dated a girl who had a best friend. 'K' we'll call her. We all became pretty close friends and ended up moving in with each other after school. K met her girlfriend 'T' and they managed to make it last longer than I was able to make my relationship with her best friend last. My girlfriend and I broke up about 2.5 years in and to my surprise I ended up keeping them as friends. Recently K's fiance (same T from before) has had an identity crisis of sorts and decides she can't be what K needs. (K Suffers from chronic pain among other things) so it's just the two of us in the apartment we all used to share. Now she's been a wreck and I'm still doing what I can to help but lately I've got the feeling she thinks in trying to abuse her vulnerability (I've barely been on a date since my ex). This combined with other people bringing up specific topics every time I'm around. I'll admit to thinking about it and regretfully thinking it was a good idea; but at the same time I realise she just ended a 5 year relationship that she thought would last the rest of her life. I've known her for 6 years and she's always been in a relationship for them. I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm not sure how I can be the supportive friend who can take care of her when everything I do feels like I'm just taking advantage of the situation. Thanks for listening - J"

She really struggles to connect with people - others often see her as a strong leader and someone who is admirable for being smart, capable, and organized, but they are much less likely to feel drawn to her as a person, even though she is very kind, thoughtful, genuine, and funny. Unfortunately, I think there is a self-reinforcing dynamic at play: She is constantly hurt and frustrated by people not being interested in becoming her friend, and that makes her less willing to invest time, energy, and vulnerability in seeking out new relationships. This is a big struggle in her life and a source of real anxiety, sadness, and self-doubt. At the end of her time in high school, all of her friends ""abandoned"" her with no reason or warning. Since then, she has really struggled to build new relationships or trust people. It was a difficulty for her in college and has only seemed to intensify since graduating. Sometimes, I fear that she really sees me as her only true friend. I am happy and grateful to be her friend, but I want her to be able to find fulfilling relationships with others, too. My heart breaks for her when I see how unhappy and hurt she is after meeting new people who seem totally uninterested in getting to know her better. What advice do you have for adults who struggle to form friendships? And how can my wife help people connect with her and like her for who she is? Lastly, is there anything I can do to help beyond supporting her and showing her love and friendship myself? "

They then told her about it but she seemed to shrug it off kind of I wasnt really watching when it happened. I felt like my world was falling apart. I still had classes with her the rest of the semester we still talked but never about the picture or that day, and we barely talked the rest of the year. That was last year. I always wanted to apologize for if it made her feel bad, but I was scared. Now I want to apologize but every time I see her my stomach drops from nervousness. I thought about apologizing over text but that feels to impersonal and I asked my friend and he said I shouldnt because its been too long and it might just make things worse and I just dont know what to do."

But, the last time I tried to let someone go down on me it ended with me having an anxiety attack and obviously having to stop. I am a little unsure why my body reacts so negatively to receiving. There was a time I thought it was worry that maybe it wasn't ""pretty"" looking, or god forbid what if it ""smelled""? So, I took hold of the reigns and made sure I was all nice and pretty and clean whenever I decided that maybe ""tonight was the night!"" LOL. But that doesn't seem to help either. A part of me wonders if it is a level of vulnerability that is intimidating and that is why I get worked up, but I don't know. For y'all that have maybe struggled with this - both men and women - how did you get over it? Was it just taking things really slowly with someone you trust immensely?

Hes had depression throughout his life and was quite closed off emotionally as a Dad to my Mum. He also hasnt been the most loving or attentive husband so my Nan is quite resentful about their marriage. That being said, he is a good man, was a brilliant Grandad and I love him dearly. Hes generous, kind and helpful to a fault. This afternoon I think he tried to tell us that he was abused as a child. We were talking about his sons recent conversion to atheism and how when my Grandad was a young teenager he also decided God wasnt real. My Nan is devotedly Catholic and he said, Even your Nan waivers sometimes when she hears about those priests who touch little boys. My Grandad moves on to tell us that when he was a little boy he was in the Scouts his Scout Leader was fired because of accusations of child sexual abuse against the boys in the club. He moved on to another story about being in the church choir. There were two men in the choir who would have parties in their house with the boys from the choir. My Grandad said that when his mother found out she went to the priest and demanded to know what was going on and the parties then stopped. Then my mum says, Thats nice dad, and my Grandad said, Oh yes, they were nice men. Nothing like that was going on. But Im certain that he was trying to disclose some serious trauma from his childhood and it was handled terribly by the Mum and myself. I sat there in silence. I know why my Mum shut the conversation down, its because thats what her side of the family does. They dont talk about difficult things. I know I handled this situation badly. But I dont want to let this go and pretend like nothing has happened. What do I do? Should I bring it up with my Grandad again when my Mum isnt there? Or should I just keep talking with him and visiting him and just wait for him to bring it up again? Asking my mum to coordinate a response is a non-starter. She has terminal cancer and isnt in a place to shoulder the emotional burden plus she doesnt have the skills to deal with something like this. Im going to tell my sister and see what she thinks but again we all grew up burying our feelings and pretending things didnt happen so I cant see her wanting to take any active role in providing support or doing anything about it. I know it takes such courage and vulnerability to try and tell your family about something like this and my heart is just breaking for my poor Grandad. TL;DR I think my grandad tried to tell us he was abused as a child, we didnt handle it well. How do I bring it up again to find out what happened and how I can help? &amp;#x200B;"

I was thinking about this because I overheard her making those jokes again today and one of her friends told her (quite loudly) to stop. It really affected me, because I know she felt hurt by that. It's a call for help and to be shot down like that... (clearly, her friends don't understand) I feel that I should do something to help her.

February 28th, 2015. I met this girl named *Jamie at party and she and I both clicked really well. Ill admit that at the time, I had been inexperienced with women as I was a virgin..and this conversations followed near the end of the night did include a hit of acid from the both of us. However, Ive never felt, even to this day, so comfortable and at ease with another woman in my life..I should add a lot of these feelings of closeness, comfortability, vulnerability, and ease were present prior to taking drugs. They just intensified them. That being said, we end up cozied on this couch by each other near the end of the night. I still have yet to describe how natural it felt. Ive barely felt this since. But thats not the topic here. The real topic? I got her number, but I ended up fucking things up with her. Because she ended up dating somebody else not long after that party..who I despised, but now associate with a decent amount. Were on good terms, but I still dont trust the dude and he knows it. Besides that, I remember making it known to her after she if Im attracted to her, because well, I was..even said I didnt give a fuck about her boyfriend knowing it either because I was that much of a cocky shit and had that big of a crush. This ends up being weird from then on out with her. Ive always sensed there was this attraction towards each other, even though for the longest time it was insanely awkward. Shed come with her then boyfriend to a social event, look at me, give me this jaw dropping look, as Id say little weird here and there to her throughout these events, vice versa, and so on. Well, time goes by. We end up communicating with each other a decent amount. Never thru message, but usually at a social event. Shed usually be the one to initiate it. There was one specifically. Me and a group of friends and friends of friends, etc. all decided to sneak into a local state park about 45 minutes away from here..but I just remember that night being really odd. See, her boyfriend wasnt around, but while I couldnt comfortable talk to her too much, she kept wanting to be in my presence and test my patience for some reason. Well, time goes by and they break up. What do I do? I try to contact her to be friends, but cmon. You know where this goes. The bad part? I was in a relationship, yet I still wanted to get close to her and get to know her more. We basically talked to each other damn near everyday for the longest time. I tried to avoid any possibility of sexual tension, even though it was sure as hell there and it was killing me for not doing anything with it. It became known after talking and seeing each other(at events) that there definitely was an intense attraction there. Im telling you this girl basically told me she wanted me to paddle her n all one day. But Im not gonna get into the logistics of that. All I can tell you is, there were so many fucking little things there that made me realize she did care and want more with me. She went back to that same park we snuck in at, took pictures of it with her friend, and was explaining/commemorating the time we had spent there. It was heart warming beyond belief. Yet, as I explained that I enjoyed my time there with her, I could never explain what I wanted. Never did. It got frustrating, because I couldnt tell my then girlfriend of the reasons behind that, nor could I tell her because I was with my girlfriend and didnt want to hurt her either. Well, both ended up getting hurt for different reasons. Hindsight is 20/20, but I know I couldve been honest with her and Jamie and I would still have a relationship..of us at least talking. There was just so much there that I did nothing with One specific moment was her coming to a friends party one time in the middle of late fall. She gives everyone else around her these friendly hugs, but immediately gives me the biggest bear hug Ive had in my life. And Im telling you, this hug..it felt as if neither of us wanted to let go of each other, but we had to. It was so goddamn intense that we immediately started at each other for at least 10 seconds afterwards..she then proceeded to invite me into the bathroom to show me her phone problems she was having. Everyone should know what something like that would entail, yet, I never made any kind of move. She would let me have all this little hints about how she likes me regardless of my mental illnesses. Along all these other things. It was just this intense attraction that we had and never admitted to each other. Well? Nothing happened. She moved a state over and we remained to have contact with each other. She joked about me moving with her shortly after her move, working with her and so on. You know what I did? And what I had been doing subtly? Pushing her away. Finding ways for her to dislike me. Make her want nothing to do with me. I didnt feel right for how things ended and developed a huge list of drug and emotional issues between this time. I did whatever I can basically make it seem platonic and nothing mattered without being a dick. I. Fucking. Regret. It. So. Much. I cant even fathom on why I did. I was scared, scared to let her know, I kept her around for selfish reasons at this point. I started blowing her up to no reply or her have no real interest in my life from what it seems. Shit, shed rarely watch my snap story except rare occasions now. I cut her off one day. Ended all contact because I couldnt keep blowing her up and putting myself through emotional and mental pain of me fucking up while I pushed her away more and more as days went by. Weirdest part is? I fucking asked her if I could cut contact! Now thats ridiculous. She said itd be fine as long as she knows Im safe. Well, just kind of gave me the reason to do it one day after apologizing for my behavior down the line. Mind you this is 2-3 weeks after asking that..she never opened the message. Blocked her on social media, but kept her number. I ended up messaging her twice since this happened. Its been at least 6.5-7 months since Ive talked to her in any way. I messaged her 1.5 months after cutting her off one morning and asked how she had been doing. No reply. I deleted her number. I wish I hadnt because I often ponder if everything would make sense if I just called her. But this is what led up to the 2nd message I sent her..on her Instagram Her instagram, message went like this Well, I know I blocked you on everything for awhile because I was being an emotionally toxic shit mind you, Im fucked up on a benzo while I type this, but in all honesty I want to know whats been going on in your life. We havent spoken in awhile and if you dont respond, its fine. I dont want to intrude too much, you have your own things going on. I want to know if youve been all right and having a good time out of state, Jamie. Get back to me if youd like, but if you dont..well, I just hope youve been good as of recently I fucking hate the fact that Ive typed that message. Ill admit Im a drug addict at this point in my life trying to drown and avoid my troubles in life since the end of last year, due to job changes and so on. Most of it was to sleep, but besides that..I get I have to get clean and Im trying. But Im really just trying to wonder if theres any fucking reason to ever try again? I know there was something there and she did too. She knew the entire fucking time there was. She gave me so many chances to let her know what I felt and what I thought of her, but I was too fucking cowardly to tell her. I get Im not the best of people talking to her and having such emotional attachments while in a relationship, but I tried to do what was most logical at the time, but it went on too long and I just couldnt say anything. Would it even be worth it? And how would I even go about it? Ive tried to move on from it. Me and my then girlfriend havent been together for almost 5 months now. Ive tried seeing other women, Ive tried focusing my attention elsewhere, but its just bitten me in the ass..Ive tried focusing on myself instead, but its just led me to self destructive behaviors and now I dont know what to do. I know sobriety is obviously the biggest on my mind..but what about her? Do I even have a reason one day to talk to her? Does she even give a fuck about me? Why cant I just move on from this? I dont understand anything anymore, especially with this girl, and I dont know who else to turn to and ask about this. Would it even be worth contacting her again? And if so, how in the hell would I go about that? I miss this girl so fucking much and I recently can not stop thinking about how I fucked something up that Ive wanted for years over nothing. Negative, positive, or in between. Any kind of response to this would be more than appreciated "

I have spoken to management about this bullying many times and HR is aware but its my word against theirs, and the other women who have experienced this from them are to afraid to back me up so nothing has been done.

204,vulnerability,Advice,My vulnerability to substance addiction is making me worried for my future...,1,9agjso,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9agjso/my_vulnerability_to_substance_addiction_is_making/,2018-08-27 01:56:09,"Well I'm 16 and I almost fell into full-blown addiction twice. 1st was with sleeping pills, 2nd was with alcohol. When I was 14-15, I moved from Virginia to Mississippi with my mother. I have a brother but at the time we were seperated because he went with my Dad instead of coming with us to Mississippi. Hell, I don't blame him now. We moved in with my grandma, it was pretty damn crammed there. Her house had 4 bedrooms with 7 people inside; my mom and I, my 2 uncles, one of their girlfriends, my cousin, and my grandma. My mother is kind of an alcoholic and so is the rest of her family... my oldest uncle and her fought a lot; normally while they were drunk. It was really bad during the school year, I would wake up at 2am to both of them fighting just over nothing... I could never figure out what the hell they ever even fought about. So because of all that waking, I would never get any sleep. Adding to the constant waking, I had to be up 5:30 everyday for school, it was hell. To combat this, I went to the doctor and got him to prescribe me some sleeping pills. I forget the name of whatever it was but they were prescription, started with a A or something. So I started taking them. On a typical night I would take about 6-7 of them... The worst night was when I took about 12, I was taking so much that I think I was developing a tolerance. I slept for almost a whole day and it was absolutely amazing... It was more of a psychological dependency rather than a physical one... I found myself thinking ""If I dont take these every single day... I'm never sleeping ever again."" Eventually, my Mom took notice and told me that Im not allowed to have them anymore. I watched her throw the pill bottle away... I was *livid*. I almost went digging through that trash can and picked up every single pill... but then I realized: ""Why am I so angry? Why am I so desperate?They're just pills. its not like I need them. Its not like I was addicted right?"" Coming off those pills was awful. It happened during the school year so I didn't sleep for like 27 hours, I was up watching YouTube for forever... luckly I finally passed out. Coming out of that was the worst thing that I think I've ever done. Realizing addiction? Its a damning click in the brain. I understand why she did what she did, but I still can't help but feel a little resentment... Fast forward about 1 year and Im here in Georgia with my Dad. Some things happened between my mom and I and I dont live with her anymore. My father has a liquor cabinet right next to the kitchen and one day I thought: ""1 taste couldn't hurt?"". But it did. It was disgusting, I couldn't think of how people were able to down this stuff like water... I wanted to experience ""being drunk"" so toughed my way through 1/3 of a bottle of Strawberry flavored vodka, then I just waited for it to kick in. To say that I was drunk is an understatement, I was was gone. I was absolute definition of *TRASHED*. My brother was at work and my Dad, step-mom, and step-brothers were in Florida on vacation. Since I was home alone, nobody saw me stumbling around everywhere. I dont remember much from that day but I remember falling down my stairs... Next thing I know I wake up on my couch at 3pm the next day, ass in the air, and with no hangover. First off I was trying to figure out what the hell happened the other day, I didn't remember a lot. Up to the point where I fell down the stairs... I was blacked. From that day on, I was drinking everyday. Not enough to get drunk, but enough to have that little happy shift in my bones. It left me with a happy feeling costantly and I am definitely not used to that... Alcohol made me happy and I didn't want to give that up; at least in no point soon. But it wasn't to last; my Dad started to notice that a lot of his liquor was missing... To be honest I wasn't even trying to hide the missing liquor, I didn't care one bit. We have cameras in the house and I guess he saw me at one point stumbling around with a bottle of something in my hand. He had this long conversation about ""the dangers of alcohol"" or whatever. It may just be my teen spirt but I didn't care about the dangers, it made me happy and I wasn't about to give that up. I told him this too. Obviously, he was not happy. As a result, he locked up his liquor cabinet and I haven't had a drink since late-July. I still crave it today, especially now. Im failing 2 of my classds and I just wish to feel happy once in a while... With my vulnerability to substance abuse, what do you think that I should do once I get out into the real world? I know that there will not be people around me who will always care, that I may be alone, no people around who would try and stop me like my parents have. The world is reeking of depravities like this and as an adult I would have the absolute freedom to discover more. How can I surpress my temptations? Solve it? What do you think I should do?"

I am a women [25y] and my best friend who is a male [29] came over for wine and food, just like any other time (even during relationships). We have been friends for 5+ years and have always had a platonic relationship, no attraction/ nothing physical. we've spent time together even while each of us were in a relationship because we both know too much about the other to want to be in a relationship. Long story short, I had been broken up with the night before and for whatever reason my friend [29] felt it was okay to try to have sex with me. He seemed forceful and then I was afraid and couldn't believe what was happening was tried by him. I lied there a minute and finally stopped what was about to happen, then moved to the couch (in the same room). Granted yes, we had a bottle and a half of wine. I was probably drunk enough to allow it, but also aware enough to know what he was about to do. This was my best friend. I couldn't sit still after what (almost) happened and angry that he tried, after the alcohol, after knowing the level of my loneliness and vulnerability. I felt betrayed by his attempt. I eventually asked him to leave that night, I didn't want to wake up to the same face, then also more upset because he dismissed his actions so easily. I've tried to contact him twice casually, with no response. I understand the friendship is over, but can someone give me someone insight as to why he responded this way? I thought I did the right thing for myself and that he would understand and apologize the next day. Or maybe he was never really the friend I thought. Idk. Did I just hurt his ego? "
206,vulnerability,Advice,Rental Situation: I don't know what is going on.,1,93lq58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/93lq58/rental_situation_i_dont_know_what_is_going_on/,2018-08-01 14:17:02,"Young 20-something here. Some time around late September 2016, I was interviewed for a room rental by my current landords. Things seemed to go well. The questions seemed general. One thing I found interesting is that landlord_1 stated that if they feel there is a reasonable risk present in the house that they may surreptitiously record in the house. From what I gather is that by signing and agreeing to rent that I consented to this condition. (This will be material later on.) Anyway, nothing so far seemed out of the ordinary. I paid and later signed a month-to-month agreement. If I recall correctly, I signed with landlord_2 that made no comment about the recording consent. I move in to the room/house sometime around early October 2016. As I become accustomed to the new place, I begin to learn about people in the houses. Landlord_2 is a professional mental health expert and Landlord_1 runs a corporation out of the house. I also come to learn that landlord_1 has had a few felonies related to their past, but, this is of no issue to me as I believe I have worked with and around felons and see no issue with them much like everyone else. An event unfolded regarding landlord_1 and his brother. I went to see how landlord_1 was doing in their office and found landlord_1 and their brother in the office. It looked like they were drinking alcohol. Landlord_1's brother seemed adamant that I come and drink with them. I declined nicely (from my perspective.) Landlord_1 said (paraphrase): ""*brother*, I don't think *tenant* wants to drink"". Landlord_1's brother stated (paraphrasing): ""Oh, I think he is going to!"" If I recall correctly, I walked away without issue. Over the course of several months (crossing over even to the New Year,) there was some family drama between landlord_1 and his brother. Involved a friend of landlord_1. Sounds like the brother of landlord_1 broke into the landlords business office (the landlord operates a corporation out of their office,) and stole some compromising documents about the brother (possibly evidence of illegal behaviour), according to the landlord. This break-in evolved into the brother leaving (although the brother seemed to leave on their own terms) and nothing to the best of my knowledge came about concerning any legal problems. The friend of the landlord (what was living in the house at the time) also seemed to have a falling out with the landlord and left the house (forced out or left on their own, I can't recall.) After that, the house seemed to become quite and peaceful. Sometime during the month of (March? 2017?) landlord_1 stated that the router reported a [""FIN Attack""](URL or something to that effect. The router (according to my landlord) said that the attack originated from my computer. I don't recall every launching any program to 'attack' any network or network-device. I did, however, tell the landlord (paraphrasing here) that I found that odd and that I had a Linux computer and that I did not need an anti-virus program to protect my computer. The landlord looked at me weird and then (from what I gather) thought that I attacked the network. Reminder: this is a corporate network. The landlord then supposedly found an [Stack Overflow](URL post that showed that a version of Linux was vulnerable to theses attacks and that (paraphrasing) I was responsible for violating their privacy and possibly hacking. They stated that if I don't install an anti-virus program on my computer that they will take me off the network. So, I installed ClamTk to my Linux computer. I informed the landlord. However; they did not come check my computer to verify. Over time, the landlord refereed to the incident to some effect as something akin to a 'mistake' or 'misunderstanding' and, (from what I can tell,) may have reminded me at one point that they saved me from the legal system. I found the whole situation weird. Considering that, if I recall correctly, the vulnerability was patched before I ever started using Linux (2013? 2014?) Over time, I began to pick up odd behaviours of landlord_1. They seemed to be constantly questioning me over trivial things like nights that I went out with landlord_1, possible their spouse, possible friends, and possible alone. Since recently, I have been developing a feeling that I am being surveilled every time I am around landlord_1. They continue to question me. In some cases, I feel like I am being drilled by police, but the police are nice and friendly. Questioned about situations and that if I can recall them correctly. I don't recall every detail about the last two years and I have a feeling that there may have been some slight changes to my memory that may have resulted in conflicting information. I have a feeling that landlord_1 is recording these possible contradictions. I can't really tell you what I have said specifically, nor can I tell you what verbal errors I have committed in the last two years. Some time around (October/November?), 2017, landlord_1 was served papers related to a no-contact order hearing against landlord_1. This caused issues and anxiety with landlord_1 as they have a felonious record. I wasn't aware of the papers until later in the night that they informed me of the papers and then began to question me if I have ever spoken to police. I 'pleaded the 5th' and landlord_1 stated that I had no 5th right to refrain from answering the question. At some point during this (rant?) about the papers, landlord_1 (threatened?/stated?) that they would (paraphrase) 'subpoena my ass' if I didn't (tell them I ever talked to the cops?)(did not go with them to court?). I don't recall exactly. If I do recall correctly, landlord_1 may have been drinking alcohol. They may have made a passing reference to ('threatening') their attorney from a previous case over putting landlord_1's brother back on the stand over some possible perjury. That kind of startled me. I have not brought that point back up to landlord_1. Sometime around (December?) 2017, landlord_1, landlord_2, and I went to (if I recall correctly,) Pizza Hut and it seemed that landlord_1 was having an anxiety episode (these seemed to be frequent.) They began to, again, question/drill me and may have stated that the comments I have made could be used in court. I don't recall exactly what was said, however, if I recall correctly, that I began to stop talking to landlord_1. (landlord_2, if I recall correctly, thanked me as the continuous talking may have contributed to landlord_1's anxiety.) I don't know what specifically triggered the anxiety episode. It seems, as time goes on, that the behaviour of landlord_1 is, well...on edge. I have no reason to believe that landlord_1 is on any drugs (only have seen them consume alcoholic/caffeine beverages to the best of my knowledge.) I also feel like I am being implicated in something although to the best of my knowledge, I haven't committed any crimes. I feel like I am becoming on edge and anxious. Recently, at work, when it becomes busy, I feel a heightened sense of anxiety with an impending sense of doom. I feel like I am about to have my life thrown away in a jail cell, implicated on some crime that I never knew I committed. My mind begins to fantasize of courtroom hearings with my landlord laying random charges against me and me losing my life. I feel scared. If I recall correctly, landlord_1 mentioned something about ('files'?) related to everyone they have rented to. So, I don't know what's in my 'file'...if it even exists. Landlord_1 may have mentioned in the past that they are a member of the press and that anyone who wrongs 'them' (I am assuming both landlords' 1 and 2) that they can put up a website dedicated to whatever facts that they have against the offending individual. Apparently, it is neither libel nor slander. Landlord_1 seems to possess a strong sense of justice and that any wrong perceived is seen as a massive slight against landlord_1. From my perspective, it seems like every time there is an issue that landlord_1 becomes fixated on said issue. Example: there was a tenant that, if I recall correctly, put in their last month's notice. According to landlord_1, this tenant may have changed their reason for leaving multiple times. One of those times, supposedly, was in front of me. landlord_1 asked this tenant why they were leaving. The tenant gave a response. (I forgot what it was.) Later some time, landlord_1 seemed to insist that (paraphrasing) I was a (victim?) of lying and that what happened was egregious to landlord_1, landlord_2, and I. Looking back, honestly, I couldn't care less as whatever this tenant said does not affect me negatively in any material way that I can think of. Landlord_1 has a policy of (paraphrasing) 'consistency is key.' In that, their behaviour is consistent to their best ability. It seems that way (except when landlord_1 has anxiety or may have consumed much alcohol.) While on the surface there may be some consistency, there are some discrepancies that I cannot seem to solve. For instance: I don't recall ever telling any of my landlords or any tenants of my porn consumption habits. Honesty, it is none of anyone business. Yet, if I recall correctly, landlord_1 made a passing reference to my porn consumption habits. Landlord_1 also made a passing reference to 4chan. I have visited 4chan before while renting, but I don't recall ever mentioning it to landlord_1, landlord_2, or any other tenant in the house. If I recall correctly, the 4chan incident is recent (this month: July 2018.) I don't know if my internet traffic is being monitored. I don't know what to do. If I keep renting, then I feel like I am being drowned with a weight on my body, sinking. If I leave, then that will cause landlord_1 to begin (questioning?/interrogating?) me about why I am leaving. I feel that whatever answer I give will cause issues with landlord_1. I'm tired of feeling anxious over something that may or may not be an issue. I don't know why I feel anxious, but at the same time I get this sense of impending doom. I feel like I am walking on egg shells. I feel that I can't talk to landlord_1 without there being issues or feeling that I am being set-up/implicated in something. I also feel like I can't talk with landlord_2 about any concerns as well, as any concerns will be relayed to landlord_1 and possibly causing issues. I just want a place to live and be left alone. I feel like I am being set-up, for God knows what. I can't think of anything that I have done wrong, but from talking with landlord_1, they seem to possess a vast knowledge of law. Using this knowledge may be instrumental against me if I ever do anything wrong. I have no intent of harming anyone. I want both my landlords to feel comfortable and happy that they are renting to me. They both are cool! It's just that, I feel there is something wrong and I can't put my finger on it. I hope that I am just imagining everything. How should I approach this situation? I don't know what is going on and I don't know what is going to happen in the future. Should I be worried? I'm beginning to feel my life is over."

I developed very strong feelings of love for him, more than I have ever felt in my life. Of note, he was previously diagnosed with severe autism as a child but his parents denied it. You can tell by his mannerisms and behavior there is some social difficulty involved. I found it very endearing that he chose me to confide in. Even though I am a very social and seemingly confident person, I am riddled with insecurities. He said he didn't reciprocate, and has since moved on. I know there isn't any point in dragging the past, but I always wonder if any part of him wanted more than friendship. I don't know too many men who would invest that kind of vulnerability and time.

212,vulnerability,Advice,My friend keeps telling me over and over again that we're not dating and he doesn't want to date and it's getting really annoying. He's also behaving oddly in other ways. How do I convince him that I'm not trying to do that?,5,8mpg29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8mpg29/my_friend_keeps_telling_me_over_and_over_again/,2018-05-28 21:41:13,"We're just friends (I'm 27F he's 23M) but we have slept together a few times (always initiated by him only). And I know he finds me very physically attractive (and has said so). He's told me two or three times out of the blue that he's not ready for a relationship (he didn't connect it to me, but seemed to be saying that generally). He's also repeated several times over awhile that we are just friends, and other times seems to emphasize that we are friends (without saying just friends or whatever). He's told me over and over again that he's self-contained, doesn't want to be dependent on anyone, likes to be alone, sometimes repeatedly at the same time. The word ""we"" seems to set him off frequently. Even though I told him I say we with all my friends in the relevant contexts. We were talking about something and I said the word ""wait"" (in an appropriate context) and that set him off that he heard it as ""date."" It seems in general the smallest things will set him off. If I show a slight vulnerability that sets him off too. Even if it's an just off hand comment. Even though I told him I'm not trying to delve into my past, I'm just sharing something (usually when I talk about my past it's about the absurdity of it and self deprecating humor toward myself). When we hang out (except the times we have slept together) he acts all weird. He deliberately refuses to look at me, especially to make eye contact (he's admitted this). He tells me I make him uncomfortable and refuses to tell me why. No other friend has said this ever, even actual exes. Even though no one else in my life has an issue with my amount of eye contact he does complain about that. (He's not autistic or the like). On the other hand he usually wants to text frequently and he sends me a paragraph or two at a time. He confides in me about everything (he claims he doesn't with anyone else). I don't attach much significance to it because it was awhile ago, but he has said he thinks of me as more than friends, but then denied it, and he's come over ""wanting to love and be loved"" (but I don't put much significance because I don't think he was in the most sober state). He has tried to broach the topic of dating in a more general abstract sense (not with me or anyone in particular) and about how frustrating it can be for him. He has sent paragraphs of praise about how I'm a wonderful friend etc and more than he deserves. And occasionally he had been seemingly wanting to be emotionally closer. Those times he would gaze with puppy/sleepy eyes into mine for up to several minutes and seem very relaxed and comfortable doing so. He'd initiate deep making out and do so for hours on and off. And come for comfort (and said at that time I did comfort him) and be really torn about leaving. He has had times when he was obviously really excited to see me. Soon after we met we spent an entire weekend together even though he's an introvert and likes to be alone a lot. He said that time that usually he'd have to go for alone time but then with me. But that was a long while ago so I don't put much significance on it anymore. Anyway, I'm getting a bit fed up. And the frequent insistence we aren't dating is getting annoying to be frank. I've never asked him to date. I don't even flirt. I don't dress up for him (and I would include not wearing makeup but men have always preferred me with literally none, even when I had pretty serious cystic acne). Again any closeness has been initiated entirely by him. How do I deal with him and make sense of things? I do not want him to cut him off, if anyone was going to jump to that. "

I am freaking out because I reached out to someone who has deeply hurt me in the past and somehow I expect him to change. I didn't sleep all night. I sent him four messages in a row he has not responded to. I am going to a counselor to manage my obsessive thoughts and relationship/sex/vulnerability issues, and I'm scared that this is not a good idea for me to be in contact with this person. I want to get some sleep but I can't and I have been working very hard to be healthier in my thinking and feel like this is not going to foster that. I told him we could be friends, maybe more, but we had to spend time together first and I'm terrified he will leave and reject me again, or that I'll send him a million more messages out of anxiety that is very deep. So I contacted someone who I have had a bit of a tumultuous relationship with during the past semester. I was very needy and did pressure him a lot. However, he consistently said he wanted to have sex as fwb and it just never worked out (either he was busy or I was, and it was really annoying). He also took advantage of me a few times and asked for a lot of my notes. When I apologized fixed because we had had a texting argument and I was definitely pressuring him to have sex, then he asked for a nude pic which I sent. Today I contacted him once more because I do think I have feelings for him, and I wanted to see if he'd ever speak with me again. We had a wonderful conversation online and he said he wanted to hang out sometime when he got back since he is now out of state. The thing is that he deeply hurt my feelings last semester and I have trouble trusts by him at all. He mentioned nude pics again but then apologized. I don't know if I'm thinking about this as clearly as I should be, but he always shows up for coffee and lunch, and other stuff, if I don't really pressure him a lot. Just not for sex. I think if he actually just wanted to fuck we would have a long time ago. The thing is that I have a long history of being extremely obsessive and controlling and bombarding people with excessive attention when I like them. I did that to him for months and I'm terrified of actually forming a fairly close relationship of any kind with anyone. I'm working through my issues with a counselor, but I'm not sure if this person is a healthy friend that have, and I'm not sure if I am in a healthy enough place to manage myself and not objectify and harass him with two many texts...and it's tough not to be obsessive. My counselor said I didn't need lithium which I had been on; but we are working on changing my thinking patterns. I feel that this person had the unfair responsibility of calming me down and I don't want that to happen again but I am already wide awake sweating profusely because he hadn't texted me back after a long conversation, even though he outright told me he was interested physically at least. Just very scared and confused and maybe unrealistically hopeful? What do you think? I also just get super nervous and extremely flirtatious, and so I'm sure I have given the impression more than once that I am easy, and, honestly, I have been for a long time. Is this a good idea to even consider? I am already freaking out about it and I'm just not sure what to do at all. My counselor has said to stay single until I get myself together, and the lunch wouldn't be for two months, if ever, but I am terrified of being rejected or having it never happen, and I feel like I cannot control my anxiety and obsession right now...and I sent him something very flirty and maybe too forward and I am just overly concerned about what he thinks...He did invite me over for sex and then cancel a lot and he also asked me to bring beer to his room. I just would appreciate a second opinion, and a way to manage my thoughts and urges, and anxiety? Thanks.I said I would be fine with hanging out and then maybe if something more happened that would be okay. I can't shake the feelings of fear I am having. I haven't been able to sleep all night and he hasn't responded. What should I do?"

I've made some very little attempts at vulnerability, but I feel they just pass it off as nothing. But to me, it took my whole fucking being to actually show some personality of mine towards you that isn't fake. It's not like they're bad people. They aren't, but I am so uncomfortable being around them that it's hard for me to even think straight, because I don't want to sound like an idiot. I just feel like I'm a piece of shit, because what kind of son would want to abandon their parents because of their fear towards them? I am an adult, yes? It is my decision to do this, but I personally feel this isn't healthy for me. If I am to be vulnerable, my mom would most likely talk about it with my step-father, leaving me embarrassed and hateful at the fact I even considered trying to open up to you.

But I don't. We don't see each other often but Its like they can tell Im a fucking shell of myself and it kills me. My other mates have become teachers, police officers, photographers, or just have there shit together, and yet here I am a broken, lost cause and it kills me. I used to be a great fucking guy, now I don't even know who I am. Its like I have realised without dad I am nothing. He was a solid man with so much life experience and I am nothing compared to him even if I wanted to be, his hands are twice the size of mine etc and its like Im realising all the things he ever said to me were to protect me, and here I was always trying to be more then him. Im realising I will never make it in life, as a guitarist, graphic designer, artist, anything I ever wanted to do for the simple fact that I am not a powerful man. I used to think I was, but since Dad has gone into old age i feel nothing but vulnerability in myself. I feel like I have done nothing but lose my way since dad became old, I want to go back 10\-15 years and redo my entire fuck up of a life. I feel like I have become a complete lost soul and my future looks fucking bleak"
217,vulnerability,Advice,How do you know if you're in love with someone or just incredibly close with them?,1,8j6s9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8j6s9s/how_do_you_know_if_youre_in_love_with_someone_or/,2018-05-14 06:39:44,"Hey all, rising-junior in college here. I need advice for a problem I feel I can't approach anyone else with. So, there's this girl I'm dating. Let's call her Ridhi. This is our third time trying to date. The first time lasted three weeks, the second two months, and the third one is two weeks and going. She's a really excellent human being. She is the closest I've ever been to someone who's not my brother. I think I've been at my most vulnerable around her, and no one else has ever seen this side of me. The only person who has ever seen me cry in four years has been her. She knows nearly everything about me, and I know most everything about her, strengths and weaknesses and all. When she's not around, I feel a small feeling at the back of my head saying ""man, I wish Ridhi were here right now."" Our friendship is deep, and built on a lot of investment. My big issue though is I don't know if I'm actually in love, or even romantically attracted to her. What I feel toward her is difficult to articulate. On one hand, I've never trusted anyone as much as I trust her. I recognize in her the qualities that I find attractive in a girl. And those seem to be the requisite ideas that contribute to our traditional definition of ""love."" But much of my love for her in the romantic, ideal-wife sense is a little ""detached"" from how I actually feel. I mean that in the sense that those thoughts don't connect to produce a fiery love for her. An instance of this that pains me to even type out is that I can't see myself having sex with her. For reference, I am a Catholic who (hopes) to save myself for marriage. She's Hindu, and she has the same views on sex as I do. But I'm troubled though that I don't even have the desire to have sex with her. Don't get me wrong, I find her physically attractive and very pretty. But I don't feel that recognition of her prettiness ""translating"" with a desire for her physically. To put it another way, during the two months we were together, we never kissed. Not for lack of trying. I tried once during a movie at the beginning of our relationship, and she told me (gently) that she wanted her first kiss to be with the man who she knows she would marry. This didn't bother me at all because I knew she is a very socially conservative person. In fact, the thought of kissing her actually vanished in the remaining two months we were together. Most of what we did physically was hold hands or hug. This didn't bother me at all at the time. But that bothers me now because what if we are just best friends who hold hands? I don't know if that's something I should be worried about. To top it off, there's a second girl (let's call her Elly) I dated shortly after breaking up with Ridhi after our second go at it. And Elly's someone who I feel a passion for that extends beyond lust. She has roughly the same effect on me as Ridhi. By same effect, I'm referring to vulnerability and level of comfort. Elly is kind, loving, beautiful, and an all-around empathetic and understanding person. I broke it off with Elly when Ridhi and I had a stars-aligning talk in which we both discovered a whole new realm of vulnerability we've never experienced with each other. This experience led to us thinking that maybe the third time will be different since we're now much more vulnerable with each other. So I sat Elly down and told her I couldn't continue our proto-relationship because it wouldn't be fair to her for me to have feelings for another while dating her. She was crest-fallen, but understanding. We're still very good friends after the fact. I am extremely close with Ridhi. I consider her, at the bare minimum, one of my best friends. But I don't know if the feelings I feel for her come more from a romantic sense or a friend sense. The trouble here also is that the big difference is that I feel a passion for Elly I don't feel exactly with Ridhi. It almost feels like my thoughts of attraction toward Elly and how I actually feel are connected; while with Ridhi, those thoughts are disconnected with how I actually feel toward her. I hate that I feel this way because Ridhi is a wonderful person. I hate how I don't feel as strongly toward her as she feels toward me. And I hate how gray this whole situation is and this feeling that I'm being a terrible person. Because this sort of behavior is something members of my family -- who are all divorced and have engaged in infidelity -- would do. I don't want to break anyone's heart or take part in behavior that will hurt others. To conclude, the fundamental question I'd like your input on is whether or not the feelings I feel toward Ridhi are in fact love, or just a very deep emotional connection with a close friend. For two weeks, my head has been wracked by guilt. I've prayed about the matter, but haven't consulted anyone about this matter. What should I do? **tl;dr - currently dating a girl who I have no idea if my strong feelings for her derive either from being extremely close friends with her or being romantically attracted to her. My thoughts about her being attractive don't ""translate"" to actually feeling a gut attraction to her. I don't even have a desire to have sex with her. But, regardless, I have a great fondness for her and wish to remain extremely close friends with her regardless of what happens. There's another girl who I briefly dated who I don't have this problem with. I feel a passion for her that is not chiefly motivated by lust. She is a lovely, caring, and kind person who I can talk to for hours. I feel horrible about this situation and that I'm a terrible person. Please help.** "

Even though academically I did quite well at school I opted against university as I had no intention of what to study and was afraid of racking up a HECS Debt (Australia) to figure it out . I was always someone who enjoyed reading and gathering knowledge . Instead I did an electrical apprenticeship last year for about 3/4 of the year and although I enjoyed learning the skills I had to quit due to really pressing mental health issues /suicidal thoughts. A bit of background ; during school I had always been someone who was academically inclined with no real inclination towards the trades. However being a person who will give anything a go I decided to pursue the trade as I was unsure of what to do with my life . I enjoyed learning about electricity and the different processes involved , I didnt mind working the tools and the physical work side of it and liked the feeling of accomplishing something. However it was frustrating at times when I picked up the tool side of things slower than the theory side which came easier to me. The parts I didnt like was probably the overly macho nature at times , having to be weary not to show any vulnerability or softness at all, and lots of overtime plus working every Saturday. I would rather say work my 40 hours a week and get paid average than work 50/60+ and get paid more handsomely (just a personal choice ) . At the moment I am working a casual job 5 days a week making money . I am tossing up re-enrolling in my apprenticeship (now that my mental health issues have lightened ) or just going to Uni to try and figure out a job I may like / may be more inclined towards . Any advice would be appreciated. Please dont drop any suck it up princess or eat a spoon of concrete comments as Im not entitled or soft, just a young man trying to find some clarity. Thanks !"

I am going to open a dialog here to help me make progress on a life long, seemingly intractable problem of mine. This is long, but it all comes to bear and the investment of your time could lead to a significant scientific breakthrough. Please read the following and make note of your gut reaction along the way: This is not ego or vanity, but I am exceptionally gifted- just not in the conventional sense. I am very badly behaved, I made poor grades, maintain extremely diverse interests and I find it hard to fit in, even among other academics. My closest friends view me as being a consumate Polymath. I have a track record of being both ambitious and audacious, very often succeeding in my efforts despite people's serious doubts. I had just started my PhD before dropping out after sustaining a severe injury- which left me totally and permanently disabled. I was forced to go back to work after my wife's health started failing and it was learned she has stage-IV lung cancer. Her doctors at home said that things looked beyond their ability to manage, so were referred to MD Anderson around Sept 2016. Her new doctors there wanted to manage her cancer as a chronic condition, meaning she would need treatment the rest of her life. After learning this, we set out on our 3 hour long flight back home. My wife sorted out how to make the move to Houston and all the other logistical nightmares ahead. It's just what she does. I spent the time coming up with our battle plan. It's just what I do. I figured education was key, so I started out just learning everything I could about the disease using what I know from my undergratuate degree, a BS in Biology. I quickly came to the following conclusion: Cancer is an evolving system, so her doctor's strategy is a losing one from the start. Granted, I know it's the best available strategy with the tools he has available, but let me explain. The treatment serves as a selection pressure, so the cancer will evolve in response-eventually making the treatment ineffective. The same thing happens with bacteria in response to antibiotics- they eventually develop resistance. When the treatment becomes ineffective, they would have to try another, which the cancer would eventually evolve around too. The process would repeat until my wife is either too weak to survive the next treatment, or they exaust all available treatment options. From that point on, I realized it was a mere matter of life extension and from the looks of things, her overall quality of life during those few years would be poor. I spent the next 3 hours studying the current state of the art of cancer treatment before we got to our final destination. I wanted a treatment that doesn't require extensively detailed knowledge of the individual pathways of cancer, since that's impractical for me to learn in such a short time. I also wanted an idea that would be adaptable to an evolving system, which cancer truly is. Here is what I came up with: Of course you can skip this part if you are not interested/inclined -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In my admittedly cursory research, there seemed to be a lot of hype regarding the potential for CRISPR. In theory, you could use it to edit out mutations in people's genomes that cause cancer in the first place. I was initially excited, but upon further reading it's still too far out to reliably use. Out of curiosity, I read about the history of CRISPR and how it was discovered. CRISPR was actually discovered in bacteria, which serves as a type of immune system against invading phages. The system recognizes specific DNA sequences that the phage virii have and chops them up, effectively killing them. Then I got an idea. I could use CRISPR, but not in the conventional way that is all the rage right now. Instead of editing the genome to fix the cancer, I would use CRISPR to recognize the cancer by its unique DNA signature and chop its DNA to pieces, effectively killing it. That signature can be found by comparing the DNA sequence of cancerous cells to normal ones and targeting the differences. No need to understand all the individual details of her cancer or finding some kind of vulnerability based around that. We are just identifying cancer cells and killing based directly on their DNA sequences, kind of like painting a target for a laser guided bomb. As you will figure out later, it's more like a laser guided cluster bomb. The catch is that phage virii do not have their own repair machinery, but human cells do. Cut up the virus, it's instantly dead. If you create a single double stranded DNA break in a cell (as with most CRISPR applications,) it will just be repaired, perhaps with a mutation where a few extra basepairs are added or deleted. My idea is that if multiple dsDNA breaks are made simultaneously, the cell won't be able to repair the damage before its next mitosis and die. This could likely happen since cancer cells are not functioning normally and likely under replicative stress. Since there are multiple targets, it will be difficult for cancer to evolve around it; if there's a mutation that makes one target sequence unrecognizable, there will still be many other recognition sites remaining. Basically a laser guided clusterbomb, right? If cancer did evolve around this treatment, it could be repeated with a new biopsy of the cancer cells. I supppose it's more accurate to mention that several cancer biopsies would have to be performed. Cancer starts off as a single cell, which metastasizes and starts forming independent colonies which start to diverge genetically. If you just sequence one colony and apply this idea directly, you will probably only kill that colony. If you sequence several, you can find sequences that every single one of them have and target those. As a bonus, this effectively reconstructs a target sequence that is more likely to hit their common ancestor, hopefully getting them all. Yet another complication arises from the possibility a cell could survive all the hits it receives. In that scenario, it would incur some kind of knockout or mutation. To handle this, my computer program would try to exclude target sequences found within open reading frames. If the cell lives, don't want to potentially make things worse right? In this case, since the mutation is incurred in essentially non-coding parts, it should be of little consequence. Then, perhaps the cell could be transfected again and die on the next attempt. It would also have to eliminate sequences that are not near a promotor site, since that's where CAS-9 grabs the DNA strand and starts sliding along to do its job. I mentioned earlier that the signature would be found using comparative genomics between full genome sequences of her healthy cells and those of her cancer cells. More specifically, I would use a computer program to find 20 base pair long sequences that are found in her cancer cells, but not in healthy ones. After that, I would have multiple gRNA/CAS-9 vector pairs synthesized that recognize those those sequences. I would need to produce enough of these vectors to serve as an infusion, since the virus particles are deliberately made incompetent (can't replicate on their own) during manufacture. Then I would transfect her cells with them and they should create multiple double stranded DNA breaks along several different spots in each cancer cell, killing them. Of course there could be complications, like her going into shock due to massive amounts of cancer cells lysing at once or having a septic reaction to CAS-9 as it's released from dying cells. I went through other possible scenarios for the remainder of the flight. So before even leaving the plane, I had come up with a sort of doomsday plan. Would I ever actually go backyard scientist on my wife? Of course not, but I will explain more about my intentions in a bit. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- End of idea description I have been sitting on this idea until quite recently when my wife's most recent drug trial lost effectiveness. Her cancer metastasized to her brain, causing a massive seizure. She needed radiation treatment to her brain and hips. Up to that point she had proven amazingly robust in spite of her condition. She was in the ER for nearly 3 weeks. She returned home wheelchair bound. We got a glimpse of just how bad things could go, and how very quickly. We were in dire straights, so one of my wife's personal friends created a GoFundMe- which I promptly shared on Reddit. Someone came to our rescue and made a donation outside of GoFundMe that allowed me to pay off all the credit cards we ran up during our struggle. Free of that interest treadmill, I now had about 45 extra minutes a day to think. I picked the idea up with where I left off and wrote down a basic protocol. I started reaching out to everyone I could with this idea ever since, Reddit, old university professors you name it. Of course I am not crazy, despite what you may be thinking. I do not intend to forge ahead blindly, go backyard scientist and actually treat my wife with this idea. What I plan to do is re-enter a PhD program somewhere and develop this idea further. It would start by getting whole genome sequences for cell line pairs (normal and metastatic) and running my script. If it returns a lot of candidate target sequences, then I go further. I would purchase commercially available cell line pairs (normal and metastatic) derived from the same patient and obtain whole genome sequences for each. I would run my script and generate target sequences specific to this cancer. Then, I would have custom gRNA/CAS-9 vectors made, probably based on lentivirus. Afterwards, I would transfect both healthy cells and cancer cells. If the cancer cells die and the normal cells live, then this idea might actually work. The idea would progress to using PDTX/mouse models and hopefully someday to clinical trials. I admit it takes a long time to develop an idea and even longer to enter phase-I trials. The likely outcome is that my wife will perish before ever benefiting from this effort. However, I make decisions rationally and applied mathematical thinking commonly used in the insurance industry. There is a small chance her doctors can manage her condition long enough for this idea to make it to trial (should it prove viable.) The adjusted payout (a human life, extra earning potentials of kids being raised by their own mother/experiencing less emotional trauma, estimated monetary value of human life in general, lots of factors) of this event given this probability is high enough that it warrants the investment by a fair margin. Further, should things not go as I hoped, this research might benefit people just like her. There's a chance this idea will not work and a lot of time and money would be wasted. I intend to mitigate this risk by successively vetting out this idea through the most cost effective path possible. In this case of course, the first step is virtually free- obtain WGS from tumor pairs online (probably from NCBI website) and run my script. Vetting the rest of my idea might be expensive, so I have been reaching out to people once in my academic circle so I could possibly exploit the resources of a major university. I have also been asking for feedback on my idea to avoid wasting time on it should it be fundamentally unworkable. Here's a typical response (this one being from one of my past advisors): ""Hi, Josh, I dont mean to discourage you, and I know nothing about this stuff, but for what it is worth, I did ask and I get a lot of dont bother me with this body language from the people I asked. Generally speaking, Id guess that someone without an extensive professional training and research experience in the area is unlikely to come up with an idea after a few hours of reading up on cancer that many, many people who are devoting their careers to this problem somehow missed. An equivalent of this in my field may be as if someone without an extensive professional training and research experience in the area comes up with an explanation for the dark energy after spending a few hours reading about it; chances of that would be extremely close to zero. Your call, but maybe there is something more likely to help in some way that you can devote your time and energy to. Sorry to be so brutally honest, but I would not be doing you a favor otherwise. *name redacted*"" He didn't share any specific objection his colleagues in the cancer field could have offered, just same vague statement on my lack of qualifications and the audacity of thinking a mere mortal like me coming up with a new idea. Others have expressed that they feel this is obviously just a sad coping mechanism. They chide me, saying I should devote all my energy just making my wife comfortable until she dies. My wife and I have had very painfully honest, open discussions about the bigger picture, including considerations of quality of life/supportive roles and care. I can't adequately express how deeply patronizing other people's reactions have been. My wife and I are both adults feel this could be a worthwhile investment of our time. Given our circumstances, we would have to make a number of adjustments before I re-enter a PhD program. I would have to arrange for daytime assistance for my wife while I am at school, daycare for the kids, make arrangements at work, etc. I do not want to upheave our life before thoroughly vetting out this idea. Doing so would demonstrate the merits of my idea and garner more support from the people I need. Further, given my lackluster 2.97 GPA at the time I dropped out, having positive experimental results might help to compensate for being so unconventional. Now, in addition to your reaction to everything above, please share your thoughts/insights on this: All I wanted is to just vet out this idea, all I really asked for is very specific feedback on where my idea might encounter challenges, or prove fundamentally flawed. I just described people's reaction to me and my idea at present. Surely some of you just had the same reaction. Since my idea was not brought down on its merits, it feels like I am coming up against prejudice. How do I overcome this? Right now my current strategy is to forge ahead, run a simple experiment and publish the results on my own. It's going to be such a hard road. Who knows if a publication from an independent will ever be accepted due to the same kind of prejudice. This is pretty much the story of my life. I come up with ideas that people think are utter garbage or overly ambitious (for a guy like me) right up to the point I actually pull it off. When I do pull it off, the typical reaction I get is 'meh.' I never hear 'sorry for doubting you.' Certainly having a track record of pulling off difficult undertakings in itself is not working for me. It doesn't make people less likely to doubt me in the future. Granted, this does not include my personal, lifelong friends- but they do not have the resources I need. I am not sure how to convey my achievements in the short time outsiders make up their mind about me. My best guess is that people's first impression of me is that I am a naive dilettante. I do appreciate honest feedback, but please be kind and understand this is not easy for me. It is not in my nature to reach out and ask for help like this, but I am having to do it more and more lately. Prior to this life shattering event, I had done quite well being extremely independent. I used to help people more than they helped me and loved being in that role- now I feel like a black hole of need. Still I think this is an opportunity to grow and strike a balance and I hope the good people here can help."

I'm completely unmotivated, feel nothing (though I can make myself cry which feels nice) bored and completely disinterested in everything and everyone, plus really negative about everything. Obviously, if I allow myself to be this way and if I think very negatively it makes me more tired and retreat more and it's like a vicious cycle.

It is almost a universal law that things ""will get worse"" before they get better... and I put that in quotation marks because it is only PERCEPTION that makes them seem worse, when in reality, when you switch to a positive state of mind, everything suddenly starts working in your favor... but it is in the beginning that things seem to get worse. Some examples of this would be having a heightened feeling of vulnerability, not being able to fully concentrate... etc... I read that this is because your mind is adjusting to the new ""vibration"" (for lack of a better term) and since one will start to attract different things, one will feel quite uneasy from time to time... So basically even though I'm starting to become more positive, I've been getting some anxiety and (very small) feelings of vulnerability often lately. I KNOW they're a part of the process and that everything works itself out at the end... but I would very much really appreciate some advice on lowering my anxiety because adjusting to this new state of mind really can put one on edge at the beginning of their transformation. A big thank you to everyone who responds. Take care!"

I dont know if this is the right place to go, but this has been on my mind for a long time and I think I need help. A few months ago, my girlfriend was raped. We had an argument, and she left. In the midst of an anxiety attack (over the argument) she went to the house of a friend. He took advantage of her vulnerability, drugged her, and let another man rape her. The legal situation is over, theyre going to jail, but I still dont know what to do. Shes still healing, and Im doing the best to comfort her through it, and do whatever I can to maintain a normal relationship, despite it. Because of course it doesnt change anything between us. And Im especially not expressing any of **this** with her. But somehow Im still bothered. For one, I cant help but feel at fault. After our argument, I didnt call or text her for an hour because I didnt think shed want to hear from me. If I had just called her, she might not have gone there. Or if I hadnt engaged in a stupid argument in the first place. I hate that it bothers me, to any degree. I love her so much and nothing could ever change that, but I still think about it. The image of that happening. I dont know what to do. I hate myself. And I hate that when SHEs the victim I even have the capacity to be upset. Someone else had my girlfriend and I hate it. I feel selfish for feeling that at all, but I do, and I just want it to stop. She feels less like mine (not in a possessive way) but I know thats not true. I love her and I want it to stop. How do I make it stop"

230,vulnerability,Advice,What should I do about these friends?,2,7oqvyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7oqvyg/what_should_i_do_about_these_friends/,2018-01-08 01:40:45,"I am 23, from Ontario. In high school I met a group of people who I bonded with because we were all mentally disabled, we were all fat, none of us showered, we were in Special Education together, we were all told by the school district that we couldn't do Uni and had to chose retail or trades, we used to game, and we got bullied alot. So we formed our own clique, it had 20 of us in it originally, 15 by graduation, and 4 now. I've since cleaned up my life, lost 150lbs and started Crossfit training sculpting the muscular athletic body I wanted, I shower every day, sometimes twice a day, and keep up with the latest men's fashion trends. I don't game much anymore, except on GTA Online after school and work, where I cruise the backroads while eating supper and watching youtube. I've developed an interest in Judaism despite being catholic, and plan to soon volunteer with the Chabad in Toronto. I also on a whim signed up for University taking food science, and began getting 80's, imagine that, eh? After this semester I have to move to Toronto and decide what to do with a few friends. These friends talk about change but incite it, they just sit around in their grandparent's basement talking about glory days of high school, in our crime-ridden small racist town. Friend 1, BFF: My first friend, Cate is my best friend. In high school, she was the girl who never cared what anyone thought, never washed her hair nor wore makeup, and would make-out with anything that moved. We bonded because neither of us had friends for the first semester of grade eight. After grad, I moved up to work at a gas plant deep in the Alberta woods for 4 years and when I got back she'd developed Bipolar Schizophrenia and was in a mental institution. She was so lost she couldn't make coffee. I've stuck with her for a few years, helped her get back on track, but here's the negative side. She is the type of person who'll invite you to dinner to thank you, order an extravagant feast, then ask for your debit card to pay. In facts, she won't talk to you if there's no money in your account. She told me she's gonna go off her meds if I delete my facebook and has bounced between halfway house and halfway house doing everything to get thrown out. I think of her as a brother, but while I've grown she hasn't. She tags me in posts I don't want people to see and refuses to untag me, she lies to her guardian expecting me to lie as well, and when I don't she refuses to talk to me. Friend 2, Cates brother Liam: Liam has always been big, biggest of our group, that's nothing negative though I'm just trying to paint a picture. In high school despite him being a Final Fantasy geek with no dating history to speak of everyone wanted to be him, he was the mayor. He still is sort of, whenever he posts something everyone will like it, 40 people average per post, sometimes his whole friend's list. He's always had these wild mood swings, he'll turn on a dime to be the most abrasive, callous, reprehensible guy. There'll be times where he'll tell his sister and me to f off for months at a time, then message us out of the blue to hang out and if I don't I'm considered a jerk, and if I don't forget the months of him leading us I'm also a jerk. He talks about going to Toronto with me, but constantly says wait 2 more years, it's not the right time for him. He's been a stocker at Superstore for the past 14 years. He's also a competitive and award-winning Marvel Vs Capcom player. In a moment of personal vulnerability, he asked me to get him in shape, to motivate him, help him with his mental health, and I have been for years and nothing come of it. Rhett, Friend 3: Rhett is Liam's best friend, and he's by far the most baffling of our group. He went to Toronto way before me, earned a degree in Indigenous Studies and began teaching it. He has people who love and respect him. Yet he'll constantly call in sick and drive 5 hours to our small crappy town to have an all-nighter with Liam where they eat fried chicken and rap whatever new game is out. He'll book a three-week vacation to hang out in Liam's grandpa's basement that smells like piss and mould and play Overwatch rather than his apartment which I can guarantee is nicer. He's also the one who's always commenting that he doesn't recognize the version of me that emerged from my fat. He doesn't understand why I shower or wear American Eagle clothing rather than Loblaws brand, why I go to CrossFit, and why I don't really game. He also has his mood swings, if he's down and Liam wants to spend time with Cate and I he'll demand they go to Ottawa and leave us in the dust. I don't know why... They've said if I move they'll still load up the car and contact me out of the blue for a night of heavy drinking which, I don't drink, and I'm sure I won't have time for. I'm hoping to make new friends, and will going to school full time, and working, and volunteering at the Chabad, so I don't where they'd fit into my new life. I will miss them but I've tried as hard as I could to motivate them, I dunno, I'm unsure, that's why I'm asking here."

I've read through the rules and tried my best to adhere to them; please let me know if I've breached protocol in any way. My sister is one of the kindest people I've ever known. She never thinks or speaks badly of anyone. She's universally trusting, to a fault. She has all the character traits that would make her a wonderful friend for anyone, but her social anxiety absolutely cripples her. She was harassed and tormented relentlessly throughout high school, which permanently shut her off from the idea of connecting with new people through conventional means. I should also mention that she's attracted solely to women, and only recently became outspoken about it to me and our parents. We're loving and accepting of every facet of who she is, but her anxiety prevented her from being ready to share that part of herself with us until fairly recently. Anyway, she moved out of my parents' home at the age of 27, just a few months ago. Throughout the last couple years of living at home, she began to develop an unhealthy obsession with wanting to meet and connect with people online. She would search Apple's app store for chat room/meetup/dating apps, make accounts for all of them, and broadcast her loneliness to the world, hoping for a kind soul to reach out to her. Of course, being the steaming cesspools of sexually-starving creeps that they are, her use of these apps attracted countless predators and manipulators, posing as women and pretending to also be autistic, bisexual, etc. in order to gain her attraction and trust. This inevitably led to her being told to record herself doing things she didn't understand, sexual pictures being exploited from her, etc. When I got wind of this behavior and what was taking place, I spoke with her at length about what was really going on, who these people really were, and all the more common and obvious tactics employed by your typical online incel. I then told our parents about it, and they handled it gradually and carefully. After a few apprehensive weeks, we felt confident that she understood exactly what happened, and how dangerous and toxic those environments can be for someone of her vulnerability. Fast forward months later to today, and my sister happily announces to me that she once again 'met a girl online.' She shared a picture of the girl with me, which I reverse searched immediately, and it's (obviously) yet another fake sent by some creep trying to sexually manipulate my sister. What do I do? What can I do? It absolutely infuriates me that this sort of behavior can go on without any sort of consequence, and it makes me fear for my sister. Where is the line between ensuring her well-being, and getting in the way of her life? Thank you in advance for any advice anyone has to offer. It's extremely distressing for me to know that I can't trust the rest of the world not to look at my sister and see someone to be exploited for personal gain."

I'm female and straight. I feel terrible about having this urge and it has really led to a lot of shame and guilt and anxiety for me around males, especially males I really like and sometimes have a crush on. I have had an experience of being verbally abused a long time ago and have had a few bad experiences with males. I often feel disrespected and taken advantage of, but, I guess the other side of that is that I often do not respect a male's boundaries if he says no, although I'm getting better, and I have a deep desire to verbally abuse him...How do I get over this very strong urge that has become an addiction for me? I have only ever done this very purposefully online, but I do slip a few times in person which has really not helped my relationships and had negative effects on friendships. How can I raise my self esteem and get over this desire of mine? I'm almost certain it's because of anger and a fear of vulnerability? I don't want a relationship any time soon, maybe not ever, but I really want to change this part of myself so that I can become more relaxed and healthy."

I was kind of interested in where things might go, Ive never been with anyone before but lets just say I was interested. But within like four days it escalated way quickly, he was sending nudes and I sent them back and it was just weird. Like I was really excited about it, I asked him if he wanted to do something sometime and he said hed be down, but it was going really fast and out of nowhere and something just seemed off to me. Then he randomly just stopped being so talkative, he didnt flirt back nothing. So I asked one of our mutual friends about it, and she said from the get go that something wasnt right and that he was messing with me. She said he liked power and control and that he had no intention of ever being with me, but something was off with her so I didnt take her word for it. Yesterday I texted him what class he was in and if he could leave it for a few minutes to talk to me. I knew perfectly well he was at lunch cause Id just seen him but asked anyways and he said he was in history and couldnt leave. So that night I sent him a snap and asked him what the hell was going on. He responded saying that he didnt think things would work out between us because it was damaging our friendship and that I avoided him in the halls. I told him I was worried he was toying with me and wasnt sure how to talk to him about it. Then he said he wasnt sure how he felt about me, that this was a mess and that we should forget about it. Something just screamed bullshit to me so I was like well maybe we should talk about it and he finally fessed up. Apparently he likes a girl and is planning on getting with her, that having stuff with me would complicate things. I asked him what he had wanted from me to begin with and he responded simply I wanted to see how youd react. At that moment I was just done with it, I told him it was all fine but then he had to go and say Good, friends. That got me thinking and I responded and said that I couldnt see how we were since he did toy with me and a friend wouldnt do that. He blocked me on snapchat right after that. Needless to say hes not my favorite person and Im so unbelievably angry right now. He took advantage of every vulnerability I had and exploited them and thought he could just weasel his way out off it. Honestly I didnt really have feelings for him, I just wanted to have fun, but the fact that he thinks he could just screw with me and get away with it just infuriates me. I want to be mature about this and prove that Im the better man but at the same time I cant just let him get away with this no consequences. What do I do here? How do I deal with him? "

People who I don't feel much of a connection with, yet am equally extremely close to. Who know a lot about me, who see me quite often but who I feel if it came down to it, I would be the last person on their list to think about. I don't have a mom, I don't have a dad, I don't really have anyone who exists on that level. Who, if a hurricane hit, would say let's go check on her house. Or if I didn't show up to work one day, let's go see how she's doing. Or if I didn't answer the phone, do you think she's okay? If I died, my neighbors would say she was quiet and kept to herself. But what am I supposed to do, knock on your door with some cookies? I'm 25 years old, not 90. I just feel so isolated from the people who are in my life and to bluntly put it, like no one actually gives a shit. I once told someone I would rather die at work, that way I would be around people instead of rotting away in my apartment. Nearly every hour of my day is accounted for, and I value my alone time so it isn't like I'm alone or lonely. I just have a hard time being intimate with people, trusting my vulnerability with people, and feeling connected with those who I call my friends. Someone can hug me and say I'm like a sister to them and I feel nothing. So I don't know what to do but I feel like I need to change some things. Its like having a pair of socks, but wearing them on your hands. I have relationships with people, but I'm not really investing in them the way that I should be. Everyone goes home to their families at the end of the day, or over the holidays and I go home to an empty, dark house to feed my cat. I love my cozy little home, but there's something missing. And I can't just snap my fingers and build my own family. So again I guess, wtf do I do. I took a sick day off work just to wallow, I mean this really affects me, this feeling of emptiness and hoplessness and lack of intimacy. It makes me turn to all the wrong things, and I quit drinking about 5 months ago so it cant be alcohol anymore. Sometimes it's the wrong men and dysfunctional relationships. Sometimes it's allowing depressive episodes to swallow me. Sometimes it's working 7 days a week and only allowing myself 6 hours to sleep.

He seems sad, but I understand why after speaking with him. A lot of his so called friends are no longer, and for the longest time he had been investing in a small network of friends given he had such a shitty family life. I totally understand, we bond over these factors. Fast forward to diner and he wasn't talking much so I tried to change topics onto news and events. They seemed to peak his interest but suddenly he turned everything onto me and asked me about life. I figured it was important to share something personal with myself to maybe encourage him to want to share the same since of vulnerability. ( Only because I spread awareness about Lymphedema! I have a rare condition and unfortunately i'm not rich so when push comes to shove I sometimes prioritize life before my health. It's too expensive to upkeep, and the surgery I need isn't being covered by my insurance. ) I shared with him my struggles with my third appeal i'm working on in my last attempt to get my insurance to cover it. I refuse to give up but I can't prioritize this surgery next to rent and other expenses. Then randomly he offered to pay for my surgery, it's around a 10k procedure !!!! I immediately told him no, for various reasons but most importantly...I just can't accept that from anyone. This is my burden and I know it's difficult but I can try, and I will fight. He insisted I allow him to do this because he feels like it's worth it for being the person I am. I wanted to cry, but not because he was offering but because I know and I feel like it's so wrong for him to offer this. Not in his current state, it just hurts to have something so close in your reach and to reluctantly turn it down. Despite my third refusal he insisted I accept and if I didn't comply he'd write me a check and leave it up to me in the end. I'm in a stupor, I know I need this surgery but I do not want it on the wrong grounds. I feel like he needs someone, help maybe because our last conversation had me feeling as if he were almost saying goodbye. He kept mentioning 30 days....

With the recent reports of celebrities sexual assaulting others though, I've remembered an event from my past that I'm questioning. This was maybe about four or five years ago. I was at a friends house for a small gathering of 3. Just hanging out, chatting and smoking weed. I was somewhat attracted to one of the guys there (I am also male, and we'd been friends for a wee while) who at one point talked about something going on in his personal life (can't remember what), and he seemed to be emotionally vulnerable in that moment. I am a naturally caring person, so I sat beside him and put my arm round him for a supportive hug. While it was genuinely to show support, a part of me was hoping that it said ""Oh, look how supportive I am. Please notice me."" The hug then ended and nothing else happened. My issue is that with the recent discussion of what sexual assault is, would this technically come under that banner? I should also point out that his behaviour that night could have been emotional vulnerability, being more intoxicated than I was, or a mixture of both. I'm not worried about being exposed or anything like that, because he probably doesn't even remember the event. This is more of a moral questionability. Any input would be appreciated. Thanks."

He used to confide in me by sharing his conflicts with other friends and complain about them behind their back. I used to find it a bit wrong for him to do so especially since some of them were his proclaimed ""close/best"" friends but at the same time, I can't help but feel honored that he is sharing his inner struggles with me. I think that the fact that he is willing to share his moment of vulnerability and emotions with me made me feel closer to him. However, recently, we have been having conflicts. And I realized that he has been doing the exact same thing to me. He has been bitching about me to a fellow classmate, telling him about the conflicts between both of us and complaining about me. He would talk at lengths with that classmate about our conflict and bitch and demean me. Later, when I talked about the conflict with him and try to apologise and resolve it, he gave me very positive replies, indicating that it's over. However, just when I thought we have settled it, the next time we have an argument, he would raise all the previous instances again and blame it all on me, giving me the impression that he wasn't ever really okay with the way they ended and despite the ""resolution"", have always been harboring discontent and resentment behind my back. After I knew that he was talking badly about me behind my back, I confronted him. However, while he admitted to doing so, he defended himself saying that he's merely ""asking for advice"" and not to term it as ""bitching"". It doesn't help that the person he is talking badly about me to is a mutual friend, who is gradually turning cold towards me. I am not sure how to face my friend who has been bitching about me nor my mutual friend. On one hand, sometimes, I feel sad about the lost friendship and feel like patching it but on the other hand, when I think about how he has been bitching about me behind my back and yet refusing to admit it, it made me feel like I cannot trust him anymore. I am also worried about losing other friends if he continues bitching about me. So far, my strategy is to avoid conflicts with him anymore to not give him any fodder for bitching about me. But it seems like the damage is already done as my mutual friend is being more distant and avoiding conversations with me. "

It's not meant to offend anybody but I just can't get behind altering my state of mind and putting myself in a state of vulnerability.

Everyone around me drinks or does drugs and it makes me feel crazy for having such a different opinion.

Of course, there was the consoling and venting afterwards that lasted a week, and after some time, he started to slowly get over her. Among all of the emotional vulnerability, he mentioned how he wants to get back with her, and is wanting to in the near future. Alright, this is expected. They were really close and were basically soulmates after 3 months, so I can see how he wants for them to be a thing again. But they can't in the meantime because Johnson's financial and personal issues caused the breakup, so it shouldn't be happening anytime soon. However, my other friend (Bry) received a message from her a couple of weeks ago that read that she's absolutely done with him. Now, I was confused as to why she said that seeing as how she also said that they wanted to get back together in the future. After some talking with Bry and Johnson, it was because of how Diaz ignored her wishes to stay friends as she got her life sorted out for the next 2 years. He tried and tried to get back with her and even attempted to get a plane ticket to meet up with her. She didn't find this pleasant because of how desperate he seemed to keep the relationship. Neither of us have told him that it's done and that she's moved on from him, and we don't think that it'd be a great idea. I brought this up now because he's starting to mention how if he doesn't ever get back with her that he may as well just die. I chalked it up to being a bit over-dramatic, but he's *really* starting to make me worry due to how confident he is that they'll get back together while Johnson doesn't want anything to do with him. He doesn't know about the messages and we don't want him to keep chasing a girl who is already long gone and in the middle of a rut. But we also don't want for his heart to break even more if we tell him the truth about how she feels after this whole mess. Sorry if this was too long; I felt that if I were to make it shorter, it would be missing details in order to give me some advice on how I should handle the situation. I just want my friend to be happy, but reading him those messages might just make everything worse. So, here is what I need advice on: * **Should I tell him about the messages and her ultimate feelings towards him?** * **How can I console him further about a breakup that's already a few months old?** * **And how am I going to reassure him that there'll be other girls and that he needs to work on himself as well?** Again, this was perhaps too lengthy, but any advice on the situation would be greatly appreciated."

Because of the fact that we're contemporaries age-wise, we have developed a tentative friendship. About a month ago we were at a bar, talking about relationships and he mentioned that his ex-girlfriend ""fucked [his] head up"" and that his parents think he drinks too much. At the time I didn't press him on it because I didn't want to be intrusive, but we shared tales from therapy and did some light delving into our respective baggage that evening. Last week during my lesson he again raised his parents thinking he drinks too much, that he justifies it by saying he ""just likes to have fun"" and that it makes his mother worry. After the lesson he said he was going to go and buy booze, and conceded that he does drink too much. I didn't really know what to say, but it's left me feeling concerned for his general emotional wellbeing. I told him to look after himself, but this week he's been playing on my mind. I have a lot of empathy for him, and I don't think I can sit by and just witness his pain as a bystander. I'd like to let him know that when he says ""I just like having fun"" in the same sentence as ""my parents think I drink too much, but I try and find the positives in problems"" I hear ""I find it hard to enjoy life without alcohol, and the people who love me are starting to have concerns"". And when he says ""I really do drink too much"" while going out to buy alcohol, I hear ""I'm starting to think that this might be a problem but I'm not sure I'm ready to fully admit it, to allow myself to be vulnerable, but I'm testing the waters by telling you because you seem like a person who might understand"". My question is, how do I let him know that it is safe to show that side of himself to me without being intrusive or putting him on the defensive? What would be the best way to say ""I am a willing ear should you find yourself wanting to talk about how you really are""? I don't want to come across like I'm overstepping the boundaries of our relationship, which I'm aware is built on the premise of him teaching me something and me paying him for that service. I can't help but care, and if he is working through some stuff and has allowed himself to show a little bit of vulnerability to me I want to encourage the process of him exploring his ability to be vulnerable. It's so important to have concerns about mental health well-received by the people you reveal them to, and I just want to do my best in this situation to nurture his willingness to reach out. TLDR; my music tutor and I are sort of friends, he's suggested to me that he might have a drinking problem, how do I let him know that I hear him and I give a shit without overstepping? Thank you, lovely redditors"

My father's mother is dying. My grandmother is 95 years old and suffered a major stroke on Monday and has been in the ICU since then. Her condition has been erratic, but we think it is improving. The most important thing to my dad is that his family is functional, despite the fact that we are far from that. I am seeing the disillusionment occur in front of him in a time of intense vulnerability. I think he's realized that he hadn't spent as much time as he wanted with his mother, and now he feels like he is losing the opportunity to try and make it up. On Saturday morning, my uncle and aunt decided to take my grandmother off of her breathing tube and take the chance that if she could breathe on her own, we would continue treatment, and if she could not, she would pass (they signed a DNR). My father disagreed, and I did as well. My grandma is continuing to breathe on her own, thankfully. But my father is broken by the disagreement with his brother and sister. He has other siblings overseas, but he doesn't feel they care much, so it is more disheartening that the family he has here in the States is divided. In light of the realization he had about his mother, he is realizing that he never spent much time with me or my brother growing up (he's admitting it all to me and it's hard to know what to say back). We had just flown in from out of state (different states). And when we got home from the hospital last night, my brother and I got into a fist fight. He had been upset about something trivial (internet speed) and was taking it out on my mom, and I had no patience for it so I told him to 'Stop being shitty' and before I knew it we were fighting. (I think we've only ever physically fought twice ever). I think seeing my grandma on her potential deathbed, made it all the more important for me to be there for my own mother. I didn't want to have regrets like my dad was having, maybe I was being rash and petty. It was an emotional day. For context, I am 25, my brother is 29 (so basically we are supposed to be grown-ass men, but we're acting like boys). There are a whole host of things I don't want to tell everyone about where we are in our lives. But when I left him up off his back, he grabbed a pair of scissors and said he was prepared to gut me. We exchanged more words, and he eventually said, ""I let him down when I wouldn't reciprocate the same brand of loyalty"" that he gives me. There's a lot of shit that is one-side in my brotherhood that I don't need to get into, but he just claims to be prepared to 'take the wrap' for me if I ever did anything that would land me in jail (I don't intend to be going anytime soon.) To which, I told him, I would not 'take the wrap' for him, he hasn't earned that from me. I've apologized to my brother, and he's said sorry to me, but that he doesn't see me the same way anymore. I don't know that I can change that, or really care to for my sake. I don't think that my opinion of him has changed much. I've always accepted that he is a bit crazy and let it be. Forgive and forget. But for the sake of my dad, I want it to be better. And when my dad had seen the whole thing unfold, he really broke, he realized that his nuclear family was broken as well. We went for a drive after, and he sounded really suicidal. He said ""I can't continue life like this. I hope I pass before my mother."" I've never seen him like this, it's hard to watch your dad unravel like this. My dad has been crying his heart out all week, and I thought I came to support him through this more than just see my grandmother for the potentially the last time, hopefully not. But I feel like I've only made it worse. I want to see my dad through all this, and I know there's no immediate fix, but what can I say or do? **TL;DR: My grandma is dying, my aunt, uncle, and dad can agree on what to do. I came home to try and support him, but made it worse because of my relationship with my brother. My dad is realizing that life is short, regretting a lot of decisions, and that he is powerless in all consequences of all of them at this point. I need help in how to make him less sad.**"

Things seem pretty close to perfect at times as well. However, I've felt myself have a massive personality change and its all because of how i want to be for her. I've lost my old values, old character etc. She's an extremely insecure girl and I honestly want the best possible thing for her. The sad thing about this is she describes me as the best thing for her. To an extent i believe this as well, we've pushed through a lot of mentalities together. Sadly in doing this i've gone from aspects of being a mentally strong individual into many aspects of vulnerability. Although, for the past week I haven't stopped thinking about how I could work on myself again to gain back the sense of independence. I can feel myself getting more and more impatient with the relationship but none of this is because of her. My problem is I can't bring myself to even think about leaving her, I know she needs me and quite frankly I feel like I'd be lost without her. Even that in itself is clingy and It's just slowly what I've become. I just need someone else's perspective on this. It's made me feel pretty shitty and upset."

I've had self-esteem issues my whole life which take up a lot of time in my days. In the past four years I've been dealing with emotional problems and have had a pretty decent lot of episodes, thinking people were following me and wanted to find me and kill me. This has been going on for a while and as a result I've been generally all over the place and it shows in my face that I am not a happy girl. So having extremely low self-esteem and working in restauration, I've delt with a lot of egotistical assholes who always need to assert their dominance on top of my own. I had this colleague who always put me down in his energy and this weighed on me for months. I got fired from my last job because I wasn't grooming to the standards they wanted (I understand why, I wasn't dirty or anything but I was behind the times on fashion and believe it or not it's important in restauration). Now I have to deal with this girl who I work with who also is a bitch young latina, who is enjoying spending her time trying to make me feel like shit about myself since we had an argument over a mistake she had that she blamed on me. Wherever I go people are like this with me. When I went in Naples with my sister a bunch of teenage boys were screwing with me in the metro, and I had no idea how to deal with this, my sister ignored the issue completely and it was super embarrassing. These people have to be above someone else so they smell my vulnerability and pick me as an easy target and try to fuck with me out of pure boredom. And I feel enraged. How can a fucking 20 year old girl make me feel like this? How can a bunch of adolescent boys make me feel lesser? I'm starting to despise people for being such superficial assholes. When someone shows the slightest attitude of ego-driven superiority I get filled with uncontrollable anger. It shows in my face and it really pleases the people who are pushing my buttons. I'm getting fantasies of giving them DMT so their ego dies and see how much of a joke they are. But that would be evil so of course I would never do such a thing. The fantasy still plays itself in my head and it makes me feel weirdly powerful I've been working so hard to let it go, every day I do some breathing exercises to ease the emotion because all emotions pass, but I still am left with a bitterness against people because they are so fucking shallow and don't give a shit about being dicks to whoever isn't like them. I just don't know what to do and how I can change my energy so that people respect me. What can I do to assert myself so I get just respected as a normal human who will stand up for themselves and won't let anyone push them around? How can I make people understand right away that if they fuck with me it won't go well? I'm also starting to resent my family because I can tell they are pushovers and they did not teach me how to deal well with assholes because they have no idea how to do it themselves. Please any advice helps."

He is a really fun and good and smart person, but has some bad habits. I share the bad habits but have got them under control. The one I need advice on, sports betting, he is down hundreds of dollars this week. He is a first year at college so he doesn't have the money to pay back. I am willing to do this but his excessive nature with gambling especially considering he doesn't have a job really has concerned me, making me worry for him that it's stressing him out and it keeps me up at night. I root for his teams and pay attention to sports I otherwise wouldn't care about. He's not a druggy, only smokes weed (a good amt) but was on spring break with a friend and they did LSD and he had a bad trip. Bad bad. I'm not sure if his friend was messing with him like he says, but he hasn't had suicidal thoughts and has not been depressed in 5 years, and he was convinced he wa a bad person and had to kill himself. We told his friend to call 911 and he was taken to the ER. He was put in the psych part of the ER, calmed down, not treated very nicely according to him and not allowed to use a phone. B/c we wanted him to be safe and thought he'd want to see us, we got a flight the next morning and were at the hospital, waiting for him when he was discharged. The doctors would not tell him we were there because they didn't want him to be surprised. He was pissed that we were there. Almost combative. His spring break vacation ended early and he came home. Our parents talked to him and I was there for much of the conversation, they said they loved him but were angry and questioned his judgement but still tried to be very loving. After such a long stressful day, my brother did not take this talk well and was very hurt and crying and comforted by my mom. My brother denied any depression or anxiety, claiming it was just a bad trip and he hadn't had thoughts of suicide since he was way younger. It was the drugs speaking not him. He is a very stubborn person though and has been arguing with my parents. He is so sure of himself. I made him even more vulnerable by writing him a letter about my problems, giving his some advice for college, pointing out his vices being weed and gambling, and also including some of the things I admire about him and that he's a great person, and having a bad trio sucks but it's no big deal. I tried to validate his feelings saying my dad being unprepared to talk about the situation led him to say insensitive things, that the people in the ER didn't treat him like a human, etc. He started to cry texting me ""I'm a shitty person"" and I went to his room. He said ""when I'm at my most vulnerable point ever you point out my two vices and tell me how to live my life.... I know it comes from a good place from you, and I know I gamble too much"" but it made him feel like shit. Later that night he was joking again and happy back to his normal self which was pretty remarkable considering the last 48 hours. So tonight he argued more with my parents, having asked them to be completely supportive in his days of vulnerability and sadness and not feeling like they did so and saying they babied him and they should know they hurt him. He hasn't been verbally apologetic, he's was being mean to them but is hurt by this experience. Back to gambling, I reminded my sister who lives out of state of his gambling habit and asked if she would help pay his debt, not because I need money but because I think we need to be working as a team. I see how hurt and sensitive he is now and can't be so tough. I addressed his gambling a little bit today after he lost more and he acknowledged this needs to be a wake up call and he needs to learn from it. He will do way less in the coming weeks. But my sister only wants to help him on the condition that he stops completely, and for her it's not about the money but she's in school for a PhD psych and wants him to get intervention of some sort if he says he can't stop. She is pretty aware of the situation but hasn't seen him and how fragile we need to be with him these days. Not that we shouldn't take a stand now and address the issue, but we just have to do so so so sensitively. And she is planning to call him tomorrow morning, and he goes back to school at noon. He can't take a bad call and shut off to me before he leaves, he still trusts me even tho he was upset I got my sister involved. It's a crazy situation. He will be fine in the long run. It was a tough few days for him, I can't imagine but he has had many remarkably good moments and been upbeat and joking with my mom even after taking gambling losses. He's somewhat upbeat and still doing things with friends which is totally important, I don't want him to feel flawed or dejected. What the fuck do I do? Thank you so much. It's been a stressful situation "

I push everyone away all the time. I can be fun and affectionate with friends, but when it's time to get close to others in any kind of prospectively intimate manner, I shut down and run away. It's easier to protect and hide than to throw myself into the wide open, unready for the disdain and rejection I'm certain will come from all directions. I'm much, much more afraid of someone saying yes to me than someone saying no. For the opportunity to let them see my heart at its most naked, give them the clearest picture of my soul only for them to realize that no, this isn't what they wanted. I'm not who they wanted and never will be. I'm very jealous of everyone who can do this so easily, people who I'm sure were given unconditional love when they were younger to show them that they'll be loved and understood despite their faults. Growing up, I was taught that if I do anything outside of what was accepted behaviour, that's it. I'm nothing. I don't know man. They say to be vulnerable, put yourself out there. They don't know that I grew up in a household where my own wants and needs and dreams and beliefs were of absolute least value, where acceptance from religious fanatics is a rare treat unless it meets the exact criteria demanded of me. At 19 years old, I personally still don't feel loved by my own parents and I don't know how to let anyone in because of it? Hm. They'll all eventually come to the same final conclusion right? Might as well save them all the trouble. I don't know. I don't know. I wish I was in love and I wish I could be free to let go. I wish I wasn't like this. Have any of you ever felt this way? Outwardly, I can say I'm conventionally ""pretty"" and nice and smiley but the furthest I can take any relationship is friendship.

251,vulnerability,Advice,Two Roads Diverged in a Yellow Wood,1,5o6sai,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5o6sai/two_roads_diverged_in_a_yellow_wood/,2017-01-16 09:11:49,"I will preface this by telling you, dear reader, that my age is a number, nothing more. I prefer the company of adults, and have always shown a level of maturity far above those of my peers. You have no evidence to support this, so I am asking you to trust me when I say I am a thoughtful and mature individual. I began working in a monotonous retail position at a restaurant and bar in June, where I met some of my best friends. I also met the 22 year old kitchen manager who began flirting with me. Thus, we embarked on a romantic entanglement. I had never and likely will never again feel emotions that strong for another person. He spoke of marriage and building a life together, and for the first time I felt an intense longing for children. He was my home, my rock, my other half I had been searching for, and I felt a sudden vulnerability and trust I didn't understand. We continued our strange relationship for about two months, until he realized I began to change my plans to accommodate him. I wanted to attend a local college over my dream school after graduation in May. He decided that it was neither responsible nor fair to influence my future so drastically, and broke it off. I suffered for the following 3 months. I saw him every day at work, and would have great difficulty holding myself together. I am not an emotional person, and typically have trouble in relationships because I refuse to show myself, so the sudden vulnerability and emotional instability was new and intolerable. I could feel he wasn't comfortable or happy either, or interactions were awkward, and on two occasions he called me just to say he was sorry. He began dating another girl we worked with, who was prettier and more age appropriate, and it was painful to watch. Nonetheless, it made her markedly worse at her job and ended poorly. Midway through November was the dramatic denouement of his career: he was fired (from a managerial position) for having two verbal outbursts. He disappeared suddenly, and I felt a little better not seeing him every day. I would still look for his car in the parking lot, I would still look for his bedroom light in the condo he shared with his cousin 500 ft from the restaurant. He wasn't present, but he was there. He found work elsewhere, but ultimately decided to move back to Chicago, where he grew up. At that point, around the 10th of December, I had swallowed my pride and my tears and was capable of easy conversation with him. I asked if he wanted to grab coffee or dinner before he left, a neutral and friendly way to disguise the closure I desired before he left. He agreed, saying he missed seeing me and would love to ""catch up"". Naturally, as the world is unfair and cruel, he left 5 days earlier than expected to avoid a heavy snowstorm. It was hard. There was comfort in knowing he was there, and suddenly the condo was always dark and I felt empty. But I can cope with anything, so the emptiness became a reminder of personal growth, a connection not as clandestine as I had wanted, but meaningful all the same. Less than two weeks ago, I woke up to an email from him saying, ""Can I ask you a question?"" ""Do you believe in soul mates?"" As I am a hopeless romantic under cynical wraps, yes, I do believe in soul mates. To know that 1073 miles away, in a new city and a new life, he was still thinking about me and what we had broke my floodgates. So, for the past 10 days, I have spent about 10 hours on the phone talking to a guy who thinks we are meant to be together. Every time, he asks me to move to Chicago after graduation, to help him open a restaurant, or to go to the Art Institute, or whatever vision occupies the moment. There is nothing I have wanted more in my entire life. But I know that the worst possible mistake I could make would be to throw away my aspirations and plans for a guy whose intentions I may not truly know. I do not know what I want from life. Other than to love, be loved, and raise honest, just, and thoughtful children. I am successful for an 18 year old. I am, to be blunt, talented. I have won awards for sculpture and ceramics, scholarships for dance, received a 35 on my ACT, and have successfully balanced two jobs and a perfect GPA. No, I have no idea what the real world is like. Yes, I know it can only get harder. My question stands thus: is moving to Chicago, pursuing a career in art or dance, or heck, even business management, and being with my proverbial ""soul mate"" the worst decision I could make? Could it work out? Or should I continue on through a state school and into a medical career that might make me miserable? What matters most? What will I regret not doing? Do you have any answers?

252,vulnerability,Advice,I feel like I am being targeted personally from my manager at my job.,1,5g0yjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5g0yjz/i_feel_like_i_am_being_targeted_personally_from/,2016-12-02 14:07:23,"I've been working at my job for about a year. I work at an eyeglass facility and I have two certifications where I'm certified in glasses and contact lenses. I'm almost done with my degree to where I'll be a licensed optician as a 23 year old female. Anyways long story, short; I feel like my job is at staked. (Even if anything happend I could find a job with the certifications and experience I have pretty quickly) I'm trying not o establish longevity though. I'm really having a hard time especially today because my manager commented on the dress I wore today at work. I never ever wear dresses and it was past my finger tips, had a modest flower design on it and no clue age because well I don't have much but she said it was too revealing and short. There's about 5 other girls who work there that are from the age of 27-32 who wear very very revealing dresses and have their boobs hanging out every wear. Sometimes it looks like they are going to the club with some of those dresses but with mine it seemed more cutesy church like. She told me not to wear it again and when I went to go sit down with one of the other girls to finishes tagging frames (which she was wear a dress) my manager yelled jokingly that she could see her hooha from all the way where she was sitting. They both laughed and joked about it. The other day too my manager commented on a different girls dress saying she was going to get some big sales wearing what she was wearing. I feel extremely singled out by far because the sad thing is, it really wasn't a sleazy dress. I've always been known for being modest and dressing that way. I guess really why I feel like I'm being singled out is because my coworkers have said over a year ago she tried to find any reason to fire someone she didn't like. There was a girl named Shakira that worked there last year and my manager made a rule to not eat at the desk and everyone did but when shakira did she got written up and no one else. She got written up for making her tattoo visible but another associate let their she be visible. She eventually got fired. I feel like my job is at jeopardy because of this reoccurring story from what I've been told. I just moved out with my fianc, really trying to be financially stable. I also got written up for the second time and no one else at my job has been written up. I got written up because keyed in the wrong frame to be ordered because my patient switched at the last minute and we had to put it in the system as a remake and it makes the remake percentage a little higher from corporate standards. I guess what really blows my mind is that I come into work and I pick up a lot of slack, I really try to go above and beyond. I'm usually cleaning up eager to work on glasses for people when they come in. A lot of the girls that are in the 27-32 age range are on their phones while I'm doing alot of the work like checking in jobs, fixing glasses, ect. There are a couple of girls who call out all the time. I show up to work when they call out almost every time. One girl'has called out about 20 times within the year. One girl was back talking my assistant manager the other day and it really was uncalled for. She ends up getting a promotion to another store. I just feel like everything is backwards. Once my manager left, everyone could tell I was having a rough day and I asked them if they make mistakes on the computer too and they agreeed that they do too often. No one else has gotten written up except me. It really discourages me. My assistant manager was told to write me up from the main manager and I could tell he was having a hard time doing it because me and him are on the same page of a lot of things at work and work very well together and he knows I'm really doing my absolute best. He tells me all the time that he sees great potential in me to even be a manager one day. He says way more than any of the other associates because they just think of it as a job. I'm doing this as a career. Not that it makes them any less but I really bust my butt there. My manager rudely yells across the store and tries to correct me in front of a patient if I didn't word something the write exact way. It's just no way to talk to someone, I've always been raised with manners, so it's very hard for me to grasp even that my manager has talked about previous associates in a bad light and tone. I thinks it's absolutely trashy and I just feel like I'm being nit picked a little too much. Some people tell me it's because of jealously because I have a mature attitude, im going to be a board certified optician in less then 6 months, I've getting my life together in my early twenties. I try not to think that way because I want a peaceful mutual relationship. I just needed to vent this to the Internet of unknown people that I don't know because I just need too. I need advice because I felt so unfortabke at work today, I was crying in the office when my assistant manager had to give me that write up. My head hurt the rest of the day, my face was blotchy and I showed my vulnerability which really sucks. I just feel like I'm literally being targeted and from what I've said here, does anyone feel like I am? Or should I think nothing of it? "

Something like 12 weeks of vacation. Company-provided car. He asked for a raise, they said no, after five years of nothing and higher insurance costs at a worse company and lower commission. His sales are anywhere from 50-70% higher than the second top salesman depending on the year but they make only $5k-ish difference in salary. The company has always been small but the brands were bought out by a big foreign company that suddenly wants to test lots of new products. So they went from selling 5-10 tried and true products to almost 30 today, which is overwhelming to the businesses that are buying from them. My dad feels like he's no longer in a growing industry but rather one that desperately wants to stay relevant. He's willing to learn and thinking of something like solar. He lives in a liberal state that cares about environmental problems and I live in a nearby very liberal state that has big subsidies on solar. I believe many sell across borders. However, while I do feel as an environmental economist that solar is crucial going forward, I'm concerned about the stability of this relatively new industry and its vulnerability to political winds. His products currently are timeless and it's obvious as to why they are being sold. That's not the case with solar. TLDR: Dad's company doesn't respect the work that he does, industry stagnant, considering changing to growing industry such as solar. I am personally concerned about the loss of stability, benefits (including company provided car), and the fact that he'd be making a huge career change in his 50s. Thoughts? Ideas on other industries in sales? He makes 65-75k now and I doubt wants to take a huge pay cut. Lives in a high tax area."

She says no one likes her and even though she has joined some organizations like dance at her school, she seems to be miserable under the surface. She's texted me three or four times with outbursts like this. She's never been one to admit vulnerability in the past but she has been very lonely even though our other friend is living with her this year. She says she doesn't understand her and that she's always rude, etc. the thing about this other friend is that she's very independent and doesn't know how to deal with all of my best friends feelings. I feel absolutely terrible for my friend. She's actually lovely and even though she's very over the top and excessively needy and sometimes irresponsible, I love her.

Basically, I've been fighting depression since my senior year of high school. I'm a sophomore in college now, and just moved out of my parents house two months ago because I was needing a change of pace, which is not what I got. Everything has gotten worse, actually. My mental state, financial situation, just everything. Moving back home wouldn't be a huge problem if I hadn't committed to a school an hour and a half away. I've gotten so bad that I can barely go to school anymore, in fact, I skipped my last two days of classes. I don't get enough hours at my job to pay my rent, and my crumbling mental state can't handle another job. I am extremely alone here without my family, but they've given me money just to live, and for school, and I want to go home. I feel ungrateful for being like this, not to mention the fact that they're willing to pay for me to see a psychiatrist. I just really don't know what to do; I am completely alone. I don't even live alone; I live with a girl I've known since we were little who I thought was my friend, but by her actions, I overestimated my significance in her life. She know's about my situation, and she tends to be very inconsiderate towards me. I'm beginning to think she sometimes takes advantage of my emotional vulnerability because she likes to blame me for everything. I'm really ashamed of myself and what I've become. If I can't finish this program I'm in how am I supposed to explain my situation to my professors and classmates? How humiliating. I'm going to try my best to make it through this semester, but if I can't get mental help soon, I don't know if that will happen. Anything will help, even just someone to talk to. "

257,vulnerability,Advice,I am a 20 y/o British guy in need of some serious life guidance and career guidance.,1,4qcmja,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4qcmja/i_am_a_20_yo_british_guy_in_need_of_some_serious/,2016-06-29 10:03:17,"Hi. The next month of my life will most defiantly be the most important part of my life, i have a few massive decisions to make and also just generally i'm so lost in my life right now. I'm going to explain my life in brief so you can get an understanding of where i am coming from. From as early as i remember i was bullied heavily by the kids in school, all the way from year 1-2 which is about 5-6 year old. I never really had many friends all the way through school and i would say the early stages of highschool is where i was bullied the most. As a bullied kid i did was most kids do and i sat inside and played videos games from the begging of highschool all the way up to now (20 y/o), so have very little social skills and confidence. After highschool i went onto college and did a 2 year course in graphic design where i met my first real girlfriend who i dated for around 1 year until my mum moved house. I moved about a 40 minute drive from her with no car and we just gradually became further and further apart from each other resulting in us breaking up in the end. During my 2nd year of college i became fascinated with another girl from my college who had a boyfriend. Their relationship was very unstable and they would argue alot, her boyfriend wouldn't pay her any attention and she felt unwanted in the relationship. To counter that she would get all of her attention and affection from me during college hours and essentially string me along as like her boyfriend (sneaking away during class to kiss in secret spots and going on trips to the cinema which would end up in us just kissing during the entire film). This fucked me up, i was coming out of a relationship with my first girlfriend and needing a rebound and instead got a girl who was using my vulnerability to please her own needs. It got to the stage where i was cutting myself a lot and became incredibly depressed during the last 3-4 months of my 2nd year at college. After college finishes i take up a perfect opportunity to go on holiday to see my my biological father in Australia who had previously been living out there for around 5-6 years after having to run away from the child benefit company over in UK because every day because my mum was persisting them to get the money off my Dad, who was also going through a bankruptcy at the time. (so basically my mum and dad literally hate each other and i had no father through the entirety of my life. Think he left when i was 3-4 year old). Instead i had a bunch of step-dad's and i mean a bunch. My mum would change boyfriend basically every 6 months and I would probably say she had at-least 10 between when i was 11-16 y/o. Anyways, while being in Australia i decide to post-pone my flight back to the UK for a whole year and try and live with my Dad in australia. For the first couple of months it was good... i guess. The internet over there was dreadful though and coming from literally sitting inside of day and playing online video games to literally not even being able to buffer a YouTube video literally sent my insane. I couldn't really go outside because I had no friends expect a few people i met at a skatepark once who were these Christians who wanted me to come to their Youth group thing where i met a few people but only knew them inside of the youth group and were always a few years younger than me. I attended college over there for a little while and also found myself a Job in McDonald's which i hated every second of but it got me some cash for rent and train fares to college. Basically i ended up moving back over the UK to peruse some weird competitive gaming fallacy i had because i thought i could become a pro-gamer if i put 100% of my effort into it. That ended up falling flat on its face after attending a few events i have given up on the idea and feel as though leaving Australia was a massive mistake, all to attempt to play video games over in the UK. After all of that happened i applied for University over here in the UK in some local community college because i didn't feel up to going to a big university and the travel was also super difficult after my mum moved house to basically the countryside. I did psychology and health and well being for 2 years at have just passed the course (HND) and have the option to go ahead of go to university to top up onto my full degree. Except, i hate the course and i hate the subject. I thought i liked it to begin with after going through some mental health issues of my own i thought who would be better than me to help other people with their mental health issues... turns out i'm not academically smart at all and found writing essays incredibly difficult. Along with the community college style teaching with was literally dreadful. I don't really want to go into anything to do with mental health or caring as to be honest i'm quite a selfish person and i don't really want to clean old peoples arses for minimum wage because that's all i can do with the qualification i have. Anyways, i finished university about 1 month ago and have basically been sat inside doing nothing with my days except casually playing games (nothing competitive) as i have also completely gone off that idea too. My mum is pushing me to find a job when i live in the middle of nowhere with no car and buses come once every 2 hours. I am basically living off (paying rent) with the little students loans i have left. I was Skyping with my dad where i told him i was thinking off moving back over to Australia as i have changed alot over the last 2 years since i was last living with him and he has basically agreed to let me live with him over there again and i just today sent of to get my passport renewed and we are looking at flights around late July. Here's the catch, i don't really know what i'm going to do once i get over there as i really have nothing that inspires me in life and no skill sets or social skills. I don't think i am running away from my problems over here in the UK but maybe i am and maybe i will end up back in the UK in a years time or even sooner in the same situation. I REALLY do not want to work in some supermarket or McDonald's in australia again because it literally makes me unhappy every second i am there and i also really do not want to be some generic sheep earning around 30-40 grand a year in some dead-end office job. I want to make something of myself and essentially be famous or make a load of money. I cant really accept just being average in my life and i'd said to myself plenty of times i'd rather be dead than be working some shitty dead end job that doesn't fulfill me in anyway. I have also said many times that i would kill myself if i didn't have 1 million by the age of 25 or wasn't famous for something good. I know i suffer from depression and have never really seeked help for it at all. I have attempted to tell my mum but cant bring myself to tell her as she has said many of times 'grow up' or 'be a man' or 'that's just life' when either found crying in my bed or asking her some a philosophical question about life. She just doesn't get it. I also want to note that i am really fat, i weigh 18 stone maybe more as of now and conform eat late into the AM almost everynight. I have about 20 massive stretch marks over my stomach and i have really yellow teeth from drinking way to much coke and just generally not looking after my teeth. I literally hate my body. SO... what do i do? does anybody have any advice at all? i don't care if its positive or negative and if you have read this entire thing then thank you for taking the time out of your day."
258,vulnerability,Advice,Confronting people from my past,1,4qxje8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4qxje8/confronting_people_from_my_past/,2016-07-03 01:02:33,"*In the interest of anonymity, and to protect those individuals mentioned herein, I've created this throwaway and will only label specific things as they are relevant to my narrative. I apologize if this makes things obtuse, but I want to be able to preserve objectivity as much as possible.* I've recently had a lot of time to reassess my life goals and ""figure out what I want to do when I grow up"". I've already completed an undergraduate degree in a field I thought I was interested in, and I do not regret having completed the degree, but it's become apparent in my soul-searching that it's not what I want to do for the rest of my life. My life experience to this point as a young adult (now mid-twenties) has more clearly defined what I hold a lasting interest in, and I'm in the process of getting back into school to complete a different degree in a field that will more accurately fulfill what I now know to be my life goals. I realized in making this decision that there are certain circumstances and individuals I feel to be responsible for my lack of direction the first time around. The subject I studied was something of a backup plan, and I recognize that I very clearly did not have a real motivation to apply it in the real world at any point. The subject I have now settled on is much closer to my heart and lifelong interests, and honestly I would have never stopped studying it if it weren't for a specific high school teacher and his (for lack of a better term) accomplice who was a peer of mine in all of the classes I took from this teacher. I won't get into the details, but suffice it to say they emotionally and intellectually bullied me to the point where all joy for the subject was entirely lost to me. At one point it got so bad that I would go out of my way to create elaborate methods of cheating on tests and homework so that I could avoid as much effort and time spent on the class as possible (which generally backfired as cheating usually ended up being more effort than just studying, and I usually ended up reviewing the subject matter more than if I had just done the work). It came to a head when I was caught cheating on a minor quiz, but thankfully my parents were aware of the problems and petitioned on my behalf against the teacher (who they knew personally and didn't particularly like). The situation was eventually ""resolved"" (mostly I just agreed to suck it up as much as possible and complete the semester under a higher level of scrutiny), and I was able to complete the coursework with undamaged grades. I later learned from a friend that the teacher and student were still talking trash about me two or more terms later. This was particularly disheartening to me, as I had previously looked up to this teacher as a role model, and was close friends with the student in question when we were younger. I still hold resentment towards both the teacher and the student to this day. I did not tie this to my lack of motivation in my now-rediscovered subject until I was researching the topics I needed to brush up on to apply to relevant programs. Here is my conundrum: I have found myself looking them up on Facebook and similar in the last day or so, and I'm trying to determine if it would be beneficial to reach out and try to confront these individuals. I don't have any expectation of reparation or an apology, I just have this growing desire to tell them how I felt (and still feel), but I'm worried that I will come across as petty or weak. As their perceived superiority over me was what really drove their bullying, showing vulnerability in their presence is pretty triggering to this whole situation. Would any of you recommend confronting them, and if so, what would your advice be on approaching the whole situation? **tl;dr I was bullied by a teacher and student in high school and I feel they derailed my joy for particular academic pursuits. I want to confront them but I'm not sure if it is ill-advised or not.** Thanks in advance friends."

Would it be considered as taking advantage of their emotional vulnerabilities/loneliness? I am talking like [60 years old](URL I am 22, and do not consider myself particularly attractive but I seem to be attractive to girls around my age as well older women every now and again.

Being from a traditional eastern family, dating wasn't really preferred. She made it clear she did not want to date, early on. I told her I want to marry her and she agreed but eventually things got ruined over text. I have loads of women interested in me but I can't seem to get my head off this one. She got engaged. I just want to have a better ending and move forward. We are from the same original city and I know I'll cross paths. Can I contact her after no contact for merely 2-3 months now? Apologize that it didn't work...and hope we can be like adults? She's still on my Facebook too and I think it's petty for me to remove her but hate that her name shows up. Long form below. Anyway, I agreed I don't want to just date. I was looking for something serious as well. However, every step of the way was a bit challenging. We lived in different cities but she fit my ideal girl criteria perfectly. On paper we were a perfect match. Most of our communication was in text and I'll admit, I was too insecure to go all in. Was hoping she would put a little more effort and show some vulnerability before I went all in (primarily because I didn't want to scare her off). Anyway...I wanted to take her out and meet up with her but it was a struggle. After nc for a week I texted her some long text about wanting to go to the next step. She responded saying she wants our rents to meet and she felt like we were just dating and didn't want that. I was a little upset that she didn't tell me this sooner. Anyway, I arrange the rents to meet since our parents are both in the same city. Everything went well. But I learned that most of her responses were coming from her mom. Her mom told me she didn't want her child hurt and doesn't want her to be emotionally involved. This was the problem! So anyway at this point I am hesitant about this girl. Our communication is so weak and I'm just not sure. Another week or two goes by after some subtle texting and we talk on the phone. At this point I tell her I want to marry her. Yes. Despite hesitation, I wanted to marry her. She agrees. In my head, I'm hoping this would get her to maybe initiate a little more or show something. This happened 3 days before my birthday and after getting off the phone I got scared. I didn't know what I just did. Again...the part that scared me was our communication was iffy but I give her some slack because she wanted to keep the traditional approach which I want to but was hoping with some affection. Anyway...on my birthday she texts me. Which is cool I don't care much for birthdays anyway and in fact that's the same thing I did to her. I tell her thanks again via text. Then I ask her when we are going to meet. And no response for two days...which was pretty typical. She was getting ready for a trip overseas. In hindsight...I was definitely coming off as needy but I told this girl I wanted to marry her. And still 2 day late responses? I didn't understand that ppl get busy during a trip so I take fault here. Anyway, I eventually write a response on the second day. I write a rude text, with no intention to be offensive. Hell she could've told me to shut up and I would've been okay. In fact...a friend told me to write this. I wrote something like: ""hey before you leave...what's the deal? Not even a phone call on my bday? And trying to see you but [simething needy I'm sure]? No response. At this point she's overseas. 5 days go by and I apologize for not using my words carefully and let her know I miss hearing from her. Her response was something a long the lines of ""hey you're a great guy but I don't think this is going to work. And it's best we leave things on a positive note."" And some additional detail. This hit me hard. My ego was bruised. I never get rejected. Not to sound arrogant but I wasn't used to this. It took me 7 days to respond. That friend told me to forget it instead of saying I should fight for it. Hence the 7 day delay in responding. My responds was some Shakespeare type bullshit with some Rumi quote and essentially saying ""hey I agree we have some issues but if there's anything in you that things I could sweep you off your feet, let's talk it out. Otherwise [enter Rumi quote about us being done for with a blink of an eye]. And I'll leave it at that."" Yes. Stupid response. Through text. Fuck. Anyway. That was 3 months ago. About 3-4 weeks ago she got engaged. That hurt like a bish and I was planning to go see her in person and get this resolved. But that news made me hesitant. Also...being in the fed side...it's a bit harder to marry a non us citizen which she was. Just require a bit of a background check. Anyway...lots of things I didn't like but I felt she would eventually learn. All I want at this point is to have her out of my head. If that means pursuing her and getting rejected in person that's what j want! Please advice! -bruised ego / hearbroken man It helped to write this out. For those that read it all...thank you sincerely! "
262,vulnerability,Advice,Did I experience childhood abuse or is this just paranoia?,7,456gay,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/456gay/did_i_experience_childhood_abuse_or_is_this_just/,2016-02-11 13:08:26,"Im a 22 year old girl and over the past year Ive had a growing sense that some kind of sexual abuse happened to me as a child. In advance Im sorry that this is extremely long but its all been building up inside of me over the past year. One of the most concerning realisations for me was my awareness of sexuality from a really young age. I remember masturbating from a young age, from before I had been explained what it meant or the sexual nature of it. I know this alone doesnt say much, but the more Ive thought about it the more Ive come to remember. I have a vivid memory of being at kindergarten, perhaps age 5, and being asked to escort a younger child inside. I have a memory of leading her out of the play area and, as I did, reaching down and squeezing her bottom once. I have no idea why I would do that, I feel guilty and ashamed as I type this experience out. I also remember engaging in romantic or sexual play with my soft toys, in that I would partner them and role play scenarios. Im a little unclear of how explicit these scenarios were, but thinking back makes me uncomfortable. I also vividly remember around the same time being caught drawing a picture a picture of a naked man, complete with genitalia. This really stands out to me as a memory because at that age (as far as I can remember) I had never seen a fully grown naked man, although I suppose I had seen another child. But I had never seen my father naked and being an only child with no brothers or male cousins I dont understand where I would have got the need to draw this from. It wasnt the drawing of a child but of a fully aged man. Probably my biggest childhood red flag appears when I think back to one particular incident. At about the age of 5 or 6 I had a friend from kindergarten named Jack. I remember Jack visiting my house and we were left to play on our own devices in my room. I remember we both at some point were undressed, perhaps not unusual for childhood play. But then I vividly remember observing his genitals and telling him that I wondered if it could fit in my own private areas, and that we should see if it went in. Nothing happened but I clearly remember saying it. Its made me distressed and worried about where I learnt this behaviour, or how I even conceived that thought at that age, when nothing like it had ever been explained to me. That wasnt the only incident of sexual-based play in my childhood. There were scenarios I vaguely remember (but not in as much detail) of looking at each others genitals and playing doctor with a male friend. Even as an older child of around 10 I remember playing games with my best female friend where we would essentially act out romance/sexual based scenarios but fully clothed with no actual sexual contact involved. As an adult Ive found that I have fetishized extreme and violent sexual acts. I have fantasised about being raped even though at the same time I know I am disgusted at the thought of it actually happening. Within sex I enjoy being choked, slapped, spanked, bound, gagged. Feelings of helplessness and humiliation. I have a hard time achieving orgasm without these elements. Ive also become disgusted at myself in that I find myself physically, but not mentally, aroused when reading about incidents of female child abuse. I want to be clear that I have absolutely no attraction to children, and I am not aroused by any physical sight of a child. But when I read about news stories involving violence I sometimes feel a slight arousal while simultaneously feeling a wave of empathy for the child- often reduced to tears by the idea of their ordeal. And while I have not been squeamish about sex, the idea of visiting a gynaecologist physically repulses me. I remember once at the age of about 16 or 17 being talked to at school about pap smears and gynaecological exams. The teacher spoke about how the instrument is inserted and it made me feel sick. I fainted off of my chair in the middle of class- the only time I have ever fainted. Also, while I know many peoples hymen breaks before intercourse because of physical activity, I was always a very indoorsy child yet I did not bleed when I lost my virginity. Ive had issues throughout my life with finding healthy ways to deal with hurt, upset, anger, and stress. For years I would obsessively push back and pick at the skin around my nails (hands and toes) until the point they would hurt and bleed. I went through a period where I would hurt myself as a way of coping with emotions, cutting myself with scissors and knifes along my arms, my legs, and my stomach. I would deliberately hit my wrist until it caused bruising. While these were largely superficial and not intended to cause lasting harm, I did have suicidal thoughts almost every day for a couple of years at around 12-14. I even thought about how I would do it and remember going through the medicine draw and counting how many pills we had in the house. Since the age of about 17 I have stopped all incidents of self harm. Until earlier this month when one incident occurred, and I felt unable to cope with feelings of rejection and vulnerability and I relapsed- I carved some lines into my arms, my legs and my stomach with a kitchen knife. There was drink involved which elevated my negative feelings, and while Im confident its something that wont happen again its really disturbed me that I could do it. Nobody knows about any of this, and I feel like the person I outwardly project to the world is drastically different to the one which I really am by myself. I also had persistent OCD traits throughout my childhood, which I believe emerged at some point between the ages of 6-8. Ive read that OCD traits can be signs of childhood abuse. I had (and to a lesser extent still have) an obsession with numbers. Everything had to be done in multiples of two or five, whether it be touching an object that number of times or the volume on a television, steps it took to reach my desired destination, turning on a light switch, eating a certain number of sweets which was even an even number or a multiple of five. While this has gotten a lot better with age (I still obsess over volume numbers and very occasionally find myself needing to do something an even number of times) it was a huge part of my memory of childhood. This also corresponded with my hatred of odd numbers and fear of objects feeling left out. I used to personify household objects, give them feelings- If I used one glass for my first drink Id need to use the other one the next time so it didnt feel left out. I would try and put objects in pairs or groups so they were never alone. I remember that even when I would draw stick people or smiley faces I could never just draw one, because I was afraid they would be lonely without another one beside them. If I touched one toy I would need to touch the others so they didnt feel excluded. I feel these were mimicking my own feeling of vulnerability. I was also incredibly shy as a child, traits which carried on for a long time. I found it difficult to talk to stranger or approach people I didnt know. I hated answering the phone and would never ask for help in shops even when I needed it. I had extreme startle responses and couldnt stand loud noises like fireworks as they made me physically flinch and jump. I remember once in kindergarten there was a nativity play when I was a Shepard, and part of it was one child clapping his hand against a tambourine very hard in succession and each time he did it I would flinch and jump to the point I noticed laughter. Within my relationships I have always been incredibly emotionally dependent. I seek validation from my partners and have always been extremely sensitive to criticism- taking it very personally. I have a fear of abandonment to the level that even when I have no longer wanted to be in a relationship with a partner Im unable to let them go because I dont want them to leave me. I feel like Im on a constant quest for intimacy and have a huge need to please whoever Im with. Even when Ive been in healthy relationships Ive found myself crying for no reason even when nothings gone wrong. Ive also found that I let partners walk over me in a sense. While Im incredibly strong and independent in my everyday life, when in a relationship I minimise the bad things a partner might do and try to let them go rather than confront bad behaviour or express my dissatisfaction. I find it difficult to recognise, own and express anger within my romantic relationships. I have, however, always cried incredibly easily. Minor inconveniences or hurt feelings cause extreme emotional responses from me. I can also be incredibly empathetic. I cry at films both when the endings are too happy or too sad. I regularly cry when watching or reading the news- usually when observing stories which involve hurt children and abuse. Another red flag is that Ive always been very private and secretive even when I have nothing to hide, something which many people including friends and my own mother have picked up on. Ive had a very complicated relationship with sleep. As a child I had terrible nightmares and remember one recurring one where I was chased by a wolf who progressively got closer to catching me vividly to this day. Ive also always had this fear of being watched while in my bedroom. As a child I would be terrified somebody outside of the windows in the night was looking through watching me, I wouldnt allow even the smallest gap in the curtains. Even to this day I get a fear that there is somebody in my bedroom and sense a presence. Ive also had a complicated relationship with food. While Ive always been naturally skinny I go through periods where I become obsessive over my weight and counting calories, usually when Im encountering stress in other aspects of my life. I come from a loving family and am close with both of my parents and if there was any incidents of abuse I cannot possibly think they were involved. I was given warnings about strangers as a child and taught about parts of my body which were private in very simplistic, non-detailed terms. Ive never had any diagnosis for a condition and Ive never been to therapy. But my family does have a history of depression with both my mother and my maternal grandmother (and by some accounts my great grandmother) suffering from depression at some point within their lives. I just cant shake this feeling that something happened to me and the more Ive read about sexual abuse and the manifestations it causes the more I recognise within my own life. Im really starting to wonder if I have repressed abuse. I just have a strong, unexplained sense that something bad has happened to me. As Ive written this all out Ive also become increasingly aware that I may have some other real issues, any advice or help will be appreciated."
263,vulnerability,Advice,Little bro is having a fit over money. I don't know how to help.,10,41bqrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/41bqrr/little_bro_is_having_a_fit_over_money_i_dont_know/,2016-01-17 14:07:19,"Just now, my little brother (by 4 years he's 13) had a fit in his room, he went off in a burst of anger punching his bed and knocking shit off his shelf. All this because, my sister was apparently getting more money from their father this month by a difference of $100. He insisted on my sister telling him how much she got, even though she initially refused to share the information. I'm not sure how to deal with this as the older brother. At first, I felt like telling him off and saying something like ""If you couldn't handle it, then why did you ask?!"" but, now I'm thinking scolding him like that wouldn't do any good (It almost never does when it comes from me). Right now, I'm thinking of asking them to split whatever they get turning that $100 into $50 and handing it off between them. Fair and square right? Update: He apparently made a hole in the wall. *Sigh* I told him he should just fess up to our mom, but she isn't the best at dealing with these things. It usually ends up with him getting punished. And it ends there, nothing gets resolved, and he festers in his own anger even more than before. Update2: I spoke to my little brother with all your advice in mind. It's not exactly what you told me to do, but i found some insight on what's been going on with my little bro. It turns out it wasn't just about the money, he was legitimately hurt by the idea that our sister was being treated as the favorite. It's been like that for awhile now for him. He doesn't feel like an equal to his twin sis. Because of it he doesn't feel welcomed or like he belongs in the family. At first i honestly didn't know what to say. But after a bit i told him that it'd be best if he opened up to his father, our mother, and his sister about this. However, he feels that if he did open up it would come back to bite him and his vulnerability would be used against him. He also feels that our mother would only focus on the damage and completely ignore his feelings. Even worse, he doesn't feel like he knows his father so he refuses to open up to him. I told him once more that if he doesn't talk to anyone and do something about his feelings that it'll keep hurting him and the people mentioned will keep hurting him without knowing what it does to him. He's also feeling very impatient about money, because he doesn't want to keep asking our mother for money for whatever he may want. Since we're actually scraping the bottom of the barrel over on our side. So, he's intent on finding a job as soon as possible. I'm not sure if that bit of info is totally relevant to any of you. But I think it shows his added frustration."

He most likely also has some form of Aspergers or autistic tendencies (talking over other people, *very* bigoted [he used to be a racist for a very long time - he probably still is, also sexist, all the -ists], never considers other people's points of view [thinks he right on everything and that everyone else is wrong; starts talking before you finished your point], brings up stuff that you've said in the past not to bring up again during inappropriate times to use against you [mistakes that you don't want to discuss, embarrassing secrets you shared during moments of vulnerability, etc.]) 0 emotional intelligence. The thing is, he's better when he's on his medication. Still awkward, but bearable as a friend. He's also somewhat into self-improvement, and wanted to go to the gym with me. He's pretty intelligent in the sense that he can figure things out, but has no critical thinking abilities, so the few times he actually listens (when on meds), you could have a decent intelligent conversation with him. You see, the problem is, he didn't always used to be so bad. Then again, I don't think I've ever had any fun memories with this guy. He's just like there easy and accessible... when you want to go somewhere not alone [e.g. movies], he'll come. If you need a lunch buddy, he's there, a study buddy, he's there. Personally, I want to cut him off. I know people with mental illnesses have it hard, and perhaps deep down this guy is also a decent person who just wants to be understood (he only has like 3-4 friends, including me so if I cut him off, he's going to end up even lonelier), but I'm just not the right person for what feels like a job now."

268,vulnerability,Advice,How do I grow and maintain my sanity in a dysfunctional family?,1,341tma,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/341tma/how_do_i_grow_and_maintain_my_sanity_in_a/,2015-04-28 03:16:44,"I am an 18-year-old student. I have been to a psychiatrist once before as I was struggling with chronic sadness and lack of motivation and have been diagnosed with moderate depression. I have seen several counselors since I was 11 years old in primary school, because of behavioral issues, in secondary school for lack of interest in schoolwork and loneliness, and Ive been to other counselors and psychologists myself after secondary school to seek help for my chronic depression. Ive seen both of my junior college counsellors both for short periods of time as I never found it comfortable to see one person for a prolonged period of time, and sought help online on counseling websites like 7cupsoftea.com, and called the suicide hotline many times. There were times where I thought my life was going well because I was doing everything expected of me, but it seems now like I was just putting on a faade to get people to think I was normal. I really felt empty and depressed inside. I have been reading books about vulnerability and self-help books about how to heal yourself and take care of your own needs as a child raised in a dysfunctional family, and it has brought back many traumatizing memories from the past. One important thing I read in it was that I have to be able to grieve my losses in a healthy manner and articulate my feelings in order to grow mentally and emotionally, so I felt a huge need to talk about my feelings and experiences with people who are able to help and support me. I don't have anyone like that in my life. My parents have repeatedly rejected me for showing or talking about any kind of emotion that they consider negative, even though they allow themselves to express those emotions repeatedly, in an exaggerated manner. I have many issues that I want to talk about and get through, but what is making me the most dissatisfied with myself is how little motivation I have to socialize. I don't think Im bad at conversing with other people, or have anxiety while Im talking to them (in fact, I dont think I care enough about where the conversation is headed.). Rather, I've lost the will to form and maintain relationships. There are people I respect, admire, and find interesting, but I never feel the urge to be around them, or be friendly to them. I don't feel attached to the friends I make that it sometimes feels like I'm pretending to be friendly to make it seem real. I used to think of myself as a pretty empathetic person, despite being really lonely, but now Im so numb and indifferent. Im finding it increasingly harder to take care of myself. Im hoping that therapy can make me feel better. I think Im very prone to depression. I remember feeling isolated from people since I was a toddler and that I didnt deserve human connection unless I changed myself completely to suit someones desires. My parents always made me feel worse. I think they have a huge role to play in making me believe in making me feel unworthy and inadequate about my feelings. I have tried managing my emotions better. Last year I felt like I was making a lot of progress being more trusting of people, then when I fell ill and couldnt speak for 2 weeks, I became really weak after isolating myself and when no one seemed to care about me (what really hurt was when they were avoiding me. I had the flu, but still) when I wasn't being my usual friendly self. So I would say that Im very sensitive to how my family members lack of affection and towards me, and I remember feeling anger and confusion when they made me feel inadequate or talked about how inhumanely they described other people (they are massively bigoted and verbally abusive). Im probably not supposed to wish for things I dont have, but reading some self-help books made me furious at them for not caring enough about my emotional and mental health because there were things that they could have avoided doing. I would appreciate any kind of similar stories and advice about how I can overcome my asociality and how to deal with my family. I feel so alone and weak."

My mothers side grandma is amazing, and I feel guilty because I should talk to her more. My fathers side grandma is amazing, and I feel guilty because I should see her more. My fathers side grandpa is amazing, and I feel guilty because I should listen to him more and talk to him more. Past life I was born in Virginia, but my dads career moved us to Pennsylvania. I live my younger childhood in Pennsylvania and had fun with my 3 brothers. I was terrified of my dad because he got drunk a lot and hurt my brothers and me. I loved my mom. I had a childhood friend that I hung out with. I had a crush on my next-door neighbors daughter. She was 16, I was 8. We went to my grandmas and our family was really connected. My dads career moved us back to Virginia closer to our grandparents. I was in 2nd grade when we moved. I made new friends at school. I video gamed with my 3 brothers. I was bullied in 3rd grade. I had a tight nit friend group with them all being girls. In 4th grade 2 new people entered my friend group a blonde girl and Asian guy. The blonde girl had a crush on me, but I had a crush on the brown-haired girl. The Asian guy was fat, but I was really close to him even though his humor was making fun of others. This summer my mother made my father stop drinking or she would divorce him. In 5th grade it was pretty much the same. In 6th grade I was doing band and advanced classes. I meet a person in band that would be my friend throughout high school. I started lightly cheating in 6th grade because I hated busy work. I lightly skipped school because I could do all the work I needed to do in one sitting instead of 60 hours a week. I ended that year with more friends and no regrets. This summer my family is closer than ever. I play games with my brothers everyday. In 7th grade I hung out with the blonde-haired girl and we were really close. I still took advanced classes and band. I cheated a little more and skipped a little more this year. I could see my friends group disappearing. The year ended and I hung out with the blonde-haired girl all summer. My second oldest brother was acting depressed and suicidal because of a girlfriend he had. In 8th grade I still took advanced classes and band. I only hung out with 5 of my friends this year. I skipped and cheated more this year. This year was ending and I close marching band and honors classes for high school. During the early summer the blonde-haired girl and I were dating. We spend hours every night talking to each other. I was tired. I started asking myself if I liked her like she liked me. I hated myself. She had always been very insecure and had always asked me if I love her. I woke up one morning and I told her I dont. I hated myself. The marching band season started a couple months before school and I met people that would change my life as it is now. I met my section and a girl that was chilling and that was part of the flag twirlers. She was a senior. I asked for her snapchat. I made new friends with everyone I met. While my 9th grade school was coming closer I talked to the senior girl more and even though she had a boyfriend I flirted with her. I started skipping some of the marching band days because I already learned what I needed to learn. When my 9th grade school started I was already exhausted and didnt want to go everyday. I dragged myself through and I wasnt doing as well as I used to be doing in middle school. My grades were dropping and I skipped school even more. I went 4 days a week and went to most marching band games. I really enjoyed when I went and I feel immense guilt when I didnt. I was about to get a blowjob from the senior girl but I told her ex-boyfriend and he told her. She cut ties with me because she had a boyfriend. I cringed at myself and couldnt fathom what was going through my mind. My life was in shambles and every time I wanted to pick up the pieces, I threw them on the ground again because I couldnt care less. My old friend group was nonexistent because I skipped school and didnt talk to them anymore. I had a bunch of new friends and they were sufficient. I ended this year and failed a class and barely passed another. I decided not to sign myself up for honors but I did marching band again. I started my 10th grade and was in marching band again. I started hanging out with my future best friend which was in my section. This year I tried to skip less and get better grades. I failed at not skipping but ended up with better grades. A girl ghosted me this year but it didnt matter in the long run. I havent talked to the blonde haired girl since I broke up with her. It is awkward anytime I come across her in the halls. I start not caring about anything. The year ends and I skipped almost until I wasnt going to pass. I knew I wanted to graduate early so I signed myself up for some fun classes for this year because it was going to be my last. I started in marching band and skipped from the beginning. My best friend was uncaring about anything I did and I really admire him. School had started and it was the second week. My oldest brother had suddenly committed suicide. This was last year. I am still speechless and I still dont have the right words to say about this. All my teachers know and they stare at me like I am some sort of animal to pity. I ask my grade counselor to let me take online classes. I finish my online class in a month and only go to school for 50 minutes for a history class. I still skip school even though it is only for 50 minutes. I hangout with my best friend to keep myself sane. I get a job at Arbys in December of 2019. I find myself struggling to get up every morning to go to school. By the time corona has came around I still had good grades but I havent went to school in a week. I have to complete some online work for the class to graduate. I finished that and then graduated a year early. I go to Arbys 60 hour weeks and start saving up money for college. I sign up for ECPI University and I start going June 15th. I have one best friend and a crush on a girl from work. I am on track to get a bachelors degree in cybersecurity."

He said that he's too busy with work and has a hard time writing (he's basically illiterate). It started out as just giving him assistance on assignments he had trouble with, to doing all of the work. I think doing his work as defeats the point of him going to college, especially since he's so hands off about it. He hasn't done anything ever since he had me take over his classes. Whenever I ask for help or ask him to look at my work, he'll just brush me off and tell me to just do the work. Only thing he'll do is tell me if some work is missing and that's it. Even on his days off he won't take a look at his courses or try to improve his writing. His classes are 70% writing and the rest are application of the the things ""he's"" learned. My dad's reasoning for going to college isn't because of the degree but rather the money he gets from the benefits. My dad is going to college over some military program for vets. I'm not entirely sure how it works, but he gets almost a full livable pay check worth per month after gaining a certain amount of credit hours. The money he would get would help our family out. I get paid for the work with some of that money I but haven't been paid yet. I soon have to worry about my own education, my community College is going to start in about a month. I'll have additional work and my dad expects me to still do his work. He's even hinted that I should neglect my own education so I can do his and even get him a masters degree. He hasn't said that directly but whenever I mentioned my school, he always asks how many classes I have and that he wants to get a masters degree. My plan so far to deal with this was by speaking with one of his teachers and get him expelled for plagiarism (which is what he's technically doing) without mentioning that I reported him. I could ruin any possibility of our family getting the money from the benefits if I reported him. I would go unpaid for the work I've done and I could possibly get thrown out of the house if the situation upsets my dad enough or he finds out that I reported him. I tried talking to my other family members, but my mom is the only that's sympathetic of my situation. I haven't told her about my plan, as I feel like if anyone knew my chances of getting away with it would reduce. Talking to my dad about it has been ineffective as he easily gets upset and is quick to blame me. I couldn't fit this information in elsewhere but my dad is going to ECPI university for a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity. He's paid someone to do a associates degree for him in the past. There's a lot more I still want to mention but this is the most important stuff. I'll try my best to fill in on missing information if needed. I'm sorry if this seems more like venting rather than asking for advice, I really do need help. Sorry for any weird formatting and grammar mistakes. tl:dr my dad is making me go to college for him, so he can get monetary benefits and a bachelor's degree. I feel wrong for doing his work and want to report him to his school."

I've worked many jobs both in customer service and manual labor, and I've fallen back on manual labor as I lost my previous job at an IT company to the pandemic. I didn't like that job (it was tedious, grunt/entry-level work), and as I've fallen back on construction and flooring work I've found I enjoy the physical grind more than the office environment. What has me confused more is that I absolutely love the outdoors, and want to eventually own a home on my own plot of land a ways away from major cities. I love people, but I also love the isolation, peace, and freedom that come with nature. This doesn't go well at all with the fact that working cybersecurity or any IT job really wouldn't allow me to enjoy the world away from a desk. I love fresh mountain air and the smell of greenery too much. I also want to travel and experience the world. I refuse to settle for the comfort of my ""bubble,"" and it bothers me that I don't have the money or time to really experience other places. And lastly, I love people to the point that I would dedicate my life to helping those in need if I could achieve my goal of owning my own property and being financially stable while doing that. I feel like philanthropy would come after financial security though, so my focus first needs to be centered on securing my future and my goals. I just have no idea what the next step is as these are trying times for a graduate with little experience. Do I commit to a career that I may dislike for the time being? If not, what do I do? I feel so helpless. Any advice, personal experience involving travel and work, or just constructive criticism helps. I'm just so lost in my head and so unhappy with feeling incapable of achieving what I want. I hate remaining stagnate and my blurry future is all I think about all the time. &amp;#x200B; Thank you :)"

Once I graduated, I got a job in sales and absolutely hated it (it was a cubicle phone job). While I was working that job, I decided I wanted to go into cybersecurity due to the high pay/ high growth in that field (I gotta pay back these loans people). In order to get an entry-level job in IT, I took an advanced computer course and recently passed. However, after doing some research, I realized that if I took the cybersecurity route I would be stuck at a desk in front of a computer for most of my life. Due to the fact that you spend 1/3rd of your life at work, I feel as if this would be a mediocre existence because I do not believe humans were meant to be sedentary creatures, hunched over staring at a screen all day. Furthermore, I have heard cybersecurity is a stressful job so now I find myself doubting whether I want to take this path. On the other hand, I had a park job while in college and really enjoyed it. I looked into working for the National Park Service, however, the pay for a park ranger is low but I believe I would really enjoy this job as I would be out in nature. It would also make logical sense for me because I would be in ""public service"" as I am a Political Science major. I also care about the environment so maybe I could find a Conservationist job via the National Park Service. Personally, I do not think money is the goal of life. If I work a job that makes me a lot of money but I am unhappy as a result, then I would hate my life. Considering that life is so short, it doesn't make sense for me to do something I hate simply for money. Basically, in the career that I envision, I see myself doing something meaningful as well as a job that I like working at. I know I capable of doing anything I set my mind to.. I just need to set my mind to something. On top of all this, I am currently unemployed due to coronavirus. Any advice from u/Advice??"

Liked my job and had a good manager. Was provided the opportunity to advance as well. A few friends at the company and met my boyfriend through the experience. But about a year ago, things were really different. I was in a lower role and was getting viciously bullied by multiple other people at the company. Management completely mishandled it in my opinion, as they basically took my bully's side (he ended up falling on his face when he was promoted; I succeeded well past him in comparison). But I can never forget the horrible, disrespectful personal attacks, nor the fact that I was completely neglected when all I wanted was for somebody to say ""stop."" (He had been making up rumors about me doing sexual acts for advancement, and saying that I was a fraud generally speaking). Now, I am leaving for a much lower paying job at Google. I am still grateful for the ""brand name"" but as I see my current (well, now former) company's stock price shoot up in light of COVID-19 and everyone around me says ""how can you leave?""

Don't know if there's any way to really fix that either. Plus, I have been in an overly dependent relationship with the boyfriend I met through this company due to the emotional support he provided during hard times. I've wanted to break up with him for a long time, but have been having a hard time while we worked together.

I bought about 5 Udemy classes over the past few years but none of them I really stuck with. A few months ago, I decided that I really wanted to learn more about artificial intelligence. I bought a Udemy course and told myself that this course would be the course that I'd actually follow through on. I did complete the course, taking notes along the way and building/training an AI on how to walk. The problem was that I didn't feel like I learned very much. The theory of the class I was able to comprehend and understand very concisely. However, when it came to the actual coding section I realized that very little in the class was explained. I also found out that the creators of the class were a bit misleading in their praise of the type of AI that I was learning about. I only later found out that the type of AI I had learned about was a very new type that didn't really have many known practical uses. So, I chalked this class up to a failure. It took a lot of forcing myself to finish this class. I enjoy the topic and it's something I want to learn about. I've found that I feel this way about other things I want to learn about as well. I wanted to learn hacking/cybersecurity at one point. I was infatuated with it, but just couldn't force myself to try to learn. I think I'm partially afraid of taking a course that isn't helpful/useful. I really want to get better at learning and being able to sit down and complete a class. Has anyone else experienced this? Did anything you tried aid you in learning at all?"

But working full time I would need to do this as part-time study, I already am drained of energy after each day of work so hoping I can get my brain working more doing study. The reason I haven't jumped straight on this is due to the below:  I have had colleagues say that IT degrees are not worth the time or money, I should just do self study (which I have enough resources to do that, just not the 'push' to stick to it)  Will I be able to cope with the workload of work and study at the same time? (With some free time as well?)  will there potentially be light at the end of the road? (If I do the study, what would be the probability of getting a job in the security industry currently?) Also note, I am a 25M in Australia.  Do I just stick with my current job/role and hope I get paid higher in future? Honestly will take any advice I can get as I'm lost on what I want to do.. Thanks"

This would be my first post on Reddit and Im kinda nervous about it but I dont know anywhere else I can ask this and I really need advice. I live in the US, I was brought as a child and overstayed visas (please dont be mad about it, my parents were kinda scammed and I was a child with no voice in the matter). I applied to Southern Illinois University of Carbondale but failed to obtain the complete scholarship so I decided to look for other options. I applied to my community college, Triton College, and got a full scholarship for two years. Not content with it, I looked for international universities with good Computer Science/Cybersecurity programs and also had to be cheap because I dont want to be a burn to my parents. I got accepted to Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology for its preparatory program where you learn Russian and then you start your bachelors degree. Here is the issue, I dont know which one would be the best choice for me. If I stay and go to my community college I would go to a four year university after obtaining an associates degree. Triton college has some benefits as I can apply for special scholarships to some good universities and I would be immediately accepted due to some programs between institutions. I would later see where I could obtain my masters degree in Cybersecurity. If I go to MIPT I wouldnt have to worry about staying without a proper visa but I would have to leave my family. I would do the preparatory program and then obtain a bachelors degree. For my masters degree I would be between staying in Russia or moving to Europe. I know French and Spanish as they are both my first language. (Got a 5 in my AP spanish exam and I already passed the French brevet) Could you help me out?

During the interview, I bombed as I expected to bomb, even though it wasn't nearly as bad as the other, in-person interviews. We had a zoom interview and he asked me super easy tech questions, which I knew I should know and that I once did, but still had to silently google search them while I bullshitted him. Apparently I did well enough to not scare them away. The job would have me surrounded by PhDs and other M.S. colleagues. I can feel the drowning sensation just thinking about it. I have $60k in student debt. The job offer is a fucking miracle, but there's very little chance I could ever contribute to their product in a meaningful way. I'd be stealing money, essentially.

Accepting the job means my financial problems go away (if only temporarily) but at the cost of my mental health and an old friend's respect. As I type this, I think a better question than the title would be ""Please talk me out of accepting""."
289,cybersecurity,Advice,Advice for a student soon to be in college and the real world?,1,h92sz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/h92sz2/advice_for_a_student_soon_to_be_in_college_and/,2020-06-15 08:04:45,"Hello r/Advice! I'm pretty new here so please inform me of and correct my mistakes if any. I'd like to ask for advice on what I can do as a student to prepare for what my parents like to call ""the real world."" For the last 3 months of quarantine, I've been planning what I can do to better prepare myself, but I end up just not knowing where to start. I have the power of the internet and a lot of determination, the only other thing that would help me on my quest is if you wonderful people could offer some wisdom. A bit about me. I'm a sophomore, I do pretty well in school and have extra-curriculars. I (apparently) can write and I am very comfortable expressing myself in English, even though it is not my first language. I have a passion for games, television, and film. I love technology, but I have to admit that I don't know much. I'm studying more about building PCs and cybersecurity, which I believe would be important assets to me. I have some knowledge and experience with Photoshop (enough to get me by), I'm learning a third language, and I think my biggest asset would be my knack for solving problems. Where I lack though, is in the experience and application of my knowledge. I recognize that it isn't enough just to know textbook definitions and pass quizzes. I am not all that confident in my skills, I struggle to juggle responsibilities, and I have difficulty communicating and working with other people. I have a tendency to just do all the work myself because most of the time, I am dissatisfied with my peer's work. I always strive for the best and I've found that some just do the bare minimum to comply. There are not a lot of job opportunities for someone as young as me where I am, so I haven't had many chances to explore and discover what I'm capable of besides through school projects. Soon, I'll be filling out college applications and writing essays. To be honest, other than filling out basic details, there isn't a lot that would qualify me to go to a good university. If I was in charge of choosing which students could go for an interview, I'd be throwing my application out. What I've heard that might boost my chance and help me is if I made a resume and built a portfolio. What can I do as early as now that can help me develop my skills? Maybe possibly even online? What do you recommend I do? Any general college/life tips? Maybe pass down a secret college recipe? Any response at all would be greatly appreciated. If you made it until the end of this post, thank you for your time. I appreciate you even just reading through my ramblings."

The job I have now is a variation on my dream- making a living sharing the joy of making music with special needs children. However, the pay is garbage. There's no paid time off, no health insurance, and worst of all not really any likelihood of pay increasing by any reasonable amount. The one raise I was offered after over a year was 50 cents per hour. This work can also become incredibly emotionally/mentally draining, leaving me with nothing left to work on my hobbies at home. Most importantly, it keeps me grounded to a desert city I no longer have any interest living in. I have no real friends or family here. I have a 4-5 month emergency fund and 2-3 places to stay for free in the Pacific Northwest for a while. I have a very low cost of living since I have roommates and walk to work (don't own a vehicle/insurance). Everything I own except some furniture that I can sell fits inside a vehicle. I want to leave this desert city as soon as possible since the only thing keeping me here is a job and a lease. &amp;#x200B; **What I want** - I first and foremost want to relocate to the Pacific Northwest where I have friends and a climate similar to the one I grew up in full of trails and nature. I'm looking for a job that could cover my basic cost of living with only working around 30-32 hours per week or a flexible schedule so I could have time and energy to pursue my passion for hiking, educate myself on cybersecurity and software development (either as hobbies or primary income streams), and still have some time leftover to write and practice music. I'm studying for the CompTia A+ certification every day to hopefully get my foot in the door to the tech field where I could potentially have more freedom and spend less time working in order to cover my expenses. **What I need help with** - Does it seem worth it to take the CompTia exam, or are there maybe other options for flexible (not 9-5, M-F) schedule jobs without a college degree that can earn 40-50k at entry level? I legitimately enjoy tech which is why I'm self-educating/practicing it every day. What kinds of jobs could I look for that would leave me with enough time energy to hike, learn, and practice hobbies while funding a modest/simplistic lifestyle? What factors should I consider before making the jump? I'm ready to rent a car and leave as soon as I find somebody my roommates feel comfortable taking up the remainder of my lease. I'd like to find a job first, but I wouldn't mind a month or two gap."

To preface, I am 21. Male. A few pounds overweight but I think my scale is just trying to flatter me. All jokes aside, I am in my local college for IT. I just got some news that itll be 3 more semesters before I can graduate due to some scheduling errors and disparities. I am currently a security guard at a local plant. I make pretty decent money, enough so that I can pay the bills and invest some and still have some to waste and enjoy things. I absolutely love technology. Im going for a cybersecurity concentration at my school, and boy do I enjoy it. I am constantly learning about stuff and Im fascinated by the whole field. My issue is that I hate my current job. I work a 10 hour night shift. During those hours, I either sit on a gate and check badges, or I ride around and check out the different sections. Did I mention that this huge plant is effectively shut down since 2012? Yeah, I Guard a huge shell of a plant that maybe employs 50 people, 20 of which are other guards. My job involves next to nothing in effort. It is mind numbing. Yet, thats kinda the issue. I hate it. I dont know why, but thats not what Im here to figure out, really. Ive tried thinking positive, Ive tried entertaining myself, Ive tried a lot. I still dread waking up on my work days. Its starting to effect most sectors in my life. I dont have the drive to study or read or write anymore. My schoolwork is becoming more and more of a chore, despite the fact that I enjoy the content for the most part. I dont want to call it depression, as I dont think its that, but I dont know. But I do know that feeling like this isnt normal. I started feeling like this some time ago. So I took some initiative and started studying for my A+ cert, and I plan on getting that in a week or two. I dont really live in a tech hub, so the IT opportunities seem few and far between, and Im scared that I may not be able to find a job with just A+ and an unfinished degree. I have some selling points (secret clearance, several courses taken on my own accord, very strong interpersonal communication skills from my time as a corrections officer and as an MP), but it just feel like the jobs that would consider me are far away. I realize that Im just going off on a rant here, so Ill pause it for now. I need advice on my whole situation. On finding a job that doesnt bring me down, on procuring an IT job, on feeling better. Just hit me with your best shot. Thank you."

My mom works at target so everything has to be based around her and her schedule. I've been applying to all the jobs I can but I have had 0 luck.

I'm also trying to get into a industry that can not only be easily worked remotely, but will also still have use in the potentially changed economy in the next few years. I also love telling stories and designing things, and I feel that videogames may become the next great creative medium for fantastical storytelling, but that's just an opinion. On the other hand, I believe cybersecurity is terribly important in our day and age, and I would love to help small businesses and companies keep their data secure.

That time I really learnt it.It has grown out of me, this is what I figured in last four days and thats why I am scared. I tried re-visiting it, but its feeling very ... Thats why my wish of targeting 3.5 grade. Please provide me objective accordingly. This is my humble request. I have realization that I might have passed the course more smoothly, by being present at labs and just grinding hard working through list by list. Individual lists, a list now, another list then. in last semester or infact even a year before that. Might have found a good lab partner for work distribution. dont misunderstand me here, in no way I am claiming that it is as if you stopped me from coming to labs regularly. I didnt mean any disrespect. I have realization of it. I regret over it everynight. Wish I would have done something differently. Please forgive me once. dare I say in another world, I'd love to be in your classes. :) P. S. Details: Of where I stand in my knowledge, from my personal assessment Lecture part; its more or less fine, nothing scary here. I had read all your lectures in past. And understood the concepts, definitions, theory. Mostly confident here. Will read it few more time. lab part; I am okay with front end - comfortably wrote HTML, CSS part. javascript yes - with sometimes referring to syntax reference guide. the backend: I was learning from tutorials at youtube, sometimes W3school. Anyways, I feel okay with stuff like, field validation, Form element read and display, flask heroku install deploy. Then pop-up alert, calendar to fill date. Then okish with session Not very comfortable: database executing, but tried playing with it using youtube tutorials, plugged in syntax. Ajax, I am struggling now with it very much to implement it practically. though I understood definition, theory and mechanism of it.I understand significance and use if hashing password. md5. Its not like I am totally NIL on this subject. Just not proficient. And I dont think I can sharpen myself more in practical. On the other hand, there is some space for improvement in theory - I feel I hadnt memorized enough last time. I have gone far away from being a web developer. I have worked in service desk and in the areas of cybersecurity. And cybersecurity is the stream I am looking to grow in. I like it. Will theoretical knowledge and that of lectures, combined with practical of many elements of frontend and few elements of backend be enough to pass ? Thank you."

I ended up getting arrested and after searching my phone the police also arrested the guy above me. The guy saw me in prison and since then I've always worried about retribution. Recently my gf's phone was seemingly hacked, with someone sending a friend of her's a load of complete gibberish through instagram DM's, and a photograph of me that her friend said was just my face in the corner then the rest of the photo was just a glitched out screen - said it looked like a photo from her phone that had been glitched. Obviously this was pretty unnerving considering my past. So my question is - is it possible for this be a bot or something along those lines? Like would a bot have capacity to access instagram and send gibberish to a person, and send a photo from the account owner's phone? We were out when this happened and my girlfriend didn't have mobile data on so I'm confused as to how a hacker/bot could have accessed her camera roll and instagram. I'm not very technically knowledgeable in these matters so if there's anything important I've left out just give me a shout If this was a deliberate hack then it seems like a very complex method to maybe scare me TLDR: People may be after me, GF's phone was hacked by bot or hacker, but can a bot access phone camera roll and instagram DM'S?"

To put it simply: I cannot remain satisfied with one type of career, one type of learning, nor living in the same area for too long. I am 23, work full-time, and am newly married. My wife is supportive of finding my way; but my parents are not. I have studied a wide variety of things since I started college at 17. I have gone from pre-medicine, to communications, to finance, to software development, to  Networking or Cybersecurity. Thanks to reservist education benefits, schools cost is nonexistent for me. Ive worked in several industries while in school (I knew for sure the broke college-student archetype wasnt for me). My interests vary widely, but Id say finance, software development, and IT are where my heart lies. My issue is that I cant do it all. I feel like multiple versions of myself want different things at the same time. Im working in IT but I keep thinking is the grass greener elsewhere? Should I study and graduate in something other than what Im in? I have a wife to take care of, but I dont want to sell my soul for a salary The problem is compounded by the fact that I get bored of living in the same area beyond 3 years. I could best describe it as wanderlust mixed with wanting to take in all the world has to offer. Maybe Im easily bored, or maybe Im out of my mind; but Im getting too old for this imo. I want a fulfilling life, but Id like to find the niche I fit in to attain that. Shotgunning my way through areas and industries isnt working fast enough for me. I dont want go through everything and after many years find out that there is nothing that is a perfect match for me."

I have some questions on what it is you need to have figured out before you move out and I was hoping maybe some of them can be answered. 1.How much money should you have saved up?(I know this is based entirely on how much the rent is and the down payment and all that but still) 2.How do you find a job that is in proximity to where you want to live? What if you can't?(The answer may be an obvious one but I'm just wondering) 3.What are some things to keep an eye on when you're trying to find yourself a place?(i.e things pertaining to the condition of the apartment, the landlord, or the neighborhood. 4. Should you move out of state or stay?(I definitely want to venture to a new state, maybe Denver one day, but I'm not sure if my first time moving out should be like that) These are the main questions I have but if you could give any more information that could be useful that would be a huge help!

Background: I (25 F) have my bachelor's in international security with a minor in Arabic. I will be graduating with my master's in cybersecurity in May of 2021. I have work experience in retail, but more recently as an accountant. At this time, I am completing an internship as an IT auditor with a major international company, and in a few months I will be taking on another internship (this one more focused in management, but technology to some degree as well) with a defense company. Even though I'm still young, I've gotten a little experience under my belt. I've traveled, gone through a couple serious relationships, and faced various struggles throughout my life (loss of family, homelessness, working 3 jobs at a time, etc.). While I am always growing and learning, I'm old enough by now to have a decent sense of who I am, what I like, and what I want. This is as follows: **My number one priority is making money and building my career. I want to go down whatever career path is going to allow me to climb the ladder and work toward a career where I make $200K+ per year.** I'm a hard worker, borderline workaholic, and I'm very happy that way! I like technology, math, etc. well enough, but I really thrive when working with people in a management capacity. I'm very organized, ambitious, and on top of it. That being said, I can learn pretty much anything, and I'm willing to do just about any job if that's what I need to do to make the money/progress I want to make. I don't want the traditional husband and kids set up, although I would love to adopt one day. This affords me the flexibility to move around and tailor my life to the career and income I want to earn. I love traveling, I'd be more than happy to work abroad.

I'm currently taking classes at the local community college and am on track to get my associate's degree. I'm sure the regular answer to my question would be just that, my college classes. The problem is that for the past two classes I've had, the instructor has only relied on the online material such as a textbook and a website called Testout. Basically you just read a shit ton of things and answer multiple choice questions at the end. In Testout you do the same except its videos of people talking about the subject and you have little lab simulator things here and there. I feel like I'm not exactly learning much and retaining the information. I'm sure if I go back through my previous lessons multiple times I could understand better, but I only have Testout for a certain amount of time. I'm worried that when I'm in my later CIS classes, I'm gonna be behind. How did you learn the things you needed for your career? Could you give me some advice? I know that I'm only 16 and I have plenty of time to learn but, I'm graduating high school this year and I want to be ready for the career I want."

Usually these jokes are completely harmless (and actually pretty funny now that I look back on them), but I still get offended. For example, I had a huge crush on a girl, and everyone joked about how she was gonna marry me or be my gf or something. Another time, I told someone that I wanted to study cybersecurity, and that I like Payday 2, and he was like ""oh boy he's gonna start hacking into banks"".

I'm a 16 year old guy, I've always been I guess above average in school, unless it's math, I'm absolutely terrible at math. I'm currently in my junior year of highschool, however due to me being in I guess the right place at the right time, I'll be able to graduate this year which is pretty exciting. Unfortunately I dont know what's going to happen with coronavirus so I dont know if I'll be going back to my classes but, I'll just have to see what happens. 2019 was probably the worst year of my life, and that may sound stupid considering I'm just 16 but, a lot of shit happened that made it a miserable year. My dad is in the military, well WAS, he retired recently. We lived in a couple places but El Paso was my favorite, we stayed there for about 3 and a half years. In 2019, I found out my dad had been cheating on my mom again(Yes again, it's happened before). I found out that I guess he would go on tinder and say he was looking for just hookups and nothing serious, and that he would go on dating websites and pose as a woman. My sister who is 18 was going through my parents closet while they weren't home and she found a thing that had sex toys, dildos, anal beeds, etc. Turned out that my dad was seeing 2 women, he would get drunk a lot and go drive. He was actually arrested recently but I dont know what happened with that becuase he's out now. He would leave at night and not come back until really early in the morning. He left on easter, new years, christmas, the weekends, etc. My mom I guess decided it was enough so they got a divorce and we moved to where we live now. I'll be honest, after hearing all the shit that happened with my dad, I lost a lot of respect for him and I didn't know what to think of a lot of shit. We went from a pretty good house and good neighborhood and good school to an apartment in a ok neighborhood and a somewhat good school. 2019 was actually the year I got my first official girlfriend, which was really great for the short time it lasted. I liked her, a lot, and we got close and it turned out she liked me too. We only dated for a month and a half which I'm aware isn't a long time by any means but, it still really hurt when she decided to end things. It was one of those situations where its like ok, she wasn't the one but, I just really wanted her to be. I was super down about that for a while and while I still get sad thinking about it, I'm way better than I was. I believe I became depressed and developed anxiety, I don't know, I never feel like, 100% happy, not just because of the breakup, but because of, everything. I'm fairly insecure about my body. I worry about shit like my libido and if my testosterone levels are too low because I was unable to get hard with my ex gf which took a huge hit to my self esteem. Also I guess I could mention I watch porn, being a 16 year old and all. I've thought that that is the reason for me not being able to get excited for her but, doesn't really matter much now. I've been trying to stop so that hopefully if I find someone new, I can be the best I can be for them. I'm taking classes at the local community college along with my highschool classes. I'm currently going after a degree in Cybersecurity. I've been trying to get bigger and work out more because I'm a fairly skinny guy but it's been hard to stay consistent. I'm overwhelmed with the fact that once highschool ends, I'm gonna need to get a job, a car, save up money so that I can move out. My ex was in the same situation I'm in, we're both 16, both graduating early, taking classes at the college. I just feel so, alone, my best friends are back in El Paso and while I like the people I've met here, it just isn't the same. I can't tell my mom or grandparents that I prefer El Paso over where I'm at now because they will get pissed at me. I also I guess have a bit if anger issues, I get really irritated with my mom and sister, they do a lot of shit but whenever I get angry, they as well as my grandparents always say its because of my dad. I don't know how many people are going to read this but, if you did, thank you so much and if you think that I'm just being an entitled whiny teenager then, I guess that's cool I'm looking to use this time being quarantined as a way to reflect and realize what my priorities are.

I did this because cybersecurity brings in a lot of money and job security right out of college. Its a very stable, money making, and in demand job. A few days ago I listened to a podcast about doing an Ikigai. It is where you write: things you love, are good at, can make money off of, and what the world needs. A combo of all of these is your passion. All the things I wrote down had nothing to do with computers other than money and maybe architecture. I really enjoy music and films. Ive been thinking over the week and I have always been interested in music and film. I was looking at my colleges plan of study on film and all the classes seem so fun and something I would actually enjoy. The thing is there is no job security or much money in film. And I also really enjoy making money. If only I could do something I enjoyed, and make lots of money. Maybe I do a dual degree? cybersecurity and film major and psychology minor? The thing is, do I go with a job that has money and security, or do I go with something I enjoy, but not guaranteed money and job security? If you do a job enough, even if you are passionate about it, you start to not enjoy it because its your job. so might as well do something that makes you money rather than not? Be unhappy and rich rather than unhappy and poor haha. Any advice?"

Currently my major is cybersecurity as my school has an associates in Cybersecurity as well. So I thought I could either do cybersecurity or computer programming.

I also have very good social skills Id say thats my best skill as well as learning quickly. I also get a lot of anxiety with it because people will say this that companies dont care about degrees anymore, then immediately do but then want to pay you less with that degree when your already needing a good salary to pay off that debt to earn the degree. Is it possible to get a really good paying job with an associates degree in like computer programming or Cybersecurity? Or any other fields?

Today she started getting emotional and uncomfortable over gun control and almost had to walk out of the class. What the fuck? Like I am not against issues like this, but why the fuck is it happening in this class? She also gets defensive when you disagree with anything she says. She did mention something about facial recognition, but that was about it when it came to tech and she had to make that about race too. She said that white people who create facial recognition software are racist just bc some people at a company mistakenly don't detect someones face who isn't white. What the hell do I do?

I am so irritated that this woman has basically turned a class-- that has these things involved but with a HEAVY technology focus, into a class where she can force her political opinions on us. She gets visibly bothered when people don't say what she wants to hear. When she realizes students don't agree with everything she says, she will try and convince them that they are wrong. She is probably 26 years old maximum and is a grad student. She honestly can probably get in trouble for it but you never know with how liberal colleges are. FYI I'm not Republican so it's not me being biased, it's just that I have had enough of this shit. This damn class is listed as Cybersecurity as I said, yet we talk almost nothing of Cybersecurity. Example of her using tech as an example: Her: There have been cases of facial recognition not recognizing dark skin tones. Student: I think it is fair to to assume the person may have not meant to be racist, it was just an error in programming( A professor the semester before proved to the class it wasn't racism in the case she discussed.)

I'm starting at my local community college with an Associate in General Studies with a focus on cybersecurity and programming. I'm hoping that I will be able to transfer to a university after that depending on what my living situation looks like. Currently, I'm in a unique living situation where my parents are allowing me to stay with them rent free until I pay down some debt (non school related) that I've accumulated/for at least the next year. I was thinking that I'd try to get a part time job that pays decently that will allow me to schedule my classes when I need to but will also allow me to pay my bills and possibly save some cash. If I end up going for a Bachelors, I would like to have it finished and be working in my field by the time I turn 30. I have a background in Business Development and Sales currently with some marketing experience. My current job has brutal and unforgiving hours (car salesperson) so it will absolutely not work for what I'm planning to do. Let me know what your thoughts are. I'm looking to transition into a new job before summer registration opens in March. Thanks :)"

The only school that is accredited in my state is on the other side of the state and very expensive so going there is not an option. I just dont know whether switching to an accredited computer science program would give me the proper training to then gateway into cybersecurity. I plan on permanently moving after graduating. The state I plan on moving to has 5 school I could get an accredited cybersecurity degree from. My current plan would be to go and finish a computer science bachelors and then once I move states, go to an accredited school for cybersecurity there. I just dont really have advisors at my school who have any grasp of this sort of thing and I need help. If this is the wrong sub I apologize but I appreciate the help."
332,cybersecurity,Advice,Is it normal to feel paranoid and creeped out at my new cyber security job?,1,ewmqea,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ewmqea/is_it_normal_to_feel_paranoid_and_creeped_out_at/,2020-01-31 21:49:35,"For context, Im a parent, Im older and I have 3 kids. No drugs or alcohol. I decided to change careers and went back to college for cyber security. Learning about it has been awesome. Ive done very well. Im at the top of my class. Recently, I got an internship. There are 6 students in the program. We all work in the SOC. I was nervous to go in the SOC. There are so many amazingly talented people in there, from forensic investigators to penetration testers... the company is a big company. You would know absolutely know who they are. But something is... *off*. The first week we had training. They really pushed the corporate agenda, how amazing this company is. The other interns and I were pinching ourselves. The company values and culture are very modern forward thinking, and they really seem to value their employees. So many amazing programs it took days to explain it all. Cool. But then we get back into the SOC. I quickly learned that things arent as perfect as they would have me believe. I learned about the various office politics. (Typical stuff at most companies) I was given a laptop that belonged to my manager (a pen tester). I see that it has remote viewing software on it and my screen can be viewed without my knowledge. Then I learn that each desk has a sensor to monitor my habits. I dont know for sure what it monitors but I know measures motion and heat. And finally, all this is made worse when I searched the company and found some posts written by a few disgruntled employees who insisted that this company invaded their privacy and the privacy of others by having a manager shoulder surf their passwords to things like their bank. The person then went on to explain other unethical things that the company did. I just have a bad feeling. I dont have to stay at this job for more than a year, its just an internship. But Im concerned that Im starting to feel paranoid and spied on. When I got home yesterday I took my work laptop and locked it in a closet upstairs. Im afraid to use it on my home network so I am making a guest network for it even though it uses a VPN. I wont let my cellphone join their network and I keep my Bluetooth off. I lock everything up when I leave. I googled these sensors and the company that deployed them and its all very vague. So my question is: is it normal to feel paranoid when you start working in cybersecurity? Does anyone have any sort of job that uses sensors to monitor your activity? Will I always feel this way or will I adjust? I feel so creeped out right now and I am wondering if I made a bad decision in choosing my field.  I can post some screenshots of the other posts by the disgruntled employees if anyone is interested. Maybe these guys were just crazy and spreading lies? But they dont seem to be just the ramblings or psychotic persons."

I am not the kind of guy who gives up, but lately I haven't been myself. My name is Simo but you can call me Niffin, I am currently a university student and I am taking a CyberSecurity course and I haven't been feeling well lately. But the thing is... I think I might have been going through some kind of depression because I don't really feel motivated to do anything. I don't even get out of bed to go to class anymore... I have always been a nerd/geek so I spend pretty much 80% of my time in front of a computer. I love doing CyberSecurity challenges and all that.. and I learned a lot from every single one of them. Now, I am thinking about giving up on the course because: 1 - when I used to go to class I didn't really ever learn anything new or exiting 2 - I don't really go to class anymore 3 - I'm not as comfortable as I used to be in those classes 4 - I want to study math by my own so I can get to a higher level course This are the main 4 reasons between many of them. Now I am asking you... How do I tell my parents I want to give up? Should I do it? I feel lost and not really motivated to go to class anymore.. what should I do?"

I'm 22 and living at home with a minimum wage job at a petrol station. I have a degree in Computer Games Design which I achieved a Second Class Honours: First Division. So far this seems more of a hindrance than a help and I wish I studied something more generic like computer science or even something relating to cybersecurity. I'm currently applying for every job under the sun as I'm really not happy with my current job but I need the money. I do enjoy computer games design once I get started and have released two games on the app store but I feel my degree is totally useless as I cant even get an interview in my field. I'm considering going back to college to study in another field but I'm not sure if that's the right choice.

I became the worst version of myself and was a full time pothead instead of a full time student. I passed some classes but dropped or failed a good majority. I came back home last fall and began community college where I picked a new major(cybersecurity) and fell in love with all of it. I am currently on track to obtain my A.A.B in Cybersecurity next December. I work 3 days a week for 12 hours each day, 36 hours a week night shifts Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. I love my schedule and have fallen into a good routine. I focus on school the beginning half of the week and finish the week with work. I am making decent money $17.40 an hour before taxes and have been able to save money for the first time in my life. I currently live at home with supportive parents and they are great if I dont need anything. But when I do need something they always fall back on how I was a pothead and threw away 2 years of school for nothing. Ive struggled with a lot of stuff and my parents holding that over my head is so hard to handle sometimes. With all the context above would you move out and try to heal the relationship with some distance? I love my parents and we get along but when I mess up or want to hangout with my friends , Im the bad guy who was a loser for 2 years.

I am pursuing a career in cybersecurity, hopefully for the government. I want to either do it with Air Force as an officer or through the FBI. I am currently considering two options for school next year: Michigan State and join Air Force ROTC (which would train me to be an officer as soon as I leave college), and go to community college in Alabama and then transfer to a 4-year university and get an internship with the FBI (they have a location in the area I am looking at going to school). I'm going to list pros and cons of both options. Both schools have great computer science degrees and offer the potential for a full scholarship. &amp;#x200B; **Michigan State (AFROTC)** \-*Pros:* Place to live (dorm/apt), already involved in a group, easy atmosphere to make friends, already know some people there, guaranteed job out of college, sporting events, 1.5 hours away from home (offers independence with the option of going home if I forgot something), could get about 3 or more free meals/week from family/family-friends \-*Cons:* Not able to work and do ROTC, wouldn't have roommates (have to room with a random), big class sizes, no guarantee I get cybersecurity within AF &amp;#x200B; **Alabama** \-*Pros:* Huntsville has countless cybersecurity opportunities (Army arsenal, FBI, NASA, Research Park), family nearby ('Im originally from there), can work and go to school, start at community college for cheaper and smaller classes, lots of good food, even if FBI doesn't work there are other options, church plug-in, around other like-minded people (insane Auburn fans lol) \-*Cons:* Would have to completely remake friends (hard at a community college), nowhere to live (I'll explain that next), I would pretty much lose all my MI friends (including my best friend who is like a brother to me :( ), wouldn't get in-state tuition for at least a year (at community college) &amp;#x200B; So regarding nowhere to live in Alabama, I have grandparents and an aunt/uncle in the area. My grandparents are about 40 minutes from school and my grandfather has severe PTSD, he doesn't sleep well at night and moves from bed to bed to bed. Also, they have paper-thin walls and I don't want to keep them up all night if I'm gaming with some of my friends. They also have awful internet. My aunt and uncle have two little girls and no extra rooms. Basically my only option would be to live alone in an apartment, which I've never done before. It would be near impossible for me to work enough to pay rent and food and everything else while being a full-time student. &amp;#x200B; Any input is appreciated. Thank you (sorry for the long read)"

We were on the same page with kids!) 2. He would divorce me if I fulfiled my life long dream of enlisting in the navy. (he is in the navy) Thankfully we had a conversation and: 1. He admitted he does want kids, he just scared they will turn out to be bad people and he will have failed as a parent. 2. He was okay with the idea of me going reserves.

348,cybersecurity,Advice,I've never felt so lost,1,dccqfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dccqfs/ive_never_felt_so_lost/,2019-10-03 02:37:53,"To preface this, I am a 20-year-old female. I attend one of the biggest schools in my state and my major is Telecommunications with a minor in Cybersecurity. I am so unhappy. I don't feel anything. I went to a different school during my first semester freshman year of college, then left that one to attend a community college in my hometown. After about a year there, I left to attend the school I am at currently. I have been at this school for about 10 months now. Everything was going fine, I had a great part-time job that fit into my schedule, a pretty solid schedule for classes (except that one darn 7 pm lab!) and an okay social life because a lot of my close friends in high school go to this school. Though, my social life is not perfect. I've never even had a boyfriend, or let's be real, one even closely resembling one. I don't take risks, I don't let loose and make stupid mistakes. I don't really have anything interesting or fun to show for my life. But, overall, everything was going as well as it could be going. I knew I didn't get excited or feel much in general, but I thought I could stomach it until I graduated. How long can a person go without feeling much of anything without having a complete and utter self-implosion? I don't even know why I am in school honestly. I have absolutely no passions in life. I have tried so many different things from film studies, business, computer science, and now telecommunications. I hated high school and learning, but it was always expected of me to move onto college once I finished high school. My mom always tells me ""You can do whatever you want, just get your degree first."" So I've been in school for 2 years now, and I just learned I still have 3 more to go before I am able to graduate. 3 years is such a long time to be unhappy. I could try to take more classes, but that would make life even more miserable as I would have even less time to do things I want to do. The way I see it, I have two options at this point: 1. Stay in school. Spend three and a half more years feeling nothing, not having time to do anything that makes me happy (besides getting high at the end of my day, the only release I feel I have anymore), and ending it all with a degree I'm not even interested in or passionate about. The only thing that makes me want to stay here is the (not even promised) idea that I'll get good money and finally have the time to spend it on things I actually care about (which I don't even know what that is). 2. I could leave school, disappointing my family and wasting the advantages I have to go to school in the first place. Though, when I think about leaving this fucking state, just getting an entry-level job, and just living life without having to invest so much time into things I couldn't give less of a shit about, I don't know how I feel. Wouldn't I be screwing myself out of a better future? Will I regret this down the line? Will I have lost my shot at being the best I can be? So, in conclusion, I am utterly and completely lost. What are you suppose to do when the only ambition you have in life is to be happy?"

354,cybersecurity,Advice,I've been suffering from panic attacks at work while stuck waiting on other teams to complete work.,1,cxaegg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cxaegg/ive_been_suffering_from_panic_attacks_at_work/,2019-08-30 11:51:46,"I (F28) work in cybersecurity. A lot of my work involves designing/reworking systems and processes, being deeply involved in projects from start to finish (DevSecOps of the systems that were designed), and dealing with audit. It's in the financial space so... Pretty important and high stress to begin with. Before I moved to this job, I was a security engineer in a smaller company so I was much more hands on in the security space in dealing with networks, servers, etc. I also enjoy reverse engineering code so I have an even deeper background in aiding in development and implementation and troubleshooting--this stuff is important because I was always the type to be able to fix stuff as I go without relying on other people. Right now I'm in the middle of a project that was supposed to wrap up at the end of July. I encountered a huge issue with vendor written code and expressed my concerns and recommended that we not go live until resolved. This project is a MAJOR project for me, my boss, and our tier of the department in general. There is an audit finding tied to it that has a deadline of September 30th and we have spent a lot of money on this. This vendor has not been as speedy as I would hope in remediating the issue and it's frustrating because I'm actually pretty good at solving these kind of problems. Three weeks ago I pointed out the section of code where I believed the issue was happening and two days ago they sent us an email saying they think they found the issue...in the exact same section of code that I told them weeks ago!!! So it's bad enough to see the issue and be unable to do anything, but worst to know that I was flat out ignored which resulted in 3 weeks of lost time. There's also another process my group oversees but relies on another side of technology to actually be able to pull off the process (we use their software to run this process but don't technically touch the systems). This broke during an upgrade another faction of technology did and it's been terribly frustrating waiting for them to remediate--especially since I'm more than willing to help but I am not granted the permissions to the database to do so (seperation of duties issue and one I completely understand in cyber). I'm both these cases, the other parties still don't seem invested nor understand the urgency of these issues, and having a hands on technical background before this job has made me horribly anxious. Despite my constant offerings to help, me spending hours pouring over code to pinpoint issues, troubleshooting network connections and re-creating API feeds, etc etc to move the processes along...it just doesn't seem to matter to these other parties. As a result, I'm constantly checking my email after work hours and first thing in the morning after I wake up just to see if there are updates. I'm stressed out knowing my boss (awesome guy) is going to take the heat if we don't make deadlines when absolutely none of this is his fault. This is the first major project that I've lead so maybe I just don't know how to handle the internal politics of all of this either. But this worrying has gotten so bad where I'm starting to have panic/anxiety attacks. I went to work yesterday morning and left after two hours because nothing was moving and I started to have a meltdown. Even after I went home and laid down off and on, I would check my email every time I woke up. I spent some time in the afternoon going through project documents. I need help to handle this ""control issue"" problem of mine. Mentally and physically I'm having a hard time coping lately knowing all of this is out of my hands right now. I know I've done all I can but that thought alone isn't helping me. I'm afraid I'm going to have a major meltdown the closer we get to the deadlines. It's gotten to the point where I'm dreading the up coming long weekend (losing Monday for labor day which is another day where nothing will get done) instead of looking forward to the time off for me to just relax. Tldr; high stress projects I'm in charge of are at a standstill due to other parties and the lack of control to change this is causing me to have panic attacks."

I have been studying IT for the last 2 years, and was strongly considered CyberSecurity for the future. However I got my first internship where I have been mostly working like a service desk technician. (It wasn't meant to be that way, but we got behind, so they used me for it, but I'm being paid so I don't mind) It does interest me, but only moderately. There are some parts that are cool, and some that just seem terrible. I see some people around me too who just seem unhappy with the IT sector, like they are stuck in 9-5s that they hate, and I don't want that to be me. However CyberSecurity of course is in massive demand, and pays really well. I have found a second calling however, I am interested in being a personal trainer. I love excercise, even though I'm not shredded or anything, and I really enjoy helping people meet their goals. I'm just good at it. I can motivate people to workout, and make them feel accomplished, and it's a very wholesome and fulfilling thing to experience. However I also know that the personal trainer market is kinda tough right now. There are a lot of people who want to be personal trainers, and the jobs simply don't pay well unless you manage to go independent and develop a good clientell, which intimidates me, as CyberSecurity has such a high demand, and good gauranteed pay behind it in contrast. Luckily I have been BLESSED with the opportunity to go to school tuition-free, so I have been doing that, and am about to get an AS in IT (In addition to the AA I had). However before I go forward with IT to get a BA in cybersecurity (And potentially a masters someday), I am thinking about taking some time to work as a personal trainer. I don't have any debts to pay off right now, and I have some money saved up as well. I also won't be getting my AS until the end of spring semester when I am 23 due to some administration problems on the school's end, but during that last sememster, I will only have one class. I can use the time between then and now to obtain most of the certificates I would need to work as a PT, and finish spring semester off with both PT certs, and an IT degree. My current plan is just to work as a PT for a while and see how I like it. Maybe I find that I love it, and I grow rapidly, and end up making plenty of money. Maybe I don't and end up defaulting back to IT. The only thing that scares me is the time. I just feel like at 22 I should have my career picked out. It makes me feel like I am behind everyone because I still don't know what I want. I have always envied people who have a clear goal in mind, and not knowing what I want to do with the rest of my life is scaring the hell out of me. I want something with good pay and job security, but I also want something that I truly find rewarding and enjoyable. But I'm also scared of wasting more years of my life in the wrong career field, and not moving forward as quickly. The whole thing is just scaring me, and I would appreciate your guys' advice."

I wrote this overnight and I'm going to sleep before work in the afternoon. I may be on intermittently after noon, but I'll be on tonight for sure. I appreciate everyone's patience, and thanks in advance. Please excuse typos. I'm short on sleep, I'm on mobile, and I'm trying my best to proofread but some things may get by. My autocorrect is fucked too. yes, I'm using a throwaway. I'm not sure if you could call this a mid-life crisis, but I'm at a major impasse, where a whole bunch of issues are tangled together, and as it stand's I'm just burning money. I can't trust my own judgement, and I don't trust anyone close to me to be honest and unbiased. By posting here I'm hoping to: (0) sort my own thoughts out (1) get a third-party opinion on things (""things"" explained below), am I making any big mistakes in your eyes? (2) get an idea on whether my plans going forward are realistic, optimistic, or straight up naive (3) receive any input on offer # CONTEXT ## A 200 page novel about my life ### Overview: I (21m) live at home with my parents (62m, 62f), and brother (27). I am a college student sitting at 90 credits (3 years on a 4 year degree) majoring in cybersecurity(more on this below). And I have a part time job as an [administrative assistant / concierge (?)] for the city. I take classes through the summer (since high school) instead of working a full time job and saving for the fall, so I have been relying on my parents for about half the money for my schooling (again expanded below). ### School: I graduated high school with a 3.8 GPA, ~30 college credits, and never had any issues academically. I entered college in fall 2016 with ~30 credits already completed (1 year at traditional pace (5 classes in fall &amp; spring)). I did not enjoy campus life. I attended a school whose student body was primarily online (something like 70% of enrolled students), in mediocre town, in the middle of nowhere. All the curriculum was online even though we were on campus. Attending class was trivial and ceremonious, as the lectures were almost always posted online anyway for the online students, and all assignments were submitted through their 'portal' (we'll call it a portal for anonymity - basically a website with Dropbox features). The height of this campus's social life amounted to sitting in my room with the door closed, playing video games - in a discord server with a handful of people from down the hall. I was isolated, had terrible diet, lacked stimulation, and followed a meaningless routine with my pseudo-online courses. I eventually started falling into depression, playing games more and more as an escape from the stress, and working less and less on my coursework. I failed most of my classes in the fall of 2017 and decided to move back home that winter, and resume as an online student from a more comfortable environment (at this time my brother was living a few states away). My parents had been working on building a new place, and Almost immediately upon returning home they sold our house and we moved into a newly built town home (so new in fact they had not yet run cable lines to them yet). It was too late to drop the classes and get a refund so I stuck it out, and ended up failing most of them again. This time due to technical difficulties utilizing their web based (flash) virtualization hypervisor (I have no idea, chalk it up to needing hard-line connection or something, the syllabus states needing a powerful internet connection, and I guess McDonald's wifi doesn't cut it). ### Family &amp; finance Now remember, I'm relying on my parents for financial support so every time I drop or fail a class I am obligated to hear my dad's fatherly advice about ""you're not putting in enough effort"" and ""there's always something you can do, but you obviously just didn't do it... Because if you had done whatever you needed to, you would have passed."" and my mom chalking it up to video games or sleeping habits or etc. These lovely discussions run toward the end of the semester and bleed into the discussions of me asking him for money (which is another paragraph) Since even before I started college I was under the impression that my parents had some kind of mysterious college fund for me since way back before my mom retired from the guard some 15 odd years ago. As such I've never been coy about asking them to cover what I couldn't for school. I figured they had it put away for exactly that reason. Ever since getting into college, when I had to pay my first bill, it seems I've had to twist my father's arm and he puts it off until the very last minute (even costing me hundreds od dollars in late fees at one point). Once I started failing/dropping classes the arguing often bled together with money talks, and me asking to dip into this mysterious account. My parents hate sharing info about their finances, which puts me in a bind since I am financially reliant. Well, I still don't know if that account exists, but my parents have made it vaguely clear that they are not as well off as I had been lead to believe, and that ""we don't have money for classes if you're going to fail them."" at this point I figured I had to get a loan to cover my classes as my parents are unwilling. So I set up a loan. I needed a cosigner, and my dad agreed at first... But then he kept saying he was busy and putting it off. The banker had called me 3 or 4 times to Confirm that I was still interested in the loan and that the agreement forms needed to be completed for him to get me the money. In the end my dad decided to tell me off, say that he didn't trust me and he wouldn't cosign because it put his credit at risk. Then after I resolve to take a semester off and withdraw my registrations since I can't afford it he drops the money in my account... Awesomesauce, but not at all worth all the stress. Makes me ask what the fuck? At this point we are still living at the town homes with no internet taking a bunch of courses where the only required resources are a textbook and a strong internet connection. I bought into the bullshit about how I just wasn't trying hard enough, and just needed to apply myself. I tried harder to complete these courses than ever before. At the worst point I had spent a cumulative 28 hours working on a lab that was designed to take 40 minutes all because I lacked the essential resources for the courses, namely ""a strong internet connection"". I was disillusioned from the bullshit about not trying hard enough, and the stress was causing me to push everyone away... I ended up following the same pattern as when I was on campus, isolating myself when I'm stressed. But since I couldn't play games without internet I wasn't even getting that minimum of contact. I just read books, listened to music, and cruised around town as my new form of escapism. And eventually I broke down. At the time a few ideas kept bouncing around my head: (1) I don't have the needed resources (2) my parents have said they will kick me out if I'm not taking classes (3) all of my money has gone to school, if I get kicked out I am on the streets (4) my parents insist I can't get a decent job without a degree. (5) I can't keep this up I remember driving around the city in tears trying to call my parents to talk about everything and get them to understand the stress I'm going through and how I can't keep doing this and they just kept turning it around on me. Summarily they said once more: ""u/iBlongInTheTrash you just aren't doing what you need to, and it's nobody's fault but your own that you failed/dropped those courses, you had all those mcdonalds' and coffee shops' wifi you could have used. Why didn't you?... I don't belive that, if you had, you'd have passed the class. I don't know what it is but it has to be something you're doing. You don't just fail courses u/iBlongInTheTrash, you fail them because you dom'5 do whatever it is you're supposed to..."" Eventually during this episode I brought up my suicidal ideation and how I needed help mentally. They offered to help me find a shrink. When I get home I'm told by my father in his 'authoritative voice' ""don't ever mention suicide to me again,"" and then he storms off from the kitchen. solid. Can really feel your capacity for empathy. To be fair, I have not brought It up with him since. We hardly spoke before but now... Rip meaningful relationships. In the end I ended up failing 2 of the 4 classes from that semester. Again I had been told that I would be kicked out, and on the streets if I wasn't in school and working so this pattern of taking and failing/dropping classes continued. And each time we'd argue about my lack of efforts. They find me a shrink a couple months after this incident through their church. I don't have any money 6 months after this incident, i He (the shrink) offered to accept whatever payment we could afford, so I ended up being the middle man negotiating money with my dad. My dad with his cryptic finances didn't want to set a price, neither did the shrink. Jesus fuck. Eventually a price get's settled and I'm seeing this dude regularly. It helped, but I don't think details are real crucial here. Everything from here on is a bit of a blur. I think we moved from the town home to the new house in the summer of 2018. From here on out I alternated between full time and part time student. Failing/dropping courses all along the way. Convenienrly I had a 1 hear head start coming in. Now I have a good internet connection but I'm also behind my usual pace. for someone who graduated in 2016 and is taking a 4 year degree I would have ideally graduated May 2019... But by now I'm on track to graduate May of 2020. And my parents have expressed that they ""are concerned I'm going to be living with them forever."" it's 2018. 2 years until I graduate. And they are talking like this. At the same time, my brother moves back in. Solid. conditions met to pass courses. Right. No. Now my schedule has to be flexible to keep up with all the family events my sister plans now that my brother is local again. Refusing to attend leads to sour interactions with the family. And I'm also losing sleep to his dog barking in the next room over whenever he has an early or late shift. He locks him in his cage because he's concerned that he'll get into something he shouldn't and it'll inconvenience my parents... # seeking advice on: At this point I'm unsure if I'm just making excuses or if these amount to legitimate hindrances. Anyway all this is mounted on top of my already waning motivation, growing stress, and disillusionment with a college education. The content is not difficult, but most of the professors are lazy, and I'm not able to focus due to poor /lack of rest. And rather than sweep through another set of classes with D's, when the content is easy enough I should be getting A's, only to argue about my 'lack of effort' and twist my dad's arm for the money HE OFFERED. I resigned myself to this set of courses, and have been looking for job listings relevant to my 3/4 of a degree (again cybersecurity... Between comp Sci and network administration). I have yet to submit any resume's / applications, though. I want to take a 6 month leave of absence for the next semester, get a full time job (IT prefferably), move out, and then resume my education from a more controlled environment. Where I'm not surrounded by stressful relations. I know I owe my parents a lot. I have not forgotten my debt to them, however bad our relationship is. And I intend to repay him in due time. However I cannot do that without Tldr; Keep getting mixed messages from parents about financial support, as things stand our already weak relationship is deteriorating and becoming more toxic. I don't want to leech off them, they don't want me leeching. But they want me to get a degree, and they will only support me while I remain in their house, an apparently detrimental environment to my studies. I want to get a job, move out, and start paying for my own classes to finish my degree on my own terms. is it naive to look for a full time job as an IT admin / network engineer with 3/4 of a 4 yr undergrad in cybersecurity (on hold, with intent to compete) and no ccna certifications?"

I was going to attend regis, with a pretty decent scholarship and grant as well. That being said, I'm having second thoughts. Even with the scholarship and grant it is going to be quite expensive. Plus, I was involved in the STEM shooting. Look it up if you aren't familiar. I really don't want to go back into a school setting, and I don't want to set myself up to fail at Regis. Not when it's still pretty expensive. I have until July 5th to give my final decision to a different college, an almost community college type college. But going into Cybersecurity, and since I'm not looking to stop at a bachelors degree, I'm wondering if it would be more worth going to Metro. Pros of Regis: It's more accredited It's a very nice school Cons: It's hecking expensive Pros of Metro: It's cheap I have more control and freedom over my paths Cons: It's not as good of a school Since I'm planning on going on to get a Masters because why not, and because Metro would let me, double major, I'm thinking it might be worth it. Plus, I'm not ready to either be in college or in school 24/7 pretty much. IDK. I'm not sure how this whole college thing works. My parents haven't really helped me. And the counselors at my high school had no interest in helping us at all. So I'm relying on you internet. What do you guys think? Because based on my knowledge, even though I would loose my deposit at Regis, I would be able to go to metro for half the price. So yeah. Edit: I also forgot to mention. I want to go into Information Security. I already have an A+ certification. I'm going to be getting a linux+ later this year, same with Net+ and hopefully Sec+. I'm working on these higher level certs. the degree as I've begun to realize is moreso just to tie it all together and finish it off. Regis doesn't offer many classes that can be easily related to these classes. Metro seems to."

362,cybersecurity,Advice,It's a mobbing?,1,c7kf23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/c7kf23/its_a_mobbing/,2019-07-01 08:18:38,"Hey guys, today my military reserve exercises began, and to be honest I already have enough of all of this. At the beginning I wanted to point out that I'm not some kind of snow flake, and I know the meaning of the hard work - I'm working as an ordinary seaman in the merchant navy. Long story short: my corporal (and other superiors) are just a fuckin bastard, at least in my eyes. Brief summary: He ordered me to shave my mustache today in three minutes. According to the rulebook, soldier can have a short mustache, but he didn't give a fuck about this. The problem is that I don't have any mustache, and what he considered as ""mustache"" was just a shaving residue. I have a very dark facial hair, so even after the cleanest shave, I still have some tiny single hairs visible. So, after this I ended with cutted face, because I tried do hard to shave this single hairs. But it isn't the whole story - this same corporal ordered me to do 30 pushups on the pavement because I told ""yes"" instead of ""yes,sir"". So I cutted my hands as well. In addition, he tries to make fun of me in the front of whole companion. I'm one step away from beating the shit out of this guy. It's a mobbing, or I'm just too delicate? The exercises themselves (by far) are also terrible - I live with 10 other people in one small room, and the beds are so shaky, that nobody could sleep. The only thing that I learned today was a making bed on the time in three different variants, and making a room perfectly clean. Oh, we also have only two T-shirts, two pairs and boxers, and three pairs of socks - good look with daily washing. We had a ten minutes to shower today, and there is only three cabines for something like 23 folks here. I expected that I would learn useful skills here, and not some Prussian discipline, because it's a course directly dedicated to become cybersecurity NGO, and not some fuckin trooper."

I have a pretty good relationship with my mom. Shes always been supportive and trusting of my choices, but now shes completely disregarding what I want, and trying to control how I transition into a different career. Long story short, Ive been in all sorts of jobs, none of them financially or intellectually satisfying, so at the beginning of the year I decided to go back to school to study information systems/cybersecurity. Im working on my Associates and I am really enjoying what I am learning. Im about halfway through the program now. My husband and I have always been very frugal. Were living on his income while I go to school full time, and money is tight, but its worth it to us that I get to concentrate full time on my schooling. I have not always made the most reasonable decisions: I have a bachelors degree in history, for example; I have quit jobs just because I didnt like them; My husband and I moved across the country a few years ago to experiment with living in a new place and attempting to find new careers, and that really didnt work out... So I acknowledge that I have a track record of making emotional decisions. But now Im working on my Associates and trying to follow through with this new career path. Yesterday my mom texted me out of the blue telling me that basically she found the job for me. She went on and on about this tech company in my area and how interesting the place sounds, and how the pay is great and I wouldnt even need to finish my degree program. But I want to finish my degree program. I want to get the degree and have the options and opportunities that come with having a degree and getting certifications, etc. I have talked to industry professionals, and they have told me that with my lack of experience in tech and my goal to promote and not just be entry-level for the rest of my life, its important that I get at least an Associates. I texted her back and thanked her for thinking of me and told her the above, etc., and she proceeded to call me. I told her how much I appreciate her help and support and how she was being a very loving parent for trying to help me out she interrupted me, scoffed, and told me not to discount this amazing opportunity. I tried to explain to her what I said above about wanting to finish the degree and how its important and she basically just dismissed it and was like, its just a certificate. I just kept trying to tell her that the job she heard about sounded like a great job, but that it isnt what I want. Its not even the kind of job I want! Not all tech jobs are the same, Mom. She told me that I dont trust her opinion, and I only trust researchers (whatever that means), and she said come on, what world do they live in? I asked her if she trusted me to make decisions for myself and she said she does, but it doesnt feel like it! At this point she reminded me that I am financially indebted to her. I told her if it was all about money, I could write her a check right now. She said it wasnt about the money, and was like, Ive never brought that money up before, have I? And I was thinking like, no you havent but you are bringing it up now! And then she was like, youre almost thirty... And I told her that I know that, and I think its ok that I dont have my shit figured out yet and that my new path is part of working on that! But that didnt seem to satisfy her. We had only a brief but heated conversation about it all and, since I was in the middle of an activity when she called, she said we should talk about it more at a later date. We both ended the phone call saying that we loved each other, and that we should just wait to talk about my hopes and desires career path in person sometime, but I could tell she was still really frustrated. Then later that day she started texting me job postings for random jobs! It just feels weird, like she wants to control the path I take. Dont get me wrong, I know that I am so lucky to have a loving supportive parent, but am I wrong to feel like shes overstepping and not respecting my boundaries as an adult? I am already filled with so much self-doubt, and all of this is sowing new feelings of insecurity."

I play MTG (Magic The Gathering) at a local TCG store near my house once or twice a week. I met a 40-year-old guy there who has attended the standard showdown (event) a few weeks in a row. Last week he asked me where I lived and we discover we live a few minutes from each other. This week he invited me over to his house however my parents told me not to ever go to someone's house that I ""truly"" don't know. They told me that a better idea would be meet in a neutral location like a local coffee shop and play there. Are my parents overreacting? My parents told me to stop being so desperate to make friends. I have very few friends now of days since all my friends in high school moved to different parts of the country.

We organized several workshops with our classmates to get a better understanding of how running an organization would look, prior to becoming an officially recognized club on campus. During winter break, we prepared all the necessary forms, attended all of our university's required meetings, and planned our agenda for the entire semester. As soon as the semester began, the other officers became focused on their academics, ignoring the workload of our club as a result. We were falling behind schedule, so I told them that I would take the initiative by planning our first meeting, announcing our club to the entire campus, and filed the necessary papers that we needed to receive funding for our organization. The day before our first meeting, the president told me that he would be stepping down as an officer in order to focus on his schoolwork. Another officer told me that she won't be able to contribute for the next 3-4 weeks in order to focus on her schoolwork as well. The last one has been pretty unresponsive. I feel like I was left to deal with a huge mess and I do not think that I can continue to run a huge club by myself (especially if I have to plan a unique workshop on a weekly basis). When I talked to the professor about the situation, he told me that he would try to find replacement officers for the club as well as try to get his classmates to present for the upcoming meetings. Since I am expected to have to organize and prepare the next 3 of the 11 meetings by myself (and I have no idea if I will receive any help beyond that timeframe) I asked if we can shorten the meeting times to once every other week, rather than continuing a weekly meetup. The professor declined that suggestion as he wanted a consistent meetup for our club. Since I was unexpectedly by left to manage a whole organization by myself, I do not think that I can single-handedly manage the workload, focus on school, and work. I feel like the officers left me to handle a huge burden and I want out. My question is, Should I quit? On one hand we did receive a decent amount of members on our first meeting and I do not want to disappoint them or my professor. On the other hand, I simply cannot manage any future meetings by myself, and I am not sure when I will be able to receive help. I'll be graduating next semester so I feel like I should be focusing on myself as well. "

However, we got in trouble because we used it on school MacBooks, which are supposedly constantly monitored. We basically used it for educational purposes primarily but also to gossip of course. However, all of us personally believe that it has helped us bond socially and allowed us to survive through hard classes. We had some social issues in freshman year w/ bullying but since then the ten of us have gotten much closer. About a day or two ago, the website was blocked and the assistant principal has addressed us directly because we ""made fun of others"" on it. He also claimed that the warning came directly from the superintendent (why would he be looking into this?). The school MacBooks still allow us to access the site at home, and even though our school Gmails are under the school administration, all of us used our personal emails to sign up on Slack. He also threatened that some cyber-security person would look into it. To be fair, we have said some mean and inappropriate things on there but they have not led to anything near cyberbullying or real life conflicts. We also are not flunking out of classes or completely not paying attention in class because of this. Also, we suspect that it was probably a student or teacher that snitched to higher authorities and we know for sure that no one out of the ten of us snitched. So my question is: How should we as a class address or resolve this problem? Would they have only found out because a student or teacher snitched, not through some bogus cybersecurity program? Should we address one of the officials (teachers/administrators)? Is it actually legal or possible for them to look into our messages? Is it any of their business to be looking into this subject matter? &amp;#x200B; Thanks so much for reading :D"

I bust my butt all month for less than I would make a week if I could get a real job. &amp;#x200B; We live in Northwest Indiana (near the border, so I'm willing to drive into Chicago to work). We fully own our house and car, so there's no payments there.

We buy clothes (only when completely necessary) at Goodwill on sale days. We aren't eligible for any government assistance (wife makes too much gross). There is no way we can reduce spending any further and we're going without a lot of things we really should be getting/doing. &amp;#x200B; We were doing okay until this past year, wife had some major medical issues and I had some major dental issues.

I take many classes that are available for free (like on [saylor.org](URL and such) but I don't have the money to take the tests for any of them. &amp;#x200B; So I have been applying to every type of job I can - fast food, cashier, etc. as well as stuff like helpdesk, technician jobs, Ubreakifix etc. I can't move (because of my wife's job) but I'm applying to everywhere in a pretty wide radius - since I'm already driving 75% of the day anyway, driving \~90 minutes to work would be better. &amp;#x200B; But I can't get anything.

For that I've always known I'd need a large amount of funding. Recently though, the best track to do that was I would become a software developer, work to reach management and in around 5 years or so make 6 figures to fund real estate investment that would eventually be the largest amount of my income so that I could fund my own research. Where I am at now: for the last year and a half I have worked as a teller at a small bank in my home town while I go to school in the evenings. I have done as much as I can to make myself as indispensable as possible. I have taken on as much other responsibility as I could and have done well. I oversee Cybersecurity and also work on introducing and implementing new technologies into the company, as well as being the best teller on the line. The CEO and head of the BoD have started mentoring me in hopes I would stay on here, although they know I have always planned on leaving. The other day, the CEO pulled me into an office to make sure I knew what I would be doing if I stayed here rather than leave. He made it clear that in 10 years when he retired he would be expecting me to be the new president, and him and the previous CEO would groom me for the position. If I decided to stay he would promote me off the teller line and into a loan office within the next few months after a short training program. Provided I have a large loan portfolio, I could be making 6 figures rather quickly (3 years or so). I'd be starting at around 50k a year (negotiable) and they'd pay for my schooling. In 8-12 years I'd be president. Both CEOs current and previous are well off and successful real estate investors, who would be willing to mentor me in both banking and that area. If I take this opportunity, I would be retired a millionaire before 50 with a possible ownership stake in the company. I am a very hard worker, i'm intelligent, and I am good in leadership positions. I don't doubt that I would do well if I did move on with my previous plan, but I fear I don't know enough about the industry to know if I'd be able to be better off working in it or staying. The CEO has made it clear that if I chose to try software development and come back that I haven't burned a bridge and the offer is open. So my best thought at the moment is to do an internship that I have planned for about 3 months before I get a job offer and then determine my future possibilities. I'm curious as to what some other, more educated in the fields opinions may be. Any advice is welcome (especially someone who knows something about the success of software developers, and project managers), thank you so much. *Sorry for the length"

I'll just quickly provide some background knowledge: I'm a 26 year-old college student who will be graduating soon. I have one semester left because I need to take a foreign language course that is required. I'm also graduating a bit late because I served my country via military service and also switched majors along the way. &amp;#x200B; Fast forward to now. There is a friend who works at a cybersecurity startup. I met him at a former workplace because he was close to the general manager there, and he's always been asking me when I graduate and saying that he really wants me to work at his company. Recently about a month ago he messages me asking me if I would be interested in doing some part time work a couple days a week. I told him that that would be great since I'm technically still in school and being able to get some extra cash and exposure would be extremely helpful, especially for someone who's not 100% sure what they want to do. It would also be good because I was planning to take some extra courses while I fulfill the graduation requirements. &amp;#x200B; I've been called in for an interview the same week that he messages me. I was basically interviewed by my friend and another guy who I've also met before. Honestly, I didn't like the interview. Not because I wasn't able to answer questions properly or because the two were mean or anything, but the atmosphere was not professional. My friend was basically just there saying ""Oh yeah I like this guy a lot haha"" and the other guy was the one asking the actual questions. A couple weeks later, the same guy who interviewed me (not the original friend) messages me saying that ""some other friends from the startup"" are in the country and ""it would be nice if you can come in and say hi before everything starts."" I also thought that comment was inappropriate because I haven't even gotten the job yet, but whatever. I visit the office expecting to say hi and have a nice chit chat with whoever's there, but it was basically an interview. They just asked questions like ""Oh cybersecurity has a lot to learn do you think you'll be able to teach yourself"" blah blah. &amp;#x200B; Now, here's what's really putting me off a bit: I'm still a student and this job doesn't seem like they're asking for a part time position. I made my position clear that ""I'm sorry but if anything's going to get in the way with school and my graduation, I can't take the job and you'll have to find someone else."" My friend texted me after that day I ""went to say hi"" and I told him that I honestly wasn't expecting an interview. He then tells me that the other guy is ""having his own ideas on who to hire from within his network because the business needs a senior level consultant."" I'm thinking to myself ""What?? I thought you told me this was a part time position, why do you need a senior level consultant??"" &amp;#x200B; I guess the advice that I'm asking is: What would you do if you were in my shoes? I'm thinking that I need to message my friend first and ask him what exactly the job needs and if I would be able to juggle school and work, as was initially promised. Because after everything going on, it doesn't seem like they like the fact that I'm in school either. &amp;#x200B; Thanks!"

This isn't as serious of a problem as other people have. Just something that's been bothering me for about a year. I apologize for the potentially incoherent rambling, but there's some backstory to why I feel like this. Basically, I'm just anxious about life after high school. I'm a senior in high school and for 4 years it's basically guided me in life. I didn't always like it necessarily, but I always had a goal. I was never much one for getting all A's in all my classes and I've always had a bad habit of passing. I've realized that the school system doesn't really fit me. But i've always had a goal of just getting by. Of course I have a plan for after high school and an idea of what I want to do. I'm passionate about technology and I want to work in the cybersecurity field. My current plan for after high school is to go to community college for a few years and then transfer to a university. I'm not gonna get a full ride scholarship and i'm sure as hell not going to put myself in debt. I'm not aimless and that's not really my problem I guess. I have a general idea of what I want to do and how to do it. My problem is that I feel unprepared for being an adult. I don't have my license yet but I'm going to try to get it soon. It's just that I was in a car crash a few years back that left some mental trauma. Nothing serious, but it was my Dad driving and he's the most cautious guy I know. It solidified the fact that it can happen to anyone to me. I still like Anime and Manga and I enjoy shitty anime memes. I play far too many games for far too long. I know I don't need to stop liking what I like as soon as I turn 18 or leave highschool but I'm just so afraid of becoming that loser who still lives with his parents at 30 and collects body pillows of his waifu. I don't handle change well and I never really have, especially being on the Autism spectrum (Which makes it harder for me to handle change). I have all these crushing expectations put on me by my father. He has faith in me that I will make something out of life and that i'm some kind of genius, but I just don't have the confidence in myself to make myself believe the same thing. I'm starting to ramble and there is some more to this that I haven't mentioned, but I've mentioned most of it. I just dont handle change well and I think that I wont really amount to much in life. Its been causing some underlying anxiety for the past year or so, but even more so now that its winter break of my senior year. Im not entirely sure how anyone here would be able to help me. Its pretty much just something Ill need to get over myself. Id appreciate it if people would give me some LPTs about being an adult and tell me stories of how the worried about the same/similar things and found their worries to be just paranoia. "

Im not sure what my major in college should be. From all of the quizzes and tests etc. that ive taken to try and determine it, they tell me Psychology. But all my life ive always been into computers and video games etc. At first I was ready to delve into the computer science field and do something like Information Security Analyst (does things with protecting/securing networks on a large business scale and usually works in CyberSecurity Firms). But some friends were taking these quizzes to figure out their major and I figured what the hell. Ill do one too. Ive probably taken about 10 or 12 now online and they never differ from answering Psychology. I think 1 time it said Computer Science. But it doesnt reassure me that Im taking the right course of action here. (I have watched and listened to a lot of lectures for psychology already on youtube from a number of different professors and their stuff definitely seems interested and like it would fascinate me. In contrast some of the lectures ive watched for a CS major are kind of meh and very plain. So while the field of CS interests me, the lectures certainly dont seem to) So without knowing what to think of these quizzes, I come to you, the almighty reddit. Do I listen to these major quizzes and go into psychology, or do i stick with what ive been into since i was a little kid? Note: i have thought about doing one and then switching if i dont like it. But i dont really have the financial capability to do that. Ill be going to a public 4year college next year so it will cost me a good chunk of cash.

Finishing my HND in Computer Science this summer, but I haven't really learned anything that would actually get me a job. That's my fault for not putting the effort in, I know. I know I enjoy programming and web dev and kind of want to get into cybersecurity, but my skills are currently below the level of a GCSE computer science student. I also have no idea what doing any of this as a full time job is like. I learned what I needed to pass assignments and then immediately forgot everything. I don't think I can get an apprenticeship because they will want to know why I'm applying for a level 3 apprenticeship when I have a D\* BTEC in Computing and a HND in Computing. I have a vague plan for after my HND, this is to get a part-time/full-time job (hopefully full time) in a supermarket or shop or admin or something, so I can earn some money and have something to get up for in the morning. In my free time, I will finally start working properly on FreeCodeCamp and actually try and learn some web dev and C#, do some Cybrary certificates as well. When September rolls around, I will reapply for a degree apprentiship in CyberSecurity I applied for this year and didn't get because I was too lazy. If I get it, I'd have to move away from home and live alone for the first time, so I'm thinking of maybe trying to move out this year (would be September 2021 I could start the apprenticeship) to try and get used to living alone and actually caring for myself. I don't eat properly and clean and stuff as it is so that will be fun. I just feel like no matter what I do, I'm going to feel shit. What if I get a full time job and I still feel suicidal and like life is one big slog of boredom and unhappiness? What if I can't get a job? I've been the doctors, I'm on antidepressants, waiting for counselling, I just feel like I'm never going to get anywhere, as all I seem to do is make plans and then never follow through with them. Everything I've said above, I'll probably still be saying next year, if I haven't killed myself by then or ended up in a psychiatric hospital. &amp;#x200B; Basically, I have no idea what I'm going to do in the future, and I'm scared.

Up to this point, my life has been fairly terrible. I was born with an ultra rare skull birth defect that left me with moderate facial disfigurement as a result of the surgery to save my life. This has led to my life just being a constant cycle of bullying and harassment. This may be strange but I didn't really understand the true value of friendship until I was around 12ish solely because friendship was nonexistent in my life up to that point. My parents separated at age 7. My mom threw me away into a ""therapeutic"" boarding school (otherwise known as residential treatment centers) when I was 12 and I've been in for years and won't be free until June when I graduate high school (7 years). She constantly lies about ""how much she cares"". My resentment for her has no bounds. I can not describe how fierce my hatred is for her. I have moderate social anxiety and pretty much have no friends no matter how hard I try (probably because of my appearance as I stated earlier). I don't like my diagnosis' to define me but to show you how much I have on my plate internally, I'm bipolar (cyclothymia to be exact) with some borderline characteristics (apparently), I'm fairly paranoid when it comes to other people's intentions, suffer from extreme depression, etc. The only family member I cared about and who cared about me (my grandmother on my mom's side) passed away in February and I've been suffering from PTSD on top of the other things. I feel like I'm losing my mind because everything like my paranoia, depression, etc. has been getting signicantly worse at a pretty fast rate and I can't get help because my mom won't let me leave the school aside from the weekends when I come home so that I can get a new mental health evaluation and start therapy. Looking back at my life up to this point, it's just been a miserable mental hellscape where everyone, including my own family, hates me. Hell, I had a random peer peg a snowball at me and call me a name for literally no reason this morning. I just ignored it because I'm so used to stuff like that. &amp;#x200B; This comes at a time where I'm actually doing the best I've ever done at... well.. life. I've been in a vocational class / college course for 2 years doing IT and cybersecurity (I have my A+ and I get my Security+ in June). I have a part time job at Target. I was elected as a Parliamentarian for my local SkillsUSA chapter. I'm doing student council at my home school. I did all this to keep myself busy but I feel like I'm losing a grip on myself to keep these good things going. &amp;#x200B; So those are the internal struggles.. &amp;#x200B; Now here are the external struggles. &amp;#x200B; I'm going to have zero family support when I graduate high school (I'd rather die than rely on any of them again if I even had the choice tbh), I live in New York so a job at Target won't pay bills, I don't even have my learner's permit because my mom refused to bring me because she doesn't want to do anything for me aside from take me on the weekends, I won't be able to afford a car, and I'm very unlikely to find an entry level IT job to advance my career. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; So I'm leaving high school with: &amp;#x200B; No friends &amp;#x200B; No family &amp;#x200B; No money &amp;#x200B; No home &amp;#x200B; Very little hope of moving forward with my career &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; As negative as all of this sounds, I do want to try and improve my situation. I believe there is some hope. Very little but at least some. I want to be successful and I want to be happy. Likewise, I would love nothing more than to see the despair in my family's faces when they realize they failed to tear me down. It's the most pleasurable form of vengeance in my situation. As of right now, my plan has literally just been based on the dim hope I could find even just a simple entry level IT job with the certifications I'll have (which is very unlikely).

I go for 2 days a week, it's the only form of structure and socialisation I have, and I know if I drop out it will just lead to me becoming a recluse in my room, because I won't learn how to program, and then apply for jobs, even though I say I will, because I.

I am looking for advice on dealing with this. Applying to jobs is stressful and I feel I have been doing this for too long. I went through many revamps of my resume and have typed up cover letters many times to see my resume didn't get a second interview. I started applying to places since December of last year looking for an internship while I was in college. I almost broke down until a job showed up asking for me. I worked as an analyst there for 3 months and since the term was up I am now back in the unemployment stage. I thought ""Since I have an internship under my belt I would have better chances trying to get an entry level job."" I was right, now every 15 resumes and applications I send out, I'd have about 2 that will call back. Very stressful process going through interviews and those that called me back I'd think ""Hey this might turn out good with the vibes we were getting."" The two that I was really hopeful for one didn't email me back after the final interview (Last week Tuesday). The second one gave me a interview gauntlet which I passed (4 interviews in 4 days with different teams). This was the one that hit me the hardest because I saw myself moving cross country for it because of the vibes and the line of communication, though I messed up the last interview because I couldn't fully communicate what was on the tip of my tongue but I got the entire description of the technical part down, they were nit picky about the wording. This morning they called me back stating that they were moving forward with other candidates. I am losing motivation right now.

Should I lower my expectations, or should I expect to continue into further education if I want to do anything fun and /or exciting? 3. What kind of careers should I look to avoid? 4.

I started in 2012 and after jumping between majors and starting a job in a relevant field (thankfully) I've finally slated to graduate in fall of 2018. My school recently started doing something called course forgiveness, and basically what that means is that if you received a less then favorable grade in a class, but the class is not required or related in any way to your major or minor (minors in my case) they can effectively nix the grade from your overall GPA. I believe the course itself stays on your transcript, but instead of that C,D, or F or whatever you got it's listed as forgiven or exempt or something like that. If I implemented this, it would boost my current Overall GPA from a 3.265 to at least a 3.4 (which is good for Cum Laude at my University). However, in order to take advantage of this I would need to update my course catalog for my major. The required courses for my major are under a catalog from a previous year and the current one is only different by one class. Normally this would probably seem like a no-brainer, just take the extra class, get my blemishes forgiven and secure Cum Laude assuming I get A's and B's in my last 2 semesters or have a cushion for my GPA if things go less than favorably. However, that extra class is a Spring only class and I've already signed up for a reasonably full course load in the Spring beforehand. I preemptively added it to my schedule in case I decide to go that route bringing my schedule up to 18 credit hours with a planned 9-10 credit hours semester in the fall for my last semester. So my options are: 1. Moving the last class for one of my minors to the fall to make room for that last major class this spring. 2. keeping all of the classes and just trying to make this a gauntlet semester so I can have less school in the fall to focus on job hunting. Also from what I've heard, one of the electives I'm taking is apparently a throwaway. So if it's as easy as I've heard that virtually lowers my actual workload to 15 credit hours. 3. Just saying screw it to the course forgiveness and Cum Laude and staying on my current plan and graduating with probably a 3.3 assuming everything goes reasonably well (A's and B's primarily). My main worries are the fact that I'm going to be working 30 hours a week this semester, I will have some ability to do schoolwork at work but of course work comes first. I guess I'm just not confident in my ability to handle all that. Also, even though the fall catalog has been very consistent every year, if there are any changes whatsoever with the course I would be dropping in terms of scheduling, time slots, etc. that would throw a wrench in everything and effectively delay my another semester. Although I suppose any major changes like that to any of my last courses would screw me anyway. I guess given how long it's taking me to graduate, any changes this far in are scary to me because I really can't afford to delay things an extra semester. I'm probably just being incredibly paranoid and I'm somewhat already leaning towards options 1 or 2, but I just wanted some extra opinions. Also not really a legit concern since it can only help me but I don't know how important Cum Laude is to employers in my field (I know that's something that varies from company to company). Hopefully I typed that mostly coherently and I would really appreciate any advice. Thanks a bunch! "

What my life holds in the future is up to me. Im finally in a job where I can pay for my university studies and get ahead once and for all. Ive always imagined having a nine to five working with computers in a business environment. Ever since the whole Snowden thing I became enthralled in cybersecurity. I live in a great city where I know I could get far in that field. My only problem is my motivation. Theres so many distractions in my life that Im having a hard time focusing on my job and getting into school again. I often sit and think about how its either I change and in the next five to ten years really get things off the ground so to speak, or look back and wish Id done these things. How do I commit to something not knowing exactly where Ill be? Studying something that I choose has always been a dream of mine. Computers seem like the future and where the money is to be made. When I was twelve I always fantasized about having my very own computer. I really need some motivation to get on track and stay there. Ive been having my mind clouded my instant gratification and the fear of moving forward to a place Ive never been. I just really want that upper middle class experience with a wife two kids and a comfortable home. Ive experienced high class living and everywhere invetween and if I was making 70-80k living in the Southwest that would be a dream come true. I dont really like to travel for vacation but for work would be different. I just want to be somewhere warm and with a low cost of living. I would live comfortably and would have enough to make a few million in the stock market by the time Im sixty. How do i find the motivation to suceed?"

Sometimes I can feel myself becoming annoying but I don't know exactly what I'm doing. My good friend told me one time that I should let people have their own opinion, so I think my problem is that I try to argue everyone's points? But I have no way of realizing if it's happening and I'm nervous to share my opinion now. For example, a conversation I just had... I'm in a class called AP seminar and we have to come up with a research question. ""Lenses"" are different points of view on a certain issue, for example an economic lens on internet privacy would mean talking about the importance of cybersecurity for banks and events like what happened with Equifax. A political lens on internet privacy would include wikileaks whistleblowing or legislation changes like the recent net neutrality laws. A: (suggesting a question) To what degree should governments be allowed to censor the internet Me: Way too political, how will other lenses fit in? Like explain how you would write about say an artistic lens for that (an artistic lens about internet privacy would be about piracy or plagiarism. How would piracy or plagiarism fit in with government censorship?) A: Economic: talk about how different amounts of censorship can affect advertising and business Me: Uhhhh wydm A: Historical: talk about how other countries in the past censored the internet, and its effects Me: Ok that's fine, but what else would you say about economic besides ""more censorship makes it bad"" A: What do you mean ""wdym"" I stated it clear as day. Isn't that the premise of all our topics, ""more censorship makes it bad""? Me: Can't really make a whole paper with a bunch of different arguments out of it. Ok let's reword it A: What do you want Me: What about ""how can government regulation affect stuff"" So what I wanted to do was for him to explain his question more because I was confused how you could talk about anything nonpolitical with it, I thought it was too specific and a more vague question would give us more to talk about. I think I came off as rude. Does anyone have this same issue? How could I have reworded what I said, or how do I avoid smothering other people's opinions in the future?"
392,cybersecurity,Advice,Should I Change My Major?,2,7a94pb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7a94pb/should_i_change_my_major/,2017-11-02 15:03:40,"Tl;dr: I'm trying to decide whether to change my major. Currently I'm a computer science major, but I've basically been set back a whole year and I have to pay out of pocket for some of my classes. Hello everyone, I'm thinking about changing my major. I'm currently a computer science major. Reasons why I'm thinking of changing: 1) Time. I'm already in my 20s. The university I want to go to requires me to go through Calc 4 at my college. Since I'm in Pre-calc 2 right now, this means I'd be set back another whole year. 2) Money. I'll basically have my AA at the end of this quarter, which means all those Calc classes I'm required to take as pre-requisites will not be covered by financial aid. Although I have the money, it's money I'd rather not have to spend. 3) I know it's kind of a cop-out, but computer science is hard, and I'm kind of concerned about what this means for a future job. I have been told I would never be programming on a job alone, but I have my doubts. I also do not want to just program all day - I was actually looking at becoming a systems analyst, but I'm not so sure now. What am I thinking of switching to: 1) IT. I'm unsure about this though because the options the university offers is either cybersecurity or mobile forensics. They both sound semi-interesting, but after doing some research cybersecurity sounds a little dull, and mobile forensics would require looking at things I'm not sure I'd want to see. Also, I'd still basically be set back by just a little less than a year. 2) English. I'm good at English. I'm not sure what job I could go for with this, but I'm good at it. This would probably also set me back, but I'm not sure yet how much. 3) Political science. I'm interested in politics (I'm in the USA, by the way). But yet again, I'd probably be set back, and I'm not really sure what jobs I could get in this field. I'm totally overwhelmed and I have to decide what I'm going to do within a week or two because registration for next quarter starts soon. If you've worked in any of the fields listed, I'd love to hear about what you do and your take on my situation. And if you haven't, I'd like to hear what you think I should do anyway. Thanks in advance."

Here is whats going on: &gt;Option 1: Ex-girlfriend possibly wants to get back together. She lives in another state 2k miles away. History with her: Cheated on me once and possibly twice, currently has a boyfriend (found him immediately after splitting up with me, he does coke too wtf) she is hesitant about leaving because he's good to her but she's ""scared to live a life without me,"" we dated for 2.5 years and never fought + lived together so naturally. Regardless of the fucked up mistakes she made am I foolish to still see a life with her? I would move back to her and USC has a good cybersecurity program. Cost of living in CA is very high too. &gt;&gt;Option 2: Forget about my ex and move on. Attend a top tier cybersecurity school in my state. Low COL, ability to save more money. Have family all around. Due to my personality type I feel a disconnect. I do not date often because I rarely find someone I connect with on an emotional and spiritual level. Deep down, her and I connect and it really sucks about how she's treated me. Her mom wants us back together because she believes were meant for each other and my ex and I feel the same way.

Our professor gave us our final a few weeks ago instructing us to find a business and to ""interview"" them about a mock system that we would prepare for them based off of what they tell us they need (basically be an unpaid consultant). Although i understand the value in the ""real world"" experience, he wants us to get each persons contact info, the address of business, any information about their business we get from out interviews, and contact info from each ""potential stakeholder."" As someone who is supposed to be learning about how to protect information and an aspiring cybersecurity professional i feel so wrong doing something like this. The person i interviewed has expressed that they wish to remain anonymous and every person i talk to about this project thinks it's creepy and weird. I don't know my professor, in fact it's an online class so i have only seen him a handful of times and now i am expected to hand over the PII someone as well as the details of their job and the jobs of others? When i asked if i could keep everyone anonymous he basically said that i waited to long to have this problem and no one else had an issue (also a bit disturbing). I just got done writing a lengthy email to my dept chair to fight this, although i have never had to do anything like this before so i have no idea what step two is. I am continuing my final without giving away this information however i could potentially fail and have to take this class over again with the same professor.

The little scratches in my consciousness are bugging me again. I need to tell someone. It's hard to keep it all bottled up and whatnot, although this isn't gonna do much. Easier to type things out than to talk to people in real life I suppose. Also I really don't have anyone to talk to in real life. Probably because of my choices, but anyways, that is done and gone. Not much I can do now about not having any friends. Anyways, I said I'd tell you people about my dumb-ass choices. I don't really care about formatting, after all, this is just a shitty attempt at catharsis through any type of social interaction I can get my grubby little shit sausages on. Let's just get started. The biggest few are really from my treatment of the opposite sex. Internally, I have a naively gentlemanly dialogue. I like the idea of helping people alot. But I'm so socially anxious that it always turns out terribly. Anyways, I've done a couple of things. It started the worst in sixth grade. This was pretty much low level stalking. I thought I was falling in love with this girl just because she was pretty, liked all the things I liked, and talked to me. But I was being dumb. I asked her to a dance, then she said ""sure"". I thought that meant we were going out. Nope. But I told everyone that we were. Word eventually got back to her, and she asked me whether I had been telling people that we were going out. I said no. I continued to do things like email her, and later on pathetically tried to ask her out. Which failed. That was episode one. Round two came later on. Having wizened up a bit, I tried girls again in high school. Stupid mistakes again. I really liked this one girl, but I knew I'd never get her, so I asked this other girl, who I didn't like at all, on some dates. I completely mislead her, and it was unfair to her. In my cowardice, I ended the string of dates by just stopping talking to her altogether when i realized my mistakes. That was mean. Then, later on that year, some girl asked me for my jacket, because she was cold. I said no. I don't know why I'm so guilty about that but it has wormed its way into my mind and won't get out. Paralyzed by fear of repeating such stupid actions, I can no longer act on any romantic feelings. I have pretty strong feelings for another girl, and have had them for two years, but I am petrified in engaging in any type of non-professional relationship with her. That is a quick summary of my idiocy in the realm of love. I'm also a sarcastic asshole. I say cruel things to people often. Today some dude mentioned that I had confused the purpose of steganography, which I hadn't, but he proceeded to say something about jargon. In front of the entire cybersecurity team as well as some other girls who were off in a corner I humiliated him, saying things like ""you really have no right to say anything to me about jargon."" Wow. I'm an asshole. Aside from this, I am very sarcastic. I think I have an outwardly grating personality. It is especially painful, because, inside, I just want to be cared about, and to care for other people. I don't want to hurt other people. It's a defense mechanism. I feel like two different people. Overall, I'm just a severely lonely, slightly depressed, asshole. At this point, I want to shut up and never speak to anyone again, shut myself away to my studies and just help people from my ivory tower. I can't deal with society, and when I try to, I just burn things. I hate myself. Anyways, if you've read through my entire disjointed essay thanks. It's impressive that you can sit through that shitstorm. And although I maybe am being overly dramatic, considering other people have more grim stories, it is hard for me internally. Two sides of me are ripping me apart. And it hurts alot. I think it is somewhat healthy to speak out my thoughts here because I don't vocalize it to anyone. Thanks. Bye. Any thoughts on how I can improve would be great."

Since the beginning of high school I have been constantly researching the world of finance, mainly investment banking. I know how hard it is to land a job in that industry but I just kept thinking about it and decided that I would try to pursue it.

Yet I kept thinking about her every now and again, I asked out a few girls, but nothing really came out of it. I went to something like a military boot camp (encampment for civil air patrol) and through the big chunk of the time... I THOUGHT OF HER I'm a senior in HS at that point and after I got out of encampment, I knew that there was no way anything could ever happen between us. I call her up and ask to talk to her so that I could eventually get over her. I talk to her and basically at the end of it all I told her that I wouldn't bother her anymore/try to make contact and I got closure. I'm 20 now god dang it, it's been several years since I've talked to her, yet I still think about her. The other day family said hey you have to drink with us... I'm like K... after that I think i got slightly buzzed?

I text my friend instead asking her to help me try to avoid that... she just tells me yo you gotta let go... I'm laying down on my laptop thinking about sam still.

In this past year I really ventured out of my comfort one and started getting involved with the cybersecurity community and team (don't be fooled I'm rather novice). I've discovered this as a real passion of mine, unfortunately this didn't happen for me sooner. Although I love it, I am not a born natural at it. I pick it up at a decent pace and do fine, but I wasn't one of those kids programming at age 10. My coding skills are average in a novice way. I really like networking and would really like to dive more into that if I could. I was studying for my Certified Ethical Hacker, but after some research saw it was much use without any prior knowledge / experience to back the cert up. (I was excited to be able to follow all the material competently though.) I have a few prominent options at this point: 1. Stick with my current Management path (have a successful internship) - Honestly this path is really unappealing to me as it's pretty dull, but it is technically an option so I'm listing it. 1. Get my second undergraduate degree in cyber security - This would really suck to go back to undergrad again. I think I would only need (on average across institutions) 35 credits so it would be expedited, but expensive and still kind of degrading to feel like I've wasted the past 4 years on this last degree. However if this is what it takes I'll accept that. I currently got into an online school University of Maryland College which is actually supposed to be pretty good for cybersecurity (maybe I'm wrong on that, don't think so though). 1. Go to grad school for cyber security - I would love to do this, after some searching though I don't know if I qualify. My GPA is a 2.9ish (not 3.0) and I don't believe I've done all the pre reqs, however I might be able to find an institution that would take me. I've heard grad school isn't much worth it though if its not from somewhere with a decent reputation though so that might be a bad idea. 1. Other, hopefully there are options I'm just not seeing that are out there. Well, figured I'm pretty puzzled so maybe I'd turn to the internet for some ideas to go in the right direction. I'm very open to really anything, will go anywhere or am willing to consider doing anything for what it takes to get to a proficient level of practicing cybersecurity (thats a pretty broad term but I think i've gotten my point across). If you made it this far, thanks for the read through."
407,cybersecurity,Advice,"Helped a colleague with a stalker, stalker found out, is threatening me - What are my options?",0,3i50xh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3i50xh/helped_a_colleague_with_a_stalker_stalker_found/,2015-08-24 10:05:22,"Quick backstory: I work in cybersecurity, and frequently do side jobs for friends and coworkers. A colleague came to me a few weeks back asking if I could determine if some form of spy software was on his cell phone. He said the woman he was dating went crazy, is breaking into his house, following him around town, etc. I take his phone and find one of the commonly purchased spy apps hidden in the OS. The app requires physical possession to install, and with that, my colleague files a restraining order, we install a security camera system in his house, and he feels better. She continues to harass him. Fast forward to today, this colleague calls me up, tells me he talked to the stalker (I have no clue why he is continuing to communicate with her), he slipped up and mentioned my name and that she said I needed to watch my back, and my punishment was coming (her exact words). Apparently she has a line of guys she manipulates that will do her bidding. My first thought was to take him and his testimony to the police, and get my own restraining order, although I am not sure if second-hand hearsay is enough. My second thought was to contact her professional certification entity and fill them in on her conduct (she works in a field where they would not tolerate this), hoping the tension from that causes her to straighten up. My other thoughts were much more brash and malicious. My question is, what are my options? Anyone ever dealt with something like this? Should I just ignore it? Do I have enough to even involve police right now? I am perfectly capable of defending myself (concealed permit holder as well), and am perfectly capable of issuing some digital justice upon her, but I would like some legal and logical suggestions first. If it matters, the stalker is a female, and I am a male. "
408,cybersecurity,Advice,How does one hack into a server and change their college grades?,0,3d2346,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3d2346/how_does_one_hack_into_a_server_and_change_their/,2015-07-13 08:14:05,"I enjoy watching the stupidity of people hacking into their school's system and then getting caught. Being that cybersecurity is something I love to research, I am genuinely curious: How do students get into their registrar office database in the first place? There are numerous people who work in a registrar office that input the grades. Every college has a portal. To access a portal, you need ID and a password. You can get an ID from a directory. How do you get the password though? I am curious in knowing how they even get into the database in the first place. "
409,cybersecurity,Advice,I want to quit my job,1,3emden,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3emden/i_want_to_quit_my_job/,2015-07-26 12:19:59,"Note: Its an unpaid CIT position at a summer camp I dont usually post on reddit but here goes. Im a 16 yo m and live with my parents. I go to private school on a partial academic scholarship and love it there. This summer, my parents were pushing me to get a job and went as far as setting up interviews for me for jobs I didn't want. So I got a job as a CIT (counselor in training) and don't really do much there. Out of the entire summer ive only worked 7 days due to a 2 week cybersecurity camp my parents made me go to and a vacation. Even though I have only worked 7 days, I dont enjoy it there and have been warned by the actual counselors that working there is hell. CITs are also not paid, so im doing this for free. Now, I am into the back half of the summer and need to start reading for school. (I have to read 4 books and write essays) Because of work and school work, I have little to no time to do anything for the rest of the summer, so I asked my parents if I could quit, as I have no intention to get a real job there in the future. They said no, and won't give me a reason, but said if I quit they will send me to public school and ban me from playing video games. Im just looking for argument points to make to let them let me quit, as I have no reason to continue to work there. Plz help. Thx Update: I used some of the ideas from the comments down below and my parents are letting me quit after this week"
410,cybersecurity,Advice,I'm employed but a job with no advancement for a career.

(Who knew those even existed? I didn't lol) I'm in a position that's higher than a regular cashier but right below assistant manger. I basically manage the daily duties of the store, while dealing with customers who have a problem with service there, and making sure the store is running fine with no manager present. But I want to quit and find an internship or entry level job that will start my career. But I'm having trouble because there's so many websites offering to look up internships and other ridiculous amount of data. I don't know where to start. How to apply? What I should be looking for? Some background: I was in college for 2 and a half years and accumulated 67 credits before I had to stop attending because of money and the cost of out of state tuition. I'm trying to back to school and I'm aiming to go to an online accredited college to get my degree while working full time. I live with a couple of friends and support myself financially for everything except my cell phone bill. I'm interested in IT and cybersecurity so if anybody reading this works in those fields please help! But all help is welcome!"
