0,vulnerability,Android,[PSA] Unauthorized Data Skimming - DU Caller/Free Caller ID,164,7zps9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/7zps9q/psa_unauthorized_data_skimming_du_callerfree/,2018-02-24 04:31:38,"Greetings everyone! This is a general PSA to grow awareness of an adware which is collecting personal information. It acts like it is part of the typical android OS, however a quick look at the privacy statement shows the nefarious implications. ###What is it? This is a software called ""DU Caller"" which is using the Google Chrome app's cache to hide on victim's devices while collecting call information. It acts as a ""Free Caller ID"" program which appears with advertisements after phone calls. It does not show up as an installed application or in the app tray, as it isn't one. This program takes advantage of a vulnerability in the Google Chrome App to infect user's devices and presumably take contact information to add to their ""Global Database of Over 2 Billion Numbers"" (URL This program also prevents screenshots, likely to decrease the ability for users to report. I've seen several other users report this same problem throughout various forums, however, most couldn't find a way to resolve the problem without a full reformat. This is a vulnerability in both Android and Chrome, as their inter-connectivity is what is fostering the place for this infection to hide. I apologize that I do not have the steps to reproduce this problem. I'll include a list of all reported cases I can find. Many suggest it was an adware installed with other applications, however I strongly believe this to be false. ###What does it look like? Here's a picture: URL It's a very sleek design with a blue background (t follows pretty closely to the material design guidelines). It pops up after every phonecall. ###How to Uninstall: The uninstallation process is very simple, actually. Just clear your Cache and Cookies in the Chrome App. The issue is that MANY people believe it is associated with an application and therefore spend hours uninstalling and deleting, finally resolving to a complete reformat (which sometimes doesn't even work if they have their Chrome data saved). ###Information: Privacy Policy - URL This application claims ""DU Caller will collect, process and retain personal information from You and any devices You may use in Your interaction with our Services. This information may include the following: geo-location, Your IP address, device ID or unique identifier, device manufacturer and type, device and hardware settings, ID for advertising, ad data, operating system, operator, IMSI, connection information, screen resolution, usage statistics, device log and event information, incoming and outgoing calls and messages, times and date of calls, duration of calls, version of the DU Caller Apps You use and other information based on Your interaction with our Services."" ###Report!

2,vulnerability,Android,Google's response about Meltdown and Spectre misleads Android users,0,7o4np4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/7o4np4/googles_response_about_meltdown_and_spectre/,2018-01-05 04:47:32,"EDIT2: I was somewhat misinformed when I wrote this post. Spectre is caused by issues with code running on a CPU, similar to buffer overflows, and isn't believed to have a universal fix on a software level. Thanks to /u/cgutman for informing me in the comments. Leaving the post below for transparency's sake. TL;DR: Google says Android users are protected because they haven't gotten the exploits to work, not because they patched the exploits. Google's recent blog post (URL states that ""Devices with the latest security update are protected"". To me, this implies that they fixed it in the latest security patch, right? But that's only partially true. In the January 2018 security bulletin (URL they say ""Android is unaware of any successful reproduction of these vulnerabilities that would allow unauthorized information disclosure on any ARM-based Android device"" (read: ""We haven't been able to do it ourselves, so we think you're ok""). Not knowing isn't the same as fixing, is it? In the security bulletin, they detail how the exploits are hard to accomplish because they've disabled user-space access to high precision timers, however there is not a known fix for the Spectre vulnerability yet, and Google has yet to merge KAISER, the patch that fixes the Meltdown vulnerability. I don't mean to trash Google here, they know much more about this than me. I just want to warn users that if you're on the latest security patch, you're only *probably* safe. EDIT: Formatting"

6,vulnerability,Android,So what are users with older devices supposed to do about KRACK?,100,778j5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/778j5w/so_what_are_users_with_older_devices_supposed_to/,2017-10-19 05:24:05,"I have an HTC One M9, it works perfectly and I have no reason to upgrade. Nor can I really afford to. But here comes KRACK out of the blue, and apparently, the One M9 is past EOL and there's no more patches for exploits, KRACK included. So am I just screwed? I understand it's past it's end of life, and this is commonplace for Android, but are my only two options to deal with this massive vulnerability to either buy a new device or risk my privacy and data? Honestly, I've never had a desire to switch to an iPhone, but if there ever was one, this would be it. - iPhone 5S - Released in 2013 - Reportedly getting a patch for KRACK - HTC ONE M9 - Released in 2015 - F*ck You, Deal with it Yes, I understand the concept of ""End Of Life"", but there should be exceptions for major security vulnerabilities like this, as there have been in the past with other operating systems and devices.

7,vulnerability,Android,"I, for one, welcome our new USB-C Overlords (Lack of Headphone Jack)",0,779o2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/779o2g/i_for_one_welcome_our_new_usbc_overlords_lack_of/,2017-10-19 08:05:47,"So everyone is all over the pixel for the lack of the headphone jack. For many people in /r/android, the lack of a headphone jack is an absolute dealbreaker and they cannot possibly grip why any manufacturer would give up some a necessary piece of technology. I, for one, welcome our USB-C overlords. First and foremost, lacking a headphone jack forces other manufacturers to create products that do not use the 3.5mm outlet. They will improve bluetooth and make better USB-C headphones with a wider selection. Honestly, as long as we continue clutching onto the a port that was created almost 140 years ago we will not see improvements in new technology. Personally, I stopped using my headphone jack in 2011. I had an iPhone sitting in my cup holder and plugged into the aux port of my car. I listened to music like this all the time and was happy. I was in a hurry one day, late for class I believe, and tossed a bag from the driver side of the car to the passenger side. However, that bag hit the headphone plug in my phone and snapped the connections inside the phone. It would not work for music anymore. I was interested in android already, so I bought my first android phone that week and swore I would not make a mistake like that again. Instead of relying on a headphone jack, I switched to a bluetooth receiver in my car. My car doesn't have bluetooth built in, so I had to get a receiver that plugs into the aux port of course, but anything to prevent my phone from being destroyed again. When it comes to listening to ""high quality"" sound, my phone isn't really the place I think I'm going to get the best sound from anyway. I wouldn't want to plug expensive over-the-ear headphones into my phone because the jack is huge and risks bending and breaking the phone. The headphones themselves are large and heavy and I don't want to carry them around. I can't just keep them around my neck because they get in the way and cause me to overheat. Good headphones also tend to have long, heavy duty coil cables that are irritating to handle on-the-go. Also, I don't honestly want to carry around something worth $150+ dollars that can easily be stolen AND reduces by awareness of my surroundings (though I guess my phone does that, too.) I'd rather have something convenient. I want small headphones, and If I'm using tiny ear buds I'm already sacrificing a lot of sound quality. I'm not loading my phone up with 450MB lossless FLAC files, I'm streaming music over youtube or spotify or pandora. The sound quality is already to the point where it does not matter if I'm using low bandwidth bluetooth headphones or earbuds because the bitrate is already so low that it doesn't matter. So why not cut that cord and use bluetooth instead of struggling with tangly cords in my pocket? I'd rather have something light I can keep around my neck and forget I have until I need it, knowing it will still be safely on my shoulders. This is a huge advantage over some earbuds I'll have to spend 5 minutes untangling so I can listen to them. So what's the big deal? If you're listening to music on your phone, especially streaming it, audio quality can't be that huge of a concern. Even if you are using wired headphones you're not saving yourself any hassle and you're just holding on to century old technology that needs to die. It is an ancient vulnerability to your $700+ phone and is going the way of Serial and SCSI ports."

On the phone that it's scanning, it just checks the security patch level if it's from September or not. Not sure how it determines if nearby devices are vulnerable. Maybe it looks up the phone model number on gsmarena and checks if it has reached end of life :) Anyway, if you're unsure if you're phone is vulnerable or not, it's best to completely disable Bluetooth as the exploit also works even if it's not set to Discoverable."

As the bleepingcomputer link above says: &gt;Instead of seeing an ""Activate"" button, attackers can use Toast messages to make the button say ""Continue,"" instead. &gt; &gt;Further, researchers say that an attacker can loop Toast messages to appear continuously, masking legitimate content for as long as it's necessary. &gt; &gt;""The Toast attack requires fewer explicit user steps to exploit and also can be exploited by apps that dont come from Google Play,"" Christopher Budd, Senior Manager of Cybersecurity and Threat Intelligence at Palo Alto Networks, told Bleeping Computer via email.

My mother has a Amazon fire so we needed to get her a tablet. So we opted just to get her a cheap $50 RCA tablet that would be just dedicated to the Ring app. Fine. Thing is that we tried to set her up over the phone. It did not work. When I went to visit them and set up the ring system I found the tablet was coming up as The system was reset and you had to login using the Master Account because of Factory Reset Protection. I tried logging in with the google account that we created for her over the phone and it had a bad password so I reset it. I found out that a reset password would not allow a login until 72 hours this was tried last Sunday. So I gave it more time and tried it today, Thursday. It still says that my mother's account account is not the master account and the tablet is still locked. I am sorry but even though it is just $50 I feel totally screwed by Google. I am in IT and just recently had to retrieve a Business listing for a client that had it claimed before I gob there. Difficult it was but the thing is that there was at least clues to the email address that registered it. It gave the first 3 letters of the email address. So at least we could have a clue which direction to follow. In the case of this tablet the Factory Reset Protection offered you no clues or a direction. So now we don't know if my mother got a tablet someone returned to the store and they put it back on the shelf as new or my mother screwed up setting it up. This was only $50 but hell we still paid for it and should be able to use it and not be subject to the overly strict Factory Reset Protection. I totally agree that there is a problem with stolen devices and trying to stop the thief from profiting off of them. But there needs to be something better than what is currently implemented. Factory Reset Protection IMO ends up hurting the non tech end user as much as deters the thief. They need a better way. at least like some of their online services they need to give part of the Master Account User name to point people in the right direction. I see no foul in this as it is currently implemented on online services, which is more vulnerable than a stolen device with Factory Reset Protection. Also yes I tried various acts to bypass the protection and surprisingly enough the security and implementation of Factory Reset Protection is much stronger on this off brand RCA Tablet than on many other Mainstream Reputable 10 times the price and named phones and tablets that people associate with high quality and tight coding that people trust on the tablet brand alone. I know I have gotten farther than most in getting into the system and I have penetrated the device to the point where I can pull up the Build Setting which is a vulnerability on most mainstream devices to unlocking Factory Reset Protection by tapping it 7 times to enable Dev Mode. But this device has actually foiled my attempt beyond that. While I can easily bypass Factory Reset Protection on most major brands and have done so for clients in the past as soon as I confirmed they legally owned the device. I am just pissed that products marketed to more non tech people have such a screw up setup and your out so much money policy. Google needs to rethink this. They need to better handle it. Especially since I have bypassed the protection on devices costing so much more than this piddly RCA tablet. But I would like to say Kudos to RCA for having better security for a low priced device than what the major manufactures can implement at 10 times the cost. I guess the Major Manufactures and Google business model uses the bypass to their advantage to sell more high priced phones at the cost of the consumer. It is just like DMC the only one penalized are the legitimate users. "

A bunch of nothing. Have you noticed that within the actual documents showcasing the Android vulnerabilities, the vast, vast majority target specific devices that are old or unsupported? That the Android versions implicated in the document are also old (I didn't see a single vulnerability target Android 6.0+). Sure, we can't discount the fact that there are still millions of users running on old as hell devices, but it's unlikely that the kinds of users that the CIA targets (getting too political here, so I won't expand on that) would be running heavily outdated software on their devices. And for you, the experience and/or average user, just as unlikely. Take as an example what Wikileaks re-tweeted, based on an ""investigation"" by Redditors on the documents. [In this tweet](URL they state that a tool was discovered which makes Android phones bulk-spy on WiFi networks around them. This tool, if you read the actual document, appears to have targeted the Galaxy S2 running **ICS**. Yes, ICS. Yet this is taken by many as a modern example of the CIA's capabilities. [Don't take my word for it, this is what Justin Case AKA @jcase](URL had to say on the issue. &gt;About the WL revelations, from an exploit developer. &gt;Looking at this offers, several of these are obviously well known, public vulnerabilities/exploits (Towelroot, the javascript one, etc). Nothing new, nothing concerning (except those on really old phones or who refuse to update). &gt;A few I suspect I know what they are, and they are also dead (patched or mitigated). &gt;Rest straight state they are for old builds. &gt;TLDR Don't worry about what they posted, its all old or known. Maybe worry about newer exploits they have that are not listed. Don't worry about any of it unless you have a reason for nation states to mess with you. In a further comment: &gt;Why worry about it? All of it is out of date and not applicable to modern device nor update firmware. Most of it is easily identifiable base on provided data. &gt;More recent public stuff is far more worrisome than vulnerabilities known since 2014. &gt;What WL published is out of date, and no representative of their current capabilities. I would be SHOCKED if those tools are still commonly used. If you have a reason to worry, worry about the newer ones. ArsTechnica's IT/Netsec expert Sean Gallagher: &gt;[7/ I'll have more detailed analysis tomorrow on @ars, but it appears WikiLeaks has wildly overstated and sensationalized this leak.](URL Founder of Zimperium: &gt;[1/2 After initial analysis: no actual mobile exploits in the leak.

[The New York Times](URL has published false information claiming that Signal/Whatsapp/etc. were compromised (now rescinded). [AndroidAuthority](URL has posted a laughable summary of information (...seriously even an Android blog gets this wrong?) I'm not even going to bother mentioning the obvious places of misinformation, namely the many conspiracy-oriented subreddits and some political places, but holy crap is the misinformation annoying. **tl;dr none of the leaked vulnerabilities are of direct concern, but it's possible and likely that there are exploits that Wikileaks hasn't uncovered that the CIA is sitting on** I'm honestly not surprised that the CIA collected zero-day exploits. Probably ever govt. intelligence agency does this. What I'm concerned with is how this information was sensationally presented by Wikileaks, and is now being shamelessly reblogged on most major outlets and discussion boards, without even taking a few minutes to look at the documents themselves. Because they don't show vulnerabilities that are as damning to Android as many are claiming."

Open Whisper Systems, the creators of the Signal Protocol which WhatsApp uses for its encryption, then came out and stated that [there is no WhatsApp backdoor.](URL In a sense, both are right. While there technically isnt a backdoor, the Guardian highlighted a potential weakness in the way WhatsApp handles its keys, and how the company had opted for a less secure, but more user friendly way to deal with accessing an encrypted conversation on a new device. Rather than its users be faced with missing messages on a new phone or SIM-card, the less secure option was chosen, playing into the debate between convenience and security. This does mean that (like an end-to-end encryption solutions) there is a vulnerability for a man-in-the-middle exploit when a new key is generated, leaving messages sent from that point on vulnerable but previous conversations stay encrypted.

I feel like I am in the minority when I say I don't want updates on my phone or any device. Updates continually disappoint me and make my device less usable. This seems to be a justification for people leaving Android for Apple. However, my frustration with updates is much worse with Apple. I also have an iPhone, iPad, and Macbook and they become slower and more useless with every update. At least my androids (Nexus 5 and 6p) can still run if I never update them. Apple forced me to update my old iPad if I wanted to run certain apps or transfer a movie to it. Now after clicking on an app, it loads 10-15 seconds later. I used to play and record music with my ipad with an iRig. I never had any problems. After updating, the latency makes it useless. I just updated my mac because I really liked the idea of siri, now the 3 (and only 3) programs I use no longer work with the new os. The software company said Apple made some huge changes and it will take them months to update their software. I experienced firsthand that ""updates"" are ways for Apple to force your old device to be useless, so you buy a newer one. While I don't think Android is nearly as bad, it does seem that with every ""update"" there are a ton of people that complain about it. I prefer to get a piece of technology and for it to do the same things, at the same speed as the day I bought it. I don't want flashy features. I want it to go immediately to the app I push. Just as I fear that iPhone getting rid of the headphone jack will have influence Android phones, I am also afraid that Android will start doing a bunch of ""updates"" too. My only exception would be security updates, if they do not effect performance and are actually repairing a dangerous vulnerability. I like those. Thanks for letting me rant. TL;DR: Don't bitch about not getting ""updates."" They suck. I have never had anything good come from updating."

21,vulnerability,Android,I am doing Security Write ups about Android Security. I'd love your feedback,17,3pxz2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/3pxz2q/i_am_doing_security_write_ups_about_android/,2015-10-24 06:24:05,"Short and simple: I really want to understand the exploitation process of Android based vulnerabilities and because I don't have the deep technical understanding of these, I take recent Android vulnerabilities like Stagefright and the LTE vulnerability, research the hell out of them using scholarly and trusted sources to understand the issue and then write them out in an Article for laymens to read and understand. I'd love your feedback on my latest article, regarding the LTE vulnerability. My main focus is accuracy of my information as well as reliability of being able to find these sources to confirm (or fix) what I write. &gt;My little security write-ups: Vulnerability in LTE amongst all Androids. &gt;Initially publically released on October 16th on CERTs vulnerability database, a joint collaboration between Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and Georgia Institute of Technology, found a vulnerability using LTE bands and its packet switching method to alter packets maliciously and then send them on their way to do their job. This was tested on 5 carriers in the US and Korea. &gt;Well first break down the history and architecture of the 4G LTE network and understand its basic structure and how it works. From there we will go explain the theory of circumvents and then delve straight into the exploitation process and analyze it further. &gt;The history of mobile networks starts in the 80s with 1G, which was the first generation of wireless telephone telecommunications. This was superseded by 2G which brought the transition from analog to digital based networks in the 90s. 2G had brought along with it increased capabilities such as SMS, MMS and picture messages. With the dawn of the technology age at the turn of the century, 3G became yet another step in mobile networks. Now with the increased demand for internet connection, 3G had to bring broadband access of several (!!) Mbps. 4G LTE is an acronym for Long Term Evolution. It was a revolutionary step forward. Now with our supercharged pocket computers, we demanded more than ever from the internet. The minimum requirements for 4G include web access, basic telephone service, gaming services, HDTV, videoconferencing and even 3D content and cloud computing. The difference here that is relevant to this write-up is the jump from circuit switching to packet switching, which allowed the exploitations that well be covering soon. Well be focusing on VoLTE based networks or networks that allow Voice over LTE, similar to VoIP or Voice over IP. &gt;When a call is made on a circuit switching network (1G, 2G, 3G) the electronic signals pass through several switches before a connection is made. There are separate networks for signals for calls and internet data. However In a packet switching network (4G) using VoLTE, data is broken up into packets and then are all sent along the most efficient route as circuits became available. Since its a packet traveling over the internet, it uses a basic user datagram protocol (UDP) header address to figure out where to go. &gt;We start off with one of the simplest circumvents: Potential free data channels. Because the phone uses the internet as the backbone of its service, it must contact a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server and get an OK response back from it to charge $ for a call. Once this relationship has happened a dedicated channel is created to transfer this call data. Once the call is done a BYE message is sent back to the SIP server, terminating charges for the call. &gt;This leads to the 2nd circumvent: Hidden data channels. However two carriers did not set up a proxy between the SIP server and the user. When actually setting this connection up, an INVITE command to the SIP can allow the server to return a response without regulation, sending another persons IP. This can be repeated by randomly sending out INVITE responses and enumerate a mass amount of IPs to target. Once an OK response is then given out, a dedicated channel spawns and then begins the exploitation process to any of the intended IPs. Because Android does not have proper access controls for this newly created channel, this process can now be done, from within an application, rather than from the phone itself. Using the IP and port enumerated from the INVITE command, we can now send packets to and from the SIP without sending an OK or BYE command, circumventing call charging. Whats even more interesting is that they were able to manipulate the INVITE quality of service parameters to acquire higher bandwidth. The worst part about this is that the encryption used to protect the connection to the SIP server was easily circumvented by just modifying the configuration client side. Because of this, they were also able to analyze call flows in plaintext."

First to be teased was the processor, and it's confirmed that it will utilize the infamous Qualcomm Snapdragon 810. There has been a heated debate over Qualcomms latest and greatest, but don't sharpen your pitchforks just yet, as this time around it's an updated version we'll be seeing. OnePlus assures us that they've taken ""every precaution"" to avoid the heating issue that has plagued the 810 thus far. They also claim that ""the 2 meets the industry standard for phone temperature, even with hours of use."" How much the throttling and heating issue can be mitigated with the new iteration of the chipset remains to be seen, but if properly dealt with, the Snapdragon 810 is certainly not a bad processor. The question, yet again, is how much performance must be sacrificed to rein in the temperature problem. Read more [here!](URL - **Android Security Awards Program:** Identifying and stomping out security flaws in an OS with over a billion users is not a simple task. Obviously, we would all prefer Google to guarantee that there are no critical security risks present, but realistically, thats not quite feasible. As part of an effort to fight exploits, Google launched the Android Security Awards Program, where they offer cash in exchange for discoveries of bugs and flaws. Even more money is on the table if it can be reliably replicated, and more again if you provide a solution. Crowdsourcing security is not new to Google - theres been an ongoing program for Chrome and Android for years - but this time, its more fleshed out with clearer terms and rewards, with the new and convenient ASAP acronym. You can read more [here.](URL - **Straight to M for the G3?:** The official Greek Facebook page of LG has implied that 5.1 might be skipped entirely for the 2014 LG flagship. Thus far it has not been confirmed, so it is difficult to tell if this reflects the official line, or the speculation of individual branches and individuals. If true, many G3 owners would be left less than ecstatic. While an argument for delays to ensure proper implementation of updates could certainly be made, a year old device shouldn't have to wait another year for an update.

If you're wondering about the difference between the two, you're not alone. If there's one thing Sony desperately need to improve, it's their marketing. In short, the Z3+ is the same as the phone called Z4 in Japan, and the Z4v has *slightly* bumped up specs. A better screen and slightly better battery, as well as support for wireless charging is what separates the two otherwise practically identical devices. You can read more [here.](URL - **Samsung and Swiftkey Security Risk:** A security flaw affecting millions of users was taken public this week. Back in November last year, an exploit was found and brought to the attention of Samsung, involving the pre-installed Swiftkey app. In essence, it was possible hijack the keyboard apps permissions and gain full access for malicious means. Both Samsung and Swiftkey has stated that they're working intensely on fixing the vulnerability. It should be noted that this only affects pre-installed versions of the app, and not those downloaded from the Play Store. All in all, it's yet another case against ""bloat"", even if it is an app you're using daily. Read the official release [here.](URL - **5.1 Updates:** This week we saw OTA updates to 5.1.1 start rolling out for the S6, Edge and Moto X (2013 edition), as well as the Android Wear 5.1.1 for the Moto 360. ---- **This Week in Apps** ---- - **Google Clock Hits Play Store:** The official Google Clock app hit the Play Store this week, meaning that if you don't particularly fancy your OEM's take on the clock, you've now got one more option to pick from. An added bonus is that updates to the app can now be pushed without having to wait for the next OTA update. A word of caution, though; some ROMs and phones have been known to not play nice with the new Play Store version, so it might be a good idea to try it out before setting tomorrow's alarm. You can grab it from the Play Store [here.](URL - **Pushbullet Announces Portal:** Designed for transfer of files between your phone and your computer, Portal aims to ease the process sending of larger and more files compared to its sibling Pushbullet. It uses a WiFi connection, meaning faster transfers and no counting towards data-caps. Another point to notice that it plays nice with Android file managers - files transfered through the app can be found through Portal itself, or through file managers, recents tabs, and easily finding the relevant files is always a bonus.

I'll miss the expansion slot and replaceable battery but I like a more metallic design and less plastic. However: see the title of my post for my main concern in what the gs6 is going to contract from it's love affair with the ubiquitously cracked screened iphone. Like (probably) many of you i've made a handy sum of money these last few years off replaceing my friends' ever present cracked iphone screens. It seems like every iphone user i know has had their screen cracked *at least* once yet i only know one person with a cracked android screen. If asked why this is I usually point out that the iphone screen seems to be set *on top* of the phone body while the gs4 screen and most other android screens seem to have it set flush or embedded and surrounded by a plastic rim. When you drop the iphone and it lands on an edge all the force is exherted on the screen itself leading to a crack. However the plastic rim around my gs4 (which is crazy banged up) prevents the same thing from happening because it absorbs a good heap of force from the drop. It's hard to really tell without a good hands on of the device or without an extreme closeup of the screen itself but it looks to me like the new phone will suffer from this same exposed screen edge. ESPECIALLy in the edge version. Do people think that this will now start to be an issue or am i not seeing a design feature that would protect the screen from the iphone's vulnerability? Lastlyni think this sub shouldn't afraid of critical analysis of new devices. Foaming at the mouth with fandom doesn't help anyone make an informed buying decision. I say keep up the critcism."
35,cybersecurity,Android,OnePlus Security Update,135,7x1ocq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/7x1ocq/oneplus_security_update/,2018-02-13 02:58:55,"Just received this email from OnePlus this morning. Posting for all of you that don't check your email. Dear Insert Your Name Here, We were recently involved in a security incident potentially affecting personal information relating to you. This notice describes what we know so far, steps we have taken in response to the incident, and actions you may wish to take to protect yourself. We are working to provide potentially affected customers a year of free credit monitoring, where it's available. This service means you can quickly and easily check as well as receive alerts about any changes to your credit history. Please register your interest via the following link: URL What Happened On January 11, 2018, we were notified of several credit card fraud cases possibly related to purchases made at OnePlus.net. We promptly took steps to investigate the situation, and ultimately determined that an unknown attacker had injected a malicious script into the payment processing page of our website to intermittently capture credit card information as it was being entered. We immediately quarantined the affected server, reinforced our systems, and disabled credit card payments for good measure. What Information Was Involved We believe that personal information relating to you, including your credit/debit card number, credit/debit card expiration date, and CVV/CSC number, may have been compromised during the incident. As noted above, the malicious script appears to have only intermittently captured customer information, so we cannot confirm that your data was compromised. However, out of an abundance of caution, we are providing this notice to all customers that submitted their credit card data on our online store during the window of time in which the malicious script is believed to have been active. What We Are Doing Your privacy and data security are extremely important to us. We regularly review and enhance the OnePlus IT and cybersecurity systems and processes. In addition to investigating the incident, we have engaged an expert cybersecurity firm to assist with reinforcing the security of our systems. We also thoroughly reviewed and confirmed the security of the affected webpage before reinstating credit card payments for our website. We have also reported the incident to Hong Kong law enforcement. We are also taking steps to notify each individual whose personal information was potentially affected by this incident. We will continue to take appropriate steps to minimize the risk of future cybersecurity incidents. What You Can Do As a general rule, we recommend that you remain vigilant about your personal information by regularly reviewing your financial account statements and periodically checking your credit report. Every individual, whether or not their data has been involved in a security breach, can receive one free credit report every twelve months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies: Equifax 800.525.6285 P.O. Box 740241 Atlanta, GA 30374 URL Experian 888.397.3742 P.O. Box 9532 Allen, TX 75013 URL TransUnion 800.680.7289 Fraud Victim Assistance Division P.O. Box 6790 Fullerton, CA 92834 URL Review the reports carefully for inquiries from companies you did not contact, accounts you did not open, and debts that you cannot explain. Verify the accuracy of your complete name, Social Security number, address(es), and employer(s). Notify the three consumer reporting agencies about any inaccuracies and promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, including local law enforcement, your states attorney general, or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). If you make a report to law enforcement, make sure to request a copy of the police report, as you may need to provide copies to creditors to clear up your records. In addition, you may request that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) mark your account to identify any questionable activity by submitting Form 14039, Identity Theft Affidavit, for actual or potential identity theft victims. This form is available at URL You may wish to add a fraud alert to your credit report file to make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name. A fraud alert is a consumer statement added to your credit report. This statement alerts creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report as well as requests that they contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. Once the fraud alert is added to your credit report, all creditors should contact you prior to establishing any account in your name. To place a fraud alert on your file, contact one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies at the contact information provided above. The first agency that processes your fraud alert will notify the others to do so as well. Please be aware that a fraud alert may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may also add a security freeze to your credit report file to prohibit a credit reporting agency from releasing information from your credit report without your prior written authorization. To place a security freeze (also known as a credit freeze), contact the three credit reporting agencies at the contact information provided above. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting agency. Please be aware that using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You may also incur fees to place, lift, and/or remove a security freeze, which generally range from $5-20 per action. Be vigilant against phishing attacks. Some criminals may use your personal information to contact you posing as a reputable source to try and trick you into providing confidential information (commonly called phishing). For example, they might call you or email you pretending to be a trusted party and ask you to confirm sensitive personal information, such as your social security number or financial account information. Please know that we will never ask you to confirm any sensitive personal information by email or over an unsolicited phone call. If you do happen to be contacted with such a request, it is not from OnePlus, and you should not provide any personal information. For more information on phishing and on how to avoid being a victim of phishing, please see URL For more information about fraud alerts, security freezes, and avoiding identity theft, you can contact any of the three credit reporting agencies (contact information above), your states regulatory authority, or the FTC (contact information below). Federal Trade Commission Consumer Response Center 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington, DC 20580 1.877.IDTHEFT (438.4338) URL For More Information We truly regret any inconvenience this incident causes you.

36,cybersecurity,Android,"The case for data-based, end-to-end encrypted texting anf RCS in Android Messages and all other texting apps",95,7lw0bc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/7lw0bc/the_case_for_databased_endtoend_encrypted_texting/,2017-12-25 03:36:17,"For the past year or two, we've been seeing two trends in messaging: RCS and end-to-end encryption. The problem is, no app currently combines both. But the thing is, Google has the tools to lead this trend with Android Messages. Why should they, you ask? Google wants Android Messages to be able to compete with iMessage, right? Sure, RCS is built into Android Messages, but RCS, SMS, and MMS all are incapable of end-to-end encryption. Now, iMessage has end-to-end encryption, which is huge. This means that consumer data is FAR more secure. To be able to compete with this security, Google needs to incorporate end-to-end encryption in Android Messages. To achieve that, Google will also need to incorporate data-based texting into Android Messages. I understand there may be some issues with my statement. What incentive would carriers have to adopt RCS? Well for one, much like MMS and SMS, RCS would enable messaging where LTE or 3G wouldn't reach or where the signal is bad or bad enough to not send data-based end-to-end encrypted messages, much like what is already occuring with SMS and MMS. If Google keeps their Android messages data-based texting features consistent with RCS messaging features (except encryption of course), this could provide seamless transitions to areas where data is not available or the connection is not up to par (which, as we all know, it is not always, even on Verizon in supposedly well-covered areas). It seems as though cybersecurity is getting far more important day by day. We're seeing these massive attacks now and increasing amounts of malware, ransomware, breaches, etc. Not only that, but now we have the option of sending money through Android Messages using Google wallet. Money! SMS and MMS are NOT the safest ways to do money transfer. If Google wants their messenger to compete with iMessage, WhatsApp, and Telegram, and be truly safe, they MUST incorporate end-to-end encryption using data, Google already had the time available for them to do this. Perhaps their key to do this is Open Whisper Systems' Signal Protocol, which is open source anyway and which WhatsApp has already adopted. Once Google does this with their own app, perhaps Android devs will apply this combination to their app as well, making messaging on Android safer, yet more convent and advanced at the same time. I want to hear your thoughts. How would you feel if Google introduced this combo into Android Messages? Comment below!"

They found that they could hijack the accessibility feature to perform a specific form of overlay using so-called toast notifications that pop up and fill the screen, with no need for the system alert permission. That tweak not only reduces the permissions that the user must be tricked into granting but also means the malware could be distributed from outside the Google Play store, where it wouldnt be subject to Googles security checks. &gt; &gt;When WIRED reached out to Google about the attack, a spokesperson declined to comment but **noted that Google released a patch for the problem Tuesday.** &gt; &gt;While Palo Alto calls its toast overlay method a high severity vulnerability, its not exactly cause for panic. Palo Alto notes that it has yet to see the attack used in the wild. - [Researchers Reveal New Toast Overlay Attack on Android Devices](URL - [Original group's blog post - includes video demo](URL **Summary of how it works:** Basically it is similar to Cloak &amp; Dagger, but instead uses a custom Toast message (thus does not require overlay permissions - EDIT: it turns out even overlay permissions are not required if app is delivered by Google Play - see comments below regarding SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission) on top of a grant-admin or grant-Accessibility-features system dialog - thus hiding that from user by making it seem like user is clicking on an innocuous dialog box. As the bleepingcomputer link above says: &gt;Instead of seeing an ""Activate"" button, attackers can use Toast messages to make the button say ""Continue,"" instead. &gt; &gt;Further, researchers say that an attacker can loop Toast messages to appear continuously, masking legitimate content for as long as it's necessary. &gt; &gt;""The Toast attack requires fewer explicit user steps to exploit and also can be exploited by apps that dont come from Google Play,"" Christopher Budd, Senior Manager of Cybersecurity and Threat Intelligence at Palo Alto Networks, told Bleeping Computer via email. ""Taken together these make this vulnerability more broadly viable for possible attacks."" &gt; &gt;Palo Alto says all versions of Android, except the latest (Android 8.0 Oreo), are vulnerable to Toast overlay attacks. &gt; &gt;The issue  tracked as **CVE-2017-0752**  was patched on Tuesday, when Google released the [September 2017 Android Security Bulletin](URL Android OS versions with the September 2017 security patch levels are safe against Toast overlay attacks. [A video of a Toast overlay attack](URL is available on Palo Alto's website."

In the Android version there is an option to replace the standard password with a PIN, which is very reasonable. There is also the greyed-out option of using a fingerprint, which my phone doesn't support. However, that option seems to be there to replace, and not complement, the PIN. Then I started reading and understood that ""a fingerprint is a username, not a password"". The LastPass people should know that better than I, as experts in cybersecurity. And in general, the people creating the whole fingerprint feature should know that, too. Why are apps and operative systems not using the fingerprint+PIN option to access passwords, just like we use card+PIN to pay in restaurants and stores?"
