If you don't know it's wordpress's default update service that notifies a few feed services. The site itself looks like it has not been updated in 10 years, isn't on SSL and a lot of the feeds it updates are defunct. I have a sneaking suspicion that content scrapers and drive by wp vulnerability scanners are being fed domains names from pingomatic. Had a few old domain names that had a default nginx landing page and no backlinks or traffic, set up wp on them just to test and within the hour had a wp vuln scanner hitting the site with some wp-login attempts. Google spiders never found it even after a week and I could find no backlinks from any of the services it's supposed to update. Half temped to remove pingomatic from new installs, particularly non-blog sites."

Unfortunately the *duplicator\_download* action was registered via *wp\_ajax\_nopriv\_* and was accessible to unauthenticated users. To make things worse, no validation limited the filepaths being downloaded. The *file* parameter is passed through *sanitize\_text\_field* and appended to the plugin constant *DUPLICATOR\_SSDIR\_PATH*, but directory traversal was still possible.

They seem like ""firewalls"" - but how is a firewall going to stop a vulnerability that just allows a malicious person to have seemingly proper access? Example: I just had a site where a malicious plugin got installed somehow. That plugin was rewriting htaccess to redirect users to spam. Would WordFence or Sucuri help here? Or was it likely a password leak, vulnerable plugin issue? (Some of the plugins had not been updated since 2015 - because the theme was hard coded to work with specific terrible plugins)."

One I think you guys will get a HUGE kick out of. Seriously, there was a part of the conversation I literally LOL to the point I choked. First, as the rookie I am, I have been working on my site for a couple months, and totally spaced about security measures. So I have yet to get one, and was reminded of my error about 2-3 hours ago. So, the story revolves around SiteLock, which according to a Bluehost rep, it the number one security company for wordpress. Anyhow, I got an email from SiteLock: ""***Thank you for protecting your website with SiteLock. The scanner you have purchased regularly reviews your website plugins, themes and content management system (CMS) for potential vulnerabilities.*** ***During a recent scan, a vulnerability was detected on your website.***"" (*There was more, but no reason to post it all*) I haven never purchased this, but my thought was maybe it just came with my Bluehost service or something. So, to make sure this was legit I click over to the live support chat with Bluehost. And I'm talking to the agent, lets just call him *Bob*. I let Bob know I read a lot of reviews and told him I did not want SiteLock tied to my account and if I had a subsciption I would like it canceled. This is what Bob had to say, ***""*** [***URL ***As you can see the reviews are great*** ***which is why they are the global leader in website security and secure over 6 million websites across the globe*** ***you are extremely lucky ""*** I was a bit shocked that he ignored me, but form Bob.. but moving on, he states ""I see you don't have any security measures on your site."" ---HOLD UP--- The email said I did from your number one company... I am still baffled by this all btw, haha. Bob continues.. ""I can set security up for you."" (continuing to push SiteLock). I state, that is ok, I will get my own security for my site. ***THIS IS WHERE IS TURNS INTO PURE GOLD LADIES AND GENTLEMEN*** **Bob:** *Wordfence and security plugins are end point application, which means they are written code installed and running on your site which can easily be manipulated by hackers. They only detect malware and intrusions once they have already gained access and the site has already been compromised* **Me:** So you are telling me SiteLock is the ""only"" one? **Bob:** *Yes, correct which is why they are the global leader in security* **Me:** You made me laugh so hard I actually choked. SiteLock has competitors just as any other company. *(this was that part I laughed, so hard I choked)* **Bob:** *Does that make sense how wordfence works?* **Me:** Let me do some research, and I'll get back to you. But right now, I am beyond irritated. **Bob:** *that is why all hosting companies partner with Sitelock. Were you able to read the trustpilot reviews?* **ME:** (**10 minutes later coming back to the PC**) Oh sorry, you can close out of this chat. I am going to do a lot of research. And I'm going to talk to a lot of developers. **Bob:** *thankfully all the research has been done for you* *which is why all the hosting companies utilize sitelock for there customers* *you can also see on the tremendous reviews on trustpilot* **Me:** Again, I'm going to pass on sitelock right now **Bob:** *completely understandable I wouldn't recommend going live until the proper security measures in place since visitors could get infected without the right level of security in place \*BoB left\** Well, Bob, was it ""*completely understandable?"" Y*ou about choked me out with SiteLock HARDSELLING! So that leads me to two things. My confusion and my question. **Confusion**, does SiteLock have such scummy practices that the company sends false emails out in order to push you towards their sales people? Was the email possibly a fake, but the support team lack the knowledge of stating was it an official email from our *partner*? My mind.. Remember that commercial with the female and the egg, ""This is your brain on drugs."" \*SMASH\* That is me! lol **My question**. I am looking for a good security plugin or service that will not bend me backwards and shake every penny I have from my being. What would you guys recommend? Thanks you in advance, and I hope you enjoyed the story of my experience tonight."

I am relatively new to this platform, so hey, hi! I just wanted to pass by and share with you a very immature tool that I have been rolling down these past few days to detect which theme is currently being in use by a WordPress site. I see WP as a revolutionary tech which has helped many people to open barriers, and I would like to contribute of my own way to potentially help users to benefit from the information gathered by this tool. Although finding out WP themes is not that useful, it was a good start to get something up &amp; running relatively fast. Featuring In regards to the app, I think it works fairly well with themes that have not been bundled yet with tools like webpack, parcel, browserify and the like. And it even recognizes child themes! How does it work? Well, as you probably have pictured, it just works by making a couple of requests to the pointed site. By parsing the HTML response, it then tries to find links or resources linking to a theme. How is the app deployed? The app is currently deployed on [kubesail.io](URL still taking advantage of the free tier. If you ever need to prototype web services I highly recommend trying them out! Even with the free tier agreement, the support it just shines :) Thanks, kube sailers! Please do note Please, keep in mind that this humble app is still under heavy development.

I'm hoping this doesn't violate the I've been hacked rule - as I'm looking for tools that will help me track down a hacker workflow here. The hack has been corrected, and using 2fa is no longer a threat (so far), but I'd like to dig a little deeper here... &amp;#x200B; I've recently come across a wordpress hack that works like this: * Hacker changes the admin email * requests lost password to their new email * weeeeeeeeee! I can clean the website, undo the damage, etc, etc... But I'm having a hard time tracking down HOW they are changing the admin email. Here's what I know: * When viewing visitor logs directly in cpanel, there is no web address hit. AFTER the email change occurs, then the first web traffic from the hacker appears via the recovery email. To me, this would rule out an insecure php script that's being accessed, correct? (Not just looking at single IP, but all traffic around time of change.) * Because the hack keeps happening, using 2fa seems to have stopped them, and the password reset now seems to be useless, suggesting that they can only reset the email, and not say, disable plugins via sql. * This also suggests that the hack is related to getting access to wordpress, and they don't have some other deeper access outside of the platform. * I thought maybe there was a cron job - which wouldn't show up as web traffic, but nothing there either. Here's what I've done: * Clean EVERY. SINGLE. FILE. so that I know they're original, or not compromised. Including deep scanning jpg files for malicious code. * Used WP Security Audit - It does log the password change, but does not log the email change. This says the email change is happening outside the wordpress platform. * Scanned with every scanner possible. (Wordfence, ninja, sucuri, etc). * ClamAV finds nothing. * Patchman finds nothing (although I have limited experience with this tool, but it is part of the clients account.) * The theme is 3rd party, and there is one 3rd party plugin - all up to date (but that's not to say there isn't a vulnerability there.)

I've been changing my functions.php file when I update my theme to disable this ""feature."" For whatever reason, with all the commotion surrounding WP 5.0, I found myself wondering why WP allows this enumeration of users at all. It doesn't seem to serve much of a purpose on sites that allow users to create their own accounts. I can see if a blog only consists of content creators this is a way to display all content from a contributor, but any other time this just feels dirty. So I asked them. Their response? It's ""not considered a vulnerability."" Apparently WordPress devs think that if they acknowledge an attack vector it becomes less volatile?

56,vulnerability,Wordpress,WordPress 5.0.1 Security Release,1,a5pu61,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/a5pu61/wordpress_501_security_release/,2018-12-13 14:51:44,"I have not updated to Gutenberg yet and I am running 4.9.9 Is it safe not to update to 5.0.1 for now. Also: Backwards Compatibility Breaks in 5.0.1 5.0.1 was just released to fix several security bugs. The Security team tried very hard to mitigate all of the vulnerabilities without any back-compat breaks, but unfortunately there were a few cases where that was not possible. Form element no longer passes KSES Prior to 5.0.1, the $allowedposttags array contained an entry for the &lt;form&gt; element and some of its attributes. Because of that, Contributors and Authors could use it in posts. The element was removed in 5.0.1, except for situations where a plugin has explicitly registered input or select fields via the wp_kses_allowed_html filter. If a Contributor or Author includes &lt;form&gt; in their post, it will be removed when the post is saved. It will also be stripped from arbitrary content that plugins pass to wp_kses_post() or wp_kses_allowed_html( 'post' ). If a plugin author wants to restore the original behavior, they will need to add form, input or select tags via wp_kses_allowed_html. Please exercise caution when doing so, because this could re-introduce a vulnerability. Make sure only trusted users are allowed to add &lt;form&gt; tags. meta_input, file, and GUID inputs are ignored Prior to 5.0.1, $_POST requests for creating posts could contain values for meta_input, file, and guid. This is no longer true, and values passed for those fields will be ignored. Plugins should not manually manipulate $_POST, but rather use the appropriate filters, and always validate/sanitize any data coming from an untrusted source. MIME validation for uploaded files Prior to 5.0.1, WordPress did not require uploaded files to pass MIME type verification, so files could be uploaded even if the contents didnt match the file extension. For example, a binary file could be uploaded with a .jpg extension. This is no longer the case, and the content of uploaded files must now match their extension. Most valid files should be unaffected, but there may be cases when a file needs to be renamed to its correct extension (e.g., an OpenOffice doc going from .pptx to .ppxs)."

61,vulnerability,Wordpress,6 Reasons Why You Shouldnt Use Nulled WordPress Themes,0,99k8d9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/99k8d9/6_reasons_why_you_shouldnt_use_nulled_wordpress/,2018-08-23 14:12:47," Building website on content management systems (CMSs) like WordPress or Magento asks users to install a theme or template. The themes determine the appearance of your site. I'm quite sure that an impressive website is every website owner's desire to attract the end-users's attention to its content. That has direct influences on efficient marketing of the services. While selecting a theme, the WordPress site owners go for either a [premium theme](URL a [free theme](URL offered by WordPress, or a nulled theme. The nulled theme is often the best choice of a lot of users because of the expensive premium themes, and the inefficient and unattractive free themes. However, **the nulled themes are actually the pirated copies of an original premium theme**, that are hacked and sold illegally on the internet at a lower price or for free. More than ten thousand nulled themes are downloaded every day for WordPress sites. You get premium WordPress themes for free, but what you dont know is that nulled themes come with a big cost, affecting your website. The nulled themes are also one of the reasons your website gets compromised by hackers. Below are some of the key reasons to **not use nulled themes for your WordPress site.** ## 1. Website Security &amp; Privacy The [security of the website](URL is a priority for you, thats why you go on using [SSL certificate](URL [reliable hosting provider](URL etc. But you have no idea how badly the nulled themes affect the security. The providers of nulled themes hack the original premium theme using nasty and [malicious coding](URL These themes usually have backdoors, and when you use them, the hackers can enter from backdoor to infect the website. In fact, some nulled theme providers deliberately keep the back door so that they can use your website to get backlinks to their sites without your knowledge. They can also [redirect your site](URL to spam links, push ads on your site, and might completely hack it to demand ransom. While you install SSL for the privacy of confidential information that your visitors submit on your site, the nulled themes can make the SSL security of no use. The malicious code can allow hackers to steal the private information of your users, which may include contacts, username, passwords, email addresses, etc. Therefore, you have to avoid the use of nulled WordPress themes which are very risky for the security and privacy of your WordPress site. ## 2. Nulled Themes Are Illegal The nulled themes are stolen premium themes that dont come with any license or copyright. The providers of nulled themes remove the copyrighted resources to make them free or offer at lower costs. There is no doubt that the nulled themes are stolen premium themes, and anything that is stolen is illegal. The use of pirated themes can lead you to legal proceedings if the original developers of them file a complaint against you. In such scenarios, you might need to pay huge sums to lawyers. The site owners make the mistake of installing such themes especially when they [start a new blog](URL or dont want to invest much in the site. ## 3. No Support from Theme Creators When you purchase the services related to computers and websites, the support from the service providers and warranty for the services are must for you. But if you buy the nulled themes, nobody is responsible. Hence, there is nobody to provide support in case you face any issues with the theme. Even if you are an experienced user of WordPress, the support and documentation are needed for proper use of WordPress themes. With [premium WordPress themes](URL you get the support of the theme creator so that you dont get stuck The creators of themes create detailed documentation and provide support so that their users can easily get things done. If youre a GretaThemess customer, then youll have our best [support](URL and [documentation](URL ## 4. Nulled Themes Affect SEO While you try your best to rank high on search engines like Google and Bing, the nulled themes terribly affect the SEO of your site. As mentioned above, the nulled themes contain spam links and malicious code, which create a clustered environment on your site. Using the spam links, the attackers can redirect your visitors to other websites that can harm them. Thus, the users will start leaving your site. Also, the spammy links and clustered environment reduce the readability of the site, resulting in poor user experience. Google ranks the websites lower in search engine rankings that contain malicious content. You might be using hundreds of [SEO tricks](URL and blogging tips to improve the rank of your site, but you have no idea that the pirated theme you are using is not letting the site become optimized. ## 5. Cant update WordPress WordPress releases new versions regularly to improve the security of the platform, fix the bugs, enhance the performance and add new features. But if you use the pirated WordPress themes, you wont be able to update the WordPress version. This is another big issue that can result in website hacking as the attackers know about the vulnerability in [out-of-date versions](URL Also, you cant get improved performance without updating the WordPress. You will have no idea about the new features in WordPress that could actually help you attract more traffic or make more money. ## 6. Discouraging innovative developers The premium WordPress themes are the result of hard-work, talent, coding and designing skills of a theme developer. They invest their time and money to design such [attractive themes](URL They also need to have a website, create documentation, assign people to support the users, and do a lot more for a successful theme. But when you use the pirated copy of that theme, they dont get anything for the amount of time, hard-work and money they invested for the theme. It can discourage such innovative developers from building such beautiful themes. ## Conclusion Utilizing the nulled themes is going to effect seriously on the reputation of your website and business, even it can cause your website hacking. You can use the premium themes instead of the nulled themes because it has several advantages, not forgetting the SEO benefits. If you cant afford the expensive premium themes, then sticking with cheaper premium themes or even the free themes is a better option."

63,vulnerability,Wordpress,Wordpress / Nginx - Security,1,894vzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/894vzd/wordpress_nginx_security/,2018-04-03 06:30:00,"Hello all, I have a question regarding the hardening of my wordpress + nginx setup. I see a lot of websites advise to block php execution in the uploads folders since users can upload files to that location. But let's say there is a vulnerability in a theme and/or plugin. Since the wp-content folder is owned by the web process user (to upload new plugins and themes). It can (in theory) upload a malicous php file anywhere in the wp-content folder. Not just in the uploads folder. And since the php execution block is only active for the uploads folder - they can still execute their script and do bad stuff. So i was wondering why you almost never read that people advise to block (direct) php execution of a file in any of the sub directories of wp-content. I mean the themes &amp; plugins are all included locally instead of being accessed directly so that will still work. Am i overlooking something? Ifso, can you please explain what? :) Thanks in advance! Update: Upon thinking some more about this - i thought about several plugins that probably use direct access (form submission) to execute their code and do something with it. So this would probably only work if all the plugins use admin-ajax instead of direct php execution/submission. But if that's the case - i wonder if it's possible for NGINX to see if the current request has a valid cookie/session and only execute that php submission if there is a valid cookie/session. Since uploading malicious code through a bad plugin/theme wouldn't mean the user also has a valid login. This would still allow plugins/themes to use direct submission but still blocks random request from the internet to execute their malicious php code. Atleast that's what my head is currently thinking Update 2: So i just thought about another flow that might prevent unauthorized php execution in the wp-content folder. This includes running a lua script at NGINX level and a custom plugin in wordpress. 1. User logs in - plugin sends back a cookie with a JWT value to indicate user is logged in. 2. If user makes request for a php file in the wp-content folder - run a lua script (from nginx), validate the jwt and see if user is logged in. 3. If user is logged in, continue the php request else return a error code 403 (?). 4. This way, even if someone manages to upload a malicious file through a vulnerable theme/plugin. They cannot execute it because they are not logged in. 5. Does this make sense? :) Would love to have a discussion about this idea"

To understand more on the detail, there's an entire section in this [guide to automatic updates for PHP developers](URL dedicated to why they're unambiguously a good thing for security. More formally, in the information security industry, we usually make decisions with respect to a given [**threat model**](URL * If you're concerned about script kiddies and opportunistic credit card thieves, ""patch available but not applied locally"" is a greater concern than ""APT can compromise our update infrastructure"" * If you're concerned about nation state actors, *you shouldn't be using WordPress*.

There are no realistic attack scenarios where disabling automatic updates will reduce your risk of being 0wned.

This was reported by Jon Cave of the WordPress Security Team, and fixed by Robert Chapin. We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from Check Point Software Technologies. According to reports, the security issue is in how shortcodes are used in HTML attributes - and could enable maliciously-crafted shortcodes to bypass WordPress's kses code which is designed to strip bad stuff out of HTML, by tricking it into thinking the code is valid. Managed WordPress service WP Engine, who I use to run this website, describes the potential consequences of the vulnerability: This vulnerability may allow users without the unfiltered_html capability, but with publishing rights, to run JavaScript code on the front end of the website. This security update ensures all shortcodes inside attributes are evaluated and then run both through kses separately and escaped for use in attributes. XSS Since WordPress 3.7 was released in October 2013, the software has come with the option of automatic security updates - hopefully ensuring that many site admins won't have to worry so much about whether they have kept their software updated or not. But, of course, there will always be those who don't have automatic updates enabled and may miss the news. :( Updating WordPress is pretty easy. You just go to Dashboard  Updates and click ""Update Now."" Of course, it's always good practice to test a new version of the software on a non-live version of your site first - if you have that capability - just in case. Note: Sites running self-hosted versions of WordPress from WordPress.org are different from the many millions of blogs which run on WordPress.com. WordPress.com, run by Automattic, manages the installation of WordPress for you, and looks after security on your behalf. Although there are some limitations on what website owners can do on WordPress.com, they can always be sure that they are running the latest version of WordPress. #WordPress #versions #xss #Vulnerabilities #Bugs #Security"

I've cross posted this for effecient exposure in r/cybersecurity I am currently on a small web team for a medium sized company and trying to fix some issues with the company wordpress website. It was built by someone who relied heavily on plugins, mainly one called Visual Composer, which essentially turns the editing page into a wisywig editor. The site did not have an SSL cert, so in the spirit of improving security I bought one and had our net hosting company install it and they had me install a plugin on the wordpress site to finish the implementation called Really Simple SSL. Ever since that was installed the Plugin Visual Composer will no longer open and allow me to edit the web pages. I have disabled it, uninstalled and reinstalled it (others having the same issue mentioned to try this). The main problem I am thinking is that when I try to open the visual composer to edit a page, a warning comes up in google chrome saying they are blocking unsafe scripts from loading. I have tried turning this off and letting it load unsafe scrips but the visual composer never loads in. I installed a plugin having to do with Health Checking/Plugin conflict resolution and it doesn't show any issues with either plugin. Second issue I am having is the website is getting a lot of traffic from foreign countries that have no business being on our site, and I think they are trying attacks like XSS or possibly trying to execute code or load scripts? I'm no cyber sec expert. I use a statistics plugin and it shows me what webpages on my site get the most hits and one is WEBSITE/wp/index.php?xxxxxxxxxx_loads=true and some like /temp.tar.gz, /xmlrpc.php None of those should be part of my website right? I get a ton of traffic from shady foriegn countries and a lot of refferals from site.ru which i've read is a pretty popular site that shares info to bots? I have been banning IP address of people visiting, but I'm looking for a more permanent solution. Right now, it feels like i am playing whack a mole, I ban a range of IPs and then they just get a new one anyway. I know that to prevent XSS attacks I would need to implement input validation, which I have been reading up on, but am still pretty clueless on how to implement. Does anyone have any advice on how to solve either of these two issues? Keep in mind, this company isn't very large and doesn't plan on spending much if anything on cyber security.
