0,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Heart Aches,1,i2dix3,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/i2dix3/heart_aches/,2020-08-03 01:06:40,"Dear T, I don't know how to say this in a manner that is elegant and well structured, so I will simply state what it is I need to say...I am crazy. I am way too emotional and sentimental about nearly everything I touch in my life. It is painful what I am about to say, it deeply saddens me, but T, I don't think I can continue to write letters to you or text you or call. When you said some months ago that you would like to make something for me, I nearly instantly knew that I cared about you in a way I had not before, and it began to tear me apart, as it presently continues to tear through me. That night, I wept as songs of sadness blared through my headphones. For I knew nothing would ever come of these feelings...we are friends. It probably did not hold such meaning for you, the beginnings of a tragedy for me...one of my pure friendships ruined by my selfish and sentimental heart. I care about you too much. When I'm looking at orange and neon pink skies, I am reminded of you, your jolly demeanor, and sparkling eyes. From the moment I met you, I felt a quiet affinity for you. I could not release you from the palms of my heart. Never before had I felt such a strong sense of familiarity and connectedness with someone I had just met. The memory of meeting you lives in my heart. I know I am only a friend to you. I want to think of you as a friend. I have tried, but alas. It is hopeless. There is a certain tenderness I feel for you. To even have these feelings for you feels criminal, as if I am assaulting our friendship and taking advantage of the vulnerability we have shared. But these feelings, like us, are neither here nor there. T, I think I am in love with you. It is tearing me apart."
1,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Dear Lieing EX,1,i2esrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/i2esrj/dear_lieing_ex/,2020-08-03 02:24:12,"So who the fuck were all the people that you told me about in your life ? Who was Gino really because he was definitely not your childhood friend you grew up with. He was definitely not the guy who you first lost your virginity to... Why did you make this person up? Oh i know why... so you could use him as an excuse anytime you wanted to be with him so i would not worry about you spending time with him. You never even worked at Richard Simmons as a fitness instructor so who the fuck was your friend Derrick even? Your friend from Jamaica that would come and go between California and Jamaica because of his business back home and his sick mother. Some of this may have been true... Those are the best kinds of lies. The ones that have truths in them so you can tell them ever so confidently. Who was Rahul? Honestly i dont even believe Rahul your best friend of 6 years that you met playing hay day online was realy! You sent him a laptop and money?! How many times did you do this? I saw the texts come in from him saying i love you and i miss you and yet i believed that those were fine because you were such a weet lady that called everyone babe and sweet heart and said i love you to everyone you cared about. Why was i so ok with you talking to your ex regularly? I was so damn understanding and trusting of you because you somehow made me feel like i was the only one regardless of all these blarring red flags. Woman you are 56 years old! When we met i was 23 and you took advantage of my vulnerability and my trust and manipulated me and made me in ""the perfect man"" man for you because knew no man your age with their lives together would knowingly accept you into their lives with all the baggage that you had. You will never find happiness if you keep lying to everyone you meet. Just be yourself because i fell in love with you for your kind heart and giving nature. Now i dont even know id you did all that because you truly loved me or if you just wanted your little toy boy who told your sweet things, supported you, pushed you and encouraged you through all your ups and downs . The good times felt so real! We were so happy together! Why did you not just stay friends with me? Why did you make me fall in love with you and then Rob me of 6 years of my life! I could have done so much with that time. I gave up friends and almost my family because i wanted to be with you and i didnt care what anyone told me. You made sure that i hated your family so i would never know the truth about you. Your mistake was giving me your sisters number all those years ago when you were happy and trusting of me... Years later that was my saving grace... Putting aside all the lies you told me and just making that phone call to her. She told me everything! She told me about your racist past(Why did you date me? Was i a fetish to you? Is that why you called me your ""African Warrior? Are you really that fucked up?""), cheating on your boyfriend with your ex husband, having sex with your ex husband in front of your daughter (I especially believe this because you convinced me to do it infront of your grandkids while they slept eventhough you know they saw us) I feel awful for the things you made me do and i should have known better but i was so blinded by my love and trust for you everything you did seemed like it was alright. Finally when i confront you with the truth in the middle of a break up where you claimed we were trying to work things out, you just tell me you are tired of me being abusive towards you! i asked you so many times if you had found someone else, so many times if you were ready to move on, so many times if you felt we should just be friends and every single time you either said nothing or told me you needed space to think about things. All i was was an option to you! Just buying your time until you found someone that you could just move on to... Maybe i was never event the only one... Maybe you had other boyfriends all along which makes what we had the more even pointless. Why did you do this to me? WHY???!! Im so lucky that i did not move in with you... Im so glad that none of the plans of a life together never came to passs because you would have made my life a living hell! Just like your sister told me that you drove your ex husband away with your lies and deception. You had been doing this for years!! Even your sister said you are not worth it, Even your sister feels you are a waster of time to any man. You were a bad mother from the start who neglected her kids for any man in your life at any given time. You even ignored your sons advice to not pursue a relationship with me. You will always do what makes you you happy first huh? What a selfish person you are. What an absolutely cold and heartless person you are. I wish i never met and i wish i never gave you my heart because now im left broken trying to pick up the pieces of my life and heart you left shattered. This is however all good, i know ill find happiness one day in the way that i want and you will be left alone, cold and bitter with no one to share the rest of your life with. You continue doing this forever because you will never find love or stability.. Even after i offered it to you so wholeheartedly, you did not want it because you felt you were getting ""too old"". I did not even care about your age or how you looked. You are beautiful and yet your insecurities drove you to seek the approval of so many men and blinded you to the one man who was right infront of you ready to dedicate his life to you. Honestly this is your loss and my win. I dodged a bullet and im thankful i woke to your lies and who you truely were. You played a good game honey. Well played... In the end though, we shall see who wins the trophy..."

I didnt care if I had to get up early to grocery shop or run around like a madwoman cleaning and getting dressed in an outfit I thought you might like. I think we are both more comfortable at home, which is why I loved Tuesdays. Hearing your silly knock sent fireworks through my chest every time. I loved seeing you with that tousled black hair, canvas bag slung over your shoulder after a long day. I always worried about doing or saying the right thing. I wanted to only give you the best. You always told me I was so good. Told me I was beautiful. But I hid my dark parts and I think you did too. I wanted yours. Id happily take those on until my last breath. I know Im a hypocrite for not sharing more of me. I was scared to run you off. I had a hard time reading you. I tried so hard to play it cool. I guess too well. You made me feel more alive than Id ever felt before. It takes me a long time to open up. You did it for me immediately, and I didnt recognize how special or rare that was for you. I had NO idea how meaningful it was that you shared so much with me. Ive always guarded my heart. Ive had men manipulate me to get what they want, and Im so sorry for thinking thats what you were doing to me. Im sorry I hurt you. Im not sure exactly how I did it but I never wanted to. I know I did though. I never wanted to see your face twisted like it did that day. I only want to make you smile and feel cherished and loved the rest of your life. I mean it when I say I love you. I want to protect your soul forever. I want to run around in the rain together. I want you to to pull my face close kiss you every day for the rest of my life. I miss hearing your heartbeat while I lay on your chest. I miss your strong arms pulling me close to you. I wish the world would melt away, our fears would cease and we could just exist in perfect harmony. Yin and yang. I see your soul and I love every part of it. Thank you for giving me all that you did. Your vulnerability showed so much strength. I think youre the most incredible man in the world. Calypso"

For a love so full its made my heart overflow and a vulnerability so real it makes me ache from softness. Thank you for showing me what acceptance is, for showing me what compassion and mutual trust feels like. Thank you for all the ways you accept and love every piece of me and all the ways I hope and pray I can give that back to you. Thank you for being my constant, my reliability, the ground I stand on when everything I thought was solid falls away. I love you more than any of the words I could conjure would indicate. Youre my everything. Mwah."

That would be absurd and give you too much power over my ability to love myself. I had it in within me before we met. But ever since I met you, you have elevated the joy that was already inside of me. You have single handedly broke the shell I held around my heart. You reminded me that it is okay to feel and allow myself to connect  but only to those who are worthy to know what is inside of my head. And you, with your divine eyes that melted me from within, are worthy of my vulnerability. I trust you. I trust you because you remind me to continue to love myself all the while loving someone else. It was always either I loved me or I loved someone, but with you, I can love both. You encouraged me to address my shadows even deeper than I had before you. I can now continuously improve myself with new clarity and elevated sense of joy. I dont do this for you, I was already doing it before you, but ever since Ive met you, I have moved more inner obstacles than I would have before knowing you. And for that, I love you. You have elevated my already possessed inner joy, and its the most beautiful feeling Ive ever felt. It may lack the false intensity people look for; that intense rush of emotions that make people think its love. Instead, the energy that you bring me is peace. They say the highest vibrations are love, peace, and joy... And for that, I love you."

6,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Days like today,1,i9bu3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/i9bu3e/days_like_today/,2020-08-14 10:30:30,"I have to write my thoughts to calm the ramblings in my head. Hey papi, guess what? Today is day three of no smoking for me! Its not too bad actually Im fine. I always knew its what you wanted all those years ago and how much you hated it. I go back in my thoughts and wish that I did more to do right by you when we were together. I think the pain I feel right now just means the week we spent together made my soul come alive. I avoided the idea of meeting up with you for days not knowing how you would react towards me since the last time things went all wrong. I knew Id be under your spell again with just one look. I mean it was your birthday and you said your only wish was to see me. Sure enough, you got me lol. I go back and forth between staying where Im at but something inside me tells me to call you and tell you that I would give up my whole life just to be by your side. Im technically home but surrounded with nothing but mundaneness and comfortability. No love or passion in life. So why did I choose to stay? Because its where I wouldnt be able to hurt you, its where my heart stays hidden. Here my soul is numb, nothing brings me joy but I dont complain because Im blessed. I take things day by day. Here I dont live on dreams and hopes of the future, true love and kids. Here my world is shielded and cant shatter my heart any worse. When I see men I dont want to know their hearts just their bodies. I dont tell anyone much of myself, because vulnerability can be used to hurt you with later. Play the part. No one understands how sad someones soul can be but only the strength the portray in face of the world. When I was with you it was like I was a little girl all over again. My heart raced with so much excitement just knowing you were close. I found myself cheesing and laughing at every text you sent me. Our touches sent chills down to the deepest core of my body. We made love like it was our last days on Earth. You gave me a reason to get out of bed. For the first time in years I realized that saying you have to love yourself first before you can love anyone else isnt true. I love you no matter how much I hate myself. I knew you wanted to stay but just like I did all those years ago I told you to go. I destroy everything I love, everything I touch and I dont feel like I deserve you. I dont know whats wrong with my head but it tells me to let you be free of my burdens. Your mom doesnt accept me cause Im not Catholic and your brother hates me for what I put you through. So forget about me, because I dont ever want to hurt you again. Please forgive me for betraying you and my heart. Please move on and be happy even though you see right through me to know that Im full of shit and this isnt what I truly want. But you give me my own will to make that call. Youre the most handsome man in the World even with some bad homemade tattoos you got when you were younger, I gladly kiss them all. No one knew my soul and my heart better than you did. For 4 years you were my rock, and I was yours. I was never the same after you and I hurt a lot of people from not dealing with that pain in the right way. But you believe in me and truly make me feel like I can do better so I try for you because doing it for me isnt enough. This letter remains unsent but Ill talk to you on the phone later tonight about daily routines and random stuff just being content knowing you exist. I love you forever."

You're going to do this next step imperfectly. It's going to feel like you're messing it all up, like it's all falling apart and you're in way over your head. You're about to learn you have to be vulnerable to survive, and learn it while fleeing a situation that has taught you that vulnerability is an emotional death sentence. Don't give up. See it through. There is an end to it, I promise. It's going to get better."
8,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,To The Girl I Should Have Given a Chance,1,icj18s,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/icj18s/to_the_girl_i_should_have_given_a_chance/,2020-08-19 17:17:29,"(Throwaway; no one will really read this anyway, more just doing this to process) I think about it every night. I've thought about it for the past 7 years. Every time I see someone hold their love in their arms, or every time I hear my friends talk about who they just adore, or every time I smell the perfume you wore to the homecoming where I first met you, or every time I hear a voice that sounds all too familiar to yours... I remember what it felt like to love  to love with all that is you. I have never really told anyone this, but not just confronting my fear of vulnerability and working through the stress that prevented me from loving you entirely loving you authentically, loving you with all of me  is my biggest regret. I fear knowing that I should have made another decision in the past, but that there is nothing to do now to amend what is already done. However, this is now my reality. I miss the days of waking up anxiously; I miss the days of walking into school dreading the moment I see you because I felt as though everyone was watching me and would see me for how vulnerable I really am; I miss the days of feeling a false sense of accomplishment for having avoided too many moments of embarrassment; I miss the days of where I didn't realize that all I was doing was disappointing you; I miss the days where I had a chance to know what it meant to love you and you love me. In retrospect, I realize this was never true love. It was never true love, but it could have been. It could have been, had I only given it a chance... a chance I will never have back. To live without regret is the greatest accomplishment. I wish this, if nothing else, for you. Take care, [retracted]"

I felt undeserving and fearful of the vulnerability required to find that again. But my way of thinking has changed when you walked into my life. I used to enjoy the idea of complete solitude. And despite the tendency of keeping myself to myself, I always end up finding excuses just to spend time with you. Your hug makes me feel appreciated. The feel of your warm hands gripping me tight makes me feel safe. Your hungry kisses wipe away the stress the day has given me. There are only a few people in my life who get meand you happened to be one of them. You are the reason for the smile that you have always adored."

Everyone said one of those days it would happen. They gave you two more days, said that you'd leave us and finally be resting in peace. But as the days went by, you hung on. We were all wondering what made you linger around. That lady at the hospital said sometimes patients hang in there for a while because there's someone they need to say goodbye to, so we made sure everyone got to say theirs. Your youngest grandchild graduated, another one returned from his trip. Your long-detached sister showed up to make amends (my dad swears he saw your mouth curve in a smile) and your former daughters in law paid their respects. And still, you waited. You clawed to this world like you'd done your entire life. You waited, like you used to, for all of us to show up. Like you used to do every Sunday at noon when we visited you for lunch. Waited like you used to do for everyone to finish their food at the table. You waited for as long as you wanted to. It wouldn't matter what the doctors might say, whether they thought you'd stay for one, two or three more days. We knew you'd leave when you thought was right for you. Nobody had ever told you what to do. For an entire week, you and us all, just waited. And then, a few hours into December 1st 2019, it happened. You left. I woke up to the news in the morning and saw your youngest son, my dad, crying. It must be hard to lose your parents, and it made me appreciate his vulnerability a lot more. Maybe we all thought you so strong, part of us thought you'd never fully leave. But you did, and you were finally at peace. Then, as I looked at the calendar on my phone, I realised why you'd waited. I think we all did. You had waited for a Sunday. And in doing so, you gathered us all one last time, one last Sunday at noon, to say goodbye."

13,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,What happens when I have something to say?,1,ie358w,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/ie358w/what_happens_when_i_have_something_to_say/,2020-08-22 05:11:11,"Hi, I hope youre doing well. Im sure youre taking care of yourself. I know last I messaged you, you said that you didnt want to talk. I hear you, I respect you, and I accept that. Therefore, this message is for you when you are ready to read. I do not require a reply, and it would be better if there wasnt Ive been having a great deal of interpersonal dialogue since we last saw each other, as I know you have as well. Cycles of over-thinking have started to fray, and tight knots loosen from being thoughtfully pulled and examined. There are a lot of things that I want to say to you, but there are very few things I need to say to you. Its very easy to come up with things one wants to say, as the whole dam of emotion is hoping to break through. But finding things one needs to say is a much more patient task. I used to think I was a very patient person, but certainly this message is to the contrary. However, I realized that the person I need to be patient with is not you, but myself. And if Im going to give myself time to heal, I have to take that step whether youre ready or not. I owe that to myself, as do you to yourself. What I need you to know, is that I love you. There are a great deal of people who love you. Love doesnt get vacuum sucked out, or rearranged like legos. It can change states, but I truly believe that once love is let into the heart, it doesnt go. Often thats where our sorrow is found, if not the only place. You are loved, and you are love. Because love is infinite and undying, so is the power of forgiveness. Through love we come to enjoy one another through recognition of our own joys and sorrows. Our reflections tell us were not alone. That we are heard, and can be heard. That we are seen not by the illusion of our physical bodies, but by the progress of our care and attention. When someone commits a trespass against us, its important to recognize the reflection, and see their holistic schema. Forgiveness then becomes as easy as forgiving yourself...which can be brutally difficult. There are many things I could ask you to forgive me of. My contributions to your indecision, my unhealthy fixation on you, invading your personal space, crossing boundaries, and disrespecting you. I have no justification for my actions, beyond that they were guided by what I felt to be true. I am sorry for the consequences of these actions, but I forgive myself for making them. I know why I did them, no matter how flawed, and I have grown beyond those choices. I recognize the person I was, and I am happy to speak with them regularly to find out what they need in a healthy way. I think I unintentionally used you to explore my own boundaries. I did that without communicating so, and when I didnt, I became upset with you for not reading my mind. I put unfair expectations on your friendship, and Im sorry for putting you in that position. I tried to let you set the boundaries and cross them when you were ready, but Im know I pushed too hard. There never should have been that expectation in the first place. I believe Ive gone too long without therapy, and thats also fucked for my friends. Theres a term for those with BPD called favorite person in which they latch onto someone in an unhealthy way. That person becomes a part of their identity and can lead to a lot of internal destructive thinking. I think I did this to you, and the pressure must of have been immense. Im sure you werent just feeling that from me. I know I put a lot of added stress on you over the past few years. I dont know what kind of toll that put on you, but I want to understand so I can be more mindful. Although, youve done your part in my development, I dont expect anything more. You can only rely on people for so long before they cant hold themselves. I want you to know that I forgive you. Ive been hung up on this for a long time. Too long. You listened to me and apologized, and I will always be so thankful for that day. I really felt that you had heard me. I cant shake the feeling that I forgave you too soon without truly forgiving you internally. Ive never been as vulnerable as I have with you. Every time we stop talking, I reassess what part of my vulnerability or honesty pushed you away. I felt like I was in this hell where I couldnt be honest AND keep you as a friend. Now that we arent talking again, I see this is true. Thats ok. I have made peace with what has happened. I saw you read my journal on the beach, and I believe you read something personal. If I am wrong, then I am sorry for the accusation. Im not trying to accuse, as Im not even mad. I wish you hadnt, but its my fault for bringing it. I realized that I trusted you too soon, when I was not ready to trust, and hurt myself. I spoke to my co-worker about going to visit you and she reminded me that fear is a good indicator of something I need to do. I told her I was scared Id lose your friendship, and she said than that was meant to be. I shouldnt have let you hoover me when I was getting over you. It was too soon. But now I know how you actually feel. I do think its really shitty how you just stop talking to me without a real explanation. Or tell me you have to, ...get back to reality. Its clear now that we were not equally invested. I forgive you because I know you, and I know you dont have bad intentions. You are taking this step to care for yourself, and as someone who cares about you (no matter how hard it hurts) I want you to do what you must. I forgive you because I know the hurt youve caused me is not from you, but myself. My ego and expectations are what pain me, not you. This is the fourth time youve discarded me and I cant do this again. Ive been hurt too many times to trust you again. I dont want a friendship without trust, especially one I cant trust to even be there. And I dont want to be hurt again trying to make it work. I see the cycle of abuse on both ends and it should stop. Im ready to let this relationship go as I know it is the mature decision for the both of us. I really respect, admire, and thank you for taking that first step. Ive been scared to do it, but I know its whats best. I dont hold any grudges against you, truly. I dont like the way I was treated but I allowed myself to be treated that way. Word of advice from someone whos been your friend, lover, and companion...there are natural consequences to the things you do. Whether that means an action you take or a word you say, it has meaning to things outside of you. You impact the world around you, and just because you intend for something to go a certain way, it doesnt mean the whole universe is gonna bend to your will. If you hurt people enough times they wont trust you. If you lash out at people enough times theyll learn to fear you. If you gaslight someone enough youll get them to doubt their own feelings, and you will become a tormentor. These are natural consequences. Youve made a lot of shitty decisions in your life and youve gotten out of all of them...you act without thinking all the time and you never consider the consequences. You cant just do and take what you want when you want it. Your indecision hurts people when acted upon. These are the consequences. Just think before you move. The cricket is one of the fastest insects alive because it jumps. It doesnt just walk, or run. It carefully scans its environment with large antennae, and AFTER its planned its course, it moves swiftly to the next position. Be like the cricket. Be bold in your decisions, but dont jump before you know where youre going. You wont only hurt yourself along the way, and youll probably hurt others more than youll ever realize. And dont take yourself so seriously. Your emotions arent more important that others because you feel them. You dont even know if youre feeling another persons emotions, its probably projecting. I want to help you, but Im not gonna let you stab me while doing so... I love you, this is goodbye"

It hurts in ways I didnt even know it was possible. Depression is being vulnerable in ways other people arent. Depression is going low and slowly pulling yourself up which should count as a friking super power because its damn hard. By someone telling you that your vulnerability freaks them out, it means that YOU freak them out because that depression, that mental disorder is part of you and even if you wanted to, you cant just make it go away. Every time I stumble I learn something new, wether its about myself, about someone or just about life. This time? I dont even know what Im learning. Am I learning to just stop being sensible? Am I learning to just stop looking for someone special? Am I learning that Im not worth it? Or am I learning (once more?) that people suck? Im tired of learning... Im very tired."

There's so much I want to tell you, but I have to thank you for being by my side on my worst. And I'm sorry I caused you discomfort throughout it. I am in love with you, I dont regret it despite it being one sided. You are my best friend, the complete definition of the one to me and our friendship is bigger than one of us feeling awkward to push the other away. We discussed that and I just love how everything is easy with you. However, the reason I am away is to focus on my goals, to give you space to have a proper sleep pattern since I've ruined yours and to make sure I am successful enough to be able to recover from the past events and to have a chance with you, free of any slight negativity or toxicity. I want to be a proper partner that would make you happy. Of course if possible as discussed. I'm falling asleep, so I'll just say, you're so amazing to me, regardless of the insecurities and the vulnerability or any other thing. You are great and I wish I could let you see you the way I see you. But that day is yet to come. For now, good night and I hope you're doing good."

Deep within the depths of my imagination, I gave you a whole area of dedication and admiration. I lived in a hidden land with you by my side, and it let me escape the real hell I was living in. The real hell no one knew about because of the power of silence. You knew me in real life. But not in the way I wanted to let you know me. We were distant. Despite being mere meters apart for nearly a decade. Oh I WISHED you loved me on every star that there was. What I got was a perfect kiss. It was so youthful and yet from that innocence I became a villain in another young girls story. I was always the most clever of them all and you knew it and I knew it. I picked up on every pattern you threw and I loved to be the little sleuth in the line on does who loved you. I wanted you to pick me forever. Even if I was painted in gothic, strangely whimsical colors. It felt like the whole world was cheering us on, from my lenses. Its funny how two souls can look at all the same evidence and come to different conclusions. But you didnt get all of my evidence. You didnt see the feelings and the dreams and the way they literally came true. Its so hard to let go because a part of me thought it was written in the stars. Even with a harsh reality in my face I still wished that you would love me someday. I know I could have hurt you, if you loved me, by how I acted with the other heros of this world. I am sorry, I thought if I got something like you it would fill the void that loving you in my mind had left me. Somehow though I just left a heart draggin through tragedy. And now Ive got my rugged heart showing up at your door. And I already knew. To hold back vulnerability. And keep myself composed so as not to leave an embarassing annoyance in your mind. And I knew that what I said to you would be divine. And infinite. And colorful. And full of love and confusing intentions. Full of desire. Full of intent to be protected. Full of fear of the ending. But I left with more dignity. Less fear. The feeling of knowing it was hopeless and accepting it. Thats a feeling. No one can take the love that I felt for you away. But I sure wonder how it wouldve felt to really receive that love from you. Now that I have a much bigger mess to pick up. I am letting go of you. My love will go into the infinite realm of past. And it will be done. My breaths will show me what it was all for. And maybe one day Ill see you in the street and we will smile because we both know something these other people dont. Curiously, Ms. Alice of Wonderland"

Attention starved and seeking touch. My skin would blanket you if it could. Intertwined to form a living knot of what we need from what we have despite what we may want. Tightly together, we would be tethered, focused on keeping our romantic threads alive. Close enough for you to let me treat you to the way I feel about you. Let me radiate into your every second. When you get bored, be bored with me. I've had enough of lazy love. I want in-love. Deep and desperate. Absolute trust and vulnerability. I'm terrified you already know. And so I burn to cauterise the feelings in case you don't feel the same, but this hot glow beneath could never hurt you. In my weakest moments I fear I'll never have your warmth against my skin.

too random to even be thought out too random to be a test ur reasoning for what you did to me switches every single time its brought up. its a new story. every. single. time. its always something new, something different, kinda like my hair color except not on the same league! what i do believe is that yes you were being honest. that there is some sort of truth to it all because you cant just lie like that. just stop lying about it? i wanted to feel better is all as i did put my all into you i only wanted to feel human someone whos sane because i wasnt in that moment theres nothing wrong with being turned on and not ok. theres nothing wrong with wanting intimacy in bad times where youre only hurting my self esteem. is it so wrong to not want to be hurt? is it so wrong to crave that and be turned on by the thought of actually being appreciated and treated like an actual human being? being able to address emotions and being praised within intimate actions? is it so wrong to wanting to be told that im beautiful and not hear the throwing around verbal insults directed at me? is it so wrong to just be turned on by the fact that maybe you are capable of love and not a vindictive selfish heartless abuser because thats my way of trying to heal from trauma. to be given something i never received. the thought of it drives me to sanity not insanity. not being comforted while i was at my most vividly transparent state and being torn apart from was absolutely hysterical and i say that with sadness. ever since that day, i was lead from the next day forward to being emotionally distressed i want all of that fucked out of me i want sanity sanity is sexy to me because that used to be something i had and i want it back. i generally just love going after what i want because i wont stop until i get what i want and thats whats so sexy about it to me its thrilling its fun its adventurous and sometimes cruel its a rollercoaster and i love a good ride but you view stability, vulnerability, being able to care, being dedicated as something wrong. so those desires were never fulfilled it isnt humiliating, it isnt innocence, its something real and not false perpetration. its realistic and raw and comes from the emotion within. being broken down and then being comforted im already broken just never comforted and during that day i wish i was but i wasnt and never was because no closure was ever given and its unfair but thats ok some people are just monsters its a DIVERSE world! that is why im still hung up on it lol and in a way it angers me ive thought about revenge but what is revenge without purpose why bother emotionally hurting you trying to recreate the way you emotionally hurt and tormented me when youre hurt every day time will do its job on you plus at the end of the day, im a firm believer in not being able to hurt loved ones if you do love them and i did love you. i cant purposely hurt you because that would hurt me i dont thrive on negativity, i thrive on positivity, and you tried to ruin my outlook on that which by the way; major fuck you for that all in all it wouldnt make me a better person it wouldnt make me feel better itd be stooping low low to a level where youre at because its so easy for you to hurt me knowing that it never affected you as much as if affected me though makes me feel like you were cheating on me but that isnt what hurts the most what hurts is youre happily mind fucking with me and are okay with it youre still lying but you live to deny it a person like you is someone whos only concerned when their feelings are hurt and thats who u are manipulative cunning trash i was just madly in love with you and it only took a few words but harsh ones to make me snap out of it and i didnt want to be snapped out of it so you took something away from me you took away my view on love. the stability, the patience, the trust, i had for you. you ruined my portrayal and how i viewed you this isnt something that ill ever be able to heal from because i will never know if you were being honest or dishonest either way: you are still being dishonest dishonest about cheating on me if you truly didnt // \\ dishonest about not cheating on me despite telling me you did. regardless: ingenuous damage was caused you still lied who lies about cheating when everything was perfect? no one in their right mind does unless they cheated what i do believe is there was some truth to what you said because it sounded real. you cant fake something like that, i just know you cant if you can though, you have more than just psychopathic tendencies going on i know you cant though because i know you i considered you to be my soulmate at one point i knew who you were on ** instant so i just know and what sucks even more is, you arent honest with me when ive been telling you i would rather just have you be honest with me tell me how it is already. stop dodging. you dont care. or maybe you do. just not enough to stop fucking around :) what im trying to say is, i get turned on in deem inappropriate situations because im seeking for that stability i once had. a connection, the consolation, something you used to give me before you destroyed it its about feeling understood when i know im not being understood. just feeling when i refer to missing the old you, i miss the way i viewed our relationship, the way i viewed myself, the way i viewed you. it was perfect even through all of those imperfections. everything was just right. or maybe it wasnt and i was just blind to it all the point is i will never know  im sorry but i cant do this anymore. having flashbacks of this is overwhelming. im an idiot. i shouldve seen this coming from the start to where you chose ** over me, to last summer where it was **** next where you went behind my back. its the fact that ill always feel like a second choice. and you deem it that way i was never like this but i was with you because its how you treated me and you should be ashamed its the fact that you can delete me in two seconds, make me ponder for hours, and come back like nothing happened knowing ill welcome you back with open arms its the fact that you can delete me out of your life because i told you how i felt. that you werent treating me like i was a girlfriend. and then you go ahead and do that. that speaks volume. you deleted me over something innocent. self expression. you constantly and i mean constantly hurt me knowing what the outcome would be and what it would do to me no matter the amount of messages, contacts, whatever it is, you show me, i will always be sketched out because like you told me cheaters will always find a way to cheat. im just not enough and no one will ever be enough to you. if you cheated you cheated youre not good for my mental health if youre only stigmatizing the ruination of it theres nothing more i despise than someone whos a pathological self condescending liar who will never learn. it all vendors from that call and its traumatizing because i will never know but i will trust what my instinct alludes to deep down you hurt me and you continue to but im not going to allow you to do any of that anymore no revenge no grudges no nothing i just cant do it anymore, i seriously cant, like its so bad. it mentally fucks me up. and it continues to get worse and worse and worse and i c a n t d o i t a n y m o r e its so easy for you to call it quits and shift blame and say youre done so live with it because im done as well what happened has happened some people you cant change some people wont change some people are terrible, ego centric bullshitters who cant help but lie and lie and lie and then wonder why be faithful then.  long letter short if you will: craving emotional comfort results in wanting physical comfort after being in an abusive relationship that also gave me daddy issues except he wasnt obviously my father. also side note: these are just my random thoughts, i dont even know what i think anymore like im just confused. would prefer if no comments were made on this post as well as this is a venting letter and im just too embarrassed the end"
21,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,For S From J,1,hktz4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/hktz4e/for_s_from_j/,2020-07-04 10:15:33," I saw a letter here the other day that looked like it couldve been from you, and It was titled with a J and an S. I hope it was from you. Ive been wanting to write something for you for the last couple of weeks. Ive been wondering whether Ive given this a fair amount of thought or if there are things Im bottling up subconsciously and I wanted to really dive into it and see how it felt. So I wrote it all out in the middle of the night a few nights ago and by the end of it I was a wreck. That I did not expect. I cried nearly as hard as the night with you in my car. And it felt amazing, and I slept so hard I was late for work that day (probably gonna get in trouble for that tomorrow Im kind of stressed). It was everything I wished could feel appropriate and called for to tell you, that I didnt know I wanted to tell you. Its such a special part of relationships - that like, aftershock. The epilogue where neither person gets to read the others. And they both carry the weight of the relationship by themselves for a minute. I get that scene in louie with the old man walking the dog, telling louie how lucky he is to be heartbroken because *thats* love. Not the middle part, the end. When you miss her. I always loved the scene and I thought I got the jist before - but after that, how I felt when I wrote your name for the first time in weeks, that was definitely love. As if I didnt know before, that sealed it. Its been such a strange month (? its been a little over that probably), Ive never felt this way before. The night I drove home from your house and in the days after it felt like I had my whole body tensed and waiting for a giant wave to knock me off my feet, afraid and powerless. But it didnt come. When I opened my eyes, the wave became the tide quietly brushing up to my ankles. And it retreated back. Rhythmically coming and going, but manageable. It was okay. I felt guilty at first. I felt guilty for being okay, I felt like I owed you more than that. I fought for us so hard. I loved you so much. I mean I adored you. I didnt take a minute for granted, I told you everything I felt for you and held nothing back. For, unfortunately, the first time I closed my eyes, fell back and felt it all. I looked at you like god - you were everything to me. I wished I could put you in a cup and drink you. You were the fuckin best. So why wasnt I kicking and screaming? Why was it tranquility I felt after losing the one most important part of my life It was because that breathlessness people feel, the internal tantrum we throw when we lose somebody comes from having loose ends I think. From not meeting the potential you felt was there to reach and leaving things unsaid. And the same vulnerability and adoration I shared every bit of with you, the words and feelings that I knew in the back of my mind would be what killed me at the end - is what made it okay. I felt you in a way so true that I was left with little more to feel. I felt acceptance. Id done my kicking and screaming two months ago sat out front of your house, sobbing into your chest . When I realized Id tried everything I could think of to keep you, and itd all lead to where we were, and it wasnt fucking fair. I did it all in front of you So it felt okay. Even though you were still front and center on my mind, I felt happy and sentimental to remember. It feels stupid to say that it felt poetic. Looking back was like flipping through pages of an old scrapbook. You miss the people and the memories, but mostly youre grateful you had them at all. The intensity of the flame left me warm when it was gone. I hope you dont remember me badly, and I hope I meant and mean as much to you as you mean to me. I hope you remember the same things that I do. We fought a lot, that goes without saying. There were a lot of things you did that frustrated me. You were stubborn as hell, short tempered, quick to assume the worst. You didnt trust me - it hurt a lot to know that. But I know I gave you reasons not to. I know that what youve been through before I showed up, what you were dealing with while I was there, made your trust fragile and there were times I mishandled it. Especially in the beginning. Im sorry. There was too much inside of you to handle being worried about me. I would tell you how I wished I could bring you inside my brain so you could feel what I do and understand that there didnt need to be questions about my loyalty. I wanted you as much as I could possibly have you. I wanted you to believe me and I want you to believe me now. I was yours and no matter how ugly it could have possibly turned, if you wanted to fix it I would do mine to fix it with you. I did not want to leave. But you didnt want to fix it anymore. You needed to move on. And thats okay too I know that you tried as hard as you could for me. You couldnt hold my hand as tightly as I wanted you to, but you held it as hard as you could for as long as you could and thats as much as I could ask for. Thank you a million times for that. Its always going to be a shame. That I didnt get to take you to flying tiger when they opened again, that I never got to see you in your little swimsuit, or have you help me again as much as you knew how while I cooked something in the kitchen. That I wont have another picture of you to add to the hundreds in my camera roll. Or wake up and see you laying next to me in the morning. Or afternoon really. Ill always miss that. I miss playing with you. Little things we did every day are the things that built the love I had and theyre the only things I remember when I think of you. I hope this letter wasnt too lame. I miss you little sarita. And I love you. Id do it again as soon as you asked me to. I still have all the little notes and drawings you made me. I keep them in my glovebox. But I dont look at them. I hope you still have the little presents I gave you. I hope you still have that little piece of flower taped up on your wall. I hope youre okay. I wish youd have wished me a happy birthday And I still want my damn socks. ~ J"

I wonder if all the times I look into your eyes and smile at you you know Im falling. I wonder if you can read my energy and know that I see you, all of you, and I am not afraid of you. That your energy speaks to me and draws me in. I wonder if you know that I could be the one youve been looking for, that I wouldnt have to compromise myself or you to do it. I wonder if you know that I would reciprocate your energy, and move to the flow of your divinity because Im falling into it. I wonder if you know that when I look at you my chest swells and my heart beats faster when you look back at me with those eyes that tell me Im perfect. I wonder if you will figure out that the vulnerable expressions you give me about yourself make me want to nurture you and give you everything youve wanted. Everything youve waited for. On God I would never hurt you. I want to give you the love youve been missing, the care and tenderness you need. I want to dance in your energy and fall into your skin. I want you to look at me and know I would give my heart to you if you let me. But only if you let me. That you dont have to worry or fear that I would compromise you. I want you to know that I would be down for you, free of the jealousy and insecurities that have hurt you in the past. I want you to know that you could move as you do and I wouldnt change a thing about it. That Id support you and uplift you, celebrate with you and value you. I want you to know that your past doesnt bother me. That your vulnerabilities are met with care and attentiveness. That I see you, the deeper you, and theres no other being like you...that I never believed someone like you could exist. And as I sit here writing all of this, I cry because I know my spirit is falling &amp; Im both scared and excited. I never fall like this. Ive never wanted someone this much. Yet I want you. All of you. Every vulnerability, every thought, every moment. The present and the future. And all I can do is hope that you feel the same and that none of this is an illusion. I hope and pray that this is for real and I found that person who transcends me. They say energy doesnt lie, and I cant find the lie. I cant find the hidden energy because it feels like theres nothing hiding and I hope to God Im right. And even though this is how I feel right now, Im still not yet attached to you. I wont attach until youre mine and I know this isnt all for nothing. Because if I attached to you now, I could end up hurt because its still too early to tell. I just hope the signs, the energy, and the moments we share are in truth."

Pretending I would have seen something specific, beautiful vulnerability, wonderful madness, but what if it was a reflection of my memories about you? Were it my memories or my imagination? I cant remember. Who are you? and what do you want from me? What do I expect from you? Is it me or is it you? When did it become this way? Casual conversations filled with casual lies. There is no end to something with no beginning. All these thoughts and unsaid things becoming more and more blurred, Emotions are beginning to fade, Showing the surface of my feelings towards you."

You probably told me what they were, but I was incredibly drunk and even more screwed up when you pulled over. I'd been walking for a while, in a country that wasn't my own, a suitcase with a broken wheel dragging behind me whilst I tried to find my way to anywhere which wasn't with Him. Because he'd broken me by that point. He took my kindness, my adoration, my creativity, my vulnerability and my hope, and he slowly crushed them down until I couldn't remember how to feel anything but a numb sort of desperation. I wasn't me anymore. I had fallen in love with the lies he told, the promises he never kept, and when he finally decided he was done with me - already moving on to the next girl - he still let me fly out there again to further drag me down. He knew I saw it as a desperate attempt to remind him of how much I loved him, how deeply I wanted to support him, how much I believed in what we had. And he knew he could break me down further. So, I ran. I finally broke, and I ran. I escaped into the night and walked down that dark, deserted road in Massachusetts, after waiting for him to pass out from the usual bottle of vodka - his daily bottle. I was a 27 year old, mentally ill and vulnerable British girl, running away from the person who'd told me to come to him. Who'd made me fall in love. Who'd twisted my words for months, taking my strengths and grinding them down into weaknesses, yelling abuse at me over the phone - **cunt, whore, bitch** - and then cycling back to love me even harder, tears slipping into his voice as he apologised, more promises, proposals, compliments, adoration. And then back to the rage, the abuse, separating me slowly and quietly from my friends so that he was all I had. All I loved. I was so fucking vulnerable. I was so fucking weak. It took less than a week for me to fall for him. That night, The Night I Ran, I was drunk. I needed to be drunk, seeing as I couldn't feel anything anymore and needed the alcohol to show him what he needed to see - because it didn't matter that he was done with me. He still needed me to love him. He still needed me to adore him. And I could only do that whilst intoxicated. I was too worn to do it sober. It was hard navigating the paths, especially whilst sobbing so violently. Sometimes the paths dipped, cracked, and I remember going over on my ankle and feeling the pain run up my entire leg - I cried harder. I came across a church, a little white church at the side of the road, and I limped right to it in my first and only attempt to seek some sort of spiritual aid, a kind stranger. I didn't care that it was 12am. I hammered on the door, screaming to be let in, begging, pleading. Needing something, or someone, to tell me I was going to be okay. No one. Nothing. So I stumbled further down the road, to the point where the path ended and a bridge began - I started signalling to cars going past, not caring if it was stupid, not caring if I was putting myself in a dangerous situation. Anything was better than the ritualistic breaking down of my soul and sanity by the man I still fucking loved. I held my hand out, I cocked my thumb, I choked on my tears and I waited. And waited. And started to walk again. Didn't know where. Didn't know how I'd get there. But it didn't matter, just as long as I got away. Then, you two. A car, turning around, pulling over, a window going down. A man's face, brow creased in concern. ""Hey, are you all right?"" And a woman's voice: ""Do you need a ride, hon?"" You two. I didn't even hesitate. I nodded, said that I did. Gestured to my suitcase and said, ""I'm sorry."" Apologising for my baggage. What a laugh. You didn't hesitate, either. You got out of the car, popping the trunk and putting my suitcase in. You opened the rear door for me, waiting until I was seated and then closed it for me. Got in the driver's seat. Then you, the woman in the passenger seat, turned around and looked me straight in the eyes. ""You're not even a little okay, are you? You wanna talk about it?"" I shook my head. ""Just, please don't kill me."" And then I laughed. I laughed a lot, and then cried. And asked, politely, again, for you to please not kill me. You promised, both of you. You reached back and took my hand in yours, and you said, ""You're not the first person in this car to walk crying with a suitcase down the road at night. And I told him that, too. I told him that I knew exactly who you were, and exactly where you were going. Because I know, hon. Believe me, I know."" And I could tell that you did. You had dyed blonde hair, your hand smelled like cigarette smoke, and you had understanding eyes. I sobbed harder, and as you softly clicked your tongue and soothed me with a few strokes to the back of my hand, it all came pouring out - or, at least, some of it did. I told you both that I felt insane. I told you both that I had Bipolar, that I was having some sort of emotional break, that I just needed to escape. I told you that much. I couldn't tell you more. At the time, I didn't quite realise what was happening to me and I was still - even then - fiercely loyal to Him. I didn't want to speak badly of Him. Maybe you believed me, maybe you didn't, but you didn't question me further. You talked, both of you, telling me that you lived nearby, taking me to your house whilst telling me small details about your lives. You were a couple, but you were in a polyamorous relationship with another woman back at the house. It didn't phase me. I didn't care. You were kind to me. You took me to the basement - I was nervous at this point, but not cognisant enough to be concerned - and showed me the bathroom, the bed. You gave me a cigarette and a drink, and showed me the garage where your workout equipment was. You talked, continued to just let me adjust and process and listen so that I didn't have to think. You offered to let me stay as long as I needed. You showed me where I could charge my phone. You told me to help myself to anything in the bathroom. You gave me the WiFi password so that I could check my WhatsApp messages. And they came in hard, heavy. Abuse. Anger. Him, demanding to know where I was. Going from anger, to apparent worry, back to anger again. Cussing. Messages from his sister, who had figured out what was happening and begging to come and find me, to help me. You saw the look on my face, and you hugged me. You probably knew it was more than just my mental illness. Eventually I called his sister, not him, and agreed that she could come and get me. She spoke to you, and you arranged a public place to pick me up. You walked me there, both of you holding my hands, telling me it was going to be okay. God. You were just so unfailingly kind. You hugged me again, both of you, before I left. And I wish so much, so fucking much, that I knew your names. That I could find you on social media and tell you that you probably saved my life that night. That by picking up a random, drunk, sobbing British woman on the side of the road in the USA, you probably stopped me from walking into oncoming traffic. I left a few days later. I wish I could tell you that, too. I wish I could tell you that four years later, I'm in a healthy relationship with someone who loves me, living with him, with a beautiful cat and a growing little garden. I wish I could tell you that I think of you a lot, that I've tried finding you before. I wish I could tell you that you gave me a tiny little shred of hope for the human race, that even though I made a stupid, reckless, dangerous decision to get in the car with two strangers on the most fucked up night of my life, it ended up being the right thing to do. Because of you. Thank you. Thank you so much."

A tear falls down as the only thing I can do is respect your decision, your lack of interest, your want for a different future. Lasting love, unconditional with forgiveness is just a fairytale. I tell myself to be strong. Focus on self, health, do what makes you happy, take the time and allow my heart to heal.

People talk about fate, destiny or *if it's mean to be it'll happen* - but I don't buy that. I believe it comes down to a choice. You make a choice everyday that passes. You choose to love, to forgive.. to make it work. Together and for each other. We decided to leave it on time and reach out when we wanted, but where are you? Do I need to reach out first despite what you said to me? I know your past. Vulnerability is your kryptonite, but don't you think I was scared to? Know one wants to feel this way. The greatest of love is connected to the potential of loss. You can't have light without dark. If you felt as I did, why won't you reach out to me?

Today was eye opening in so many ways - and I'm beginning to think that once again I have assumed a fear of attachment for what really is ... nothing. You speak as if you have so much knowledge, yet refuse to share a single example of ""1000s"" you posses. C'mon man talk of healthy boundaries? Safe people? There really aren't there are they - it's an act. Healthy boundaries =/= mixed messages, safe people are not inherently mistrustful and they certainly do not assumed that all other people are all good or all bad - that's straight splitting, FFS. Today I told you I trust you enough and consider you a friend. You told me that i don't know you, that you could give a fuck all of what I think of you personally - okay now we've moved into an entire fireworks display going off all at once. Damn, you are right - THEY ARE THERE FROM THE START! LOOK IM LEARNING SO MUCH FROM YOU! Now I'll be sure not to think so little of myself that I would let anyone treat me like that. Straight up fuck you for that comment, how fucking hurtful and callous. Hypocrite, seriously - empathic and compassionate MY FUCKING ASS. This time I may end up taking you up on your over eager ""I'll be just fine if you walk away"" speech you give when you are suddenly confronted with MY compassion, MY courage, MY strength, MY abilities, MY truth, MY understanding, MY intelligence, MY vulnerability, MY trust, MY integrity, MY empathy, MY selflessness, MY love. Realizing that while you're ""telling"" me you're these things - I'm the only one who IS ACTUALLY DOING THEM. So here's my letter from a few weeks ago, and hot damn - the only thing that has changed is that I recognize the ""mistake"" was once again falling yet another mirroring of my worth in the eyes and words of another covert narcissist who could never possibly be able to reciprocate what I offer ... on uany level. I'm like actually done, even if I discovered that I am wrong, and that you're really just afraid to be hurt ... ""Time is short, it's precious - and not worth giving to others freely without regard to the loss it causes the self "", you preached to me this morning. I asked ""how do you learn someone can be trusted?"" ... "" Over time, people reveal their true self "" your long rehearsed and spat out line. Fucking fortune cookie bullshit - running in circles. Officially over you sexually, romantically, and probably won't hold my breath for any ongoing meaningful friendship, but hey - I'm just a client, and that's really all you have claim I meant anyway. Besides your lesson here would have made me the teacher and you the student since you're incapable of recognizing you were the one who had to submit to grow your going to remain ""safely alone"" until, perhaps, another time and place, just like I have here - you recognize AND CHANGE so you dont repeat the mistake you've made withe. The rest COULD have been my gifts being given to you. Too bad your ego, your demons refuse to allow you the opportunity at becoming real. So I guess this is ... Uh, Byyyyyyye.** Velveteen Rabbit, Strange how these things unfold, how prior experience shapes perception in the here and now. It's really too bad that even though I understand your reaction now in hindsight it doesn't change the underlying truth. Truth is what we both hold above all else - the shared need for it is what sparked my interest and attraction towards you. As disappointed as it was to recognize there are likely other relationship dealbreakers which I won't go into depth about now it didn't change my attraction to you, nor has it changed my mind regarding the truly kind, caring, and trustworthy person you are - ""safe"" is the word that comes to mind. And I cannot deny that I find you incredibly physically attracted, and ugggh you smell like heaven. I'll admit that I am in desperate need of someone who can be trusted safely with physical intimacy. I assumed that you also shared the mindset that one could be sexually respectful without believing/mistaking/requiring a deeper ""relationship type"" commitment. Turns out I was incorrect, however it doesn't mean I don't understand and frankly, appreciate that your wants/needs are different than mine. Indeed found it refreshingly wholesome and genuinely sweet. Just another part of you that I find admirable, different than me but in a way that doesn't attach envy or shame with it. The closer we get emotionally, the more we become open and vulnerable with each other, really, only solidifies that future sexual engagement is something that you and I should not let happen. Make no mistake, neither of us should idealize the emotional connection between us deepening as a some foundation for something ... more. It's me who needs to be concerned about being safe enough for you - i can't change the first undeniable fact, there are dealbreakers (bluntly - mistrust of science, medicine, and my higher level of academic knowledge of psychology is in sharp contrast to your ""relationship"" with God.) Morals, basic political ideologies - we seem to have a solid fundamental agreement on - fuck I'm even impressed by the answers o parenting you gave - ESPECIALLY because you're not one!!!! You seem honest, trustworthy, soft, safe, and kind - I want that, want you so achingly much. You're so rare a find that I'm struggling to not ignore that relationships require more than just not being an abusive asshole, more than just being a good person who deserves to be loved in a way that reciprocates the way you are capable of loving. Those other things matter a great deal - to both of us. To lose sight of ourselves as individuals in order to be together would be sabotaging everything that we have fought our entire lives for - it would take two real lovable beings and create something else, something unhealthy, perhaps even toxic. Fuck, this sucks, I don't want it to be over. So I guess it's time for integrity - doing the right thing - even wheb it is the hard thing. Boundaries, you're starting to forget yours and I need to create stronger ones. I so wish it could be a romantic ending, so wish we could fall over into this love we are on the edge of, wish we could be the support and healing that we both want, need, and deserve. However as we discussed the other day, it's okay to make mistakes - it's recognizing that it was a mistake and learning in order to grow and not repeat the same behavior (thus changing something from being a mistake, instead making it a choice) that's the hard thing for people to do. I've been here before and made a mistake, now I have to make a choice. Doesn't matter how much I want something, if that something means you have to change parts of you - its not real. I Need REAL. For growth. For healing. For you. For me. For truth. For love. The Skin Horse"

For years I happily accepted the criticism, and tried to improve myself. But god damn it I am tired. Just once, cant it be possible to find acceptance ? Just someone who could care back or try to love me for what I am. Nobody could be normal in my situation, and Im tired of being judged for coping the best I can. I have no family, no close friends and no one who would notice if I lived or died. The only support I have is that which I pay for; my social life is superficial at best . I keep so much bottled up inside, and when I finally broke down enough I show vulnerability, Im mocked and ridiculed for being weak. Sadly, sometimes this comes from my own parents pretty I am punished in general by society for feeling anything but happy. No matter what I do or how hard I try, in the end Im always a burden. But people tell me to be lucky because at least I have a dog. How could anybody be mentally well balanced in my situation Im always put down for it, but how about other people feel that I had to sit by themselves at Thanksgiving or Christmas? Oh maybe if Im lucky Ill get a pity invite somewhere. How would a normal person handle it if the only people that were nice to them that werent paid half the time only did it out of pity? I dont even know what it is to have someone genuinely like me or a real friend. Im always as good as my last deed. Im tired. I dont have the energy anymore. Sometimes the loneliness just overwhelms me. There are times I wish I could reach out to people, but I would just be a burden all over again. I dont want to do this anymore; Im tired of having to bottle up everything inside. I dont want to endure the daily struggle. I just dont know what to do anymore. Even worse is when people tell me I deserve all my life ended up. Im sorry but thats bullshit because theres even serial killers that have families or people that care about them people even people in prison get visitors. Some of them that Ive done horrible things. What makes me so different from the rest of goddamn society? I just want someone to care back so badly. I want love. Thats such a hard thing to let go of again. The idea I matter to someone. Im tired of taking it like a champ, and being left in the dust when people find something better. Once I outlived my usefulness Im history, beginning with my own parents. Im alone and Im tired. I dont wanna do this anymore. Im tired of people telling me I do it for attention also...I have nowhere to put my feelings. If I didnt do this I would probably self harm. Im so angry at the doctors for not letting me have those pills. Just the way my life has been hell I should horrible I guess my death has to be two; Im not worthy like other people who wont get better Im having a peaceful death. Nope its going to be as horrible as my life was. Im tired of this"

I see you for who you are now. I see you for a narcissistic coward, unable to accept any responsibility and as someone who thrives off sympathy. You now tell people I am ill; you claim you have no idea why its come to this. You blame my bipolar and send my friends and family to convince me to fall back into you. You would contact my family to talk badly about me so regularly, not knowing it was getting back to me from my oldest sister, my youngest sister too uninformed and too impressed by your image to question the morality of your continued behavior, I only finding out about these interactions once she began to give my older sister advice on how not to get caught. I protected your imagine when the cracks appeared, both to myself and those around us. I will always regret this. You echo the claim you have changed; you say you are different from 18 months ago, a year ago, six months ago, 3 weeks ago, 5 days ago, today. You say what you need to say, recycling your excuses and backtracking until you wear me down or you find the right combination. You guilt me with stories of your past and negate my own, it has become a competition I have forfeited. Your stories of hardship and struggle became a cause of remorse and guilt for me but you used mine as ammunition in public and private. You targeted every insecurity I had to break me down and gain your control, to further your desire for my behavior to fall within your wishes, to further my dependence on you. You used humiliation to control me, you tried to isolate me by continuously telling me how my family loves you and doesnt understand me, how our friends hated me for my Asexuality, how everyone would choose you over me, you told me how much of a bad person and girlfriend I was for my sexuality. You lay on thick how much you put up with for my sexuality, how selfish I am to put you through this, despite you knowing years before we got together what I identified as. Yet every time I tried to break things off you would tell me you didnt want or need those things, you would tell me you loved me for me, you would tell me you were the only person who does or ever will understand me, you say I wont ever find someone like myself and insist you are protecting me for the terrible people I will find if I leave you. You demand another chance, you throw yourself a pity party and insist that it isnt how I say it is, you say you will change. Despite this you insisted on training me and when it becomes too much for me your mind games began all over again until I again gave in to your will once more and the sexual exposure therapy began again. You deny the things youve done, you tell me it is in my head, you tell me I have misremembered or misinterpreted as soon as your words begin to come back on you. You lie about things I have agreed to, telling me I have told you the things youve been wanting to hear. I have somehow overcome my sexuality and can now do what you like, you tell me I have simply forgotten, my revelation lasted only long enough to tell you and then vanished from my memory. I went down every avenue for you, I went to therapy to fix my sexuality, I took tests to determine if it was a physical ailment, I participated in your exposure therapy and yet it was never enough. You knew better and you said it wasnt asexuality, you insisted it was because we were drunk our first time, ignoring my past relationships and struggle with my sexuality well before I met you. Ignoring everything Ive told you, how our training affected me, because you insist you know me best whilst you tell me things I think and do and if I ever argue to the contrary you tell me Im lying. I was afraid to tell anyone, to seek out advice because you had so heavily involved yourself within my entire life, distancing me and building your own imagine within their eyes. I was afraid I was crazy; I was making things up and I was afraid no one would believe me. You had me questioning everything, making me think I was stuck within a psychosis. I have been hoarding our messages for a year in an attempt to provide myself with the reassurance that I am not what you say I am. Even now, a month after our breakup, you enlist the same tactics as before and I still feel as though there is a possibility you were right all along. I crave the reassurance those screenshots gave me, but every time I look over them I continue to place your narrative over them. I seek my sister out who you involved in our relationship for her support, because without her I would not have had concrete proof of your purposeful narrative, I would have continued to believe everything you did was unconscious or I was blowing things out of proportion, I would not have found the strength in myself to leave you. She sees you too. Mr. Goodie Tooshoes who only cares about being seen as selfless, you so deeply need the sympathy and admiration over everyone around you, it is why you twist my memory, why you lie to everyone we know, why you cut up our screenshots, why you accused me of abuse out of embarrassment at my mums' funeral after you called me a bitch in front of the guests, why you continue to tell everyone how much of a nice person you are, because in truth you know you arent. You excuse your behavior as a selfless, honest act, the mental gymnastics borders on remarkable. Even after you harass my sister for information on me for the past month, after you send our friends to message me to collect information for you, why you come to my home and tell me it is not just my sexuality people hate me for, but rather they hate me for me, and only you will every know me for who I am. You talk about a proposal and you insist you would never hurt me within the same sentence you break down my confidence. It is why, while I am gone, you visit my home to extract information from my Nana under the guise of a lunch visit. It is why you persistently message me with apologies, with accusations, with your undying love, with requests to know where I am and what Im doing, asking me to send you a message to let you know whenever I am leaving town, because you are just so concerned and need to know I am always safe. You say you have no control over the things you do, it is your parents fault, it is ignorance, it is your naivety that stems from your kind heart, it is a mysterious mental illness you claim, it is from desperation you say, desperation that comes from the overwhelming love you have for me. You tell me you cant and wont let me go, while you also apologize and tell me youll back off, and yet you have done no such thing. To the poison I let in. I see you, and I hate you for it."

I dread to think of the things you have been saying to those who can only hear your narrative, because you love their pity and the control that comes with it. You would collect my siblings upon their visits and whisk them away, whispering toxicity upon my name only stopping to stare in silence when I have arrived, waiting patiently to continue your complaints to my family that you would never dare share with me. No, instead you tell me it is everyone else who demands I change, the humour and mannerisms we share I must alter, you make backhanded comments in front of our friends and families until I fold into myself. The double standard is maddening, you feel free to do as you please, calling me boring once Ive changed to fit into you but demean me if I come out of my shell. I have put my foot down and now you continue in secrecy, calling and messaging every complaint and negative thought you have of me, reporting back only what my sister says. She thinks you are a bitch you tell me; she thinks you are annoying you say, you tell me how much she adores you.

You whine and keep questioning my reasoning for not wanting to go further, it feels like a battle of wills I am afraid to enter again. You schedule our sessions, if I am unable to continue or I do not perform how you like, you reschedule. I avoid and postpone, I attempt to rip it off like a band aid, but the wound wont heal, you pour salt in it. There is always a critique. I am trying but not hard enough, I need to look like I am enjoying it, you need to go further. I now deny you sex, I explained how it feels like spiders crawl beneath my skin, I cannot stand your touch and you do leave me be, for a while. But as always, we are back again because you never really learn. You never mean your apologies.

I was afraid to tell anyone, to seek out advice because you had so heavily involved yourself within my entire life, distancing me and building your own imagine within their eyes. I was afraid I was crazy; I was making things up and I was afraid no one would believe me. Your power was slipping, your constant attack on my sexuality was not enough. You turn to my mental illnesses, my bipolar, my social fears and my ADD. You turn to my weight. You present all as jokes, they are cruel and humiliating within the presence of others. In public you claim your persistent name calling of thick is referring to my intelligence, in private it is my body, I call you out and you tell me it is the largest part of me. When I complain it upsets me you tell me I should take it as a compliment. You do not stop. I am withdrawn now, hate being around people when you are there.

Of course, following it up with telling me how you are the only one who cares about me, you could never have me forget how hated I was. You blame this action again on your selfless honesty, you say it is because your whole friend group tells each other everything people say. I wonder if they know everything youve said to me about them, or does that rule only apply when I am the topic? It made me laugh, you call us all friends, but I was and still am completely disconnected from these people so quickly upon our relationship thanks to you.

And you really convinced me for awhile that it was true, that there was something wrong with me. That I was a fraud. You made me question who I was at my core. But did it ever occur to you that my inability to open up to *you* wasnt all on me? It wasnt that *I* couldnt open up to you, it was that I couldnt open up to *you*. I have people who know who I am at my core. They know me better than anyone else, they know Im not the passionless stone you think I am. Why is it that I feel so free to open up to them? I know I frustrated you by being so closed off. But instead of trying to really *see* me, you tried to pressure me, bully me into vulnerability. The things that make me who I am at my core are things I rarely talk aboutand when I do, *I* want to be in control of exposing myself, and I like to wait until the right moment. That moment never came with you. You deserve to be with someone who trusts you with their vulnerability. I loved you, I love you, I miss you, but I couldnt trust you. And you saw that as a personality flaw, you saw it as emotionally stunted and cold and bland. Its not worth it to prove you wrong."

You stand in front of me. I could reach out with the palm of my hand to touch your face, but I force my hands to stay in my jacket pockets. We share a short conversation, something about work and whats happening in our lives now. I try to listen and its been so long since Ive been this close to you and its hard to not lose focus because all I think about is how gorgeously handsome youve become and always have been. Before you go, I tell you its good to see you and that its been nice seeing you these past couple of days. You come over to me and hug me. I embrace it and my body melts in your arms. But it ends too soon. You pull away, and we take a step back. We look at each other like we know what were thinking. You tell me its been nice seeing me too but that it also has been hard for you. I tell you how thats the hardest part for me is knowing you were once my best friend. For whatever reason, your voice becomes more audible when you tell me, I loved you. Water forms in my eyes, and I think to myself then why did you let me go. Instead I say, I am sorry. And I dont know what happens from here. All I know is I was scared then and Id be lying if I said I still wasnt. The idea of needing someone terrifies me because for whatever reason it feels like giving up a part of myself like my independence but maybe its the vulnerability that I am scared to give up. There are so many crazy different elements of me that even I have a hard time figuring myself out. However when it came down to you, I always knew that it was you who I wanted to be with. I overthink, and I am indecisive but with you it never felt like a choice. I guess thats why I always knew it was love because its true you dont choose who you fall in love with. Remember, we werent looking for love? Instead we fantasied about being gypsies in the night and traveling solo in the world. Somehow during those months together, we bonded so much that I have never gotten over you. Even though, I pushed you away, I left you and I was looking for an out to leave my old life. I saw you as the one to blame because my demons still haunted me at night and we were friends that I thought maybe youd be the one to tell me the truth. Ive come to the conclusion that Ill never know what really happened those years ago and I need to live with it, and I do live it with it everyday. But what I miss the most is you. None of that mattered and nothing matter now. My life has never been same since leaving you. I dont know what I can do to show you how much I want you in my life. I cant help but wonder, did you feel the same or do you feel the same?"

Or at least, you think you do. And you probably feel very worried about me, and what I might do to you. Well, the answer is nothing. I can't do anything to you. More importantly, I don't *want* to do anything to you. Your reaction was a reasonable one, and if the tables were turned, I'd probably do the same thing. If the tables were turned, I'd be worried out of my mind and second-guessing everyone I met. So if you ever meet me- the real me- know that I care about you, and I don't want you to feel afraid."

I have depression. It wasnt until grad school, when I was at my lowest points, that I realized I needed help. I realized I had actually been fighting with it all my life but just didnt know it. I went to therapy and successfully processed trauma from my past. I thought that was it, a weight lifted off my shoulders, and Im cured. I didnt know depression doesnt go away. Treatment is amazing, but its a chronic condition that will come creeping back. Like slow weight gain in the absence of exercise and diet. When I left you, I truly didnt know why. Even when you asked, I gave a confusing response. I remember for a week I would just cry and cry. I felt horrible. I thought I made a huge mistake but yelled at myself theres no going back now, this what I did! I called myself a piece of shit for doing that to you. I told myself there was no other option because something felt off... That was the depression creeping back, it takes so many forms. It wasnt clear to me at the time, but why I left is because I was really trying to find myself. I needed to take that first step inward before I could be of any use to you outward. I didnt know that when I ran away from you, I was running towards myself. That when I left, and for months dove into bad habits and thoughts, I was really calling out to myself. To love you on that next level that you craved, I had to love myself. Be gentle with myself. I didnt think I was capable of that, or capable of producing it. I started meditating, journaling, and expressing myself. It wasnt easy at first, talking about feelings and sharing my thoughts. I have a great group of friends that held my hand through a lot. People who care about someone are willing to listen, more so than I ever imagined. Journaling helped me see my thoughts clearly when laid out in front of me, and I corrected some flaws like being too self-critical. Meditating helped quite the voices in my head that said I dont deserve anything. Im still on my journey to becoming a better person, but now moving forward I have myself as a partner to rely on. Hes no longer an detriment but a resource. So I guess after all that, thats why I reached back out to you. I found why I left, I made the discoveries and changes. I asked to come back, and you said no. You had just finally moved on. That was hard for me to hear but not unexpected. I guess my only regret is that I wish I could have known all this sooner. Ill still be there for you, and always always be thankful for you. I wouldnt be on this journey if we didnt take a chance on each other. Always yours,"
50,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Peace in Your Violence,1,i0iq77,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/i0iq77/peace_in_your_violence/,2020-07-30 18:58:58,"Ill run barefoot through the nothingness and bring laughter to the mundane. Its a better place. These words are my last within the journal I finally completed. I wont bore you with the details of why filling this journal is so significant to me. Really, what matters is that for the longest time I lost a significant part of myself - the part of myself that could properly reflect on my life and create beauty from it. Its the part of me that my true friends and family most cherish, support entirely. The reason I lost this ability isnt worth many words. What is worth some, is that you made your way into those pages. Through the process of speaking, writing, thinking, and dreaming of you, I found a new realm of possibilities. Ones where I was worthy of love, something surprisingly difficult for me to accept. Just writing that simple thing, worthy of love, brings me to tears. Its silly for the concept to be so difficult for me for so many reasons. Still, I wanted vulnerability to be a them for this chapter, and maybe reading about my own struggles with such a concept will help someone else. Were all worthy of love. I write again, you are worthy of love. Why dont we love one another better than we do? Why do we hate and belittle, compare and spew jealousy? Why do we accept this angry world? Have we strayed too far on the pendulum? Sometimes, when I read the news, I think so. Sometimes, when I hear others speak, I think so. Sometimes, when my tears fall, I think so. Ive been tired, and hurt, and kicked down so many times that I think I ask may I have another? without thinking about it now. Still, I get up. I prepare myself for the next beating. Where did my voice go? Why have I accepted such harm? Empathy, I think I told myself long ago. I have empathy, and therefore to be a good person I must accept the pain others cant. Its ok, I can handle it people hear. They accept too quickly, and Im punched before the timer starts. I felt called to pray for you one day recently, with a similar prayer that I had asked and you may have managed to help with. I dont know if you felt it. Maybe it doesnt matter. Who knows? I listened to Silence by Marshmello throughout this prayer, and had an epiphany. I had empathy all wrong. An empath isnt a sponge. An empath is a filter. You dont take that pain as your own and accept the journey. You take that pain and push it back out into the universe (lovingly) because the person is too weak or frightened to do it alone. Its so simple. How didnt I recognize it before? How many of my prayers were lost in translation? Why did I feel so comfortable in not only my own pain, but the pain of others? Why didnt I just give it all up to the universe and dance? Why did I feel the need to sit with that silent sorrow? I wonder about these things, and have a new journal to help me contemplate. I wonder what my words will look like without that tinge of sorrow. Could I still write? I am now. I found peace in your violence. Cant tell me theres no point in trying. Im at one, and Ive been quiet for too long"

I was trying to figure out who I was and how to move forward from the past. I looked to you as a friend for support and you took me in. You nurtured me then molded me into what you wanted. You werent looking for a friend or even a girlfriend. You wanted a wife. I trusted you and looked up to you and you used that position to your advantage. You rewarded behaviours you liked and brushed off ones you didnt persuading me to believe I wasnt being myself. You convinced me that it was my choice to abandon my independence when really I just couldnt bear the guilt you put on me for trying to be my own person. I told you hundreds of times that I wanted to be single. You didnt listen. I showed you my flaws hoping they would steer you away. They didnt. Instead they became something for you to throw in my face. Something that in your opinion proved that you loved me. You fed off my vulnerability and controlled me with guilt. You wanted to be a hero. My friends and family were worried for me. They thought I was acting out of character and I was. So no I didnt break your heart. You broke your own damn heart. Im a human being. Not an object that you can customize to your liking.

God knows how much I did my best to stay strong and not completely lose it. But now that I have an offer, I've become open with how I pretty much felt down by losing a job previously. But I just wish you stop treating how vulnerable I was as something ridiculous. You invalidate depression so much, it's as if it was *that* easy to just shoo away. Also, even when I was already accepted at a job, you still had negative things to say about me. You said I was lazy, you said I took so long, you said I didn't know how to manage my time. *Why don't you just let me have my moment?* Also, it's so funny how you can easily say that I'm lazy and that I wasn't doing anything, when you don't even know how our industry works. I *need* to take the time to build a strong portfolio. You just don't get it. You always assume the worst in me. Thanks for ruining the joy of getting a new job. Now instead of feeling excited about it, I actually feel anxious that I might be incompetent since you know, I can't manage my time well and I'm lazy and everything in between of the things you said. :)"

You, especially. Things you wouldn't even remember yourself. I thought of a moment, when we worked together: You were browsing missed connections with kelly...and found one written about her. What are the chances of that? We all shared a laugh and a smile over it. You made a comment though. You wished someone would write a missed connection about you. Well, here ya go. All these years later. You might find it, you might not. I hope you do, and I hope it sparks something internally. You know I use reddit... you don't know my handle, or the communities I'm involved with... but I think your heart will bring you here some day. You were my first love. It was a tumultuous time for us, and we were not yet grown enough as independent people to jump those hurdles together. I'll always lament that. I believe we were the right people, just met at the wrong time. But it's been a while, and now were adults... I've changed. You've changed. But I still miss you. I still remember how you smelled like the faint scent of a corn chip. Your broad chest and shoulders, your strong arms and *those hands*... of all the body parts to get turned on by, your hands...so sexy. That does not discredit all of the other beautiful parts of you though. Your eyes were absolutely stunning, those little red flecks in a sea of pale green. They pierced my soul with just a glance. Left me breathless. When I dream about you, I see your eyes the clearest. And weirdly, I still dream of you so often. Those stoic lips that kissed with such strength, and gentleness. That little scar where you bit through the top as a kid. Your pout is so unique and I miss putting mine on it. God I fucking miss you. So here it is, a missed connection (sort of)...an unsent letter tossed to the void in the hope's it will find it's way to you. I'm casting a line of vulnerability, I stuck some love on the hook, Hope you take the bait. -C"

Considering youve said this to me multiple times in the past. You used these words to hurt me after Id send walls of text. But you were never good at really communicating anyway. So I guess I really asked for it. I know its been 9 years, and Im married now. But there are somethings on my chest that I never got to say. Somethings, that, as I grew and matured I came to notice. And yes, this will be a wall of text. Will you read it? Hell. You may never find it. And Im okay will that. I just need to be done with it. To preface, i want to tell you some backstory that I never told you. I never told anyone. I only just recently confessed it to my husband, bc its embarrassing. As a teenager, I harbored an immense fear of being alone, and the drowning type of depression. More so, than I thought. After what weve been through... I feel like you know this.. but do you know why? Right up until high school I was bullied. And not the casual bullying. It did kind of fade into that, where it was mainly about my looks. But I was beat up. Multiple times. I was once cornered in the girls bathroom and was beat in the head until I pissed myself and was left alone to wallow in it. I still think Im trash. But Im working on it. This made me have a real complex about relationships in general. I became friends with people who emotionally abused and ridiculed me for 10 years! I am no longer friends with said people. And its one of the best things Ive ever done for myself. But I stuck around so long bc I believed every degrading thing and I never wanted to be alone. So.. imagine when I got a boys attention. Hell I didnt think anyone would ever like me. Why would they. When I was 13, yes I was 13, when I met (lets call him Joe). My cousins 18 year old best friend. You know this. It wasnt until I was 14 that he pursued a relationship with me. I know now that I was groomed. 4 years doesnt seem that bad when youre two consenting adults. But 14-18 is a big gap in maturity. And he definitely took advantage of this. My dire need to be wanted and my kindness was RAN THROUGH. He abused that power whenever he could. He knew exactly what to say and when to say it. And if I loved him I would show him in certain ways. All under the pretenses that no one must ever know about our relationship. Not to tell a single soul. I didnt understand why then.. but its bc HES A FUCKIN ADULT AT THIS POINT. He would cheat on me constantly and use this as an excuse but would keep me around to torment me to his delight. It was exhausting. But I wouldve done anything for him even though I knew something was up. Ehh.. He broke up with me for being a drag. My sophmore year, I met you. I liked you instantly. I remember the first thing you said to me. You probably dont. You were funny and nerdy, and most of all you seemed safe. You felt like such a breath of fresh air. We talked too much during class, though. So much so that our teacher would move me across the room. Right next to two boys that would sexually harass me that semester. For example they would put their dicks on my desk and touch me unwarranted. I never spoke out bc cool girls dont do shit like that? Would I be slut shamed or deemed a tattle tail? I was so uncomfortable. This caused me to put you on the back burner for a while until I got drunk, and confessed my feelings for you. I said I didnt remember but I remembered. I just didnt want you to let me down. From then on things were like a dream. Sadly, thats all it was. You became distant and I started to uncover little lies that you told. You didnt like that. You grabbed my arm so tight and hurt me. I refused to let things go any further. The boy I thought was safe... wasnt safe at all. Over the weekend I planned to break up with you. Come Monday I would let you go. What I didnt expect was to see Joe. Broken sad little Joe. Barf. Silver tongued he fucking snatched me in his web. He knew EXACTLY how to play me. He saw my vulnerability and quickly acted upon it. We kissed before I ended it with you. And this I am deeply sorry about. Not to make excuses but I shouldve been stronger. I wasnt. He made it seem like he would wither away if I wasnt there for him. That he needed me. I know now for sure that, that was all a hoax. He didnt need me more than you. He just wanted to use me again. You logged into my Facebook and read the messages between us that night. Most of it me, entertaining his ego. This hurt you. I still broke up with you. I was still set on letting you go, even though I still loved you. You labeled me a cheater and have ever since. It was such a sloppy teen breakup. Joe and I didnt last long this time, though. He was his same grossly manipulative self and somebody finally ratted us out. It was probably you. But trust me, Im more than okay with it. In fact I THANK YOU. I would finally drop him entirely a few years later when I watched him do a line of coke in front of me and it absolutely disgusted me. That moment was the last wake up call. (I had still tried to remain friends with him.) Anyway! We were a bit rocky after that though. You struggled with wanting me back and despising me. Me being fucked up and wanting to not lose you entirely and still be close to you without actually being close to you, I cat-fished you as a male friend. This worked out in my favor for a bit and we ended up back together. Until you took my virginity. (Im glad it was you btw) but thats all you seemed to have wanted and dumped me shortly after. You also still couldnt unsee me as a cheater. Although you were exchanging nudes and talking to girls over the internet like it wasnt a problem. I made you hate me so we wouldnt ever think about talking again, and we havent talked since. (But since I was fucked up I still tried to) Later that year I moved on completely, and met someone who thought the world of me. And I thought the world of him. We had a very brief relationship but Im so thankful for it. He was the friend I needed at that time, and talked a lot of sense into me. I only mention this because this is around the time I found out that you wanted to be the last thing I saw before deaths embrace. Essentially, you would have happily liked to see me die. How do I know you said this? Dont interact with our mutuals on your personal tumblr account. For someone so intelligent, you slip up sometimes. I dont think moving on warranted death. I dont think a kiss with someone else before breaking up with you warranted DEATH. Was it stupid? Yes. But not grounds to die. You might take pleasure in this, but this fucked me up. I feared you for a long time. I was scared to see you in public. I was scared to close my eyes at night. I had nightmares for years. I never wanted to see you again. But I did. At the restaurant where you worked. I had no idea you worked there and I fucking could have turned white and dropped there. But I held my composure. How does one react to the person who wants them dead? However, its been 9 years. Im not upset anymore. Still rather confused. Its to my knowledge that you still hate me to this day. I guess, I deserve your indifference. You dated one of my best friends and she was your dream girl. But even she isnt perfect. You have always wanted to be a main character in an indie movie. J, life isnt like that at all. My husband is the friend Ive waited for my entire life. He is patient and kind and knows EVERYTHING about me. Yet is still so loving, and willing to grow old with me. Flaws and all. Weve seen the darkest parts of each other but are the lights of each others lives. Im happy. J, after everything, I hope you find that kind of happiness. That kind of patient love. Stop trying to find the manic pixie dream girl. A real woman will be tender with your fragility, a love you through it. TL;DR? Even though you hate me, I still hope you find your happiness. Love and light, N"

I will still be the same ""perfect"" partner you left in shattered pieces. You abandoned me. You abandoned your pets. You abandoned your support system. You abandoned yourself. All because you selfishly wanted to chase a destructive and traumatic fantasy you felt would resemble the ""romantic love"" you saw in movies. By now I'm sure you realize the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Your reality can turn on a dime, but I will always know the truth. I saw how much you loved me, each and every day. We had grown well beyond the infatuation phase of the relationship. Our love had evolved into a far deeper bond consisting of absolute trust, vulnerability, and support. As your ""new relationship energy"" fades with your future partner(s), just remember how easily you threw away what you described as the ""best thing you've ever had in your life"". Remember how quickly you painted me black, just because it was too hard to face the guilt of leaving me. I will still be here, taking care of myself and the family you discarded. So as you are considering reaching out again, please remember the actual reality I lived through. If you believe you're finally ready to own up to your mistakes, please pause. We both know you don't even remember half of what you've done. Instead, take a moment to look in the mirror and ask yourself if you're truly willing to hurt me again."

One time, I stole $20 from your coin jar collection, 1/2 pennies, that I used to pay my half of the rent. At the time, I felt justified, because one time I just left some money on the table, in our home that we shared together, and I asked where it went. You said: ""if you don't want people to take your money, you shouldn't leave it lying around"". I took that as a sign that you took it. *It's just change*, I thought. *He won't notice. You can do it, then I can too*, I justified. At the time, it seemed like a better idea than telling you I was short. You did notice. You thought someone broke into our home and stole it. 2.) When we were not together but were friends with benefits and loyalty expectations, I was not loyal. Here's why: A.) No matter how long I was faithful to you; no matter how many times I apologized; no matter how hard I tried to please you, not upset you, be a good girl, do anything I could to keep you in my circle...I knew it would never be enough. You were never going to forgive me for the first time; it was past the point of no return. There was no way that you were ever going to see me as anything but a whore. So I might as well be. Funny how that works out? B.) The emotional distance you placed between us. The intimacy faded to dust. We were both terrified to open up and let each other in. I desperately craved it, but didn't communicate that craving. I knew you'd just reject it. I didn't want to bother you. Didn't want to cause a fuss or fight. I just wanted to please you. Show you how sorry I was. Holding out hope that someday, somehow, I could be forgiven for my transgressions. Not that you've ever been particularly emotionally expressive, but it's never been the same after that night. I couldn't take it. Our relationship felt transactional. Always giving; seldom receiving. If it did not directly benefit you, you weren't interested. Texting first more often than not. Chasing you. Trying to think of things to say that would keep you interested; things to do together that you might like. Giving you your space when you needed it. Trying not to appear too clingy, but also not too distant. Trying so hard to be that cool girl, that would impress you, never doing anything just for me, for my pleasure or joy. The US was dissolved. It was all about YOU. You said you loved me, but you also hated me. Kept me at arms' length as punishment. You hated me but were terrified of losing me entirely. The unspoken pain and resentment permeated every conversation; every interaction. C.) It's not cheating. You can't cheat on someone that isn't your boyfriend. D.) I have a pretty good hunch you weren't upholding your end of the bargain, either; for sure at least once, and more than that if you could. I fucked that guy that you asked me one time if I fucked, and I told you that I didn't. I regret that decision; I don't even know why I did it. I wasn't even attracted to him, and I wasn't in my right mind. We were smoking weed, drinking Jger and popping pills. One thing led to another..... We discussed our relationship problems, pain, and depression. He was going through a tough divorce and was still involved with his ex-wife. He made me feel better; validated my feelings and anger. I felt truly listened to; cared for; appreciated for my vulnerability. I felt so much guilt over it that I ended things. I tried to be just friends with him after that, but he said he couldn't take it. There was also this one guy that I didn't fuck, but did give head to. I've never told anyone about this because I'm so ashamed and disgusted with myself, but I met him on one of those sugar daddy websites. I was feeling so low and depressed, and I thought that my job was on the line because I fucked up really bad, and I figured, hey, sex work is work, so might as well be a hooker, then maybe I could make enough money to pay my way through school and spend less time working, more time on school. He didn't give me any money, but he took me out for sushi and he was attractive. No, he wasn't an old pervert. He was in his early thirties. I liked him; he was a gentleman. I would've met with him even if I had to pay for my own meal, I think. Him and I shared similar kinks, he took me back to his place for one night of fun, then I never spoke to him again. Once I realized I had job security, I deleted my account and never looked back. And then there was the guy you know about. I started things with him prior to ending things with you. That's why I was pulling away. It felt good for once to be chased by you. Remember the last time you spent the night? That morning you left for work, I didn't return those three words. You probably knew this, even though it went unsaid. Shit, you may already know all or part of this. Maybe She told you. So, I guess we're even. Goodbye Forever. \-L"

Aaaaand, okay, maybe (read:definitely) some anger mixed in. I was riiight there at the cusp of moving from cyber stalking once a week to once every other. And, if things progressed like the other times, its a quick road from there to once every month. But no, someone had to send a signal flare giving the green light to let the flood gates happen again. Its a pattern almost like clockwork, isnt it? How many weeks do we go between? (Which is the reason for the joke of the upcoming trip Im taking, btw.) So... was that it? You initiate expecting what, exactly? Surely expecting this, otherwise you wouldnt have made an effort to reach out, much less follow throughwith enthusiasm, might I add. If I had known you were planning on what I assume is cutting ties, then yeah, maybe you could have gotten a bit more vulnerability out of me. Instead, when you asked me what I wanted to know, I answered truthfully: How are you? Boring, maybe, but I honestly wanted to see how life is treating you, how the complete upside down world were in right now has affected you. I dont know what I would have said or asked. Ditto? I wear my heart on my sleeve, but trust is a long and winding road over here, and I comes with a wider range of emotions than any normal person. In that current range of emotions, though, are three in majority: 1. Exasperation. Like, dude, come on. I feel a little like I was used for some type of closure, which my left brain tells me, He literally told you tonight is it. So I suppose the annoyance is at myself as well, just making the assumption that we both knew that wasnt true. 2. Challenged. I want to win. At one point in time, I made almost a sport of getting men to want me, to develop an infatuation. All this is dusting off that competitive side of me. I have confidence that if those miles werent between us, if we saw each other on a casual basis, we would have already fucked each others brains out. Its a dusty, dark corner in the back of my mind full of bad thoughts where thoughts like even now, if I wanted to, I could have you. That if you think your attention has been piqued, really theres no comparison to what I could potentially do to make you want me even more. So, so much more. 3. Relief. At least, to an extent. A bit of comfort that at least one of us is responsible. But trust: the first two are very much in control here. I would say guilt belongs in here as well. So is that all vulnerable enough for you? And you know what? Why not make bad decisions? Why not let irresponsibility take the wheel and become uninhibited, drinking up every part of each others selves? Say fuck it, and fuck each others brains out (and going back to number 2 above, Id definitely enthusiastically fuck your brains out). Who would know? Just the one time, letting lust rule over everything else, and maybe saying goodbyeat least until the next year, lol. So, there you go, theres the current situation. Theres been two other letters Ive started to write, one explaining exactly what I lust for and how I wanted it, while the other explaining the reasons why its good to leave each other be. I might still post them, just for the satisfaction. Right now though? Acknowledgement would be nice. Its only been a couple days, but just getting radio silence after all of the build up has me frustrated and annoyed, and most of all, confused. Ive rambled, Ill regret this Im sure, but at least Ive gotten it out. I dont even know if you will read this, to be honest. Its too hard for me to sift through all the letters, to be honest, maybe its the same for you. I highly doubt that, but Ill tell myself that until I can come up with a better excuse for my ego. fourth"

I was sobering up after three months of being high almost every day and I had a vengeance for something, but I never knew what. All I wanted was to have fun for the last two weeks I was in town, but you made me fall in love with you and it changed my life. Today I realized that you reminded me of who I am and you showed me that it was okay to be that. I never really got over you, but I suppressed it enough to be good to someone else. When I left town, I knew things were over between us. You acted cold when I left and didnt respond when I asked if I could see you one last time, so I told myself that it was your way of showing me how you felt, and I did my best to move on. And when my paths crossed with you, L., I wasnt doing much better. I was still hungry for something more but I was sober and reeling after things with G. started resembling muddy water as far as clarity goes. Things were long over with him when we started, but you know that. It was just weird how it happened so close together. He was gone and there you were. It was strange. I was in haze and I didnt know what to do when I had you right in front of me. But L., I cant tell you enough about what you did for me. I never knew love like yours and I always wanted so badly to be good for you. I think that for awhile, maybe I was. Things ended for us around the end of February. You were gone for work and didnt know when you were coming back, and I blew up over nothing and made you question our relationship, which you were right to. I knew deep down that the problems we had with ourselves would never be something we could help each other fix. I was always bad at blowing up and you were someone whod hold it in like nobodys business. You cant communicate like that. It doesnt work. So Id lost you both at that point and only recently did I start hearing from each of you again. Ive been on my own for awhile and its helped enough to where I feel comfortable, but the summer drives me into a place of wanting that I cannot contain within myself. Last night I stayed up until dawn trying to figure out what to do about you two. G., you are everywhere. In the songs I listen to, my hometown, and in the quarter I picked up on the street, the one that displays your home state that I still keep in the cup holder of my car. The quarter isnt yours and likely never was, but it is the only tangible thing I have to remind me of you. Today I cried as I turned it over in my hands, thinking about the conversations we had last night about you and your life and what happened to your dad and what happened with us. That was clarity. You are not the same person you were when I met you. Youve changed. And it brings me both closure to that chapter and ignites a new kind of wanting within me as I long to lie down with you somewhere and learn every part of you again. I dont think I could ever let myself let it happen. I dont know how I could go back to my life if I had more time with you, especially with you as you are right now and with me like this. We are feeding off of each others vulnerability and it is addictive. We cant go back. But god I want to. And L., you have always been everything to me. On the day I lost you I thought I was going to die. You have loved me like no other person ever has and from that I have learned what real, lasting beautiful love is. I could live off of this for a lifetime. You are the most wonderful man I have ever met in my life. There will never be anyone like you ever again. And for you to want me right now after everything, it breaks my heart because I see the future so clearly and I dont understand why Im not running towards it. The problem is that I love you both. Im in love with one of you, but the love I have for the other is an infinite, deep, soulful kind of love. It is the stuff that lifetimes are made of. But then again, Im left to wonder, is that really true if I can still have feelings for the other? Im an adult, I havent been committed to either of you for a very long time. I can feel how I want and at the end of the day, Im not breaking anything. So why does it feel like I am? Why do I feel like I have to choose? One of you is my future and I just cant figure out who. One of you is trying to stray me from my path, but its not malicious. Its just heartbreaking because you think Im it, but for one of you, Im not. I dont know what to do. I never have. Ill always love you both. Thank you for everything you have done for me in my life. Both of you. If I only ever get two great loves, Ill know who they were and I will always be grateful for the things you showed me. Even if I end up without either you, even if I decide to close the door on both of you, the time I had with each of you was worth it."

You never know how many times you could have picked up the phone, dialed the number, have it ring twice, and heard that voice on the other end. The one you were dying to hear. No, not when you don't need anyone. You never know. You'll never know that last tonight I sat in my black chair sobbing. Wrapped in the maroon blanket my grandmother knitted for me. Legs curled up with my arms wrapped around them. You'll never know that with one hand I dialed your number, and with the other, I wiped my tears. No, you'll never know that. You'll never know that I had a moment of vulnerability where all my walls came tumbling down, and the one person I wanted to run to was you. Even though you're the reason I'm vulnerable. You'll never know how easy it would have been for me last night, had we spoken, to tell you all the things my heart begs me to say. How impossible it would have been for me to run away this time. How ready I was to give you reasons. You'll never know how lost I think we've become. How badly I wanted to give all the answers you couldn't give. How much I wanted to hear you ask me to stay. I called you three thousand times last night. But you'll never know it. And instead, while I walk down the empty street by my house, wrapped tightly in my sweater, kicking the leaves my tears fall on; I'll find a way to fix this on my own. And you'll never even know it. It's a funny thing, not needing anyone despite how much you really do need them. I really could have used you last night."

No one else can even come close. Just you. I wholeheartedly believe we were meant to know each other, I do. But I also believe were meant to be with each other. I dont want to throw that at you, though. I dont want to make things harder for you or more confusing than they already are. Lets face it, I also just dont want to tell you that and open myself up to that kind of vulnerability. You think our relationship was meant to be a lesson and that its not meant to continue. I disagree. Of course you can find lessons in everything life throws at you, and thats a smart way to look at things. But I think were more than that. I think theres a reason we both still care about each other so much. I think we were meant to be more than young love, and firsts, and fond memories, and devastating heartbreak. I think if finding each other back then was really just a lesson, the lesson was to fix ourselves and try again later when the timing was right. Its almost later. I hope youre still around by the time it comes. All My Love."

I was 26 and you were the first; its looking like youll be the last. No one else came close. I know it wasnt the other way around. I know you meant more to me than I meant to you. I know I needed you more than you needed me. I know I loved you and you didnt love me back, not quite, not the way that I loved you. I dont know why. I dont know if it was me or you or both. What I do know is that despite having spent so long trying to avoid the vulnerability of noting this to anyone, even myself, its just the truth. I will try to stop projecting your rejection of me onto my current life. But to be honest, I dont blame myself. Your rejection of me was the most profound loss I have ever sustained. When I met you, it took about two days for me to realize you would change my life forever. Youre not the best-looking or the smartest or, by any means, the best man Ive been with  youre frankly mediocre in a lot of ways. I can do better and I have. Youre not that great, but being great wasnt it. Something about you just fit. Something about you felt like it was made just for me, like you were my mirror. You just got me, and loving you became my heroin. I have never felt quite as alive nor quite as dead as when we knew each other. I realized actually pretty damn early that you were bad for me, that we were bad for each other, that you might directly or indirectly kill me, but I didnt care. I would have watched my own life, my sense of self, everything I had burn down without moving a muscle to have even a chance at a life with you. In fact, I did just that. The abuse escalated to the point that I left a wedding covered in bruises, where you choked me and actually did threaten to kill me, and I still couldnt bring myself to go. I would leave if I could do it again, much earlier, before you hit me, before you got close enough to hurt me. But it felt like the right thing at the time. I loved you that much. The pain I felt when I lost you is some of the most intense and excruciating I have ever experienced. It took my breath away. I could barely eat for months and alternated between sleeping more often than I didnt and staying up all night into the next day. I am not a big girl to begin with and I lost fifteen pounds in a month without trying, started losing my hair in clumps  whether it was from the stress, the weight loss, or some combination, I guess I dont know. You mocked me for how much I got stoned when you left. I only did it because it hurt enough without something to numb it that I would start throwing up anything I ate, would start crying during meetings, was knocked over with this tidal wave of grief that rendered it impossible to keep going. Again, I loved you that much. It wasnt just the end, though. The rejection was constant and chipped away at what little self-worth I had until I needed you to breathe. You fucking hated me, and God, did I notice. I noticed every time you showed up late or didnt show up at all. Every time you yelled at and made fun of me. Every time you devalued my taste in music, my clothes, my family, my friends. You hated me so much, so much of the time, and I would have done anything to feel the moments when you didnt. I dont think anyone has ever hated me as much as you did when I was your partner. I hope they never will again. Im with someone whom Im probably going to marry. We just talked about it last night. I love him, but it doesnt ache. Its not loud, screaming agony. Its kind of light and peaceful, like a picnic on a sunny day. He is better than you in a lot of superficial ways. Most importantly, he is kind and good to me, which you absolutely werent. Hes consistent. He does love me like I love him. Occasionally, he hurts my feelings entirely by accident, I tell him, he apologizes profusely, and thats about as far as it goes. If things ever go south  if he cheats or hurts me even emotionally, he doesnt have to hit me  I will leave. I will be able to. And it wont hurt like it did. I will be fine. But maybe thats what it is to grow up and out of this bullshit. Maybe growing up is holding other people accountable. Maybe growing up is holding myself accountable to deal with life instead of using another person as a distraction to avoid myself. Ill never love someone the way that I loved you. But I dont think that I want to. I think you are something I only need to experience once."
64,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Alchemilla,9,h7bjih,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/h7bjih/alchemilla/,2020-06-12 11:45:02,"However much you might have once said it... Ive no sylvan grace or beauty. Rather instead Ive fur and tusks and ears like a bear that stand out from long braids. Or scales and wings and claws coated in earth. Moss and lichens end up caught in my hair and Im often caked in earth. Can broken hearted beasts ever find love? Id collect all the drops of dew in alchemilla if I thought it might heal the lovelorn. Year after year and season after season I pour this longing back into the world in some small way, hoping something might grow from it. It is that yearning to have someone to lean into and to feel they will do the same. To share those stories of lonely moments where someone else was so badly needed but instead one just had to pick themselves up again, and to try and shelter what was left of that sentient fire inside. Guarding that smoldering fennel stalk of a heart against an abyss. Until it might bring warmth again. Vulnerability, love, passion and intimacy are nothing to fear but embrace. And with that, I needed something that can root deeply. To reach beneath a lithosphere of attraction to a mantle of meaning and further to a core of sincere sentiment. The spirited mundane. If I wasnt so concerned about you Id have been more upfront. If I wasnt handling my own struggles I would have been more focused. Each time I wanted to reach out and open up I felt pushed away before I could even consider sharing something and its difficult not to take this as meaning youve lost interest. Maybe any connection has simply passed and theres only acceptance of that now. While its immensely hurtful, and I wish it was all a misunderstanding it doesnt surprise me as much as it would have if you had returned these affections. The last time I fell in love I nearly lost myself in grief, and thats not something I plan to repeat. Sadly, your troubles wouldnt have been a burden to me - I wish I was someone youd want to share them with. I wish I had at least shared more of my own rather than to slowly set the tone to hold back. I said everything was fine - as in I could handle the stress on my own and didnt want to concern you. But it wasnt fine in that I could feel the confines of my own limitations during those moments. I almost caved and sent I understand if you cant but it would certainly raise my spirits to hear from you. The general upheaval here is just weighing in more than usual. I hope youre okay there. Little did I know that those words would hold more truth in them now then they did a month ago. Still I hold fast to replying instead with as much grounded composure as I can muster. Trying to cloak the reality that I needed kindness and gentleness too. In a conversation we had several months ago, I mentioned the concern of social, environmental, and economic collapse - something I had tried to prepare for over a decade ago. While I find Im hardly prepared... I try to remain hopeful at the same time as I thought I might never see such a time of change. I wish I could talk to you - to have those in depth talks which are missed. Instead I find myself in an old struggle with chronic illness. At times, barely able to write or speak or move from waves of pain. Yet, still too stubborn to give up and each trial only furthering a determination to keep going. We can sometimes do these trials on our own.. but should we? In the past I also often imagined that if I ever fell in love again, that who ever that could be might also be struggling as well and I would take comfort in wishing them to find the strength to make it (and anyone trying to make it through another day). Finding my own resolve in a wish for a collective strength to be found especially among those that felt weary or worn down. If only to redistribute any luck found like a mycorrhizal network of compassion and support. Regardless of how you might feel about me, that wish that you have found or will find the support you need remains. Perhaps Im just howling into the wind again and know not what else to do but set these thoughts adrift."
65,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,"UC Berkeley History Professor's Open Letter Against BLM, Police Brutality and Cultural Orthodoxy",2,h89nr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/h89nr6/uc_berkeley_history_professors_open_letter/,2020-06-14 01:32:37," I realize that this letter is a bit long, but it is one of the most intelligent things I have read in a while. UC Berkeley History Professors Open Letter Against BLM, Police Brutality And Cultural Orthodoxy *The following letter was* *written by a UC Berkeley history professor and shared among his or her colleagues anonymously* Dear profs X, Y, Z I am one of your colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley. I have met you both personally but do not know you closely, and am contacting you anonymously, with apologies. I am worried that writing this email publicly might lead to me losing my job, and likely all future jobs in my field. In your recent departmental emails you mentioned our pledge to diversity, but I am increasingly alarmed by the absence of diversity of opinion on the topic of the recent protests and our community response to them. In the extended links and resources you provided, I could not find a single instance of substantial counter-argument or alternative narrative to explain the under-representation of black individuals in academia or their over-representation in the criminal justice system. The explanation provided in your documentation, to the near exclusion of all others, is univariate: the problems of the black community are caused by whites, or, when whites are not physically present, by the infiltration of white supremacy and white systemic racism into American brains, souls, and institutions. Many cogent objections to this thesis have been raised by sober voices, including from within the black community itself, such as Thomas Sowell and Wilfred Reilly. These people are not racists or Uncle Toms. They are intelligent scholars who reject a narrative that strips black people of agency and systematically externalizes the problems of the black community onto outsiders. Their view is entirely absent from the departmental and UCB-wide communiques. The claim that the difficulties that the black community faces are entirely causally explained by exogenous factors in the form of white systemic racism, white supremacy, and other forms of white discrimination remains a problematic hypothesis that should be vigorously challenged by historians. Instead, it is being treated as an axiomatic and actionable truth without serious consideration of its profound flaws, or its worrying implication of total black impotence. This hypothesis is transforming our institution and our culture, without any space for dissent outside of a tightly policed, narrow discourse. A counternarrative exists. If you have time, please consider examining some of the documents I attach at the end of this email. Overwhelmingly, the reasoning provided by BLM and allies is either primarily anecdotal (as in the case with the bulk of Ta-Nehisi Coates undeniably moving article) or it is transparently motivated. As an example of the latter problem, consider the proportion of black incarcerated Americans. This proportion is often used to characterize the criminal justice system as anti-black. However, if we use the precise same methodology, we would have to conclude that the criminal justice system is even more anti-male than it is anti-black. Would we characterize criminal justice as a systemically misandrist conspiracy against innocent American men? I hope you see that this type of reasoning is flawed, and requires a significant suspension of our rational faculties. Black people are not incarcerated at higher rates than their involvement in violent crime would predict. This fact has been demonstrated multiple times across multiple jurisdictions in multiple countries. And yet, I see my department uncritically reproducing a narrative that diminishes black agency in favor of a white-centric explanation that appeals to the departments apparent desire to shoulder the white mans burden and to promote a narrative of white guilt. If we claim that the criminal justice system is white-supremacist, why is it that Asian Americans, Indian Americans, and Nigerian Americans are incarcerated at vastly lower rates than white Americans? This is a funny sort of white supremacy. Even Jewish Americans are incarcerated less than gentile whites. I think its fair to say that your average white supremacist disapproves of Jews. And yet, these alleged white supremacists incarcerate gentiles at vastly higher rates than Jews. None of this is addressed in your literature. None of this is explained, beyond hand-waving and ad hominems. Those are racist dogwhistles. The model minority myth is white supremacist. Only fascists talk about black-on-black crime, ad nauseam. These types of statements do not amount to counterarguments: they are simply arbitrary offensive classifications, intended to silence and oppress discourse. Any serious historian will recognize these for the silencing orthodoxy tactics they are, common to suppressive regimes, doctrines, and religions throughout time and space. They are intended to crush real diversity and permanently exile the culture of robust criticism from our department. Increasingly, we are being called upon to comply and subscribe to BLMs problematic view of history, and the department is being presented as unified on the matter. In particular, ethnic minorities are being aggressively marshaled into a single position. Any apparent unity is surely a function of the fact that dissent could almost certainly lead to expulsion or cancellation for those of us in a precarious position, which is no small number. I personally dont dare speak out against the BLM narrative, and with this barrage of alleged unity being mass-produced by the administration, tenured professoriat, the UC administration, corporate America, and the media, the punishment for dissent is a clear danger at a time of widespread economic vulnerability. I am certain that if my name were attached to this email, I would lose my job and all future jobs, even though I believe in and can justify every word I type. The vast majority of violence visited on the black community is committed by black people. There are virtually no marches for these invisible victims, no public silences, no heartfelt letters from the UC regents, deans, and departmental heads. The message is clear: Black lives only matter when whites take them. Black violence is expected and insoluble, while white violence requires explanation and demands solution. Please look into your hearts and see how monstrously bigoted this formulation truly is. No discussion is permitted for nonblack victims of black violence, who proportionally outnumber black victims of nonblack violence. This is especially bitter in the Bay Area, where Asian victimization by black assailants has reached epidemic proportions, to the point that the SF police chief has advised Asians to stop hanging good-luck charms on their doors, as this attracts the attention of (overwhelmingly black) home invaders. Home invaders like George Floyd. For this actual, lived, physically experienced reality of violence in the USA, there are no marches, no tearful emails from departmental heads, no support from McDonalds and Wal-Mart. For the History department, our silence is not a mere abrogation of our duty to shed light on the truth: it is a rejection of it. The claim that black intraracial violence is the product of redlining, slavery, and other injustices is a largely historical claim. It is for historians, therefore, to explain why Japanese internment or the massacre of European Jewry hasnt led to equivalent rates of dysfunction and low SES performance among Japanese and Jewish Americans respectively. Arab Americans have been viciously demonized since 9/11, as have Chinese Americans more recently. However, both groups outperform white Americans on nearly all SES indices  as do Nigerian Americans, who incidentally have black skin. It is for historians to point out and discuss these anomalies. However, no real discussion is possible in the current climate at our department. The explanation is provided to us, disagreement with it is racist, and the job of historians is to further explore additional ways in which the explanation is additionally correct. This is a mockery of the historical profession. Most troublingly, our department appears to have been entirely captured by the interests of the Democratic National Convention, and the Democratic Party more broadly. To explain what I mean, consider what happens if you choose to donate to Black Lives Matter, an organization UCB History has explicitly promoted in its recent mailers. All donations to the official BLM website are immediately redirected to ActBlue Charities, an organization primarily concerned with bankrolling election campaigns for Democrat candidates. Donating to BLM today is to indirectly donate to Joe Bidens 2020 campaign. This is grotesque given the fact that the American cities with the worst rates of black-on-black violence and police-on-black violence are overwhelmingly Democrat-run. Minneapolis itself has been entirely in the hands of Democrats for over five decades; the systemic racism there was built by successive Democrat administrations. The patronizing and condescending attitudes of Democrat leaders towards the black community, exemplified by nearly every Biden statement on the black race, all but guarantee a perpetual state of misery, resentment, poverty, and the attendant grievance politics which are simultaneously annihilating American political discourse and black lives. And yet, donating to BLM is bankrolling the election campaigns of men like Mayor Frey, who saw their cities devolve into violence. This is a grotesque capture of a good-faith movement for necessary police reform, and of our department, by a political party. Even worse, there are virtually no avenues for dissent in academic circles. I refuse to serve the Party, and so should you. The total alliance of major corporations involved in human exploitation with BLM should be a warning flag to us, and yet this damning evidence goes unnoticed, purposefully ignored, or perversely celebrated. We are the useful idiots of the wealthiest classes, carrying water for Jeff Bezos and other actual, real, modern-day slavers. Starbucks, an organisation using literal black slaves in its coffee plantation suppliers, is in favor of BLM. Sony, an organisation using cobalt mined by yet more literal black slaves, many of whom are children, is in favor of BLM. And so, apparently, are we. The absence of counter-narrative enables this obscenity. Fiat lux, indeed. There also exists a large constituency of what can only be called race hustlers: hucksters of all colors who benefit from stoking the fires of racial conflict to secure administrative jobs, charity management positions, academic jobs and advancement, or personal political entrepreneurship. Given the direction our history department appears to be taking far from any commitment to truth, we can regard ourselves as a formative training institution for this brand of snake-oil salespeople. Their activities are corrosive, demolishing any hope at harmonious racial coexistence in our nation and colonizing our political and institutional life. Many of their voices are unironically segregationist. MLK would likely be called an Uncle Tom if he spoke on our campus today. We are training leaders who intend, explicitly, to destroy one of the only truly successful ethnically diverse societies in modern history. As the PRC, an ethnonationalist and aggressively racially chauvinist national polity with null immigration and no concept of jus solis increasingly presents itself as the global political alternative to the US, I ask you: Is this wise? Are we really doing the right thing? As a final point, our university and department has made multiple statements celebrating and eulogizing George Floyd. Floyd was a multiple felon who once held a pregnant black woman at gunpoint. He broke into her home with a gang of men and pointed a gun at her pregnant stomach. He terrorized the women in his community. He sired and abandoned multiple children, playing no part in their support or upbringing, failing one of the most basic tests of decency for a human being. He was a drug-addict and sometime drug-dealer, a swindler who preyed upon his honest and hard-working neighbors. And yet, the regents of UC and the historians of the UCB History department are celebrating this violent criminal, elevating his name to virtual sainthood. A man who hurt women. A man who hurt black women. With the full collaboration of the UCB history department, corporate America, most mainstream media outlets, and some of the wealthiest and most privileged opinion-shaping elites of the USA, he has become a culture hero, buried in a golden casket, his (recognized) family showered with gifts and praise. Americans are being socially pressured into kneeling for this violent, abusive misogynist. A generation of black men are being coerced into identifying with George Floyd, the absolute worst specimen of our race and species. Im ashamed of my department. I would say that Im ashamed of both of you, but perhaps you agree with me, and are simply afraid, as I am, of the backlash of speaking the truth. Its hard to know what kneeling means, when you have to kneel to keep your job. It shouldnt affect the strength of my argument above, but for the record, I write as a person of color. My family have been personally victimized by men like Floyd. We are aware of the condescending depredations of the Democrat party against our race. The humiliating assumption that we are too stupid to do STEM, that we need special help and lower requirements to get ahead in life, is richly familiar to us. I sometimes wonder if it wouldnt be easier to deal with open fascists, who at least would be straightforward in calling me a subhuman, and who are unlikely to share my race. The ever-present soft bigotry of low expectations and the permanent claim that the solutions to the plight of my people rest exclusively on the goodwill of whites rather than on our own hard work is psychologically devastating. No other group in America is systematically demoralized in this way by its alleged allies. A whole generation of black children are being taught that only by begging and weeping and screaming will they get handouts from guilt-ridden whites. No message will more surely devastate their futures, especially if whites run out of guilt, or indeed if America runs out of whites. If this had been done to Japanese Americans, or Jewish Americans, or Chinese Americans, then Chinatown and Japantown would surely be no different to the roughest parts of Baltimore and East St. Louis today. The History department of UCB is now an integral institutional promulgator of a destructive and denigrating fallacy about the black race. I hope you appreciate the frustration behind this message. I do not support BLM. I do not support the Democrat grievance agenda and the Partys uncontested capture of our department. I do not support the Party co-opting my race, as Biden recently did in his disturbing interview, claiming that voting Democrat and being black are isomorphic. I condemn the manner of George Floyds death and join you in calling for greater police accountability and police reform. However, I will not pretend that George Floyd was anything other than a violent misogynist, a brutal man who met a predictably brutal end. I also want to protect the practice of history. Cleo is no grovelling handmaiden to politicians and corporations. Like us, she is free."

67,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,To my coach,3,h8zecs,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/h8zecs/to_my_coach/,2020-06-15 04:54:04,"Dear Coach, I was never the popular kid or one of your star athletes, but I did athletics anyway. You probably didn't know that my dad forced me into cross country, making fun of me and often picking at my weight. It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that he was narcissistic. People throw that word around like candy but he had all of the manipulation tactics and sociopathic pathology involved down to a T. He screamed at me often and always used my weight as a weapon to tear me down. I'm surprised I never developed an eating disorder. You probably didn't know any of this but it doesn't matter. You still fucked up. After my first cross country coach retired you took over. I didn't mind being stuck on JV my senior year and your star athletes getting varsity. I wasn't that great of a runner and my times weren't great. I never made below 7:52 for the mile run. I get that. What I don't get was when you and your 2nd in command started asking me to sort tracksuits in the closet, and then groomed me with money to start grading homework. I was poor and would have gone the extra mile for a bit of allowance. You saw my vulnerability and you took advantage of me. As if that wasn't enough, you asked me to start heating up your meals during lunch, something you wouldn't have asked of your star athletes, the rich popular girls who ostracized and ignored me. You asked me why I wasn't going to do track the next semester and laughed when I started crying. I didn't know the meaning of the word ""no"". I was a bit of a people pleaser. I'm not a victim, but I was conditioned to be that way. I now know my own power. You oversaw FCA. Your praised God publicly on social media for your students. You should have known better. You took advantage of a 17 year old girl who was getting verbally, mentally, and sexually abused at home. You were supposed to be an adult and an example to someone like me. You were complicit in my bullying. I had no one and you, the adult who was supposed to be the fucking role model, failed me. You saw somebody with low self-esteem and who was easy to manipulate and took advantage of the situation, just like my abusers. It took me 10 years to estrange myself from my dad AND my mom, who looked the other way and refused to admit anything and even denied her own wrongdoings. You have NO IDEA how much pain I was in. I can't believe you call yourself a Christian you fucking snake. I'm 30 years old now. I know how to stand up for myself know my worth. I live in a safe place in a different country, have a good financial situation and am out of debt and am much better off emotionally, but it took a lot of hard work, therapy and tears to get there. I'm working on forgiving you. I know you are not the sum of your parts and I know you will be a saint in another lifetime. You, many others, and my sperm and egg donors taught me just how calculating and cruel humans can be and still appear as the good and honorable person in the community. But for now, I know you for exactly what you are. You're a wolf in sheep's clothing and a mean girl, just like my peers."

Our break up was supposed to me amicable, I even took her on a birthday trip to show her that even though we were no longer together, that didnt mean that I stopped caring about her. I called you after years of not talking. I was desperately looking for someone who might know something, who could confirm or deny my suspicions. Yes, I called and texted her, but I was vulnerable and desperate for the truth. You said you didnt know, and so I confided in you. I told you I was afraid of what I might find out. I asked you if I shouldve known what she was doing, if I was stupid for not seeing all the red flags that I was starting to see now. You reassured me that you werent someone that sought out drama, you werent about that life. I thought that maybe because we hadnt spoken in years, that we were acquaintances on good terms, that you were so far removed to anything related to me, that you were just being a kind human listening to me in a moment of weakness. Then, my ex tells me that she heard a recording of me speaking to you. I beat myself up for some time thinking that I was being unkind to my ex by talking about her to someone else: did I say something untrue? Did I say something unkind? Did I paint her in a dim light? But now I know where I stand. No. I spoke my truth, and I am not ashamed. I did not say anything unkind about anyone. I learned my lessons: be careful with who I confide in, to not share my personal relationship with a stranger, and humans can be scum. Thats you, you are mean for sport. To exploit my emotions, my vulnerability. To what gain? You shared it with multiple people. Was that amusing to you? Do you feel like a hero now? Showing everyone how crazy I am? I hope you get what comes around."

I say stop following me. You do it more. I say stop trolling around with my life. You do it more. I say that your presence makes me uncomfortable and afraid. That makes you feel powerful. I ask you to move on from me, and stop harassing me. You hack into my private information and fear-monger me. I say Im not interested in you. You doxx me in hopes that I get raped. I say Ive found a new partner who treats me with respect and helps me get into therapy to heal from your abuse. You doxx him, follow him, and then make fun of him online. I say stop harassing my sisters because they dont like you. You pretend to be them and try to get them harmed. I say leave my friends and ex friends alone. You try to seduce them just to hurt them where you know I can see. I say okay, fine. Will having a relationship with me make you stop hurting people I love? You say that you never loved me, and you finally leave me alone- but you find a new version of me to harass in my place. Months go by. You see me happy. The cycle repeats. I dont love you anymore and I never will again. Please move on. - - -/ Before all of this shit, I loved you a lot. I always tried to make you feel loved. I emotionally showed up for you time and time again, and carried a piece of you with me wherever I went. I felt we had a connection. I was protective over the idea of you. I loved you so hard that you became ingrained in my universe, tied into every aspect of history and culture I have ever loved. I showed you my vulnerability. I showed up for you. I looked you in the eyes and opened the door between us. I cried hard over you and missed you something fierce. For a long time, you moved me to create. You inspired me. You were my first true deep love, and I never stopped letting you know it. I loved you hard. I went through hell to get you. I housed the worst of your traits and emotionally fought your demons alongside of you- which you credited to another. I cared. Now that all of this is locked up deep inside of me and I refuse to allow myself to open that door between us, you lash out, play games, and do all of this just to continue making yourself appear in my world. You forgot that there was a real person who loved you because you became so consumed with convincing yourself we were both part of a foolish game. I didnt love you for points. I loved you because I saw in you a piece that had broken off of me when I was younger. I saw how similar we both were in our pain and reactions, and instead of being disgusted by those attributes, I harbored a tenderness for you that I wish had been bestowed on the both of us when we were younger. You continue this campaign of resentment against me like I somehow did you dirty by hardening myself against you after YEARS of your indifference and your using me to hurt other people. In all actuality, I did nothing to you. I just showed up. I didnt make fun of you. I didnt harass you. I didnt make you the butt of jokes. I just cried. A lot. And eventually became jaded. I saw how you were willing to hurt my loved ones just to get to me, and something snapped. All of the shit you did to me behind the scenes that I held in to protect you came spewing out. Once I started, other people came forward with similar versions of the trauma you had wrought, and in the wake of the spotlight, you HATED me. Now were stuck in this revenge cycle that goes nowhere. You want to still have the emotional impact you did before because my love felt good. You had untapped lust and adoration to feed off of which made you feel unstoppable for the duration I loved you. And when it stopped and you once again became empty and ignored, you tried your damnedest to get it back. Not because you realized you loved me and that you were wrong for hurting people the way you had been. But because without all of that adoration, you became just as common as the men you secretly believed yourself to be above. Your life began to go to shit because of your violence against others, but I became the face of your hurt. So you felt yourself justified in tormenting me and mine to get even with me, even though all I did to you was speak up. I could go on and on, but I doubt itll make a dent in that thick haze of self-actualizing in which you surround yourself. Summed up. You were loved by me once, and i would have fought wars for you back then. And in some ways I did. But you mistreated me. You mistreated others like me. You tried to hurt my family. You tried to hurt my friends. You left me no choice in this matter but to become a version of you that you cant fight against. We were always each others mirrors. Its just now you dont like the reflection staring back at you."

It floors me each time it happens. Music, fire, and a sense of vulnerability within a place that almost seems sacred now is necessary for it. I give up my past mistakes and graces to the fire, hands singed with new blessings and prayers. I dance away my fears as the night sky is further illuminated. I walk across the footprints of my past and reach for new distances. As daylight breaks Im lost trying to recollect what is old and what is new. I wash it all away so I can begin anew. I give this moment silence. As the birds chirp a sweeter song I know I am ready for whatever comes next. And with this, I take my next steps."

Its kind of a piss poor analogy, but thats the way my life has been. I seem to always be expected to eat more than I can chew. Ive always been taught to never to back down from a challenge. So... challenge accepted! I gotta be honest with you, Im tired. My mental state is dwindling by the second. Its safe to say Ive officially lost it. Im done. I want to throw in the towel so bad, but I have mouths to feed. I admit I should seek counseling, but i feel like I and only I, am able to help myself. Essentially I hold the answers to their questions. Just gotta find the right questions to ask. Ive only opened up to two people about my mental state. One of them has similar issues and hes become a close friend. The other one was a friend I was talking to before I got into a relationship. So we ended things. She was probably the person that understood it the most. I hate that it ended so abruptly, but it was the right thing to do. Ive come to realize that Im causing my own harm. Growing up I was so good at going with the flow. I was doing my own thing. No worries at all. Fuck it, I said. Boy did that backfire on me! I wasnt educated on how to handle the responsibilities And emotions of becoming an adult. I just Kept bottling them up until eventually... POP! Lost all my marbles. I tend to cater to peoples Problems, before I took care of mine. Ive grown up with so much hate and anger That I didnt want anyone else took hurt like i did everyday of my life. Others peoples problems are just that, their problems. Its nice to lend a helping when its feasible, but in my case I had no right to help others, because I needed to help myself first. I would say this is why Im such a mess. This why Im an absentee father. I became the father I never wanted to be. Ive had a lot of fears growing up. Vulnerability was my biggest fear. It took everything out of me to open and express my emotions. This completely fucked me up beyond anything Ive ever experienced. I dont even have the words or vocabulary to even begin to describe what I feel inside. I have yet to fully process my mental breakdown. Its still fresh in my noggin. I havent talked to family about it because I dont even understand whats going on. I should probably talk to a therapist... For the meantime, Ill start bottling up, maybe write in a journal. Ill think of something. Ive had a lot of blessings in my life, probably more than I deserve, but thats not my call to make. Im grateful for all of them, but the one Im most thankful for is the ability to understand things at a better rate. I cant explain it. I just understand things or can figure things out on the fly. This is why my mind is constantly running and the off switch is broke. I cant turn it off. Ill need to look into meditation for that I think. This whole time Ive been self inflicting trauma and I didnt even it. (Also from outside sources) One thing I dont understand how to do is register Emotions. I think it all goes to anger or suspicion. I love my all my kids so much. I know I dont show it or express it, but the love I have for them is what keeps me going. Any other kind of love is just fuel for a heartbreak and disaster. I dont want it. I dont want anything from anybody. No questions, no help, no pity. Steer clear from me. The last few years have been horrible, but Im going to take it as a blessing and use it to grow. Lots of people have abandoned me and I dont blame them. Theres only a few people that stayed in contact even after everything Happened. Thats my small circle I that I need to stay close to. Ive lost all my contacts. Ive managed to scrounge up a few but its probably best if stay away. I feel like a ticking time bomb. I dont want to cause anyone else anymore pain. Ive caused too much. Its feels good to get this out. Journaling is definitely something I should do..."

I'm sorry you are so tightly wound around your ideas of justice and guilt and success and failure, so tightly wound that you'd twist the universe around your body to fit your skewed perception of what happened, before you'd admit your own mistakes. I'm sorry for how exhausting it must be to be you. To be so full of anger and delusion and blame and guilt. To constantly feel the need to plug a hole within your being, with approval or validation or victimhood - no matter what the cost may be. I'm sorry you never understood perspective, though I hope you will one day be able to digest the choice I made for what it is: not an attempt to wrong you, not abandonment, not betrayal - simply the right thing to do. I'm sorry I introduced you to the boy you couldn't leave before he left you. I'm sorry I never told you truthfully how I felt, about the way you spun the world and people and truth and subjectivity to fit your narrative. I'm sorry I didn't try to drain some of that rage or righteousness or inadequacy or sorrow from your heart, before you decided I no longer deserved even the smallest parts of you. I'm sorry but I will never confront you about your terrible behaviour even though it robs you of your chance to grow: I am tired and you are tiring. I'm sorry I was a bad friend to you - I never meant for you to hurt, only for myself to heal. I'm sorry there are parts of the choice I made, that I could never explain to you, but in my defense, I think you'd break if you knew the whole truth. I'm sorry you think I hate you. I don't. I love you very very much despite it all. . I can't believe you said those things about me though. I can't believe you knew me so intimately yet think I were capable of such vile disdain. I can't believe how you wiped clean every laugh, every cuddle, every vulnerability, every secret, every joke, every Burger King coke, every plan, every truth; till all that is left,is animosity and hatred and mistruth. To call me two-faced or a liar or a cunt is hurtful. To call me manipulative is quite something else. 'Manipulative' implies intent, implies cruelty, implies I had a stake in this awful mess of a year, implies I wanted to see you fall to your knees or crumble into your unhappiness. To selectively filter out all the light, until you are left with a clump of mean words and darkness is so vengeful. Were you always this ugly? But you know what, I'm not angry. I'm not fuming. I'm not looking to get people ""on my side"". I refuse to see you as anything but pitiful and sorry and suffering and tired. No matter how hard you try to separate what happened into black and white, no matter how hard you try to goad me into a confrontation, no matter what cruelty you spew, what accusations you levy, I will always feel sorry for you. I will always look at your condescension and ugliness and think, ""well if thats what it takes so she can live with herself..."" or ""yikes she's going through a lot I guess"". When I saw your 'expos' the first thing I said to myself was: thank fuck I'm not her. How exhausting it must be to be her. How glad I am to not live in her head. What an awful place to be. What a nasty way to think. I hope one day you will allow yourself to be a good person who has done bad things, because this ""I could never be wrong"" gig is truly tragic. (Also I'd love you if you were a bad person just as I love you now when you're not: with all my heart.) You are so intelligent and bright and funny and interesting - what a shame it would be if you never got the opportunity to know yourself as you are. Until then I will thank your insane tweets and hurtful misrepresentations for being your outlet. I've never been a religious person, but I'm praying for you."

The words that wanted to spill from my heart about what could have been didnt have a place in our reality. Still, there seems to be a place for them. Im sure youd find some joy in that. I wanted vulnerability to be one of the themes for this chapter of mine. Writing to you, even in this abyss, might suit that need. Or maybe I should write to write to everyone and no one, take some focus off of the chaos that surrounds us all. My heart feels calmer after writing something with a bit of raw emotion about you. That might have been the toughest part, not knowing what right I had to even feel so much. Matters of the heart can be so confusing. So what now? Do I write about all the strange things that fill my world? Do you want to know the story about the bee? What about that spider? The butterflies? The time I faced my humanity in front of a lightning bolt? What suits here? Sometimes I cant get it out...these thoughts of mine with no place to go. The beauty I see and experience can baffle me at times. I suppose its probably the same with you, a search for beauty and truth in a world that seems to be falling apart underneath our very feet. My roots seem to have grown regardless. I feel the soil beneath me, a hug from earth in its own right. Its gift being a bit of strength as I reach up to the stars. Where do I belong? Here? The rain gently touching my leaves, the winds giving turmoil and clarity to parts of the world kept from view moments ago? Maybe."

I know that the sentiment sometimes just makes it so much harder to bear in the moment, because we can never know. What lies beyond tomorrow is something we cant foresee, and as much as one can hold onto hope, the fact that things *might* be better doesnt always make the present easier to bear... But I wish I could. At least, I wish I could hold you in my arms and be there to physically comfort you. I wish I could be the light that helps you heal. That being said, your vulnerability is not something Im entitled to, nor is your trust in me, so why does knowing that you grow more afraid as we grow closer filling me with a slight sadness? The fact that youre scared that you might hurt me in the process of trying to avoid your own hurt speaks volumes. But we make mistakes. We mess up unintentionally sometimeswere only human after all. Perhaps I cant promise you that everything will be okay, but I wish that you could one day see yourself through my eyes and realise that I want to be by your side and see you through until they are.

I need to know what runs through your head, even some of the time, especially if we're supposed to be just friends. I want so badly to be understanding of you taking time for yourself, of you being on your own and doing your own thing. But holy shit does it make me feel like I don't matter AT ALL when you're able to go weeks, even months, at a time without talking to me, to anybody. I need more from people than that. Even if it's just one text saying ""hey, I'm not in a good place. I'll text you when I am."". I need to be able to have that sort of vulnerability from you, to know that you're okay, that I shouldn't worry, that you just need a minute. But instead I just get nothing at all. And then one day, when I think I'm finally over you, that I'm able to be just your friend without getting my feelings confused, I get a call or a text. And I see you, and I feel that calmness and peace that is so fucking rare for me to find. I see your face that is probably the most beautiful one I've ever seen. And I can't help myself, no matter how much I know you don't care about me. No matter how long I've spent convincing myself that you don't care about me in the same way I care about you, I find myself back in that place all over again. I find myself full of the wanting. To just be around you all the time, to soak up the air that you breathe because I know it's completely different from mine. To see the world as you see it, because you see it so beautifully. You make me want all the things I've never seen myself having with any other person I've met, even though I've never told anybody that, let alone you. I know, logically, that you just want to be my friend. I want so badly, so entirely, to get past this so that we can be just that. So, why can't I? Why is it that every thought I have somehow leads me back to you? Why is it that I can't help myself but to be there for you, even though it hurts me? I think I just want to believe that there's more to the story. That there is some world where you actually felt the same and I didn't make it all up in my head. Because I know that there is no reality where I could've actually believed so wholeheartedly that someone as amazing as you would feel anything more than friendship for someone like me, and it not be true. But. I did. And there is. I just wish we could talk about it. We could make jokes and get over it and move on. But instead you're just pretending I never said anything at all. So there's no clarity, nothing to push through the misunderstanding, just this feeling of something that's incomplete and stagnant that I can't get past. And I feel so fucking guilty that I can't get past it. I talked with Mya and I realized that I just need more from the people around me. I'm such an anxious person and you know this, so just please, please, meet me halfway. I would never want to force you to talk, or put you in a situation where you feel pinned down. I've always tried to expect the least from people, but I feel like I'm not even getting that. Talk this shit through with me so that we can move on. Be vulnerable with me, be honest with me. Because I can't spend the rest of my life loving this version of you that probably never existed to begin with. It hurts way too much. My intentions are pure. I never wanted or expected to feel this way about you. I want you in my life, in whatever capacity you're comfortable with. Just please, let me fucking be there for you."

Ive been raised with the notion that love and emotion are a weakness. Vulnerability is a gateway to heartbreak and betrayal. Ive never understood this fear that was created in my mind, unkempt by my anxiety and apprehension to my peers and their willingness to open up and see beyond their own pain and insecurity. I never had the strength to do that and I dont think I ever will. I lack competence that so many others have, resources that I can never have a firm grasp on. Though, none of this is an excuse. Rather a reality that Ive shunned many a times, and have felt a weighted guilt on my soul. Why cant I be better? Why cant I be who I want to be? What do people want me to be? Will I forever run from the scars and agony of my youth? A life so far but emotions held close to my heart. Is it possible to overcome such damaging circumstance and prevail on top, against all odds? Ill take what was told to me in confidence, lie in hushed ears and walk away in secrecy. Ive always believed that nothing good lasts forever. By my own hand, external sources or others, life would come in the way and ruin it. But, would you rather the good things happen and end or never happen at all? Would you trudge through miles of misery to be able to recognize what truly makes you happy? Questions, and so many more, unanswered for myself. I feel hollow, unsure and numb to my reality. Silence and my thoughts keep me company and quite frankly, I hope it remains that way. It is less people to open up to a repeat the tune of my life. Writing gave solace to the cacophony that is my mind and soul, a bellowing wind that will never find its peace. How I wished and yearned for peace, happiness only for it to flip upside down on my head. Ive tried. Ive breathed. Ive lived a life that I didnt think I could live. Life is beautiful, and much more with you in it. It was colorful. It was refreshing and enthralling, the movement of the world in your eyes kept my bleeding heart at bay. I wish nothing but happiness and favor in your life. You deserve every bit of it, and I will forever and eternally be grateful for what Ive been given and blessed to experience. Ive walked the path at a pace suited for my own comfort. Im not sure what I wouldve done without you. The things I wouldve said, witnessed, without you to guide me. But, as all things in this life, they come to an end. Ill remain quietly in my own company, reflecting and withdrawing from once was and will be. I want to live in a space of time that exists in only one singular moment. Not the present, past or future. A second in time. Perhaps I should start, Ill begin. Thank you. Until again. Yours, A"

After all, ours was an interesting story. E put you in my head. But for good reason. She cautioned because of your situation. But even when you left your bags at my house, dressed in scrubs fresh off the plane. You were a different person. Not everyone trusts a complete stranger with their stuff in a different city. Then there was the wedding. The sneaking back to the storage room. You played the piano. Theres also an elevator picture. Then the beach. You indulged my late nigh t run on the dunes. Eating pizza. Sitting on the porch talking. I remember sending a pic while I was diving. Just hoping to catch your interest. I actually sang some songs in the shower while there that I was feeling for you. Was it All in my head. Couldnt tell if I was making up that your had interest in me. While theres wasnt another girl involved. Couldnt help but wonder if it was all in my head. Every glance. Every hang. Was it real or was it all in my head. Did you ever feel the same. Was my head just playing games? It was so hard to keep it together. I felt crazy crazy crazy. I looked forward to every occasion you would be around. No one would have known because I locked the shit down deep inside. Showing it exposed a vulnerability I just didnt want to deal with. Too much fear. Too much unknown. Then that summer trip to NC. I said I just wanted to get out of town. And I did. But the destination was very much directed toward you. I hoped to see you. And I did. We met at the bar all casual. Then that weird Air B&amp;B with the picture that looks like clothing evidence in the stream. And it was a bad part of town. So I bailed and crashed with you. I agonized over my outfits. I adored sitting on the porch talking and smoking cigarettes from the freezer. So my mind just mildly buzzed with you in it. I started dating someone a few mo than later. And for whatever reason. Maybe your social media or more likely just because of you - I couldnt stop thinking of you. I compared everything he did to you. And he just didnt measure up. I cut it off. Then you invited me to the super bowl party. I accepted and took off on a sprint around the block to burn off the anxiety while I waited for your response. It was a good response. Got it mid run. I was determined to be cool and casual. But E said you asked for suggestions about what to do. You wanted to have a goo datish time with me. Tried to write it off. Obviously that didnt happen. Passion took over. I knew it would be hard if we gave in but I couldnt help it. After that I couldnt read you. What did I do. Was this just another sucker moment. Was I just begging for another guys attention after he got what he wanted? I called off work on Monday just to see you so more. Even though I just hung out while you were working. Looking back that feels like a crazy girl move. But I was a crazy girl for you. Leaving. That night was excruciating. Maybe because I knew it wasnt gonna be a long distance thing that defies everything. I knew how you felt about that. You were clear about it and E converted your concerns. But I wanted to believe it would be different. I wanted to believe I would be the one who would change that all for you. I wasnt. But then it was Es Bday. You came. I told E and M that I wasnt gonna do anything. But halfway through the night I knew I was giving in. You were my weakness. Remember when my dog shit on the floor and for a sec you thought it was you? I never laughed so hard. You always had me laughing. Regardless of the situation. After that... the real struggle began. I knew you didnt want the distance thing. But I held onto this bizarre hope that I would change that. That it would be different. After years of therapy I realize that was an issue of mine - thinking I could change someone and that my worth was found in someone doing a 180 for me (thanks dad for being a complete twat and fucking up my world view of relationships - another letter to write). Even when I knew what I was experienced it didnt make it easier. I saw the girls in your social medial. My heart shattered each time. It sank into my stomach. My stomach then churned it into pieces. Eventually I got used to the idea. The time and distance did its job. I met someone. You werent involved. I could move on. Then came your bday party. Or was It Js bday.? Which ever once, I knew Id have a melt down. I was preparing for seeing you. It nothing prepared me for actually seeing you. For listening to you. Hearing your voice. Laughing at your jokes. Looking at you smile. I knew I had to let it all out to you or I wouldnt forgive myself. I worked up the courage to come downstairs to you. You were cracking jokes about C sleeping. I sat on the edge of the air mattress and spilled my guts. I followed you around like a puppy. While my bf slept upstairs. I dont know if it was this time or the othe bday party. But on the deck I finally looked at you and said  I would have done anything for you. I would have dropped everything and moved to be with you. And you looked at me. Shocked and sad. You looked down and said I had no idea you felt that strongly. I felt the same way. Panic set in for me. Did we really miss each other?! How could we have felt the same about each other and miss it?! Was it too late?! To say this disrupted my life for the foreseeable future is an understatement. To hear you say you felt the way I did back then but we were just to incapable of communicating felt like an actual shot to the heart. I know you know what I meant when I said I was considering doing a big thing. You talked me down. You were the bigger man. We even chatted the next day. You know what I alluded to. I didnt even have to say real words and you knew. And youre response was, abbreviate, you need to stay your course, maybe our paths will cross one other day. I was a wreck. It took me months. Maybe a year to get over that. How could I have missed you. How could we have been so close but missed it. It could be us right now. Why isnt it us right now. I felt guilt, shame - for my current relationship. But knowing if you you said the word, Id drop it all and be by your side. I would drink and send you songs and feelings. The songs said the words I couldnt. I know you understood. You never responded, but I know you got it. Probably for the best. Thats you. Poised and restrained. However today, I still see you in the same way. Ive seen the good and bad (from a distance). Ive heard the good and bad about your situations (from a distances). But it doesnt change how I see you. To me you are amazing. You arent perfect. But. You are funny. Introspective. Insightful. Reflective. Self deprecating, but intelligent and humble and hilarious. You are aware. So aware you self. So aware of the world around you. You are sincere, quick witted, understanding, slow to react and judge, considerate and aware of the greater existence of people - life isnt black and white. You tend to sabotage things from the start. You see the end, knowing where youre stating. I cant criticize, you are being realistic because you know you. But you dont give yourself enough credit. Other people suck, but you think youre the problem. Maybe other people are part of the problem. And I know I tend to try to play the savior. I want to rescue people from their bad views of themselves. I want to show them that they are great. That they can be great. And I realize I may have had that tendancy with you. Only because, though I dont actually know all you been through (I know some stuff from 3rd parties but thats not relevant regarding what you actually experienced on the inside) I feel like I understand having been though similar things. And for fucks sake I love your soul. If only you knew how lovely your soul is. I struggled when things didnt happen with us. I just couldnt let it go. So many songs were just how I felt. To you. For you. Because of you. The struggled lasted way longer than I think it should have considering we didnt actually ever really date. There was just something about you. I just kept coming back. I just couldnt master the art of letting you go. And you know it. You got the snaps. The songs I sent. Theres no mistaking what it meant when I sent a song to you Im the middle of the night. Yeah that Nicole Atkins song. All those Tori Kelly songs. It felt so silly. But I would listen to them on repeat. Knowing they were written for me about you. Trying to pretend I was getting over you. All along Im with someone else. The guilt. All of the guilt. I cant have you. I have someone else. But you still drove me crazy. I had a playlist of song about you. You felt like it for me. Not because of some superficial reasons. But because your soul spoke to mine. From the moment you left your bags at my house, to the wedding coast ,to the time at the beach dunes, to sitting on your deck, to falling in my dogs poop on the rug at your super bowl party. I would crumple to the floor late at night. I Against all better judgment I send the snaps. I listened to the songs on repeat. Again - I was with someone. But you still consumed me. Eventually Id listen to should have been us. And it wouldnt hurt the same. I guess that was grieving leg read. It was an acceptance. I wanted it to be different. I wanted it to be us. But we will never know. And we cant suspend life for what ifs. But the lyrics remain true for me You got yours and I got mine It's unfair that I still care And I wonder where you are tonight Back and forth like a tug of war What's it all for, do I want it back I still got a little flame for ya Even though you drove me mad Now and then, I pretend That it's you when I close my eyes You got yours, I got mine But I wonder where you are tonight Thinking it could be different But maybe we missed it As time passed. As we lost communication. As life moved on. The hurt and desire wanned. But the feeling about who you are - how real, sincere, incredible you are as a person - that never left. Even though its not on the top of mind these days - the right song, a picture of you, your name popping up - any reminder, reminds me of how amazing you are. I dont know what I means to feel weirdly connected to someone I am now actually connected to. Maybe its me. Maybe I have some glitches. But theres a peace for me knowing youre out there. As long as youre happy. As long as you are feeling okay. I still cant help but feel like me and you were a cosmic miss. And all those songs still apply, for they have articulated the feelings I couldnt &gt;&gt;&gt; Tori Kelly: Eyelashes All In My Head Should Have Been Us Art of Letting You Go Nicole Atkins: A Little Crazy"

I have tried to continue feeling as I once did. I feel like I talked myself into staying attached to you convincing myself it was for your sake. The truth is I've only done long term relationships. I waffle, I can't just outright say no, because I never took the time to learn who I was, how to identify if I am even happy or not so I default into the emotions of those around me. I know this is toxic. How can I turn away from someone who loves me with every fiber of their being even when I have given them so many reasons not to. When we planned to spend time together last night and today I was excited until I saw you. Until about an hour into hanging out and realized all I wanted to do was leave. I know this hurts you. I sat down after I got home and truly thought about it. I told you when we first started dating that love should feel like freedom. I don't feel free. I feel imprisoned. I do every time I am with you. If you came to me right now and said you wanted to leave me and never talk to me again I would breathe easier. I would shrug and move on with my life. I feel guilty, oh so guilty for feeling this way especially because I know you would blame yourself. You have no reason to. You are strong, incredibly intelligent, a truly beautiful person inside and out. I have tried to leave before and seeing the damage it did I tried to slap a band aid on it by denying myself and staying even when in my heart of hearts I knew I shouldn't. Now I feel like we are caught in a death dance. Every time I kiss you I feel the lost feelings echoing in a well of darkness. In my inability to speak up I have trapped us in this doomed limbo. Sometimes I feel as if I told you this you would be okay with the fact that I feel nothing for you except general care of another human being as long as I stayed with you. But I don't want to stay. I want to be free, free to find myself and who I am outside of a relationship of any kind. I want to scream into the void how much I just want to be left alone. I want you to be free. To love and be loved in kind by someone who simply is not me. We have whipped each other since we started seeing each other. I don't feel this is fair in the slightest. I am so thankful to you for so many things. You enriched my life with knowledge, with understanding, with vulnerability. At the same time you tend to hold these things over my head. The same way I have done with you in the past. I feel even more guilty because as I tried to force myself to be the ""good loving girlfriend"" I went overboard, I made grand gestures. I reassured you I would always be there. I resent seeing you. Every time I spend time with you I go home with my head and heart a mess. Like I am not me, just a prerecorded program of yes dear, I love you dear. You deserve someone to hold you at night. But I don't want to hold you and I don't want anyone to hold me. I want to find out who I am. I wanna figure out where I fit in this world. I want to become a whole person and I feel like I can't do that after I contact you. I feel like a liar every day and night. I did love you and I wish with everything in me that I still did. After everything I don't see a way out. I have tried in the past and you argue me into submission although it is still my choice to say yes. I don't know how to tell you this without ruining all the progress you have made. I don't want to hurt you. I wish you would just leave me, but that is selfish. I just want it to be easy at this point. Unfortunately nothing about this is easy. I don't want you out of my life forever. I just feel like from the start we should have just been friends. I found you to be a kindred spirit, but a kindred spirit in intellect and pain is not the same as a kindred spirit in a partner. One cannot find a kindred spirit of a partner until their spirit is whole. Mine is not. I have not been single for more than a month since I was 13 years old. I have spent more than a decade worried about other people and their growth and their pain and their journey. In doing this I have neglected my own soul. I never thought I'd live this long so I lived vicariously as a shade through others. This has to stop before I have nothing left worth salvaging into a functional human being. I wreck havoc on everything with empty promises of comfort and love because havoc is all I have in me. I simply wish to be to others what I need for myself. I realize now I can't get that from the outside It has to come from inside me. But I can't spend that time inside myself to reflect and nurture and grow if all I am worried about is making sure you feel nice. So this is goodbye, not really because I don't have the backbone to say so yet. I need to do it soon though before I whither and die completely. Before I damage you too far to come back from. I once told you my capacity for kindness is my capacity for cruelty. I was wrong. There is no kindness here."

B.M.G., you are killing me from the inside out. god, i didnt know asking for help to leave you would result in this. if i had known, i wouldve stayed. i would have continued to be the object of your abuse and use if it had meant i wouldnt be in the psychological turmoil i am trapped in right now. i wish i never left. i long for my ignorance and my innocence again. i want back my mind that accepted you as normal and not a monster. i wish i had never been told how wrong your actions were. if they hadnt discussed it with me, maybe you would have never had the chance to change their minds. but thats what you do, isnt it? youre a master manipulator, and it is impressive. youve convinced me rape is okay. youve convinced them rape is okay. youve convinced everyone that i made it up. you live in my head, and i cant escape you. i didnt really leave you, though. you follow me everywhere. youre in my head, youre in the heads of my peers, youre in the messages of my friends, you never leave. you stand beside me when i get up, you lay beside me when i go to sleep. youre always here. i dont even care what your friends think. i dont even care that theyre your friends. i dont care that they lured painful information out of me just to believe you over me. goddammit, i dont even care if your friends date my friends because i will never win. tolerating those who tolerate you is still justifying you as a human. so, i guess your actions are excusable to me too. i lost the moment i shared my vulnerability with someone who would ultimately bring it back to you. i lost when i took the advice to leave you. when they said it would do me good. they lied too. just like you. fuck this, id take you back if it meant youd leave my friends alone. if it meant they didnt have to stand up for me to your friends who saved me. maybe if i apologize long and hard enough, youll take me back and leave everyone be. maybe wed meet where we left that night in the pouring rain. youd take me back in your car, id be silent and tense and youd have that look. the look you had when i told you i was terrified of you. the look that meant you are still in control. wed get out of the car and youd grab me by the arm and drag me downstairs as i am so accustomed to. its muscle memory now. you have everyone on your side already, so why do you continue to try and win people over? i am a known liar now, i guess, so why try? they all believe you. i wonder what would happen if you knew that i still spend the majority of my nights in a ball gasping for the air you never allowed me. releasing sobs full of so much pain that should never be known to man. what would happen if you knew i claw at my skin when i remember your touch? youd probably laugh knowing youre in control still. i was never going to win this. you have too much power. you always did. you still have me in your clutch like you have everyone around your finger. i lost. i always lose. if you ever saw this, youd laugh at how i dumped my feelings on a page with no structure. i could never do it right. sincerely, you know who this is."

Youve been like this for quite awhile, never caring if I was on my period and in pain, or emotionally hurt by your lying and manipulation. I had surgery a few days ago and you called me a baby because I had fallen on the floor after getting home from the hospital and was crying on the floor. Damn youre a piece of shit. When I told you I needed certain things in those moments, you became upset at me because the things you had already done for me werent enough and I was being too needy. The irony is that you are so incredibly needy ALL THE TIME. 2-3 times a week you get into these moods that can be set off by the smallest things, and Im expected to cater to your every need and constantly be aware of how youre feeling. I used to never have a problem with this because I loved taking care of you, but now that I see how little you want to take care of me.. Im fucking pissed. Were fucking 22 and I have no interest in spending so much time and energy worrying about the lack of emotional vulnerability from a man who acts like a child."

You were never the type to fake vulnerability, and it kind of did something to me to see that you were capable of expression beneath the unyielding, stoic mask you wore during the day. After I set up the couch for you and gave you tea, I listened to you finally talk about all of the things you had been lording over me since we came crashing into each others lives years before. You were congested and miserable as you apologized for the things you had done to me in your jealousy-most I knew about, some I didnt. You confessed that originally you had only started doing those things because you felt rejected by me because of my own stoicism in public, and when you realized you could get away with it, you kept going. You said you were partially encouraged by the friends you kept at the time- elite, rich, and connected kids trying to make it in the Hollywood scene who got their kicks from picking random targets and making a game out of pranking them. You couldnt blame them entirely, you said, because they got bored of it weeks in and wanted to move on to someone new, but you couldnt stop fixating. You had nights where you hated yourself as you watched footage of me crying in my car or listened to audio where I vented my fear to my sister. You had more nights where you scoured your files, looking for any mentions of other men in my life who might have been a threat to you. You told me you started to question your sanity when it moved past a cruel joke to real investment to my life. You wanted to scare me some days, on the days you disapproved of my behavior or got overly drunk and I refused to acknowledge you. And on other days, you wanted to save me from people like you; to whisk me away to a life of success and power that would keep me from ever crying over men like yourself again. I was your pet project. You couldnt decide if you wanted to tear me down or build me up. You had several girlfriends in the advent of your obsession. They were beautiful, tall, blonde goddesses in comparison to me. They wore their elegance and wealth effortlessly, and made you work to please them. But in the dead of night as they lay curled against you, trustful and sleepy, you snuck away to replay certain bookmarks of my life. Here was a video of me flipping something off in the distance; here was one of me giving money to a stranger; here was another of me on a bus late at night, my makeup worn off and my headphones fixed to my ears. Most of the ones you bookmarked werent erotic. Some were funny to you. But most were just of an ordinary woman living her ordinary life; and you *yearned*. You were caught one day by one of your lovers, because you couldnt exit out of my profiles fast enough. This one was different than the ones you dated in the past, you said. She was smarter, colder, more powerful, and in her anger, she terrified you. It was the first time you felt like me. She had eyes on you when she was gone, you said, and you didnt know for sure, but you thought she had tried to hurt your exes as they kept disappearing from your life without talking to you. Ghosting you. Youd never been ghosted before. You said she took note of your interest in me, and became wrathful. She couldnt understand your fixation on someone like myself. And here I watched your self-deprecating smile turn downward, as you realized the insult in them for the first time. You waved it away, and went on to tell me about the game she tried to turn your involvement in my life into after she understood who I was to you. Prey. Owned. Acolyte. She had a taste for blood that exceeded your own voyeuristic sadism. And once she learned of the socialite games, she wanted to be an undoing. You started crying again as you talked about how she orchestrated my daughters removal and the jail setup. You told me she watched footage of me standing in court over and over again, her eyes cold and satisfied as she replayed me speaking before the jury. She liked your footage of me in tears the best, you said; and for the first time, you regretted ever meeting me. She wanted to do more, to do *worse*. She started turning her gaze on my family and friends to see how far her reach could go, and you were contemplating turning yourself in just to save me before something changed inside of her. You looked shaken as you told me that one night, in the thick of her retaliation, she woke crying and sweating, looking human for the first time since youd known her. She was incoherent for a time, skittish and unable to meet your eyes as you tried to parse out what had happened to her from one sleep to the next. She told you that she had lived as me. It was a nightmare so realistic that she swore it had happened. From birth to end, she had been forced to live my life, including all the trauma and abuse subjected, and that no matter how many times she begged to be spared or for mercy, everyone turned a deaf ear to her words as her torture was broadcasted on TV for all to see and none to care. She said she felt the pain and fear, and loss of friends until her inevitable descent into that jail cell last year. She watched her daughter taken by social workers on loop after loop while people celebrated online, and something inside of her changed. She woke up and realized what she had done. She finally felt the impact of her actions, and how she could use her immense power to better rather than destroy. And so she set about fixing the mistakes she had done, starting with me. I listened to you recount her nightmare and wondered at what had you so up in arms at what sounded like a positive change. I didnt say anything. You said that you realized something after having been dealt your own helplessness at having been pinned by someone stronger than you. And that was you envied me. After all of the hurt and humiliation you put me through, I still believed in good and had hope. You envied how I forgave my predators. You envied that I knew how to live with overwhelming terror, and in that envy you finally realized that I only grew to know how to deal with terror because of you. You sat on my couch, and for the first time in a long time, you asked for my forgiveness. You told me that I had control over my own life from now on, and the ability to protect myself from people like you both. You passed along her promise to be better and to help improve my life, and told me that she wasnt fickle; that her word was her bond. And that she wanted me to feel safe so she wasnt reaching out directly. I didnt say it last night, as you left shortly afterward, but I forgave you both a long time ago. Thank you for finally being honest with me. More importantly, thank you both for helping me. It isnt easy to change for the better; Im right there with you both."

Why is it every time you do, all you do is project, as if you speak of yourself? How many times do people call you out only for you to have it instantly fly out your brain? Why is it that you're half way to 22 now and you still act with childish behavior of that as if you were still a senior in high-school? Why is it that seemingly you surround yourself with the people who enable your poor behavior and turn your back on the ones who genuinely care for you and just want you to succeed? Why is it that whenever you had a problem, you let the world crash down on me and expect me to beg and plead no matter how utterly stupid your reasoning for being upset were? Why is it when I felt upset with you, and to be fair, was not appearing threatening, but rather, just wanted to be understood, why is it that you took that reached out hand of vulnerability and spat on it? Do you ever notice how the people around you often apologize because you subconsciously make them feel guilty even when they didn't do anything wrong? Why do you never hold yourself to the same standard you hold others? Why is it okay for you to babble online about people's ego when your's is the size of texas? Why are superficial things like a person's weight, and whether or not someone can control their emotional stability 100% percent of the time seem like a good reason to leave someone in the dust and replace them as if they are trash? Have you ever looked back on things you've said and realize how insane you sound? Do you realize you're the one to point fingers but never point it at yourself? Do you realize you called out a genuine person in your life for ""gaslighting"" when you had your fair share of that with me? Do you realize that even though I should come to hate you I just can't? That I just want the best for you? I really wish you could see how you have so much potential to be someone great but you are just pissing it away. I wish you were more motivated and I wish that I could've been there for you in your dark times instead of being cast away because I'm 5'6"" and over 200lbs. I still care about you but you are a terrible person sometimes and it's hard to even be around you. I hope you don't end up alone in life because if you continue these bad patterns you will push every good thing away from you until there is nothing left but you and your games."

The idea of being vulnerable does not sit well with me especially because of fear of rejection. Thats why I dont like opening up because you can express how you feel about something to your hearts content and someone can just choose to reject that or ignore it. But thats the thing I cant control how others react so at the very least I have done whatever I could. Despite knowing that I dont think Ill be able to go one up especially if Im not comfortable. Thats the thing I think I need to be comfortable with someone and until that happens Im literally clamped up. I keep thinking about youve seen my soul and youve accepted me for who I am and thats what I need in life. For me if I like or love someone I see your soul and accept you for who are Im there for you for life unless you do something to make me feel otherwise you know. So I suppose vulnerability has to happen at some point you know. I just dont know when or with who.

It felt like a hug from you. Hugs have always seemed, to me, to be the bookends of our friendship. There was *the* hug, the one at my doorstep, that started everything. The single, solitary heart-pumping moment of that hug is seared into my memory as it was, at one point, seared into yours. (Do you still recall it, I wonder? How I collapsed into you so recklessly?) My instinct knew then that I was going to fall in love with you, it's the only way to explain why a hug that meant nothing felt so much like *something*. Then there is, of course, that last hug. The one we analyzed for hours. What were you feeling when you held me and let your hands linger for the briefest moment? Not what you were thinking, I think we can both discern that, but what was your instinct telling you in that moment? I wonder if mine knew that it would be the end. Was I really so deaf to the warning signs or so deluded that I let myself believe it was the start of something? Either way, I must confess that I still allow my thoughts to linger in those quiet embraces throughout my day. Anyway, back to the song. When that song came on, it was like you were sitting with me. It felt like you, like the same combination of intelligence and vulnerability and poetry and humor and sheer fucking attitude that keeps me so pathetically enamored despite the pair of years separating you and me and that last fucking hug. I sat there basking in that feeling, the emotions falling over and melting into me like snowflakes on my skin and it was almost painful. It was like having you there for three minutes and forty-three seconds. How strange that a song I'd never heard and, in all likelihood, one you don't know either, to hit me that way, to make me remember you. Of course, that's exactly what I'm trying not to do. In truth, I've tried at least a thousand times to forget that I'm in love with you. That's just about twice a day for every day apart. I've hated you and missed you and cursed you and cried over you but most of all I have prayed to a God I don't believe in that you get what you deserve. Because you deserve better than me and no amount of love on my end will ever change that. See, the worst part, the thing I hate to acknowledge, the shame that I carry with me is that I have someone who loves me. Someone I love. It's not a passionate, all-consuming love. It's comfortable. Lived in. The love of friends who sometimes drive each other bonkers but always find a way to come back together. It's a good love, but it's not the love that I spend most of my energy trying to ignore. Lately that love feels heavy because my arms are so weary of carrying this torch for you but, like a nightmares where you can't run or scream, I keep setting this love down and walking away and it keeps finding it's way back into my arms. I beg for closure. Either take me in your arms or let me put this godforsaken love down and walk away. Send a letter, a text, a word and it will be enough. (Is this really where I'm at, begging for a single word breathed in my direction? Does that alone not engender a little mercy?)"

I am the most vulnerable there, vulnerable but safe. But ... this vulnerability often frightens me. Can something that feels so heavenly also be this terrifying?Is this real? This feeling comes so naturally. Where did you come from? Are you meant for me? And I, for you? I want to be your protector. Can you trust me with all of your virtues? How about your vices? Will you hand me those broken pieces, *""tainted""* you'd say -- unaware that these are you're most beautiful assets. I'll take you by your hand and point out in awe, showing you the charm in those parts you stow away. Im beyond terrified but with you? Together? We can move mountains. So do me a favor will you? Hold my hand and don't let go. ""Marry me"" - I'll have the pleasure of asking you one day."
90,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,An open letter to my abuser,1,gebhos,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/gebhos/an_open_letter_to_my_abuser/,2020-05-06 12:24:39,"I see you behind my closed eyelids just before I fall asleep. I hear you voice in the back of my mind. Your touch transforms my skin into something that is no longer mine. I wasnt even at double digits before petals were plucked from my pores and crumpled, discarded. One by one. You acted as if what you were doing was normal, how casually your hands crept towards me. How often had you done this to act like it was no big deal? I was wearing corduroy pants that were a size too big for me, so I was constantly pulling them up. I wore my favourite shirt at the time, cotton underwear, odd socks in white sneakers. I, barely pubescent. You, old enough to be my father. How on earth was a young girl to react? Scream? Cry? Fight? Remain frozen in fear? I hate myself as parts of my flesh no longer belong to me. Theyve been claimed by someone else, stolen from me, replaced with the empty words you used to hush me. Like a tiny bandaid over a huge, gaping injury. I still feel like washing my hands over and over but I can never seem to clean the feeling. Your wife was in the next room, she was just a couple of months away from giving birth to your child, yet here you were, your focus on another child as you forced her hands down the waistband of your underwear. A child, whose childhood you selfishly stole. Silence does not equal consent, not that consent should have mattered in the first place, I was not an adult, nor a teenager. I was nine years old. A child. I was still in primary school. I hadnt started growing breasts, I hadnt gotten my period, yet here you were with your hands down my pants. My body still remembers the painful feeling of stretching, tearing. NINE. You repulsive, vile human. As a police officer, you should have known better. You were supposed to be someone that people can trust. Do you know how much you hurt me both physically and mentally? Are you even aware? Do you know how agonising it was to go to family gatherings and act like everything was normal for years? Do you know the shame I feel? I cant even bring myself to tell my parents. I feel like theyd never forgive themselves. They tried so hard to protect me. As a teenager, I wasnt allowed to sleep over at a friends house if they had an older brother or if my parents hadnt met the father. I didnt have the heart to tell them that it was too late. Im an adult now, but I still havent worked up the strength to tell my family. I dont want pity, I dont want people to tiptoe around me or be overly cautious of what they say around me. I cant bring myself to tell people. Ill no longer just be me, Ill be forever haunted by my association as a victim and that thought is unbearable to me. Ive already had part of my identity taken. I am so much more than a victim. I refuse to be identified by something that wasnt my choice. The first time I even tried to be intimate with my boyfriend was when I was nineteen. Ten whole years since you laid your damn hands on me. What should have been a moment of chosen vulnerability with someone I trust and love had me reduced to a scared girl, having a panic attack, sitting on the bed in my underwear, crying, shaking, nose running and mascara streaming down my face. My poor boyfriend was confused and very concerned, he asked if I was alright and held me. I knew I had to tell him that it wasnt anything he did and I knew I had to tell him what happened to me. He held me and stroked my hair while I cried and unloaded ten years of repressed emotions. With each passing year, I feel more and more disturbed. I see children who were my age when it started and they look so, so young. I hate how youve forced your constant presence in my life even though I havent seen you in many years and I hope that one day if I do see you again, Ill be brave enough to tell you how much I despise you."

In these past 5 months you have done what I never thought anyone could do. You actually taught me what love is. What a real relationship is. My first and only relationship before you was... awful. I told you about it within the first month of us dating. I tell everyone who chooses to get close to me because the baggage I carry is something people need to know before signing up for being my friend, or boyfriend for that matter. Before you, I didn't know it was ok to not be ok. That I was allowed to be upset sometimes and not know why and that that didn't reflect how I felt about you. I didn't know it was ok to be vulnerable in front of the person you loved because I thought everyone would take advantage of my vulnerability. You taught me so much in such a short amount of time. You were patient in getting to know me and you dealt with my anxiety and insecurities so gracefully. You've never gotten upset with me about how I feel and you've always listened to me try to explain even when I know it doesn't make any sense. You're my person. And while we've both said we're just gonna see where this goes, we seem to talk about the distant future quite a lot. We talk about being grumpy old people. We talk about living together. We talk about having grandkids even though we both say we don't want kids. For once in my life I'm excited to be along for the ride and see where our love takes us. Here's to going through this crazy life together and just figuring it out along the way. I love you."

Something I wanted to understand so bad but it terrified me the lengths I'd have to go to if I wanted to learn everything I needed to know. Vulnerability, self-love, and open communication, and were at the time merely abstract concepts from my inexperienced point of view. I was scared to find out what love was. Because I knew it was going to make me or break me. But you made it tempting to go outside. You said you knew the ropes and wouldnt let me get hurt if I took this risk with you. All I know is that I had never wanted to change for anyone more than I did for you. You let me take baby steps at first allowing me to make a few mistakes. Mistakes I seemed to hold on to longer than I needed just because I wanted to be better for you. Every day. I got some scrapes and bruises in the beginning but you were there to pick me up. But eventually you realized that I wasnt ready to run. Not even close. You knew where you wanted to take us. You found the path. Youd been on this journey alone for so long, exploring the map, good and bad. But you found it. A safe, paved road laid down right before me. And I didnt appreciate it at the time. I was too busy looking off the path, worried about the dangers of taking this risk and forgot that I had my guide. Yeah you never let me out of your sight on our journey, but its like sometimes you were yelling at me to catch up from way ahead, not by my side anymore. And I think its because you never really knew what my real struggles were. And neither did I. Because I saw the path. So smooth, so good on the joints. But this if my first rodeo. And I tried to be badass and take that risk with you. Im just sorry it felt like a crawl to you. But I was just happy to moving in the right direction with you. And you made the mistake at the very end. When I was ready to run. The minute, no second I saw you face to face I was going to run into your arms and tell you I was all in. It wouldve been okay if this happened earlier when I couldnt keep up. But no. It was when I was finally seeing the light. Even if you cheated on me after I told you I was all in I think we couldve gotten through this. If Im going to be honest I think I am hurting more than you. Because I never loved anyone harder, felt closer to anyone despite the actual distance, wanted to dedicate my life to one person. To one purpose. Not even fucking close. Until I met you. And I need to be with someone who shouldve known this was something my hard and soul couldnt take. Not until I gave you my consent. Which was going to basically be me telling you that I was ready to take the leap. I couldve been there yesterday with you if you really wanted me to. So yeah, heartbreak sucks. Especially when you made me believe I wouldnt catch it. And believe me this whole entry Im writing does not reflect how much I want to go back to standing under a hot shower pretending like it was your warm body holding me and just shake uncontrollably and feel like I cant breathe until I couldnt stand anymore and just lay there in a ball forever. You broke me. Im not as strong as you. I dont have battle scars. I dont know how bad things can get. I needed you to hold my hand and have patience with me. I wish you couldve been more present and not worrying about things out of our control. So Im deciding to walk back, because in the end the only valid reason for me to call it is to go off what I feel. I feel like I have no more life in me We were at the pearly gates and you tripped on the way in. I could see how close we were to immortalizing our love. Now all this over one small trip? Well you were my guardian angel. And when you tripped you took me down with you. And thats when I realized you never made it through those gates either and you were just as fragile as me. You pretended to be an angel and made a promise only angels could keep. You shouldve walked with me. Slowly. Both wearing our fears and shortcoming on our sleeves, not just our hearts. Walk with me and explain what goes on off the path. You couldve showed me theres nothing to be scared of, no matter how many times I got spooked. I was so scared of going out, but you said such sweet words. So I trusted you. And you were scared you werent good enough and wanted us to get through those doors as fast as we could. We shouldve talked about our fear. In a productive way. But we didnt. And I wish you stumbled earlier so I couldve seen that you knew no more than I did. Because I probably wouldve ripped out my heart right then and there and summon whatever strength I had to chuck it right through those doors."
93,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,"Thank you, restraining order.",1,gg6lza,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/gg6lza/thank_you_restraining_order/,2020-05-09 11:59:20,"It's been over a year. I'm breathing finally. Fresh, deep breaths. I have removed all contact from anyone you know, including you. I have the restraining order to thank for that. Forcing me to remove myself from your grip. My life has changed, evolved, taught me there is more to live for. I have so much to thank you for. You taught me to be free, that I didn't need to rely on anyone for feelings of validation or anything that I need. You taught me if I wanted something to go get it without subconsciously thinking of anyone else. I wish you seen what I see in you. Courageous, intelligent, funny, confident, adventurous, and free. You have the power to be so much more than you allow yourself. In an out of prison constantly running. With a mind like that you could be running a multi million dollar company, but that would require you to believe in yourself and stick to something. For 3 and a half years I tried to believe you loved me you just didn't know how to truly love someone because of your upbringing. I constantly blamed your lack of love and security as a child for your behavior now. But I finally realized it's your narcissistic behavior that can never be changed. You learned too early in life what you can gain by being manipulative, and maybe your lack of vulnerability and sense to be able to gain anything on your own is to blame. You'd give anyone in the world the last thing you had if it meant they wouldn't suffer or go without, but why is it that you can't give the same emotionally to a partner. I loved you. I would have given anything for you to have seen that. I kept all of your pictures. Not because I miss you, but because I want to remember the feelings that I had for you, and remember that one day I will give those same feelings to someone who deserves them. After 3 and a half years, drugs finally caught up with you. The feeling of getting away with everything that you do with no consequence gave you a power you couldn't escape. Held at gunpoint, being choked until unconscious, and having a knife set on my throat with the grip of my four year old child at the end of it because I chose to finally set myself free of you. Hardest nights of my life following. Sleeping in my car, crying myself to sleep, scared to go anywhere you were familiar with until you were caught. I can't say for certain I wouldn't have let you play with my mind a couple more times if it weren't for the restraining order, this is why I say thank you. I am happy. I am free. I am still not healed, not ready to love, but eventually I will be able to let someone love me without a constant thought that they have negative intentions with me. Someone will deserve all I have to give. To the girl keeping you together now: I don't hate you. You knew about me and watched this happen and chose to stay, you picked him up as he was running while the cops searched my house. There is nothing more for me to ever try to say to you. I can do no convincing to someone who doesn't want it. Nor will I try. My best advice to you is to love him. He needs it. Someone to try and show him there is more... more to this life. That he is capable of more than he gives himself. Be careful, protect yourself, and your kids. When you start noticing the spiral of unstableness when he lets himself slip again, protect yourself before you have to thank a restraining order too or a grave."

I was honest, I told you I cared and that I wanted to stop hooking up to keep our friendship from becoming toxic. Did you take that as rejection? Why would that even matter since you were *talking to someone else* at the time? It burns me up to watch you rationalize your guilt by lying to yourself. Do I need to show you my records? Are you really so prideful that you have to change your memories? Id love to send this letter to you but I know youre too much of a pussy ass bitch to have your mistakes so blatantly pointed out. This would definitely shut you down. Or maybe Im the little bitch because Im too afraid to say this to your face. Im too scared it will completely end our friendship. Because although you kicked me when I was down, I still dont want you to hurt. I just want you to acknowledge your lie and apologize, is that asking for too much? Why would you ask me to open up and then claim you never wanted that at all? Especially when you know how hard vulnerability is for me. Do you not see how you violated my trust? Fuck. Youre a bitch.

FRIENDS RESPECT YOUR BOUNDARIES. friends dont lie. friends dont lead you on, only to let you down. i will never understand. was i not good enough for you? physically or mentally? was my body not suitable enough for you? like your stupid onlyfans girls that youre always mulling over? was i not easy enough for you? god forbid, you actually valued what lies beneath a womans chest over the size of her breasts, or assets.. clearly, i should have listened when everyone tried to warn me about you.. how you use women merely as sexual objectification for your selfish pleasure and addiction. youre shallow. its not your fault you couldnt meet me halfway. not many souls swim sweetly and securely in the abyss of the deep ocean such as mine. you only wanted to swim in the shallow end, and thats okay. i could never hate you. but i do resent you. for melting my heart and making me feel again, only for you to discard me and replace me with your newest supply throwing herself at you. that hurts, but not as badly as it hurts to wonder if it was ever real. to feel like this was just a game of cat and mouse. i dont take love lightly, but you knew that. so, did you not respect me, or did you simply see me as a challenge you thought you could win over time? did you just want to use me for your sexual or emotional pleasure? like a toy on a shelf... or did you just want to keep using me to stroke your ego? better yet, was i just your charity case that you felt bad for after I opened up to you? preying on my vulnerability. i never wanted to open up to you and i never wanted you to see all that you saw. irregardless, none of these things would any friend of mine ever consider. youre not my friend, and you never were. so i wont apologize. im sure thats what youre expecting and waiting for.. me to come back to you crying and blaming myself. always apologizing although its not my fault entirely.. im not sorry for giving you my whole heart and eloquent emotions. for loving you when you needed it. i will not apologize for walking away from what no longer serves a purpose in my life as falsified friends. save your sympathy.. i am not sorry for being vulnerable. i am proud. proud of myself for always staying true to myself. i promised myself to never let love, nor loss harden my heart. i will not apologize, because i gave you all that i had. i will not apologize, because it is truly your loss, babe. all my love, your bewitching babe"

Its an infinite line of unknowings. I could pick and choose what I want to believe in, or where to head towards to but... I will have to accept either way that I might not have the complete truth of things on every side of the dice. All I know is that I feel immense regret for what happened. I dont know why I pressure and expect myself to such a high standard of getting over it already. I mean, I didnt know this would affect me so deeply. Its only normal that it takes a long time for me to come in terms with the pain of the past. It doesnt matter how long this takes for me to get past through actually. Because its my own path to walk from. I truly need to learn from this, no matter how many trials it takes me. No matter how much I keep falling back down, I want to learn how to love properly. I keep asking myself what is love? And why am I attracted to you? Back then, it was no question when youd just be in front of me. Like a lightning struck me and I just knew. And I just felt. But still, Im looking back and I just think that maybe you were simply a catalyst in my life. Maybe youre not meant to be with me. You bought up really deep core wounds I never thought I had. In your eyes, I felt like I was one with you, like I had seen my self in you. A vulnerability that has been shattered and dismissed at a very young age. Almost like I had found my own innerchild again, someone Ive forgotten long ago from neglect. I dont wish to put you in such high regards off from that, as I used to put you on a pedestal before (due to my coping mechanism to escape from reality) and it didnt do anything for us, rather I felt further away from you. I guess I would say that before you, I lacked a bit of general empathy, not that I am exceptionally immune to feeling other peoples feelings, but just always felt separate from others. I wonder if this is due from a lack of mirroring from my caregivers. I dont really understand it either. I dont know what is it in you that mirrors me and that makes me feel vulnerable and seen. But I took that belief far off from being realistic and useful. I just became more defensive and distant. I forced myself not to fall for you, not to talk to you, not to look at you. So I pretended like I didnt care. But the more I didnt talk to you, I could never truly get to know you. The more you entered in my dreams, the more Id portrait you as an illusion in my head. I wasnt aware of your relationship with her. I was never attentive, just clueless and oblivious. Ashamed. Never asking questions. Living in my own world, not letting anyone in. Hell, that was my problem. To be honest, I guess I was jealous. But again, I wasnt aware that I was because I would just shove down these intense feelings for you. And I didnt really care who you were with or whatever you had with people, I didnt want to seem desperate. But the more I hid myself and my feelings, the more I carved in to my own stories. The more I became possessive in a passive-aggressive manner, more monstrous by daylight. I assumed so much. And I was selfish. Selfish. Selfish. Selfish. Selfish. Selfish. Selfish. Selfish. Selfish. Selfish. Selfish. Selfish. I just wanted you all to myself all suddenly. And thats just pure codependency and a lack of self-worth. I was insecure. I had no clue where I was going. I projected you as a godly-like figure when you were a demon from the start, well realistically, not in a bad sense. Just a contrast. Youre not perfect. And so am I. So why did I constantly put myself in a position where Id feel below you? Where I wouldnt be able to talk to you just like any other human being? Where you deserved to be heard just like any other too. I feel ashamed of how ignorant and inconsiderate I have been with you. My insecurities has a long way to go. I have to unlearn a lot of the things Ive learnt, to integrate a new, healthier belief system. I always felt hidden under the shadows for some reason. And I thought I could remain silent and invisible for as long as I wanted to. But what happens when there are people who are willing to open their doors for me? Will I just shut my own door out of fear? Sometimes, I feel like a bad person. A bad friend. A bad lover. A bad student. A bad child. And thats from a lot of shame. Sometimes, I dont speak up because I think that Im worthless, therefore none of my words matter. I assume that people dont care, so theres no reason for me to explain myself. But again, its all in my head. Wow, I sound so negative and depressed. I think I might just be too hard on myself. I think I have just been mistaken again."

I know its impossible for me for me to have actually been in love with someone I never really knew, but that doesnt stop my feelings. Even if my love is pretty broken and is for someone that wasnt real, it still feels real. To tell you that even after all of this time, I still dream of you. We never met in person but we talked for years. Even still, a person who I never met wont leave my dreams. I want to ask you why my subconscious cant seem to let you go. I wonder if you maybe dream of me? I used to wonder if you thought of me, but this text answered that, I suppose. Many times I also wondered if what we had was real? Or if you couldnt bring yourself to tell me the truth because I wasnt worth it in your eyes or because it would stop me giving you what you wanted. Worse than that, I wonder whose fault it really was. Mine? Yours? A culmination thereof? Did my paranoia, vulnerability, insecurities, and difficulty trusting ruin what we had? The more I ponder it, the more I realize that fault doesnt matter. Because even if I was right, I was still blind to what was really between us. Instead I saw only what I wanted to. I was blinded by hope and desire for what could have been. Even if you did violate my trust and our intimacy, lie to me, lead me on, and let me go on as I had, or even if you didnt..... I still believed the truth I had come to find. 9 times out of ten I still believe it. You did those things and wont even be man enough to own up to it. 1 time in 10, though, I do believe you. Maybe its because I want to believe you. That Im really the one to blame. I want to believe youre better than that, I mean more to you than a paycheck and a good laugh, and that youre the one for me. Once we learn our life lessons and learn more about who we really are, that we could be what the other needs in a partner. Unfortunately, none of that matters because what we had is irreparable. It matters not by whose hands it was destroyed. Theres no way to fix this after what happened. Trust cannot be rebuilt when decimated by something such as that. We both know I rarely trusted anyone as it was, and without trust, there is no base for love. Some days I read through the letters on here wishing that I would find one from you. Recently, I realized I would never even know if it was you or not. How could I? Even if it somehow matched our story, I wouldnt be able to recognize your username. Hell, you even told me that you never were much of the emotional type and that you kept everything to yourself. Why would you put it in the internet for display? I really wouldnt know if I was just being hopeful and naive. I never really knew you well enough to guess if it was you or not. Lets say I do text you. Would you want to know I was safe and leave it at that? Would you want to try to be friends? We were good at that part, you know. Would you tell me I was wrong? Or that I was right? Would you tell me that you missed me? That you love me still? That youre over me? Would I fall subject to my indestructible hopes that we could have been something more? That we could be the unstoppable team who loved and grew together? That we could be the heroes we want to be and help others along the way? Would all of these hopes even matter when I never really knew you? No one knows our story but us. Not even the people who read this. Hell, neither of us even knows the whole story. We only know our half: what we heard, read, said, saw, felt, and thought. Moreover, I cant even really tell anyone our story. They wouldnt understand. They would only see me for the fool I am. They wouldnt be able to grasp how O felt then and feel now. Wouldnt understand why I still love the you that you played so well, even if that person never really existed. Every day that passed, I wanted to reach out to you or for you to reach out to me, but now that you have? Im panicking. What do I do? Do I ignore you? Spill my guts? Tell you to not let the pandemic guilt guide your actions and to kindly leave me be? Find some wording that shows that I care, but I cant handle talking to you because I simultaneously want you back and want you out of my life? Would saying any of this to you be helpful or hurtful for one or both of us? Was the pandemic guilt induced text supposed to make you feel better? I dont know. I just dont f***ing know."

I can hear your voice telling me your name. I can feel your hand shaking my hand. Im so bad with names! I always say. And its true. I always forget names. But I didnt forget yours. I want you to know that Im sorry. Im sorry that I was too young to realise that I caused you a lot of trouble and pain. Im sorry that I was oblivious to the fact that you felt real feelings for me. I was scared. I wasnt ready to feel what I felt for you so soon after leaving a long term relationship. You were older than me and I didnt feel good enough, experienced enough, had-my-shit-together enough. I laugh now, youre not that much older than me but at 22 it felt like it back then. Im sorry I was so self absorbed. You liked me and I liked you but you were the only one brave enough to say anything. You were the only one who showed vulnerability. I barely gave you a thing. I was never good at that but Im working on it now. Im sorry you left your fianc and it was probably partly to do with me, but I couldnt deal with the enormity and the weight of it. Im sorry if you left her because I made you feel like there was something special with me that caused you to rethink everything. We never talked about it. I dont know. But you left her and I was still too scared to let anything happen. I just put my walls up like I always do and offered you nothing. You didnt deserve that and Im so sorry. I still think about you and hope that youre happy and the person youre with shows you all of the love that you deserve. You seem happy. I wish I had the guts to apologise to your face but its been too long now. It would only drag up the past and I dont want to cause you any more hurt than I already have. You will always be important to me. This sounds ridiculous because we werent ever really anything, we just tip toed around an opportunity that I often wish we took. But its true. I like to think in an alternate reality I wasnt such an idiot and things had a chance to play out but in this reality its never going to happen and Im sorry for that."

I'm finding myself once again on the outs with you as well as our friend who I tried to confide in. It shows there's been a lack of growth on my part. Won't speak to yours. As you stated, ""it's definitely a two way street, bud. We both share some blame"". But that's your own stuff to figure out. I'm realizing I have a hard time giving all of the information to some people and maybe giving information I shouldn't to others and that's once again left people I care about feeling that I was dishonest with them. And you're not wrong. Omissions and half truths are not the whole truth I lack a lot when it comes to vulnerability and communication. I haven't done enough work on that especially recently bc when things are good and people aren't mad at me, I'm not doing the work. Guess now's the time to get back to it."

I told you what I've been working so hard to hide or ignore or supress for months. And you said absolutely fucking nothing. Not a word. You couldn't even allow me the dignity of closure. I mean, fuck dude. At least tell me you don't feel the same so I can move on. But no. My complete and total vulnerability was met with silence. Why would you do that? Do you enjoy the power trip of it? Are you trying to preserve my feelings? What does it mean?? The entire point of me admitting this all was to get some answers and all I found were more questions. Life's too short to spend any more time agonizing over you. I shot my shot. That's all I can do. You'll probably never see me again. With no due respect, you're the worst."

We have not been dating long enough for me to feel fully secure that giving my life up for you means I can restart with you yet. I also cant do long distance any longer, Im exhausted and my heart breaks more and more everyday. Thats how much I love you. So much that my heart hurts. All my mind does is think about you.... I fantasized about a life with you, I had a false belief in trust that we could be together forever. But this was never equal was it? Looking back, you always gave as little as possible. You recognized (and I opened up) that I was broken before, repeatedly so you took advantage of my low self esteem and gave me surface level love and affection so I wouldnt leave and I didnt know the difference. Im not sorry that everything happened the way it did, the fighting and the overthinking/doubt. My gut always knew something was wrong but I was too scared to be lonely. I lived my truth with you, complete vulnerability. I will miss your laugh and goofy smiles forever. However, we now start our lives in a new direction and I know that Im only going to learn more and grow to be the person I want to see. I dont know who you will end up becoming or if you will ever grow up but I hope you do for your next partners sake. Squash your pride and live honestly.

104,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,"Even when I try to voice my anger, I end up saying ""I miss you"" instead.",2,gjwwk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/gjwwk3/even_when_i_try_to_voice_my_anger_i_end_up_saying/,2020-05-15 08:43:35,"Dear \[redacted\], I hope this finds you well even though it shouldn't find you at all. All points towards radio silence as the healthiest strategy. From tarot to my friends and my most rational self, everyone seems to agree: this cant work out, and codependency, just like nicotine, is best cut off cold turkey. But emotions, feelings, pulsions and yearning seldom listen to the voice of reason, and thus I find myself writing to you again. There is still unfinished business in my heart and at the back of my brain; these thoughts will not let me rest until I put them to paper. (Well, lets be honest, its more like they will let me rest faster, but the end of obsession will take ages, anyway.) Of course, any attempt at being honest, now that it has already been established that things would not work out between us, is tainted by the unyielding hope that they, somehow, still can. That if I explain myself properly, if I can state my desires and my needs then, surely, things will work out the way I want them to. If people get to see the real me, then, surely, they will like me. It is the childish, naive hope that I have held onto all these years eaten away by depression and the intimate certainty that everything was pointless and that there was nothing I could do about it. I want to honour that hope, that coping mechanism; and thus, I am writing. Even though you will never read this once again I must remind myself, you do not want to hear from me and I have started being anxious about, well, did you really mean thank you for your message last time, or were you just polite-panicking? Anyway. I have already written to you at length about my mistakes: how I let trauma blindside me, old patterns reigniting in my brain and steering me towards catastrophe; how I didnt react as promptly as I would have hoped; how I was too impatient and callous in my panic; how I didnt manage to communicate anything clearly, to myself and let alone to you. But I didnt tell you much about what I did think of you or our relationship, beyond panicked reassurances that, oh, youre so sweet, and how could I ever reproach you anything, I really do not want to remind you of your ex!. And, of course, both these are true I genuinely think you are full of qualities, just as I abhor the thought of adding to the emotional scars you bear from your previous relationship. Yet I cannot use this fear of hurting the other to silence myself forever. It is too easy an excuse: oh, it might hurt them, so I can never say it and thus never make any progress, and blame it all on Our Issues. Similarly, I never told you what I wanted, because it took me so long to even admit to myself that I wanted anything. For the better part of the last four weeks, any thought on the matter was immediately countered with, well, \[redacted\] doesnt want \*anything romantic\*, so how dare I do so myself? There is no point. I should repress it. Needless to say that this was, one, unhealthy as fuck, two, absolutely unproductive. So, here goes nothing because this is already quite so long, and I fear the longer it gets, the less I will actually say what I mean. Forgive the lack of politeness and angle-rounding in the next few sentences. I am angry. At you, for treating me callously now and then, and at me, for letting it happen. I did not enjoy being ignored when I told you, hey, \[book\] has a really triggering scene, dont you think they needed to go that hard with the forced, public coming-out? because that part hurt me a lot, and I was sharing something that I felt vulnerable about. I thought it was presumptuous of you to go, well, my \[relative\] is a \[job\], but dont ask, cause Im not going to show you anything, like I would fucking ask to see her work in the first place and youd get to dangle the withdrawn information over my head. It is understandable to not want to share details of ones private life over the internet, but I promise there were nicer ways to go about it. The day we had that conversation, after you tagged me in the Instagram post it only seemed fair for me to do my best to explain my feelings and to answer this as fast as possible, in case youd be invested in the answer, but you bloody left me on read for two excruciatingly long hours. A simple I have read this but cant answer right now would have sufficed. I was trying so, so hard, and it felt so disrespectful. I suppose thats when I realised it was probably not going to work out at all I had made myself extremely vulnerable, and had been ignored. Then you referred to it as, our weird conversation, and that minimizing, distantiating attitude should have been everything I needed to realise you had no interest in putting but a sliver of the work I was really to put into. You're the one who put all the expectations and formality on your shoulders. I don't remember, nor did I find trace in our archived chats, asking you to initiate the conversation every day, or to let me know when you'd go AFK, or to even chat every day, or to take care of me, or Anything, really. I specifically remember telling you I appreciated those things, but that you didn't have to, several times. And I meant it. I really did. I was standing there, doing my utter best to keep my triggered reactions in check, and failing, and telling you I was triggered as you somehow kept on I found it quite ironic that you went all confidence is charming on me, when friend, pal, darling, dont you think theres bravery in vulnerability? Dont you think theres strength in softness? Didnt you see how confident I was, even as I panicked, to lay out the facts of my triggered brain? Dont you think its confident of me to show up as my whole self, no matter what? I cant help but think you have your beautifully staged pictures, but you wouldnt voice chat or anything. And you didnt owe me that, and it might be bitchy of me, but really, whos the confident one, here? If you keep your offline and online lives so separate Maybe you arent as confident in your offline life as you appear. Like, how else can one be a loner on the internet? Oh, and I can think of at least half a dozen ways to answer, Im scared youre going to forget me when the lockdown ends without lying, still conveying the fact that you are not promising anything, and yet still be remotely reassuring. To leave me with only, I cannot give you any promise felt disrespectful and a little cruel, like you were either waiting to see how much I was ready to put up with, or hoping I would get the hint and leave without you having to dirty your hands, so to speak. Of course, I cannot presume that this is what you were going for, only tell you that it is what it felt like. From that moment on, I knew I had to disengage, even though I refused to admit it for another few days. Im glad I did, eventually; otherwise, the frustration would only have increased, and I would have been unable to express it before exploding at your face, which, frankly, is no way to do things. We both deserve better. And thats also why Im glad you told me you didnt want to chat anymore. I have no interest in having, in my life, someone whose reaction to my I am triggered and cannot be rational right now is to somehow still expect me to be rational. I mean. If you thought this was unhealthy for me, as you did and knowing I was not exactly in control of what I was doing and saying why did you still wait for me to be the one to disengage? Id told you that was something Id struggled with. Ive been in your shoes before and yes, it doth suck to be the one to say, aye, youre neat, but were clearly in a weird emotional situation here and if either of us is going to get hurt Id rather not let it happen. But no. Instead, you said things like, I am afraid this might affect me negatively, like did you not care for me at all? You once said, the realisation that things couldnt work out had brought you to tears was that true? Did you really mean any of the nice things you said? The way you sounded when you said, please, do take good care of yourself. I dunno. I guess I wish you had cut it off yourself instead of letting me crawl my way out of triggered space. All those long, pointless discussions, of course I was going to try and get you to stay, because I was, in fact, in a state of panic, and you werent reassuring me one bit! I cannot begin to tell you how hard it is for me to allow myself to write, I am angry, even though its in a letter you will not read, and with all the caveats that, yeah. We both have reasons to be annoyed at the other. I have very vivid memories of my ex trying to anger me on purpose, to help me let it all out, and of me still choosing to hurt myself instead. And I suspect that the parallel between my ex and you, between your ex and me, didnt help at all in anything. We came to this with too much baggage, but Im glad its helped me realise it, at least. I wasnt dealing with the aftermath of this relationship as well as I thought I did. Im still seeing my counselor, and Im working on untangling my self-worth issues, and trying to rewire the faulty routes in my brain. Im still spending way too much of my day willing myself into not contacting you, not checking on you. (I know you were sick. I worry about you. Its silly. Youre better off without me, and you have your roommates and all. I wanted to be so good to you, \[redacted\], and I cant even tell which part of me wanted what anymore.) So, Im angry. That doesnt mean I didn't mess up, or I hate you or youre a terrible person or whatever I mean, I feel we both are kind of terrible, in our own ways, because we are both human beings. And being human is being terrible, flawed and messy. I once apologised for not showing up as my best self; I regret it now. What I am sorry for is not showing up as myself as at all, trying to smooth out my flaws and making myself more likable. Im too intense for your tastes, and thats fine. I like being intense, actually. And I think thats also why on top of being angry, Im also sad because I genuinely like about myself all the stuff that seemed to be too much for your tastes, and theres nothing I can do about it. No matter how hard I try or how I wish it wasnt so, I cant change your tastes, can I? And I wont change myself, so here we are. Alright, Im glad I got that off my chest. Theres another few things I want to tell you, though. First, I wanted to tell you about what I wanted. Did I want something romantic out of this? Im not so sure, even though it is obvious I wanted more than what I was given. I think I wanted hope and harmless fantasies; maybe I wanted the hint at something romantic, later. For now, I wanted the spark, the kinship, the emotional intimacy. I wanted to want you, I think I blinded myself at some stuff about you that didnt get me as excited as I told myself it did. I wanted to bare my heart out and peek at yours, I wanted the reassurance and the little tokens of affection, gaining your trust. I wanted us to realise we were both letting our past define us, and be ready to work on our shit together. I wanted to be there for you, because thats a way I know how to bond with people, to encourage you and support you. I wanted to be sent songs and be asked about my stuff, I wanted you to be invested, to be interested in who I am as a person the same way I think youve got a pretty face and great fashion sense, but your so-very-staged self-portraits arent what I was there for, I wanted you to wonder what laid beyond the insecurity, the weird music tastes, the tragic backstory. I wanted you to want to know me as the caring, smart, creative badass I am. And I wanted to know what hid beneath your own mask; I wanted to see the personality behind the performance, so to speak. I could already see a bit and of course, I came in too strong, I think anyone else would have been spooked but I think it might have scared you. Maybe you didnt want to be seen, or at least, not the messy bits. Maybe you didnt want me to go, oh, look, youve buried the most personal lyrics under the instrumental. Maybe youd wish Id just said, oh, I love your voice! instead. Maybe you're like me, and anyone who hints at romantic interest you haven't initiated feels threatening and scares the shit out of you. Maybe you wanted the attention and not the attachment; maybe you underestimated your level of investment sometimes it strikes me that I do not understand why you put up with triggered!me and our disjointed conversations if you really were as little invested as you made it sound. It makes no sense. Why did you say after all this, after pushing me away, why did you say, I could see our relationship evolving in the future, but I dont want this to change your behaviour? Why keep me dangling on a thread, why insisting I say no, I wont expect romance when I was desperately telling you, my attachment issues are acting up, I am not in control? That did not make any single goddamn sense. But emotions and feelings do not make any sense, as has already been established, and I can think of a dozen irrational reasons why. Maybe you didn't know how to disengage, maybe you were scared of hurting me. Maybe, maybe, maybe. There is no point in speculating. What is done is done. I do not handle unanswered questions very well, but that's a skill I can learn. I talk big, but I keep on thinking about the comics you sent me, too. ""The Right Knight"" is innocent enough, although I can twist it into ""well meaning but still going about love wrong"". ""Goodbye to Helios"" chapter 1 is all about becoming oneself through one's found family. But ""Great Abandon"", \[redacted\]. I can't not read into it. Trans person let their relationships crash and burn out of fear of showing up as they really are? Hello? Could be either of us, too! And I'm not saying that you chose to communicate through your comic recs directly. It's a subconscious thing, isn't it? But I can't unsee it. I will never unsee it. ""With Great Abandon"", recs me the person who, at the same time, reminds me once a week they will keep me at arm's length because that's what they do and aren't as invested and refuse to commit to anything (and I point out the contradiction with a lot of self-aware fondness). Well, no, you did say it once, that you could see the nature of our relationship change in the future. That you didn't want to close that door in a sea of plausible. If I had gotten the reassurance and attention I wanted, it might have been enough to keep me around. If you hadnt looked so alike with my ex, if I hadnt been triggered, if I hadnt spooked you, if Id been able to speak up, if, if, if Im so angry, \[redacted\], and Im so sad. There are two storms in me, one that rages against the dying of the light, the wasted opportunity, and the other who icily reminds me that there was no way in hell someone like you would do well in my life. One that waits for you to call me back, and one who's glad I erased your number. For me to change my mind, to say, ""well, okay, maybe this could work out now"", you would need to agree to what I've written here, commit to do better, and, like, plain like me more than what you've said, because now that I've realised my feelings were hurt, I'm sure as hell not going to pretend I'm fine anymore. But could I be truly genuine from now on, as genuine as I need to be? And I'd want you to be comfortable with voice or video chat, which you've always said you weren't. I'd want to not feel like I'm contained in a box you can ignore whenever you want, even though you are also, technically, contained in a box I could ignore if I didn't have attachment issues. I don't think it'd be possible. I'm still wishing it'd happen, because I am the eternal hopeful, and because I have never done closure in my life before. I'm trying, though, harder than before. Because, well, clearly, this cant work out. And every day I have to convince myself again. Every single day. Its been weeks. Its OK. It was the same with my ex, I know the drill. I hope youre enjoying your me-free days. I hope youve forgotten about me, that youre chatting with people who wont send you weird electro-medieval music, or wont be involuntarily passive-aggressive because they havent realised something youve said hurt them yet. Gosh, I was terrible with you, wasnt I? And you with me. Even thought we tried so hard. Right. I think thats all I had to say I could go on, but Im just writing in circles, now. I hope you are well, and can open up to another in the future. May we meet again, if it proves beneficial for the both of us, and if it doesnt, or at least, in the meantime, may we both forget the other. Love, \[redacted\]."

I cant believe how simple it was but profound. I love her. I wish I was better. She truly deserves a husband in who she truly loves.. if thats me in the future shell come back, maybe her mom will love me.. I know her dad must.. I want her to be happy, and I miss her smile. Seeing that smile literally has me happier than the last year of my life. I am extremely blessed to have God listen to my prayers. Ive been sober for so long it seems, and I had to.. I remember when I first saw her, it wasnt the mall, it was with our mutual friend that passed, B, and I wish B wanted to smoke that night so I couldve known her for two years longer. Shes proud of me, she has love for me, and her eyes show how deeply she has fallen, but Ill catch you babe.. I saw that she is babysitting, and I wish I didnt look so fucking rough. I just panicked, anxiety fucks me up so much and 3 hours of sleep doesnt help. I threw away the pack I had cause I need to quit .. for her. I dont want us to smoke cigs anymore at her back porch.. she deserves the best.. I hope she knows Im happy now, and I hope she is too. I hope she knows how to get a man to treat her .. Im proud that we have come to this end.. I told her about what I was reading. I wish I couldve talked to her longer.. but it was getting hard .. I wanted to hug her, I wanted to smell her hair, I wanted to smell the perfume she put on, and I only had coffee in me and I wish I couldve been happier, but you show me that Im worth it, and Ill be happy one day.. Im so relieved.. shes gorgeous with no makeup , thats my wife. I know shes good. She unblocked me, but Im giving her time and space to do her life to the fullest because maybe she wants that from the conversation but I know her well enough to know she wants more. Im fully in love with her soul.. I hope she never changes. Shes going to get all she deserves from me InshaAllah. All the words I said I meant, and maybe Ive fucked up a lot but we were young and still are, but now success feels like this woman is what I need for the rest of my life. I have to be stronger. Im so busy with work, but Ill make the time, and I cant drag her into it.. I need to manage. I missed a big meeting about my career today and its cause I felt her presence as if she needed me.. but yeah Im always here with her in her soul.. turns out Im still good and theyll let me stay in Atlanta. Im staying for you S. Youre my everything baby. Show me your vulnerability. I tried showing mine today and you saw that love. I hope shes happy. Im in love with her flaws, Im in love with how beautiful our children would be, and how much our family would always be close. I hope you get the best sleep tonight, I know I will. Dreaming of you is a sign that Allahs given me telling me youre my other half. Im going to get closer and closer to you and now I know youre in love with me S, and you heard me say the most special words Ive ever spoken in that moment, Im in love with you thats forever babe. No matter what. Im never going to find a love like you. Thats damn sure. You remind me of home. God Im all butterflies, and love and Im so grateful I know your the love of my life and its mutual without the need of a title. Its a bond thatll forever grow no matter anything. We took so much time apart, and its still better than ever before. This is true love. -AC"

We used to be in love. I cant put into words how much i still think of you everyday. I have made a sick habit of making you my first thought in the morning and my last when i go to sleep ,wishing you were here to hold me tight . You were my first love,the first boy who ever loved me and thought i was enough for once. The first boy to ever get me a flower. Remember? It was 8th march,6 years ago. Time flies by so fast. I still remember the first time that i saw you. I could sensed that you were starting to fall for me. But my messed up brain wouldnt let me have it . I always thought i was unworthy of being loved by someone like you . You have to understand that after years of bullying,i never in my life thought that i could feel so much happiness. I am sorry for the person i was. I was horrible. I lied to you . You were the first person to be there for me when i was sick. So when i felt you pulling away from me my messed up brain somehow made it reasonable to lie. So that you would show me you care again . My parents pressured me into leaving you as well. I just snapped,i was horrible. This is not an excuse ,i am owning up to my mistakes. I have been trying to be better ever since you left. And you did the right thing leaving. I wouldnt have changed my ways if you didnt. I needed help. You were so lucky,you had and i hope still have ,a great family who supported you and loved you and amazing friends. For as long as i can remember,loneliness has been there. My parents rarely met me on a neutral ground and my whole life ,home was unstable. I am trying to break the cycle,P. I am trying to be better to everyone around me and better to myself. I am still very ashamed of myself and i like to think that i have done good on healing my issues and starting over. Over the years i got to appreciate you more ,you know that? And the pain it causes me is even deeper . What we had is actually pretty rare to find,ive come to realize that. I wish we would have worked things out. I still love you and i still think about you even 5 years after we broke up . Im starting to think i might be delusional . Dont get me wrong,i loved each and every one i have been with ,but there was no one else who got me so well ,who could make my heart skip a beat . I havent told anyone this yet,but i feel when you are going to be in a place. If im going out or to the one of the places i used to see you and you are going to be there ,my heart skips a beat and its like its getting charged with electricity. I read somewhere that our bodies can learn and recognise certain energy patterns. I thought these feelings were worth fighting for. I saw last summer at the festival in our hometown. I dont think you recognized me ,granted i didnt want you to . I wore a hat and sunglasses the whole time ,my hair was dyed and my body was much skinnier than you remembered. I was with a group of uni colleagues. One of them asked you for a lighter ,it wasnt until you approached and replied to him that i recognized you.I could not believe my eyes you were there so close to me,yet so far. Ofcourse,no one else did because they dont know you . I keep this story locked away in my heart. But i dont want to carry it like a burden. I tried different approaches ,but you pop back everytime. Because i am starved for your touch,kisses,hugs. No matter what i do,you will still haunt me . Every time i travel to some place new,you are the first person i wish i could tell,when something good happens,i wish we could celebrate together. I could go to the ends of the earth and i would stilk not be able to shake you . I dont even want to,because if i do ,then i have nothing left. The last time i saw you,i didnt even try to talk to you or see you . I respected your decision of never seeing me again. I thought i was strong. See how much ive changed? Two years ago ,at the same festival i saw you again . You didnt even acknowldge me and it hurt,not even greet me until i did so . But you talked to my then boyfriend. You asked him how he is. You dont know that,but i cried that night. You asked the guy who had the heart to leave me after 3 years for his bff how he is and you didnt even look twice at me. Even you yourself said he didnt deserve me. We've been going in circles for so long and i hate it. It drains me so much. If you still felt the same ,i wish you would talk to me and open your heart to me . Or at least give me some closure. I know that in the past i based my happiness solely on our relationship and it was wrong. But its been 5 years. Dont you see i have changed enough? You have changed also. I so wish i had the opportunity to start over. Over the years,i wish i was there for you in your sorrows especially. To share your happiness. To show you i am much more than what i have been . If you still feel the same,i am waiting for you to reach out,because i am afraid. You thaught me to be afraid to show my vulnerability,you thaught me to not put my hopes and happiness solely in love. So please,if you feel the same ,let me introduce myself again. Lets start over. I dont want to spend my life without you. You were everything i was looking for. I am really looking forward to showing you the me i should have been all along. Love."

Every time I am sad, you make me feel ashamed for my feelings and say I am always complaining. I know youre not the type to multi task but I ask you to spend more time with me and youd rather sleep because youve spent all day running errands or working with your dad. Every night I wait for your phone call, but you are too tired to dial me and in the morning when I ask, you say you fell asleep or you were tired and needed rest. I try not to get upset and understand and not talk much about it because it already happened and I cant change last night but in the beginning, you gave me so much of your time. I know things change because were getting older but your life style is still the same. You use to called me even when you were tired. You would call me at the time you said you would. You didnt want to sleep without me, you would share music with me, tell me you miss me during the day without me telling you first. We would eat together, watch movies, make jokes and dance, agrue but you knew how to make things right instead of pushing me to the side, say hurtful things enough to make me cry. but I feel like this is all fading. Weve been together for 5 years and you think what youre doing is fine but this routine has come to a point where I feel like you are getting too comfortable with the way youre handling our relationship now, you forget I still need and want those things because you are not physically here with me even if you dont need them or feel like doing it or because you cant make time. you tell me youre not perfect but you make mistakes but You use to want to know eveything about me, and now that you think you know everhing about me, you use my weaknesses against me even if you dont realize it. you think you are right when you yell at me and Im quiet but its only because I know you dont take rejection well or criticism so I sit there feeling sorry for myself and asking why did I even start this? Now he hates me. I blame myself... and every time I cry, you watch me and listen until my tears are dry. Doesnt it hurt you too at all to see me have nothing to say anymore but break down because I just cant take it anymore? I asked you what does it mean to put me first? And you said it means you call me after youre tired, truth is. after you get into bed and sleep for a couple of hours you then call me but sometime tell me you fell asleep. And I do believe it all. I feel your sadness You get when I dont want to have phone sex with you because you give me this look on face making me feel like I can never satisfy you because I said no and when you leave to do whatever after we have phone sex, I feel used and abandoned. When I open myself up to you vulnerably, and send you paragraphs after each, you reply small and make me feel worst that I ever said those things to you but only out of fear of losing you because of the way I feel... and you never try to make me feel better or compromise with me how to make things better for me. I know I should take care of myself when youre not around but I cant help it if you said youll do this for us and not follow through. You use to tell me to stay with you, and you use to say things will be alright. Now you tell me to leave you alone, fuck off or to leave your side if I hate it so much and this happens so much, I started to believe this is just who you are and if I love you, I should learn to live with it. but I dont want to live knowing you dont see how you treat me. You think I am overthinking things but you are a different person now and I dont think you see how hard it is for me to adjust to who youve become. and I still love you but Im more aware of who you are. now You know how to wrap me around your fingers and make me feel sorry for feeling all of this inside me. The worst thing is, I cant even tell you all of this because I fear you will explode, say I doubt you, make me feel bad about myself. Tell me to leave you. Instead you dont take the time to understand, wow this is what my girlfriend is going through. if this is how I make her feel, what can I do to let her know I care about what shes going through. But you dont. You reply with oh, or you dont reply at all. you dont ask me, what can I do to make you feel better. What is it that you need from me? What can I improve on? Im sorry you feel this way, Things will get better. I wish you would ask me these things, because these were the things you use to say to me when you dad would force us apart, when your family threaten me, when everyone didnt want us together. now that no one is involved in our relationship, you have really shown me who you are and how you handle my vulnerability. Of course there are times where I am happy, we talk about our future, family and kids and places and its only because you have talked me out of it all and made me believe you and say that I am only overthinking things. At times I know when I am overthinking things but other times I know I have a soft spot for you. Things werent always this way. You say I lack trust and understanding but god knows I have trusted you and understood you more than I ever have these 5 years. I love you but I know you wont change."
108,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Exposure,1,gq7inp,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/gq7inp/exposure/,2020-05-25 18:48:21,"My psychologist said that if I stayed away from that site and stopped reaffirming my feelings for you on it, that I would eventually move on. Shes wrong. At least, so far. Its only been a week? Or something like that. And yes I didnt choose it, the site is down. But its never been down this long. Anyways, I still think of you every day. I mean it doesnt help that I can hear you sometimes. But I think I would think of you anyway. I feel so...pent up. Theres so many feelings and thoughts that I would normally get out on that site but I cant now. Honestly, I dont think that this love is going anywhere. Youll never hurt me so much that my love would be overshadowed by betrayal or pain. So it will just stay there, with or without you. Its a waste of love. Its sad. Its weird how important that site is now. It was my only real connection to you. Thats why I could never leave. Otherwise, its a horrid site with lots of negativity and garbage. You cut me off in every way you could. I bet you wouldve changed your number if you could. But I think that you still have that love with you and it bothers you. Cant squish it out of existence huh? Anyways, the reason for writing this letter is something I was thinking of today. Based on what I know and have experienced with treating social anxiety and OCD, the same principles hold true for many fears. You have to face the fear. But gradually and purposefully feel the discomfort and unpleasant feelings when you dont practice your safety behaviours. Am I completely wrong or can you apply this to trust issues? I guess youre afraid of feeling vulnerable and the negative consequences of letting someone in? They leave or lose interest? And with me, there is the reinforcement of your fear because I left in the past? If she did it before, she can do it again? Hmm, with every undertaking of this kind, they say to start out small. What seems like a manageable way to start working on your trust issues? (I am assuming that you are not already working on this. I know that you might be, and that you might be seeing a therapist but I figure you only see them once a week if that and its probably talk therapy right? Even if you did work on this with a therapist it would take months and months to get anywhere. But I hope that if you think it would work and you have the money that you consider that option) From what I know, its best to start small. So maybe choose a person you trust fairly much and share something about yourself that would make you feel slightly vulnerable. After you share it, dont distract yourself. Just sit and wait and feel that unpleasant feeling. Then try it out with another person whom you trust. Maybe the same tidbit or something else. Just feel the squirmy vulnerability feeling. Ideally, you would do that as many times as it takes for you to notice a marked reduction in the unpleasantness of the feeling. You could choose a person that you trust less or a tidbit that is even more unpleasant to share (something more private or risky feeling). The key is to get LOTS of practice. The more you do it, the safer and less unpleasant it will feel. If you dont mind it, write down each instance when you tried this and how it went and how you felt afterward. This is important for tracking progress and it reinforces the therapy every time you look at it. But dont write it down if the hassle keeps you from actually doing the therapy (learned that the hard way). Anyways, I hope this gives you ideas on how to go about working through your trust fears. If you can find a therapist to help you, even better. The good thing about a therapist is they keep you accountable. Even if life gets tough and you lose motivation, they keep you on track and boost your motivation to keep trying. And hopefully one day, youll work up to your highest fear: telling me your feelings. I know I sound selfish here but it would be good for you too. To get it out and see if something could come from all this. I will be waiting. Dating when youre me is impossible. Everybody has boxes to tick and well I dont tick most of the boxes for anyone (I am being accurate here, not pessimistic or whatever). I hope you are safe, well and as happy as you can be. I hope youre enjoying the sun and the heat. I hope you think about me at night and it arouses you. You can bet I do. (For some reason Im smitten physically with the main character of Valeria (Netflix). Her moans are next level. I want all the sex scenes to include her lol. Obviously Id much prefer you.) P.S: I also was thinking today about something else. If Fifty Shades of Grey can get published (and that writing is just insanely atrocious!) and every celebrity and their brother can get their random memoir/life advice book published, you can too! And your writing would be leagues above all the crap I just mentioned. You could get a book of poems or short stories published too (Im saying that cause that friend of my mom published a book and more recently a book of poetry.) P.S.S: that is all. Im going to get ready for bed and probably watch the last episode of Valeria. :( Im really liking this show, its like sex and the city but with more likeable characters. But with the same devastatingly awful choices haha. Good night. Sweet dreams my love. I hope I dream of you tonight, instead of deep water, sharks, disturbing situations (kids being caught and tortured ? ( yeah wtf)), plane shenanigans, very bad driving that should lead to a crash but never does and (the good dream) a play I have to do for school that consists of a diverse group of people meeting in a restaurant and having fun. I try to prepare it so I can write the play because I think its so good (remind you of anything?) and the world needs to see it. I wake up and cant remember even a third of it lol."

I guess I am more afraid of being hurt than being lonely. This world feels like a pack of wolves ready to swallow me whole at the slightest vulnerability. Without you, I feel lifeless. I wish you were here. To tell me not to let things like this get to me. To encourage me. To uplift me. I wish I could hear your laugh or see you smile. I wish I could take you to the one place you always wanted to go ever since you were a little girl, but died before you could do it. I told myself at my worst moments I would keep living in order to go to that place. And even though I don't have your ashes, maybe in a way, I could bring your essence. You didn't deserve what happened to you. I know you wouldn't be too proud of who I am today. I am trying to get better but I don't know where to go. It feels like I have to choose between protecting myself or setting myself free from the burdens life has stacked on my shoulders. I'm so lost right now. You always knew how to help me forge a map towards growth and strength. I miss you so much."

Weve gotten super close super fast. Going out all the time, sharing all our secrets, crying and laughing and drinking and loving. I was so vulnerable with you. For a while, I could feel myself just be me with you, look into your eyes and slip in your arms and be in a safe spot. Then the first incident arrived. You cheated once. I thought you understood it was a mistake, thats what you said. I cried and cried and cried. I was broken. But you were there for me. You stayed up from super early in the morning to really late at night caressing my face and my hair to make me feel okay. You were with me everytime I cried and that I had a panic attack. I never felt so hopeless before, but you were there. Little did I know that things didnt change overtime. You kept telling me that it wouldnt happen again, it was a mistake, you were tired of lying. I believed you. I loved you. I probably still do. But the situation just got worst. You had to stay to work longer, wed text less and less, I could feel you becoming distant more and more. I knew something was off. And something was off, and it was, but you were too much of a coward to tell me. I knew it wasnt normal. But you kept telling me it was fine, that you just needed space. You werent well and happy, everything wasnt going too well in your life. I tried to respect that and trust you... why did you have to do this to me. I trusted you, I believed in you, I was proud of you and trying to be as supportive as I could be of your projects. I was always there if you needed me. You were my priority. My heart is aching so much. This morning, I miss you. My heart would want for things to go back to normal, but I know how toxic that would be. Plus you probably hate me for how things went. But you know what? F*ck you for isolating me. Making me cut off some friends, take off Instagram and snapchat. F*ck you for making me feel bad about my masturbation and my sex drive. You where f*cking having sex elsewhere. F*ck you for that night that you forced me to masturbate in front of you and to cum without me wanting to, without me being comfortable, to the point that I got sick and puked. F*ck you for lying to me, over and over and over. I gave you so many chance to tell me the truth. You couldve just told me, but youre too much of a coward and youre too scared of being alone. F*ck you for telling me about kids, mariage, long term, love and vulnerability when you had no intention. F*ck you for all these wasted nights that we spent working on our relationship while It was all bullshit. Ive spent so much money in therapy because of you. F*ck you for all the anxiety, the panic attacks, making me depressed. Theres not a single morning where I wouldnt wake up feeling like shit, like something was wrong, like I had to run the fuck away from you. But you knew how I felt about you and you used it. I was so f*cking stupid, it hurts. F*ck you for having a negative impact on my grades, on my family, on my friends, on my self esteem. F*ck you for lying and cheating and... just being you. You deserve the worst. F*ck me for letting you do all of this."

Will you remember? Will you even care? Looking for a spark. Thats how you drew me in because our need for a catalyst, appreciation, effort, vulnerability was shared. Little did I know how badly me being vulnerable with you would wound me. I blame myself, and not you. I knew better than to let my guard down. I told you repeatedly that this was all chemicals and new romance energy, and you declared that it was your feelings and that they were true. I fell down the rabbit hole with you, and I shouldnt have allowed myself to love you. I told you that I am always the one leftover in the end. You told me repeatedly that wouldnt be the case this time. You looked forward to making memories with me. You reassured me that you were in it for the long run. Your so-called bold statement. Was everything you told me a lie? Was it all in my head? Was it all pretend? Was it all just so that you could sleep with me? I should have tasted the dishonesty all over your breath as you kissed me. Thats when the slow fade began and you found yourself to be so busy. I am such a fool. You wouldnt tell me that we were done despite me repeatedly trying to give you the easy out. You said that you needed to think things through and things were slightly overwhelming for you. Did you mean it when you said to take care? Did you mean it when you said that I deserve the best? When has any of this ever been about what I want, truly? Just let me fucking love you.

I thank the universe for really showing me that no matter how long you know someone, at any moment it can all just change. Youve taught me I need to trust my instincts more as well. If Im gonna be honest, what you did shook me to the core  despite my anticipation of you doing something like this. Youve never been good at seeing others succeed while you let your failures fester. Yet I was always there for you. Im going to spend the next, last year of school succeeding. Regardless of how much youve done to shake my spirit, it will only strengthen me. With Karma. p.s.

I know what youre really doing, and while you think you might have me fooled, its a thinly veiled attempt. You should know, we will never be friends, and you will never get me back. Most of our relationship you were contrived and calculated. There were fleeting moments of sincerity, but never willingly. Those moments of genuineness and vulnerability drew me back in, and you learned to use that against me. It was manipulation at its finest. You are one of the most selfish people I know, and yet youre so good at projecting, you actually made me feel like I was the selfish one. You embarrassed me by criticizing me in the most shallow ways. You were so desperate for validation and power that you had to drag me down to feel in control. You hated my success and my confidence because you felt threatened by it, so you tried to knock me down to your level. I never judged you and I did my best to make you feel safe, so you could be yourself for the first time. But it was not my job to fix you, its nobodys job but your own. I hope your emotional maturity has advanced by now, but Im not willing to find out if it has. You managed to make forgiveness truly unattainable from the most forgiving person there is. You may wonder why I let you remain in contact, instead of blocking you out of my life. Im not one for revenge, but I cant help but feel satisfied knowing that youll never get over me. After all the pain you caused me, all I have to do is live my life happily to know you are filled with regret. Regards, Your ex PS. If youre reading this and think it might be about you, seek therapy."

I am learning to accept that sometimes we really do need to experience the immeasurable pain that comes with losing what is most important to us. Sometimes that is the only way to really see something for what its worth, to truly value it and view it from an outside perspective without emotions and attachment distorting the lens through which we peer through. Some of the most valuable lessons in life can only be learned through experience. The past cannot be changed but that doesn't stop me from continuing to wish that I had learned these lessons before we met, that I had learned them at the expense of a less meaningful relationship with a lesser man. You came to me with so much vulnerability, eager to trust me with your heart. I know I did not handle it kindly. What I regret most is not learning how to get a proper grip on my mental health before allowing you to take a leap with me. I would have treated you the way you deserve to be treated. The most agonizing feeling is having the knowledge that the pain I caused you could have been spared with just a little more action and self-care on my part. I am learning to forgive myself because it is essential, but you must know it doesn't come easy. I hope you no longer assign blame to yourself for our demise, you must be kind to yourself. I fully realize that by not practicing true self-love I allowed myself to become co-dependent. By not seeking proper treatment for my depression and anxiety I allowed myself to become controlling, overly critical, and argumentative. I find that men often base their life-satisfaction and self-worth on their partner's happiness in a relationship. You mustn't allow yourself to do this, you were and still are so very perfect. I am the only person who is responsible for myself and my actions, it was not your job to fix me and it certainly was not your job to be my emotional crutch. You were the most extraordinary partner and companion I could have ever asked for. You are everything I could ever want and more. I have never felt more bonded to a human being, we have the type of connection that people spend their whole lives in search of and rarely ever find. We have always been so compatible in so many different ways. Each of our personalities challenges the other in the areas that demand growth. We share enough interests and beliefs to nurture the deepest of friendships while simultaneously complimenting one another with our differences in a way that creates constant excitement, wonder, and intellectual conversation. I could never get tired of getting to know you, growing with you, or experiencing life beside you. We have the type of partnership that makes individual success inevitable. We are each incredibly driven, passionate, and eager to learn and when combined we are truly a force to be reckoned with. I know deep in my gut that I will never stop loving you. I have gotten to know your soul far too well for that to ever be possible. I respect you deeply as a person and I know we have something worth fighting for. We fell off track for a little while but what successful couple hasn't? How can we blame ourselves when we are only human? I want you back, if you will still have me. We aren't the same people as we were before and I would like to give our relationship the chance to evolve as well, but while in a healthier headspace this time around. I gave you a second chance two years ago and am now asking for one in return, but only if your gut is telling you we're worth it. I miss you deeply and always wish you nothing but the best. I hope life brings both of us pure love and sheer happiness, regardless of whether or not we carry on together or apart. I love you. I am in love with you."

I dont know what is truly behind your silence or irritated short responses but it feels as though it is directed squarely at me. You claim that its how you are. Its you, not me. So clich. Ive made many wrong guesses at this point; its embarrassing. I thought you considered yourself an incel of sorts (you are NOT one). Next up was my assumption that I had poked a hole through that impenetrable wall of yours and it spooked you. I tried to calm your fears and the anxiety by sharing my own vulnerability, in the rain, like a fool. Were SO different; how could I be that important to you? The self-centeredness of that particular assumption makes me cringe and grosses me out. The past few months have made it feel like we are some of the last people on earth. Us driving through deserted city streets in search of daily takeout. Me stressing over things that are outside of my control. You talking me down. Apparently Ive made some twisted crisis-bond to you and the combination of this bizarre circumstance combined with this hot-cold maneuver of yours has pushed one of my buttons. The bright red one in the back labeled deep-rooted attachment injury. I know you didnt do it on purpose but others have pushed it before. I recognize the pattern now and I should know better than to continue giving this anymore of my energy. You are special to me though so I will.

You deserve to laugh with nothing holding you back, and to love fully and completely. I cannot take those things away from you. I will not. So, I exist in a living hell. I have been fighting so hard for this family that I have nothing left. I lit myself on fire to keep all of us warm. I am ashes of myself, yet I am still burning. I dont think it could have gone any better way though honestly. I did what I had to do. No body else was going to, so I dont have any regrets. I would do it again. I dont believe it will help to try to fix myself with medication or therapy anymore, because this situation will always be broken... yet, I cannot leave, because youre here. Youre here with your big eyes, small hands, jumpy feet, cuddles, hugs, empathy, humour, curiousity, playfulness... and your huge vulnerability. So I am here. I will be here.

Like when I saw you laughing while I was telling you about plans to go away with you and saw you were making fun of my childhood abuse. That should've been enough. I put up with it bc I liked you and was falling in love with you and a person like me doesn't have a lot of self-esteem. Then we almost got it. I got messages from your ex where you said you hated it here, me, it was a mistake to break up and you'd rectify the situation in six months, if you could afford a ticket to Portland. Looks like you could. You lied about so many things than blamed my mental health for it all. The important things you f'ed up. I tried to kick you out. Break up with you. You refused to leave and said we were made for each other. I didn't know this was a time limited relationship. You'd be going back to the ex after six months. This was just to punish him. So, now, I'm a junkie again. I won't draw it out this time. I'm tired. Bored. Blown it too often. Don't feel like getting into a place of vulnerability again.

120,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,To the man that never felt loved,3,gu24sd,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/gu24sd/to_the_man_that_never_felt_loved/,2020-06-01 02:33:17,"You won't like what I have to say. I'm sure you've already made up your mind about me - the partner that I was, and the relationship that we had. If it's anything like the disdain and hatred you expressed that final night, I can understand your anger but it is definitely not justified. You made up your mind to see yourself as a victim in a loveless relationship, however, I think it's important you remember certain events to help better balance your perspective and, hopefully, learn from it. I endured severe distress numerous times through our relationship. You have pushed me, shoved me, twisted my arm, choked me, broken things around me, invaded my privacy, and belittled me almost every time I brought up the fact that these acts had been damaging to me in some way. Even that very last night, you belittled my defensive reaction to being given ""a little shove."" You never took responsibility for the emotional damage you caused when these events happened. You were abusive in other ways too. The throwing my phone across the distance M.O.? You'd practiced it before in Orlando, and you did it again that night. You say that you don't remember what happened in Orlando, well let me remind you: I wanted to leave. I told you I would buy a plane ticket, asked if you could take me to the airport. We fought and screamed at each other. You were angry and I was angry. You stopped the car in an unknown neighborhood and demanded that I get out, knowing full well that I had no idea where we were (I don't think you did either), no other transportation, my things were at your friends', and we were a 4-hour drive from home. When I didn't comply, you got out of the car, walked around to my side, opened the door, snatched my phone, and threw it across a stranger's lawn. You did the same with an extra pair of shoes I had there with me, then pulled me out of the car by the arm while your child cried in the backseat. Your behavior that night was abusive. You think that because you reached out the following day (after I had to take an Uber to the airport and sleep at the airport until my flight departed, the following morning), that that makes it better? That it shows some initiative to extend an olive branch? You consider yourself the martyr for taking the initiative to fix what you had broken? For putting the responsibility of your outbursts on me by saying that I ""made you do it""? This victim complex that you've developed is wrong. You apply it to everything, not only our relationship. More than a dozen times, you spoke of being abused at the hands of your parents - hit, or neglected, or simply being treated unkindly as a child while they paid more love/attention/interest to your sister. They denied your accusations every time. You also speak of the world being unjust with you, of the police picking on you. Dear, you were rightfully arrested all three times. You weren't getting picked on. You were being punished for your behavior. That you continued to break things around me when we fought, after I had voiced more than once how this was triggering for me, was abusive of you. That you said, and I quote - ""this table that you like so much, that you want to be perfect? Here you go"" before punching a hole into the cement table we used to have in the living room is abusive. That you picked up my vape pen that final night and mockingly said ""awww look, it broke"" is abusive. In your fits of rage, you purposely destroyed or tossed things that you knew I needed (my phone, the keyboard and notes on my desk that time at the studio) or brought me joy (the table, the pen). This has been going on since before we even started dating. Remember the new year's party? The moment that you stepped out of the bedroom and told that guy to come in, to fuck me because I supposedly wanted him? I shoved him aside, opened the door and called out for you. Literally shouted out your name. I thought you were going to come back. You said you'd be right back. I didn't even know that you had sent that guy into the room on purpose until days later, when my friend told me exactly what you'd done. I thought he had just snuck in on his own, like some slimey guy taking advantage of a drunk girl. But he was in there because you told him to meet me in the bedroom. You didn't want your on and off partner at the time to know that I was there with you. Every time I tried to bring up that night, because I still can't make up my mind if what happened was rape or not (I think I do know but I'm ashamed to admit it), you shut me down. You told me to forget about it, to let it go. That our relationship couldn't move forward if I continued to hold on to that night. So I let it go. It was the first abuse from your part that I simply let go. I don't want to place all the blame on you, and I don't want to say that I never hurt you because that would be a lie. We hurt each other plenty of times throughout the relationship, but for you to walk out of this believing that you were the only one that hurt throughout it, is an insult to the abuse I endured at your expense. I don't hate you and I'm not angry with you. I want to close this chapter and move on with my life. Despite what you believe, I did love you more than anything in the world. I built up resentment toward you when I felt my love grow and yours diminish. That's why I told you I didn't love you sometimes, in the hopes that it would wake you up, make you realize that love needed to be maintained, not just expected. You laser-focused on that, but you never acknowledged the love I did give you. Moving in with you when I wasn't fully ready because you gave me an ultimatum, sacrificing my career to work with you when you told me that it hurt your feelings that I was job hunting instead of working with you, helping your business succeed and grow, trusting you with the purchase of our first property together, helping you be healthier, taking care of you every day at the hospital and the days you were in the wheelchair, spending every day with you, cooking for you, dressing up for you, going to therapy with you, sacrificing friendships for you, giving the relationship chance after chance after chance, were all acts of loving you. I saw a future with you. I wasn't always 100% certain of it, but I saw it. I saw a child with you. Someone to inherit our new home. You know these things because I brought them up, more than once. When I felt the relationship falling apart, or you growing distant, I asked for more time together. How could I not love you, but at the same time express worry that we weren't giving each other enough love, that we were neglecting the romance in our relationship? We were busy. The busiest we've ever been, probably. I asked you more than once to coordinate together so that we could have at least one day to ourselves, to rekindle the flame. I told you, if we couldn't go on the cabin getaway that we had planned a year before, we should at least have one day together. One lazy day to be with each other, to love each other, physically and emotionally. I can't ask for these things the amount of times that I did and at the same time not love you. You've hurt me, throughout the relationship and especially on the last night, more than anyone has hurt me in my entire life. This isn't an exaggeration. I've cried over us every day since that night. I miss you so much. I gave up everything to be with you, as you wanted me to be with you. You took everything I gave you for three straight years and, in one night, set it on fire. You've left me with literally nothing. No home, no business, no savings. You know you fucked up, otherwise you wouldn't have gone into my Google account to delete the videos from that night. You didn't want me, or anyone, to see the person you had become that night. Like I said, I don't hate you. I'm hurt by you. And despite your belief that I ""don't have feelings"" (you literally laughed when I told you that you were being hurtful that night. Do you remember that?), well, congratulations. You found them and you destroyed them. But I'm taking this experience and this relationship and growing from it. You made me experience a level of hurt that I didn't know even existed. In a way, I'm grateful. Instead of rebuilding the walls that you helped me tear down, I actually want to remain open, exposed. I finally experienced the pain that I spent my entire life, and every relationship, trying to avoid. Now it doesn't scare me anymore, and I can apply this new confidence, vulnerability, and optimism to future relationships. Thanks to you, I'm not scared of getting hurt anymore. I wish you the best. Thank you for everything. I love you. - D"

I have never felt I needed to be someone I wasn't in order to receive attention. I have never felt a desire to take away attention from someone else. I have never felt my likeness for attention was something more, something deeper, something more *sinister* than how I saw it then until you scraped your black light of abhorrence over who you think I am. My flaws are plentiful to me and up until now they *certainly* had nothing to do with you. I am a self-aware person. As a self-aware person I am also certain of my identity as a strong, confident woman. Weeks after you raised the curtain on your true feelings of who I am to you, those words tap danced all over every thought that ventured to approach center stage *Your need for attention is a problem.* In my swirling, unrelenting preoccupation with who I now say myself as, my Grandma called. Like a hypnotist with a desperate patient I became undone, despite her nimble tenderness having no motive. *I like attention I can't help myself, that's who I am*.

I miss your energy. I miss your brilliant mind. I miss your stories. All of them, because you tell them so well. I miss sharing drinks with you, and passing hookahs and vapes back and forth. I miss your laughter. Even the laughs you have when you bust my chops. I miss your teachings; about this company, our careers, life, and the world. I even miss wondering if you were truly listening to my stories, since you interrupt them so often with your excitement and zeal. But deep down, I know that you were. Especially since you started taking my advice, following in my example. You have no idea how happy it made me to know that I had an impact on your life beyond the walls of those hotel rooms. I miss our musings, our talks. I miss those the most. Switching constantly between the deep and the philosophical to the stupid and the mundane. But there was never a moment between us that was stupid or mundane, was there? At least for me, it never happened. I miss your passion, and seeing how mine affected you so. I miss your touch. On the outside you like to show toughness, an untamed nature. Tough, aloof, untamed, a closed book. You are all of these things. But your touch, it shows an entire different side of you. With me, you are also tender, open, sensitive, and most of all, vulnerable. And I am with you too. You reached a deep level of vulnerability in me, peeled away at layers and walls most aren't even aware of. And I let you. I let you in such a short amount of time, in so few instances. That's one of the things that amazes me the most. How were you able to get in so quickly? I felt a connection to you almost instantly. We shared a bond that was beyond the physical and obvious. There are very few instances in my life where I've fallen asleep being held or holding someone, prior to you. Cuddling, I hate it. I enjoy my space, and knowing that I can move easily and freely as I please. Literally and figuratively. Yet how many nights have we fallen asleep without holding one another? Right now, I can think of none. And in this restless night that I write this, I cannot stop thinking of that one night in New York City. I was restless, and riddle with anxiety. You put my head on your chest and held me in your arms. I couldn't sleep and kept you up, as I have in times before. Yet you held me. I was stjbbong and wanted to push you away so I can lay squirming in my anxious restlessness, deep in my negativity. But you held me there, and I felt safe with you. I've always felt safe with you, and I miss that. I miss all of these things. Every single moment of the handful of fleeting nights we shared. It was clear from the beginning that this was to be temporary. And I never could have imagined from our first night that I would end up feeling this way. I'm not even sure what it is I feel. I've told myself that I can't fall in love, we can't allow that. I'm not certain if this IS love. The only thing I know for certain is that I have to feel all of this from afar. Be whatever I am to you from afar. I know that this will pass and all of it will end, just as every splendid night that we shared. But for now, I miss you."

I said this last night, but deleted it. I didn't like my approach. But when I say this, I'm not just speaking of me. I'm speaking for all of us. The one's you treat the way you do on a daily basis. The one's you employ to force the bullshit. You do need us. You need our time, strength, money, resources and our ideas. You're incapable of formulating an original idea of your own. You asked if it was right to consume someone else's idea if you have the funding to do it and they don't. The obvious answer is no. It's not right. But whatever. We won't go that route. The mere audacity you have to proclaim such a statement along with the whole we don't need you is just mindblowing. It really makes what I've said seem so watered down. Obviously, you needed me for the past seven years. You wouldn't had been a thorn in my side otherwise. You need people like me to do the work cause you don't know what the fuck you're doing. While you're pushing paper, we're pushing rocks. It's not the same thing. Funny thing is these dipshits still rely on you so much when they don't realize we already do all the work. You do nothing. You can't even market shit properly without marketing it as your past endeavours as if the past is the best you'll ever do. In some cases, that may very well be. But don't ever confuse who needs who. We don't need you. You do need us. We can work together, but I don't think that's what you want anymore. You just want slaves. That's why you thrive on our vulnerability. Like a woman trying to get something from a man, you know the softer side of our psyche is easier to manipulate than the war side. I said it long ago when I talked about Japan's music and the vast majority of their lyrics. I see the world you're building. It's quite disgusting. You're disgusting. I understand so much now and I also understand it doesn't have to be that way. Sad part is I don't know who's side I'd rather be on. I know what logic suggests. Then I look at them and I think of all the bullshit once said about treating the janitor like you would the CEO and I don't see it. You should be as grateful for their work as we are for the opportunity and yet, there's no respect there. Never has been. And that's why you have to work so hard at figuring ways to manipulate the masses. The truth would set you all free, but it terrifies you to think of a world that actually exists on cooperation. You're fearful that somehow you'll gain less by being so. Maybe, but you never tried either. You told me the truth, it wasn't all bad. I laid down my arms for a better solution. It could have gone so much worse. I'm beginning to notice a pattern throughout history. Even when we thought we were at our most free, we really never were. I don't know what to do. I'm not even sure I want to participate on either side. I think I'm still bidding time. I know you're gonna end up creating an unnecessary war. That I do know. Before you achieve your ultimate goal, there will be blood shed and lots of it. And I definitely want no part of that. And maybe there's perks to it all. I can certainly see how communication is a willing sacrifice for obedience, just look. It's not all bad there. But we all know the truth of the matter is you're scared your throne will be taken. Maybe you dont deserve your throne. Did you ever think about that? There's always someone better no matter how talented or smart you believe yourself to be. Even I'm aware, but I give credit where credit's due, you don't. That's the difference between us. I do treat the janitor like I would the CEO."

132,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,"""...And I'm grateful for that.""",8,g2cre3,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/g2cre3/and_im_grateful_for_that/,2020-04-16 20:53:29,"Here we are again.. Except just like our love this time around, this pain feels thicker. It feels harder to breathe, harder to find purpose, harder to move forward. Ive avoided music like the plague these past two days. For some reason, I just cant bring myself to enjoy any of my music anymore. But one song Im listening to as I write this is Hill by Sleeping at Last. Im not going to lie, as soon as I pressed play, it knocked the wind out of me. I hope it isnt too much of me to ask you to listen to it while you read this. I dont really know where to start.. Theres so much I want to say to you, this might be enormous. I suppose Ill section it off like this: I want to apologize sincerely to you for the parts that hurt you most. I know every Im sorry was a stab, as you once said, so I wont torture you with listening to empty apologies anymore. What I will do is own up to everything Ive done against you. 1. I couldnt let go of X the first time around. I was emotionally unavailable when we met, and I dragged you through my heartbreak with me because I didnt want to do it alone. I used you to help me move on from someone and made you feel lesser than in the process. You never deserved it, and I couldnt see that because I was blinded by my own egotistical needs. I am not asking for your forgiveness, I certainly dont deserve it. 2. I cheated on you. I could go through my reasons on why I did it, but none of it matters. The unfortunate fact is that I did. No amount of sobriety will change it. No amount of time will change it. There will always be a 2 second kiss that happened where I put you second. I knew firsthand the damage that cheating could do, and I made my choice regardless. It was the most disrespectful thing I could have done to you. Im not asking for your forgiveness, I certainly dont deserve it. And I do not blame you for not wanting to forgive. 3. I jumped into a relationship when I told you Id wait for you. I was too ashamed to be alone and self-reflect on all the pain I put you through. So I took the easy way out and distracted myself and left you alone to pick up the pieces of the mess I created. I pushed myself to forget about you and I didnt care to own up to anything I did in the past. Do not forgive me for this, instead take pride in yourself for not putting up with it. 4. I fueled every insecurity you had. I made you feel worthless and impossible to love. I used leaving you as a threat. And the hardest pill to swallow is that I did all this sober just as much as I did it drunk. I could never forgive myself for this, I certainly dont expect you to. I failed as your boyfriend in making you feel secure and adored. I failed as your best friend in listening to your needs and being dependable. It goes without saying that you deserved none of what I put you through. Hindsight is 20/20, but regardless of this, if I truly cared for you like I always claimed I did I would never have put myself in a position to lose you. It always amazed me how you would say I would go through hell to bring heaven to you. I think its time you rephrase it in favor of yourself and stop giving me unfair credit. You are the one who went through hell to bring heaven to me. I hope someone shows you what real heaven is like one day. Youll love every bit of it and it will feel freeing. I want to thank you for so much. You came into my life and changed it for the better in the short time you were here. You once asked What do you even like in me? What made you choose me? Why me?. Let me finally answer with gratitude attached.. 1. You revived what died in me 11 years ago. This is tough to write, but it deserves the number one spot. I could never thank you enough for this. You re-energized the kid in me. You put me back in touch with my vulnerability and my warmth. You made me fall in love with life all over again. As much as you despise it, you showed me true compassion. All this I tried to shove down with alcohol and bad relationships and self-destruction since that one night when I was 15. I will thank you for as long as I live for this, even if it was short-lived. 2. You restored the trust I lost in myself. I always thought I deserved the short end of the stick all through life.. But you swooped in with your own sunshiney vibes and made me feel like I was better than that. You took your time with me and made me believe I was worth more than the self-sabotaging life I was leading. You schooled me on how to keep a promise to myself. You encouraged me everyday to be better than I was before. You made me want to be sober, for me. How could I ever thank you proper? 3. You loved the thing that meant the most to me; my family. I cannot begin to express how much of the love I have for you that grew from this. You showed up for each member of my family with sincerity and respect. The biggest part of this pain is feeling like I have to take that away from them and you. I have always meant what I said.. They are your family too. They see you as theirs. This will never change no matter what you and I go through. Do not think for a moment that you continuing to love them is disrespectful to me. It only confirms that I made the right decision in making you the first girl I wanted to introduce. My sister sees you as a sister, my aunt sees you as a niece, my mom sees you as a daughter. No amount of time or distance or blood will change this for them. If you make the decision to part ways with them, they will respect it. However, they will also in the same breath remind you that any time you feel alone in this big world, you have a small family here. 4. You accepted every part of me, even the bad ones. You embraced every flaw of mine effortlessly. You knew I was capable of change, and even if I never did change, you loved me anyways. You upheld true, unconditional love for me. It was always overwhelming and deep. You were dependable, trustworthy and real. You held my hand through some of the toughest moments of my life, and you made sure I never felt alone through any of it. Your love was unlike anything Ive ever experienced in any relationship I have had, and I could never be grateful enough for being given the opportunity to receive it. You were my best friend because you wanted to be, not because you felt an obligation to me. You were always proud of me. I have so much more to thank you for, but I want to keep this short. All this stuff you taught me.. I feel it fading away. I think youre taking it with you as you go, and thats okay. I want to just be thankful for you and all the lessons you taught me these past two years. I want to be grateful for the insight Ive gained from you. You showed me my soul and what its capable of. Thats why it was you. Thats why it will always be you. I think Im supposed to know how to do this, but honestly I dont. I never have known how to do this. I dont want my things back. They were never mine to begin with, they have all always been your things. Ive been sleeping in your shirts and your smell since Monday. I cant muster up the courage to put them (or any of the gifts you gave me) away. I honestly dont think I ever will. I might make it to owning my house one day and I will still have your sticky notes posted on my walls. I still have this typewriter that Id love to send you, but I dont know if youd just be angry at me for doing so. Ill hold onto it for you. I wish I could fly up and see you just one last time.. One final touch goodbye to send us on our ways.. But I know this is unrealistic and you will never want it. I will make do with every memory of your touch in the meantime. My first instinct is to finish this by telling you Ill wait for you.. But I know I've done enough damage here and my time is up. Just as you said, I respect you too much to drag you through any more pain. There is love in holding on, there is love in letting go. I ask you to promise me one thing.. Do not look for me in other people. I want you to find someone better than me. Someone who can give you everything I couldnt and someone who is more gentle with your heart than I was. I meant what I said.. More than I want to be back together, I want you to be happy. You deserve every good thing life has to offer and every chance to never sit still. You deserve your fantasy wedding and proposal (hopefully you dont get another Slytherin), you deserve patience and warmth, you deserve stillness and peace. You deserve someone who calms your mind, not make it race. You deserve security and honesty. You deserve to never feel afraid to be vulnerable and compassionate. You deserve a new playlist. You deserve someone who will take care of you. You deserve someone who will show you a world I never could. Someone who takes their time with you, someone who makes you feel unafraid. Someone who can handle your energy and your need for space. Someone who understands you better than I ever could. My eyes are loaded with tears and Im carrying every precious memory weve made as I move out of the house we made a home. I cannot promise Ill ever stop loving you. I cannot promise Ill ever stop holding out hope that we return here. Truth be told, I never will stop hoping as long as Im alive. But I can promise that I will respect you enough to leave you alone from now on. That doesnt change that I will always be here for you, I will always be your number one fan, and I will always cheer you on from the sidelines when you arent looking. Should you ever find yourself alone and in trouble, the key is under the mat. I value you, I respect you, I cherish you, I will never forget you. I like you R. I love you R. \- J **Ill always love you cause we grew up together. You helped make me who I am. I just wanted you to know that... there will be a piece of you in me, always. And Im grateful for that. Whatever someone you become, wherever you are in the world: Im sending you love. Youre my friend til the end.  - Her**"
133,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Goodbye for now,6,g2heqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/g2heqk/goodbye_for_now/,2020-04-17 01:47:38,"We had been orbiting each other for years before I finally manned up and asked you out. I always had a feeling that we had to happen some time, and now was finally the time. On our first date we were both amazed at how much we had in common, we both expressed how this was like dating someone exactly like yourself. Your drinking rivaled mine, all your jokes landed perfectly, we agreed on everything and finally kissed. We went back to my place and had sex like animals, like we had to compensate for all those years of absence from each other. You kept telling me how you always wanted to see me. How all your friends were happy about this finally happening. I felt the same thing. I kept asking and you kept coming. I never fall for anyone, but now I was falling. I began exposing a flank to you I didn't even know existed anymore: an emotional vulnerability that gave you power over me. And why not give you that power? No way this would come back to hurt me. I knew I was right about this. This had to happen, it had to be written into the structure of the universe somehow, how could we back out from this perfect match? A very dangerous thought, but difficult not to entertain when you're wrapped up. But I almost immediately sensed that you were slipping. I don't think you even knew yourself, but I could feel it. Our communication started dropping a bit. You were just a tiny bit shorter with me over text. Then one late drunken night you told me that you were incapable of falling in love with anyone. ""So am I"", I lied back. You were relieved, I was disappointed. I was hubristic enough to keep pushing. I kept telling myself stuff like ""You'll come around"", ""girls have told me this before"", and ""I am usually the one who backs off in the end"". I tried everything. More contact, less contact, more jokes, less jokes, more drinking, less drinking. I even gave up. I stopped initiating, told you that it's okay to back out if you didn't really want this. You came back to me for a while after that. I was happy then. But even though you came back, I could sense that you had changed. You weren't enjoying it anymore, you were merely attempting to enjoy it. And I honestly do believe that you tried. I think you wanted to fall in love with me, you just didn't. The day you left I told you that I hope you're right about us. And that I'm wrong. ""So am I"", you replied."

Now I'm right back to drinking way too much and hurting. Im so goddamn tired of crying. You pulled away two weeks ago and just treat me like shit anymore. I wish I could be spiteful and mean to you but I can't. Im a fucking doormat. I thought you were different. I guess I should be thankful for the lesson. You will be the last person that ever gets to see my vulnerability. You continue to just be okay, meanwhile it's 7:30 and im on my 3rd beer for the day. I had given it up, then you hurt me and im right back drinking again. I cant blame you for my coping mechanisms, thats on me. I just wish you'd be honest. Sad part is i would take you back if you'd say the word. Im fucking weak. I loved you so much that I forgot what hating myself feels like. All I got is this goddamn lonely love now. Thanks for that."

It took you about 2 seconds of opening up the first time we talked for me to drop the guard I had up for so long. The way you looked at me, the way you asked a question and I knew you were genuinely interested in an answer. We burned so bright, so fast. All I wanted to do was make you happy and walk with you through your turmoil. I still don't quite understand why we seem to be at the end of the road but you should know some things. You're a phenomenal person. I know you don't always see it but you're one of the most caring, selfless people ive ever met. I love these things about you because it brings me out of my shell and makes me want to do better. Everyone sees it, even now. I still love you. I don't say it anymore, but I do. I tried to play it off the first time I said it, but I did mean it. I knew that early on. I might have been half asleep when I said it, but I knew. When you told me you weren't a safe bet, I told you that you were a win for me regardless. I meant that, too. I spent years getting over my ex and I never thought I would meet someone again who would get me like she did. I showed you all of the skeletons in my closet and it only strengthened our bond. You showed me that I'm still capable of loving and exposed a strength I didn't know I had in me. I'd take a bullet for you based on that alone. You reminded me that I'm human. I'm sorry you're hurting but you're too hard on yourself. Your past isn't something to be ashamed of. You've overcome so much and I'm genuinely so proud of the woman you are. You kissed me last night and I didn't see it coming. I didn't mean to take it there but I couldn't watch you cry and not try to comfort you. I only left after the fact because I didn't want to wake up today and feel like I took advantage of your vulnerability. I'm not even sure you remember doing it. I'm trying to be a good friend, but I miss what we used to be. Maybe you do, too and I'm just a stubborn fuck. I know I'm crazy and intense, but our whole theme for the year is not watering ourselves down. I'm not apologizing. I don't understand what's happening but you're my favorite whether we work out romantically or not."

I was riding a high after speaking to you back to back for 3 days straight and enjoying the silliest shit youd say. Sometimes I wonder why such a small amount of days became significant for me, is it just a reflection of how equally exciting and painful dating is? Is it a small hint of the amount of healing and progress I still have to do with my own heart, mind and soul? I was ecstatic to meet you for coffee. You laid on your history and details of yourself, and then somehow I end up taking you back to the place you had your first panic/anxiety attack and then I took you home, only to find out the next few days that you did not know whether you wanted to meet up again because you are going through shit, but I was a really cool chick. I had dug my grave not knowing what I wanted or what to expect from what seemed to be a mutual understanding a casual meetup. My bad. I guess I projected my hopes and excitement onto you expecting something to blossom. My past relationship left me a bit broken and the general confusion in my life along with the birth control pills I was on did not make my spiral into this rough patch any easier, and then a pandemic came along, leaving me isolated in my thoughts with no other methods to escape other than dealing with them. I wished you the best as you told me you were dealing with a lot, and I havent stopped. its a topic worth visiting a therapist for, but I have not managed to get you completely out of my head. Ive tried reading multiple articles and methods of detaching myself from what happened, and learned that I am not meant for these meaningless casual hookups when I am a sucker for cuddling, hugging, kissing, and showing affection. I guess Im a fucking romantic at heart. I dont know if Ill ever send this letter, but I did draw you. Call it my catharsis, but before meeting you I was not been able to pick up a pencil and draw for myself, and art is my life. I finally did. I decided to draw you with elements based on one of your tattoos that stood out to me. I want to be able to give it to you and show my vulnerability with nothing to lose. I wouldnt expect you to understand the drawing, or the emotions behind it. You might even destroy it, or you might just be repulsed by it. Id like to think your sensitivity towards what happened after our encounter means youll somehow appreciate it, but who really knows. Ill never understand why or how you had that much of an impact on me when you were in my life for a millisecond. You were one grain of sand in the entire hourglass that shattered through the walls, and now Im learning yet again how to pull myself through and put myself back together. Who knows if youll ever vacate my thoughts, but for now..thank you. Thank you for that empathy when I couldve been ghosted, and made to feel even less when I was down."

I had thought the darkness, was fear of being alone, making a mistake. I close my eyes again as I realize my error in judgment. The darkness is those things but it is more. It is vulnerability, you have to be real with yourself in the darkness. You can not hide from your tears from yourself when you are alone at night. As I look at my companion I realize my second error. In my mind I though that she lived in the darkness and would be a good guide, I missed that she did not want to live in it. Life had happened and she ended up here like me. Sometimes we end up here by choice and sometimes we don't have a choice. I turn her, taking both hands and interlacing the fingers. I thought she was giving me strength but we are really giving each other strength. Her side would ebb and my side would flow, her side would flow and I would ebb. I watch the light trade between us. Together we could make it out of the darkness, alone we would perish in the darkness. The magic part of the darkness was revealed in her cracks. In the darkness, your light comes from within, you can no longer hide your cracks. Most people look at their own cracks and tear themselves down. They see them as flaws. I only see the beauty of then. Those things that make you uniquely you. All I can see in the darkness is her beauty. I'm entranced by it. It captures me and pulls at my soul. She can see all of mine and I can see all of hers. I am completely vulnerable. In the light, you wouldn't see those cracks, the light within is cloaked by the light without. People stop being their real selves in the light because they feel protected and able to mask undesirable cracks. I know now we are in this together and I squeeze her hand a little tighter. How precious a person she is. If only she could see herself the way I can see her. We turn and keep moving in a direction, unsure of where we are going on the darkness. Our conversation is about our cracks and how we got them. Sometimes there is sadness or embarrassment but we share openly and completely. Together with the lion and horse in tow."

I was a little too eager to go into a relationship. I had never been able to date due to strict parents so I was ready to find my one and only. I was in love with the idea of love. Being naive and inexperienced I had no clue what was in store for me. You made me feel special and drew me in when you opened up to me about your failing grades and sad childhood. You knew exactly what to say to make me want to fix you. Because you listened to my advice I thought I could help you. I felt like you saw me clearly like no one else did. You made me feel understood when you listened to me in turn. For the first time, I felt as though I had connected with someone. I cared about you so much but little did I know was that you were only faking vulnerability to draw me in. You exploit a girls caring nature and you know that using your bad past will make them want to change you. When you saved me that one time, my naive and hopeless romantic self thought it was a sign that you must be the one. You were my hero that day. Things could have gone horribly wrong for me had you not come to get me. I felt this sudden attachment to you and trust that I still to this day cant explain. You went out of your way to go help me and so I thought that must mean you cared about me. I thought I knew guys and the potential danger (to get hurt) that came with them. I was so very wrong. You acted like I was the only girl you liked and you told me so. I should have known better when you flaked on me with those carefully thought out excuses. But because I trusted you I gave you the benefit of the doubt. I wish I never met you because without warning you suddenly disappeared from my life. Ignored messages and 0 explanation. I invested so much into you only to find that you hooked up with another girl and started dating her. I thought I meant something to you but I guess I was just one of the many girls you were lying to. I found out about that you know? That you were talking to several girls at once making the same promises that you never intended to keep. You also told them the same stories about your past hoping to garner the same sympathy. I was nothing but a side hoe to you. I know there are other girls who have gotten hurt way worse than myself. But as someone who has never dated before nor experienced a connection this hurt me so much. Well Im writing this to say Im want to be done moping over you. Im hoping that Ill find closure by (not actually )sending you this letter. While Im still sad when I think about you, I plan to learn from this experience. I wont let my guard down so easily anymore. Ill make sure the next guy invests in me and me only. I wont settle for anything less than what Im worth. Baby I just wanna let you know I wont be your side hoe anymore.

I knew you for all of an afternoon but you left a lasting impression on me of beauty in everything of how wonderfully diverse the world is of genuine happiness even in the face of adversity. Never before have I had a connection like that with anyone. I told you everything there was to know about me with a total unrelenting honesty, vulnerability. I didnt feel the need to impress you, you made me feel normal again. You opened up to me about your dad, about your life. You were part of my Lourdes miracle. I will never forget that day. The Skye the feeling you gave me the tears we each shed outside that top church. The hug we shared that we both needed. You helped me that day, more than you could ever know, that day in August 2018 I vowed to turn myself around. Well, I did it! I owe it to you. I met you almost exactly a year later on the bridge. I wish we had more time I never even took your number I wish for all the world I took your number.

Writing this, I cant know how we ended. Were we ever truly together, or was I the man of honor at your marriage to someone else? I dont know if you are reading this with my taste still on your lips, or straining to remember someone you havent seen for years. I hope I died in your arms and that we loved each other passionately until the end, but, whatever the facts leading to that end, I want you to know that in my final moments, here was the truth: my thoughts were of the peace I found in the warmth and scent of your embrace, my last breath was filled with the light and longing for more of you, and I was filled with gratitude and joy for the experience of knowing you so intimately. I loved so many of your individual qualities, and still the sum of how I felt about you was so much greater than all your awesome parts. I loved you like a clich, and yet it felt like I had stumbled on some new revelation. In gooey pop-song ways: I just called to say I love you? In indie hip-hop ways: I been thinkin bout forever? I had daydream fantasies for years of marrying you and that alone freaked me out, and left me wondering what the hell was wrong with me. I wanted to run from the intensity of these feelings, and often compensated by being superficially uncaring. Or just caring enough. I loved you till the end, and I loved you for a long time before that. For so many of the years we spent together I tried to be cool about iteverywhere I turned it seemed like I was faced with choices that just exacerbated one terrible situation of my own making or anotherso I spent those years making no real choices at all. If I died regretting anything it was not having the clarity, the bravery and the strength to move past my fears years ago and to step with you into the light. I think you know many of the reasons why I felt paralyzed. A tremendous sense of love and responsibility to the people in my past, along with my inertia and ability to disengageallowed me to simply let life be filled with the accomplishment of my obligations as opposed to my desires. I suppose it was justifiable to sacrifice my own happiness to this, but it was wrong and unworthy to sacrifice your happiness to this. I should have let go or found a way forward sooner, and I pray that at some point you found it in your heart to forgive me and stepped forward with me into a new day where our love was unshadowed, and fully inhabited the wider world of our lives. I remember the first time I realized you were special. Not just super smart, which was obvious from the jump, not just interesting, which was clear even from your personal profile, but special in a way that made my heart pound. It was probably not more than a week or two after we started emailing and texting each other. I think we were talking about your interest and background in writing, and poetry in particular. I made some throw-away observation that, strangely, all of Emily Dickinsons poems can be sung to the tune of The Yellow Rose of Texas. Thinking about it now, I just feel embarrassed it was exactly the kind of glib and superficial remark I would have said so many times before in an effort to appear clever; trying to SEEM interesting, as opposed to BE interested. Just an empty comment in the moment, but in response, the next day I received an email from you that was a thoughtful, well-researched explanation of why this seeming coincidence was socomplete with a discussion of the sub-set of rhythmic schemes that informed the early Americana of folk tunes like the Yellow Rose, along with a sympathetic portrayal of Emily Dickinson as a poet who might well have known this and embraced it. You were beautifully direct and clear as always in your communication. NOT didactic. NOT showy. Just a lovely person taking the time to be interested in an idea, sincere enough to engage with a person, and brave enough to take mea stupid boy who was just looking to make an impression on a hot chickseriously. A shining, graceful, generous thing to do. And it made meunworthy and dishonest mestop my selfish headlong needy rush for a moment and SEE you with a sense of wondrous foreboding. As in that moment when the Grinch tried to make sense of all the Whos starting to gather in their stripped and empty town square to sing. O, be careful  shes really, deeply, *good*. Perhaps I should have been careful. I should have tried to be good myself. Perhaps I should have left you alone. But I wasnt careful, and I wasnt good, and I chased you ever more mindlessly because my soul started its whispering as I read that email and I am NOT sorry, because in that quiet realization I first saw YOU, and my heedless, thoughtless, careless heart found a purpose, and a meaning, and a partner. I tried almost without ceasing to follow that truth; in my broken fashion you were loved and cherished and always seen with great empathy. You were seen when a panicky psychological state of flight response left you almost unable to hold a conversation on our first date. Even in my confusion and exasperation I found you adorable. You were seen when you were nervously determined to keep your top on the first time we fucked. Even though I was bewildered because I couldnt understand how you could be comfortable enough to have intercourse but not comfortable enough to take off your bra, I was touched by your vulnerability and I loved those perfect tits ever afterwards. You were seen when you told me in a matter of fact voice about the betrayals of people who damaged your trust and your faith and your psyche, even though when you first told me these things I refused to see how my own behavior continued the pattern. You were seen when you told me in a quiet, resigned voice that you were pregnant, and you were seen when you told me in a quiet, determined voice that you were going to go through with the pregnancy. Even in my panicked, secret despair, I found the idea of having a child with youOUR childunbearably exciting. You were seen when you naturally stepped into the role of motherhood with a thoughtfulness and a calm competence that was the essence of grace, and even when I dramatized the limits, you unquestioningly made room for my presence and my role as a father with a directness that lighted my path to the possible. You were seen all those years when you wanted me. Even though I was so unworthy of the loyalty and devotion of someone so good, that lovelike bringing something long buried to the surfacecalled forth in me an answering determination to be my best self in loving you. And so too, you were seen when you stopped wanting me; sad enough, brave enough or maybe just tired enough to move beyond the call of our promise. Here was my last great challenge in the story of meeting the love of my life: to both want to lovingly hold you for myself, and to want to lovingly free you, even from myself. Only you know how our long, complicated story ended. So much of my lifes energy was given to things I now know didnt matter, but youcomplicated, flawed, amazing, beautiful youmattered more than I could ever express. Your name was my meditation on meaning, my prayer of hope. From the moment I met you I loved you for my lifetime. If you are reading this, I have stepped out of times earthly flow And now I love you forever."

For 13 years, I was firmly rooted in my comfort zone...until you came along and took me outside of it. I willingly went with you because my gut instinct was telling me to give you a chance. Im so grateful for you coming into my life, and for giving me an opportunity to see what is outside of my comfort zone. Because of you, I am now staying well outside of my comfort zone, despite temptations to retreat back into it. Vulnerability was a huge lesson for both of us. We both learnt that a good relationship is where both parties are comfortable with being vulnerable with each other. I had never experienced vulnerability like I did with you and I am grateful for this. We got to the point where we could have been more vulnerable with each other, yet it scared you. You felt so emotionally exposed. You couldnt continue because you hadnt healed from your trauma and you didnt have a healthy relationship with yourself. Nevertheless, you taught me so much about vulnerability and I will be forever grateful. You taught me so much about love than you will ever know. Because of you, I learnt love is magical, scary, vulnerable, soft, patient, safe and worth the risk. You were unable to receive my love because of your trauma, and whilst I am heartbroken, I accept this. I know you care so much for me, and that is the most I can get from you. I never thought I could love someone as much as I love you. For the first time in 13 years, I was able to say I love you to someone other than my family and friends. The pain I am currently experiencing has taught me that loving you was completely worth the risk I took. Im not a fan of pain in general, but I am truly grateful for this pain because you taught me its okay to love again. Because of you, I learnt more about trauma. I learnt more about my trauma and why I tended to behave and think whilst responding to situations. I learnt to think twice before acting. I learnt to think about why I was thinking or I wanted to behave a certain way. I learnt to unpack my trauma and to move forward from it. I learnt not to allow my trauma to sabotage myself, and most importantly what I had with you. I began my healing journey approximately 5 years ago, and you were the mirror I never knew I needed. You were one of the final pieces in my healing journey, and because of you I am a better person today. I sincerely hope what we had has taught you how to start healing from your trauma. I am so very grateful for this, particularly for when you shared your trauma with me so I could understand you better. Embracing my queer identity was yet another huge lesson I gained from you. I adored the way you embraced your queer identity and its helped me to embrace mine in my own way. It also helped me to re-invest in myself. It also helped me to connect with the queer community where I consider myself lucky to be a part of and to have gained beautiful friends. As a young child, I was taught not to show my emotions in both home and school environments. I was also taught not to be so emotional in relationships. I thought not showing emotions was brave. For so many years I was scared to be emotionally open. The last 12 months, I learnt being emotionally open was indeed brave. I was scared to be emotionally open with you, yet you saw me. You validated my emotions. You were soft and present with me. You taught me that it was okay to experience emotions. Being emotionally open is also an important part of vulnerability, and I learnt that from you. I am so grateful for you. You are undeniably amazing and intelligent. You are one of the most beautiful humans on this planet. You deserve the world. You are so worthy of love and magic. You have so much potential. Thank you for being you. Forever grateful for you, sunflower x"

I was able to spend it with an amazing friend. We just hung close and talked. Spent the day among the ocean waves, the trees and each other. Our discussion was wide and diverse flowing from topic to topic. We challenged and grew as the trees we walked past. Shedding our masks as easy as the bark of the tree. Taking time to smell the flowers and enjoy the small moments. Finding perches among the cliffs we gazed at distant islands and ships that slipped by, thinking about what is possible. Each stop giving us time to adjust and slowly wind a thread around our hearts. There is a connection between us that cements our friendship. We found truly magical places to share with one another in nature and from within ourselves. We exposed regrets, sorrow, heartache, each sharing in our vulnerability. Each expressing compassion and kindness. Each accepting the other, building trust that could weather any storm. There was a sense of peace that radiated from us that even the animals had no fear of us. They would stop and look. We watched the sun paint the sky with all the colors in a crayon box. It was glorious to see and share with one another. It paled by the color for your eyes, the fire in your hair rivaled the sun. For no matter how beautiful the sky was my eyes only saw you. It has been a long time since I have felt as special as I did today. I felt seen and heard. I felt loved. Thank you so much for giving me such a day to cherish. It means so much to me."

Ive only experienced granted lover. I never Learned to love anyone. I always thought it had to be automatic. Ive learned to love two different people recently. R, thatll never change. You stuck with me When everyone, but Wes , gave up on me. I was even at the point to where I gave up. You were persistent and never gave up, even with the withdrawals and shitty attitudes, you kept pushing. You got me healthy and continued to show me the better things in life. It was me that gave up on you. You didnt deserve that. Your positive attitude and stern love saved me. Thank you so much. Im sorry that I wasnt the friend that I shouldve been. Yet, somehow youre still texting me and making sure Im ok. I can finally tell you That Im good. I appreciate you. Im sorry I had to let you go. I was trying to do right and I just ended up hurting you. It was a lost cause and shouldve never allowed myself to back track. All it did was clear a bunch of what-ifs out of the way. I had good intentions, but I allowed myself to be affected by someones elses uncertainties.

Actually, I should be thanking you because you scared me enough to seek help. In just two short days, everything has flipped on its head. I want you to know that Im diagnosed BPD. It developed as a result of living with a narcissistic mother and an environment where I was constantly told I wasnt good enough. That combined with vulnerability, voila. What I did was a result of me having extreme abandonment issues. When you said you didnt want me, it sent me overboard and just made me cling to you more. Because in my mind, I was convinced that meant you were going to be gone forever. Im not going to make excuses for my actions, I let them get the best of me. And I became someone that I hate. I owe you an apology, and a big one at that. All youve done is care about me, and I was too blinded to see that. And thats not okay for me to do. I hope youll see this and maybe youll reach out, but I understand if you need your time and your space. Youre my best friend and I miss you. Im sorry."

After our separation, I have been reflecting and thinking a lot, and I couldnt shake the feeling that you were in a constant 30 day free trial when it came to us, a trial that became an almost a whole year free trial. I will never know what was real or not with certainty about your actions and intentions with me, but I guess Im at peace with it, cause I 100% know what my feelings and intentions were towards you, and both of us know all of them were sincere and came from a place of pure honesty, affection and a lot lot of warmth. I want you to know, that from my side, I was willing to work things out and find a solution, as I always did, solutions such as talking with Caro and open our relationship if sex and physical interaction were an issue (which lets be honest, it started becoming an issue for you) - but, romantic relationships require two people, and I felt like Ive been doing the leg work of two people on my own for a while, and that while was a quite lonely and tiresome road. Love is something both parties work on and fight for every day, love is made of commitment and responsibility, its not only lovey dovey feelings or how much we turn you each other on (though theyre important, love expands way beyond that). I shouldve stopped, the same way you gave up on this before breaking it off, cause you checked out of the relationship waaay before breaking up, which also reflected on all of my unmet needs, needs that I wholeheartedly tried to talk through, but you werent there, cause there was something or someone else... In other hand, honesty, transparency and commitment wasnt fully there from your side either, despite your efforts of convincing me otherwise. I never told you this cause it really fucked me up back then, and I tried to suppress it and chose to listen to your words once again, instead of judging your actions - well, remember that time you came into my room after making dinner for us and you found me crying? It was cause, I found out about the messages you initiated with your mothers friend, I read through the quite stuff you and her sent to each other - while we were together and while you knew about the trip I was going to embark for us to be together. I sincerely apologize for violating your privacy, I know it was wrong, I wouldve never done it if I fully trusted you, but I guess you wouldve never cheated on me with her or your Grindr and Snapchat friends if your feelings were true for me. What hurt the most of your actions was that you still had the nerve to look at me and say you loved me every day, say I was the one for you, and even told me I should move to Europe in order to have a future together, which I was willing to do so, cause, as far as I know, you werent willing to even visit me in Bolivia. I still have that one moment of vulnerability on our last night in Palermo, when it finally hit you that you were going back to Norway, when we were cuddling and you started crying saying how I meant the world to you and how all you needed to be happy was to love yourself and for me to be near you. I dont know where that went, I guess well never know. If you made it this far, however, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart, for everything we shared, laughs, tears and fears - although I felt wronged, hurt and used by you many times, I want you to know that I dont hold any anger or resentment towards you, in fact, I wish you nothing but the absolute best. And hope this makes you realize the importance of actions and how they affect the people around you, cause you had people who truly loved, cared about you and saw immense light despite the darkness and the twisted perception you have about yourself. That being said I have decided to distance myself 100% from you (as if you havent done that already) and I really dont want nor need a friendship with you, I already got friends, who support and contribute to my wellbeing, so thank you for the offer. But on the other hand, let me just say this from the bottom of my heart; thank you, thank you for leaving my life, goodbye."

But I am also sure that I Love You. *I am so stupidly, madly in love with you*. Even after all this time. I just love you more all the time. You, I understand from our conversation last year, do not love me in the same fashion. You care about me as a friend, and I'm not upset by that as one would imagine. Instead, I am so thankful to be in your orbit that I don't mind a bit. If my love for you is served in friendship then I will still be happy I was able to show it to you. But you should be reminded of my feelings because (and I apologize for causing you discomfort) I need you to know the *whole* reason I'm scared to meet you. Part of it *is* my fear of vulnerability. That's true. But the remaining reason... is that I'm afraid of being physically near you. What if I love you more after having met you in person? What if I can't be okay just being your friend after that? What if I can't act normal around you? I know if I was having this problem about someone else, you'd give me the best advice. I wish I could tell you. Because you should know."

Intended for cathartic purposes, an un-sender is allowed to unload emotional burdens. There is no audience at the other end of the letter to respond, nor rebuttals on unfounded allegations. This can be especially true when the un-sender has unrequited feelings to the un-receiver. Ah-- the unreciprocated love story is a tale as old as time. This isn't a letter written to rehash mistakes of what could have become of two people. Projecting onto another person then expecting them to measure up to those unwelcome desires is not fair to anyone. There wasn't a future there because a romantic relationship is defined by the person who wants it the least. That being said, Poe, I didn't do my best. This letter isn't going to have long-winded paragraphs that focuses on shifting blame, exaggeration, outright lies, or self-deprecation. I resolve to accept the mistakes I made. I'm human and deserve someone who can return the love I give. It's not your fault that wasn't you. It's been almost a year since we've spoken at length, but I still honor and treasure you. Always, x"

Truthfully, took me terribly long before I asked to talk to you privately, I kept typing and deleting the message. Yet, I'm thankful that I took that step. With you, I no longer need to hide behind the facade of being strong and independent. As we moved into a time of prayer, I asked for any prayer requests and you said - ""My prayer is just for you to stop feeling this way."" Perhaps you were merely teasing, but at that moment, I felt myself falling deeper. I don't even know where we both stand.. I have been constantly rationalizing and denying how I am feeling, but I recognize that I am slowly losing control. Being vulnerable is.. frightening but with you, I don't mind.

You're so hard on yourself. You call yourself broken and you fear closeness. Is this why we're here? Because I scared you? You use to make mention that you felt that we were going fast at times and that you were scared. You often talked yourself out of us getting close, but there you were. Talking with me for hours at a time, telling me little stories about yourself know one else knew. We grew so close and then just as quickly as we grew close, you started putting up walls again. You had asked to just be friends. I agreed despite the fact knowing you and I would blur that line a number of times, which we did so often. Closeness without the risk of loss? But look at us now. You'd often get upset with me about the smallest of things. I see now that was because you were scared of being vulnerable. Your past shaped you and I'll never hold that against you. I just wish you would see that I'm here because I want to be. Because I love you. You told me once you loved me. You told me you're scared of all the power I hold over you..

I came back, but you said you'd never forgive me despite everything? That hurt more than you'll ever know. I thought we were a team. We always were, you know? What changed. Maybe I was just supposed to be in your life for a moment. To tell you that you are a wonderful person, to not be so hard on yourself. To help you realize your worth. Most importantly, to help you love yourself. I'll never know. If that's the case, if you ever chose to open your heart again. I hope you remember that you are beautiful. You aren't broken. Love yourself. Vulnerability is the most beautifully chaotic thing we have. Pain is part of love and will always be. Don't hide from it. I hope we can talk again someday. I'd love to know how you are. I know you feel the same way and want me to reach out, but not this time. If you want me in your life, it's up to you.

You said you found for favorite part about me right then and theremy heart, as you put it. I just remember you looking tired and anxious to go home, but you told me you couldnt get me out of your head. Youre not like any other guy Ive met. Youre proudly present and strong-willed with an armored heart, but the moment you let your guard down it was as if I held your heart in my hands. I love having a side of you that only I get to see, and you have a part of me too. You talk to everyone; even if you dont speak their language, you try your best. Youre so golden-hearted yet boyishly sarcastic, I cant ever imagine being mad at you. When you get angry at the world, you let it all out like steam on a train but come back running for a hug and a kiss on the forehead. I love your vulnerability and I love that you try so hard to act tough. I know youre just a softie, but its cute to see you try.

I haven't had too many heartaches in my life when it comes to relationships, fortunately. I also don't put myself out there for fear of embarassing myself either. Vulnerability has never paid me dividends. Most weren't my fault either, but there was one. Carol set the tone, as my first real attempt at a meaningful relationship, that no one would ever want me or waste their time on me due to my shortcomings. Lena probably would have but I gave up on myself and then there's you. Since middle school, I was always smitten on you. It just took that first day of meeting you after school while we waited for our ridrs to pick us up. You were in that awkward phase, about to bloom, but not quite there yet, but something about you still seemed beautiful to me anyways. You were goofy as shit and just plain acting nutty that day. I remember looking at your twin like what the fuck is wrong with this girl, but I'd be lying if it wasn't what attracted me to you. You just radiated this light. I don't remember all the ways things transpired to be, but I do remember stumbling on your grandparents house on a venture in the woods with my dog Zeus that one day. I had no idea they lived there, you were related or even that it was an every Sunday gathering. I just knew I heard kids from where I was at and there weren't too many of them in my neck of the woods, so naturally I was curious. I can't tell you how many Sunday's I would sit on that swing listening to my headphones while I waited on that green Suburban to drive pass. Just knowing you were around lit a spark in me that no one else could. And how your grandparents had accepted me even when y'all weren't there was just amazing to me. Your grandfather will always be one of my favorite people. I missed not seeing you my freshman year, but imagine my surprise the following year when you tried out for the drumline. It was almost as if it was destiny. My girl was with me. Only you weren't my girl and nothing I ever did or could say would change that. But I so badly wanted it to be. I didn't care how many relationships I had to sabotage, you were mine and fuck everybody else. Only, in your mind, I was beneath you. Good enough to acknowledge as a friend, but unworthy of anything personal. I even took a year off of school after graduation before starting college only to end up at the same one you were at. It was like the universe was taunting me. And the fact that you refuse to spend your free time with your sister and friend and spend it with me instead was like insult to injury. And not even introducing you to Carol seemed to light any form of jealousy from you. If you had it, you hid it well, though you were an aspiring actress. And maybe that's why you didn't want me. You knew I wasn't much for flashy shit and conformity of any sorts. Maybe you never saw me as anything more than a peasant. Someone undeserving of royalty. I'm sure that's how you see or saw yourself. But all of it just pissed me off worse. You and your pretty boys, that all you cared about. Guess I wasn't pretty enough.

If weve already met. If youre halfway across the world or two streets over. If I will even notice you on the first go round. Maybe Im too late for love. Maybe Im too early. Is there really someone who exists who reflects and compliments me or is it all just an illusion. There must be relationships like that out there. Of course its not all fun and games, it takes work. Im jus wondering if my expectations are too high for reality. Ive always taken care of myself, but I want to be taken care of. Not because I cant do it myself, but because you want to because it makes you happy to do so. I want to take care of you too. I know there is balance within relationships though Ive never had the pleasure of experiencing it. Do we have the same interests and likes? Will we simply just be content observing how passionate we are about our own separate interests? Is there a man that is not scared of vulnerability? Is there one that will write me love notes, or send me songs simply to remind me that hes thinking of me? Or maybe one that will stop at a wildflower patch to pick one for me on his way home from work? Do these things really exist? Or is it just fantasy? Because if it doesnt exist, Ill be satisfied with living in my head. Because I want nothing less than this. I will spend every day showering you with affection if you can do the same, and on the days where we are too tired to do so, just laying next to each other in solidarity will suffice. People say this isnt a fairy tale, these movie types of love dont exist, but I refuse to accept that answer. Ill just keep trying, time and time again, Ill sacrifice my heart to go through the heartbreak of 1,000 possible lovers to find the one true."

How dare you disrespect my relationship for 8 months and then swoop in like you're some white knight. You treat her terribly. You forced her into a relationship with you and do nothing to change your controlling, partially narcissistic behaviors. You walk all over her emotions and pretend you're some great dude while you stifle her, control her, have groomed her to inherently rely on you but show no emotional care or empathy. Pretending you care when you just want to have but not nurture. You haven't changed. You did the same shit when she and I were together, and you gaslight and make her believe that she is lesser than she is. I hate you for that. Your manipulation. Your pouting and abuse to her while playing the victim. Lying and putting a facade on to turn people against her. That's not love, you prick. And you. I trusted you as a friend and you violated me. You disrespected my feelings and preyed upon my vulnerability in my weakest and most difficult moments. I told you countless times not to touch me and that I just needed support platonically. From the very start i told you that. And then you'd get drunk and forget that you groped me or tried to kiss me even when I pushed you away or moved away from you. You put my PTSD from being abused as a kid in hyperdrive, making me feel disgusting and that it was my fault for trusting. You touched me. You violated me. I throw up thinking about it.

Every once in a while, though, i will feel you here with me. As though no time ever passed. As if you never betrayed me. As if i were still blissful in my naive ignorance.... i can see your face, soft with vulnerability, your eyes sparkling like fresh dew on grass, your large, rough hand, enveloping mine, your sweet, reassuring words, making me feel safe..... and then i cry some. Because i know it's too late for me. I'll never have the luxury of feeling that security ever again. I chose wrong. I chose a man whose love was conditional. Who loved me in good times, but left when i needed him most. I'm sorry i wasn't fun anymore. I thought i was more to you than that. I thought *we* were more than that."

I can find no fatal flaw in you, nothing to push myself away from. I am not saying that you are without flaws but there is nothing that I can say is a major source of worry. As hard as I try to destroy, what I seek to destroy refuses to turn into ashes in my hands. When I am near you, I feel peace and I feel safe. I can finally take off my mask and I am free to be unbound, wild and raw. You feel like the home I never had. Do you understand how terrifying that is? I have spent countless lifetimes making myself so small that I am almost unrecognizable so that others could consume me favorably. I have cut away parts of myself in order to please the ones I am too afraid to release from my life because I am weak on my own. But with you, I dont have to do any of that. You accept me for the brooding, highly sensitive, passionate and sometimes paranoid being I am. I dont have to make myself small or slice away agonizingly at fleshy bits to please you. I dont have to be of this plane of existence, I am free to spread my tattered wings without fear. It is both repulsive and magnetizing. Its painfully beautiful. Hopelessly tragic. I dont ever want you to leave me. If Im being honest, that is my greatest fear and that is why I try to push you away and attempt burn the bridge between us. I have a self destructive hurt you before you hurt me mentality. It all revolves around the fear of loss and I have lost so much in my short life. I dont feel good enough to have what you bring to the table. Unconditional. Its something I have never known before. Everything in my life has been within parameters and within condition. Its something I have always been told about by others but never have I experienced it. What you are is a gift. This may be me being an idealistic piece of shit but I cant help the way you make me feel and you make me feel so much that I am afraid it will spill out when youre near. If you wanted to, you could weaponize it against me and I wouldnt blame you if you did. Vulnerability is a weakness but its something that I very much want to give you. As always, I am afraid. The cycle continues as it has for some time now. Even if it seems to have ended, it starts right back up again. Maybe it will blossom into something beautiful or maybe it will be the death of us both. Fatal attraction is almost always just that...fatal. I feel that you want this death as much as I do. May we kill each other in the most breathtaking way imaginable. I wouldnt want it any other way."

We flowed well together. Chemistry bounced off the walls. You looked at me eyes held deep in gaze, a look to send an electrifying jolt straight through my bones. I longed for your insights, always trying to decipher your colourful mind and train of thoughts. I adored your wild soul. Out of everyone I had met, I believed you shined the brightest. We had come to the inevitable crossroad, and it hurt  I remember it hurt. I wasnt certain whether to fight for it one last time or to say farewell and let it all go. We didnt end poetically. There was no fond farewell, instead we let things unravel abruptly and unforeseen. No matter how badly I wanted it, your affection wasnt mine to keep. I could never break down your walls, nor would you let me, as you are twenty-seven men in one. Leaving was nothing new to you, the great escapist you are; I discovered you choose to not conscious the feelings, possibilities or notion of love. Hiding, refusing to relent and embark in any situation that would expose your vulnerability  you could never love me, not while you having your own handful of demons needing to be addressed."

Ive missed you since the second I drove off this afternoon and all I want is to see your little wink-and-smile move that makes me *literally* swoon. I miss your cockiness and I miss your boyish attitude. Beyond that, I love your vulnerability and I wish you would give yourself a chance to be emotional outside of my presence. Every time I see you, you pour out your feelings like endless rain into a paper cup and I *know* it hurts to keep it all in. Youll always be my big, strong man, even if you cry sometimes. Its good for you. You were rambling about your eventual apartment today. I asked to decorate and you said of course. Im so excited to be here with you, even if this doesnt last forever. You said youll move anywhere I go for college, and even if its just an exaggeration, it means the world to me that you feel that way. Youre the biggest sweetheart in my universe, more so than any other guy Ive been with. Youre the perfect mix of machismo, sensitive, adorable, and pretty much every other positive adjective and youre absolutely perfect for me. Sometimes I catch whiffs of your cologne in the air and it still makes my heart flutter. Our first date, you gave me your sweater and refuse to take it back. You look at me with such adoration, I can never stop smiling when I see you. Your crooked, teethy smile brightens my day every time I see you laugh. You talk about the dumbest shit sometimes but its honestly adorable. You think like no other guy Ive ever met and you entertain me to no end without even trying. Sure, I miss your hot ass body, but I miss your hot ass personality more. Both would be nice right about now. The next few months are going to be amazing, and once you get that apartment of yours, life is gonna be perfect for us :)"

But I can't truthfully call you a friend since no matter how often I tried to draw you out and relate to you, you'd retreat back into your shell. I won't say that it didn't hurt -- I'm sensitive like that. But I did understand. I know you carry your thick barriers for a reason. I thought once that maybe it was to protect your career, but I don't think you're that ambitious. Now I wonder if maybe you're just sensitive too. But while I'm endlessly singing out a tune like the 52 Hertz Whale trying to find another like me... I think you've chosen to lock yourself safely away from the emotions of others. I can respect that. As much as my soul aches for a kindred spirit, I can't force you to come out and play. You've never been anything short of patient and kind as I worked to absorb as much of your knowledge and wisdom as I could. I learned so much from you and grew so quickly under your gentle guidance. But I'll let you in on my deepest secret -- most of what I did was to thank you. I saw how overloaded you were with responsibility and an entire team at your back depending solely on you. I felt your tiredness, vulnerability, and uncertainty. I sought out to ease your burden, intercede on smaller issues, and adopt some responsibility so you could move up to the bigger things I know you were meant for. I sought to be an ally to you. Now opportunity has come to spirit me away and I think our time is at its end. I'm so tremendously grateful for your role in shaping me these past two years. My only regret will be that we never got closer, but I do believe I truly felt you in those long quiet moments where we would linger on calls for hours past our scheduled end times. They never had to last that long, did they? And yet you were never in a hurry to leave me, even when we ran well past the usual end to your work day. I like to think maybe you felt it too, this comfortable meeting of souls. I have the curse of loving too easily. Not quite in the romantic sense, though there's certainly an attraction there. Rather... I've come to love the little I know about you and how you make me feel. You make me feel safe and respected. You make me feel like my insight matters. You make me feel valued. It hurts so deeply to be leaving the quiet comfort of your presence and forging my own path, but we both knew this day would have to come eventually. Clearly friendship is not in the cards for us, nor is anything more... But I'm better off for knowing you, whatever you are to me. I hope you feel the same."

No one ever asked me the hard questions or poked at the sleeping bear of underlying psyche and memory. Talking to you gave me the opportunity to overturn the old and to reinspect what I had previously overlooked. Every detail had meaning with you. Everything was important and worth noting. It wasn't just casual conversation, it was like weaving something new together. Some sort of creative experiment come to life. I looked forward to speaking to you because it became the only time I felt genuine joy and each new talking point sparked further excitement and curiosity. There was no boredom between us nor moments of dead air. There was an unspoken agreement to keep doing whatever it was that we were doing. I fucked it up when I caught feelings, but can you blame me? All of the intimacy, the vulnerability shared between us. You weren't just an ear to listen-- the act of you participating in our discussions led to a bond I found that I needed. It was something irreplaceable to me. I'm sorry you didn't feel the same but I won't apologize for having those feelings. You made me feel safe and understood, two things I had been striving to feel for such a long time. I wanted what we had to last forever. I thought it was special and beautiful although it was also unstable and frightening in a way. Opening yourself to someone completely is an act of ultimate trust. I gave that to you. You still have that. You took it with you when you left. I still get the urge to write you and sometimes I write you here when I have something I wish I could say to you but I cannot. I hope you're out there somewhere listening. Maybe you'll accidentally stumble upon this spot again and remember what we had together. I hope it wasn't as unimportant and unforgettable as you made it out to be in the end. I hope it had just as much of an impact on your life as it did mine. I miss you and I miss our conversations more than I can ever express. I won't ever forget you (still haven't, ha) and I doubt I'll ever truly get over our fallout. I cherish those words we shared during moments where we could turn to no one else. I hope you keep those memories close to your chest and understand that I gave you something I have given few others. Know that I am still here should you ever choose to speak to me again. If I never hear from you, I want you to believe me when I say I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart and that I hope you extend the same tender willingness and vulnerability to another because you are far, far too special to keep it all for yourself. With love,"

He is like a little boy who has become aware of his mortality. Perhaps it's the years he has spent moving around the world, never living in the same country for long. There's a kind of a vulnerability that he has, in his eyes, which are the colour of the bluest skies, but at times, appear gloomy and dark, almost black, when his pupils are dilated.* *There is also something extremely gentle about him. Sometimes, he can be a bit of a cad with his male friends, or when he's obsessively online, posting ridiculous gifs all the time, being a bit of that playful lad when he was at school. He doesn't spend a lot of time focused on his appearance, and will often wake up, hair completely disheveled and with a hoarse voice, the first thing he will do is call me. I like listening to him in those tender moments when he's vulnerable with me and he's revealing his true self. Other times, I can sense him scanning my mind, picking up on my subvocal chords from thousands of miles away and just as I am in a monologue with myself wondering if I should stay or go, he'll suddenly call me. He'll ask, ""Are you in this with me or not?""* *I think he's been disappointed in love many times. I don't know all the details of what had happened with his two ex-wives, but the last one apparently left him devastated. I listened to everything he has said to me very carefully as the roads turned and twisted in his mind. In those moments, I felt so close to him, as if we were two minds that suddenly bonded together over the physical distance between us.* *If I were to be completely disclose my fears, I am primarily afraid that he would end up being exactly like the man I had briefly dated before him, who was a careless monster. They have some similar traits in common, such as their love for martial arts and some interconnecting fields of interest. I kept wondering if he was going to turn out to be a similar type of monster as the other man, but there is a weird intuition inside me that tells me that he is a different type of man, that he is merely broken, but who he is is ultimately different from that other man, but I'm always struggling in between my head and my heart.* *I think if we were to see each other, a lot of his underlying fears and insecurities would dissipate. It's just that we haven't met in person yet and something needs to give in order to close the gap. If we were to just hold each other and talk, a lot of the miscommunication that we have would dissipate, but he's afraid that I will start to feel differently about him, that I will get tired of him. However, there's something about his intensity that draws me to him. He's all fire, and I'm the ocean waves.* *Yes, all this sounds partially crazy with two people who are probably somewhat, if not entirely eccentric with some interconnected childhood trauma that has bonded us together. I recently read a study though that said that 70% of the people you will now meet will be online. Maybe this is the curse of our technocratic generation, we're so globally connected, but at the same time, there is this paradox of each of us being a lonely island and not being completely present for the people who are right next to us. Our minds are far away thinking of someone else.* *I think we just happened to have met at the right time, but he was struggling in his ongoing divorce battle, and I think he just wanted a bit of light romance and flirtation, but something else happened along the way. I changed something deep inside him, and it made him afraid.*"

I knew you were picky, and looked for the worst in people, counting off their flaws in your finger tips, one-by-one. I thought I could be different. How foolish of me. You got mad because I told someone you knew (my closest confidant) about us, but I had to. I felt a nagging feeling in my gut. I felt like by not telling her, you were trying to control me. With you, its all secrets and lies, smoke and mirrors. You expected me to give you my unyielding loyalty before giving a teaspoon of vulnerability. That was the problem. I felt an intensity with you, but never felt like you were willing to jump down that rabbit hole with me. Not until I gave you all of me and surrendered to you completely. I wasnt going to open up to you until you met me halfway. You are self centered, truly, and I feel sorry for you. I think you know that you dont express empathy well. I think that you are paralyzed by the resulting loneliness. I think the potential of no one ever loving you again keeps you stuck in your current situation. I think I provided a glimpse of a way out and you almost took it. I think the possibility of me seeing through you scared you straight. Im so tired.

I feel like a complete mess. You took advantage of me and my vulnerability, my sensitivity, you took it all and threw it away as if it didnt matter to you. Before I became your girlfriend, you were all that I ever wanted. I told all my friends about you and I dreamed we would be together. That day happened and I was on top of the world, or so it seemed. I said I would take care of you and love you with all my heart and I did. You took advantage of that. Your insecurities tore me apart. The dream I had of being with you turned into a nightmare. I lost friends because you wanted to isolate me. I lost hobbies and the desire to do activities because it made you jealous. I stopped being around family because I didnt want them to see me cry over you. I wanted to protect you instead of protecting myself. Instead I chased you wondering why you wouldnt talk to me, answer my calls and give me the silent treatment. When I had enough and just wanted to give up after crying constantly, you would beg for me back, saying things would change, only to repeat the cycle and continue the blame. I dont even know who I am anymore. I have lost myself trying to please you. I chased you, pursued you and when I finally got you, then the accusations and jealousy began. We could never even go out to public places without you accusing me of looking at other men. All of my favorite places to go to are ruined because of the fights we would have there, and you leaving me behind while I struggle to find a ride home. My dream of being married and having children is shattered because I dont think I will ever want to go through something like this again. I cant even look at men (which you accused me of doing) without feeling like I will be hurt again. I am resentful because of you. I have so much anger because of you. I was happy before you, I had hope before you and you took it all away. I gave you all of me asking for nothing but love and respect in return.

From my family, from my upbringing, the nuture I wanted to escape so badly. Now I can see that I'll spend a long time running from myself. Maybe it was me I was running from the whole time. And when I decided to stop running is when things started to really go bad. I had always been exceptional at not letting things get to me. Not being bothered or affected by anyone else. Now I not only gave myself over to someone who only used my vulnerability to hurt me. I let that carry over and affect my relationship with the person I've met who really meant the most to me. Don't spend your life thinking nothing matters because if and when it does, you won't be able to adjust to it. Fuck I am poison. I can't bare anything anymore. It only gets shorter and slips through your fingers faster and faster. Why didn't I trust my instincts years ago. Why the fuck did I isolate myself. Why did I ever let any of my family back into my life. It's always been a lie and it's always loaded with psychotic shit. Fuck man I used to have something, some understanding or at least self preservation. Even if it was based on nihilism. Why the fuck did I ever start thinking anyone was above their own human nature? I am such a fucking idiot. I have no self esteem left. I don't want to ever have a connection with another person again. Regressive nightmare, I feel like I'm 18 again and I just kicked drugs and had no direction. That led to a car accident that nearly killed me. Which led to a stupid relationship that I walked away from after 4/5 years of game playing bullshit. Then I went somewhere without direction. Fell into some stupid relationship and the isolated myself on an island for 5 months. Then what? Tried to contact the friend I had and got fucked over hard. Fuck I just want a friend. And I had found the best friends I could have asked for and then I had a psychotic meltdown and fucked it up. Yeah I hate myself. I don't want to be or do anything. I've seen multiple angles to this shit, been on different sides of it. Why did that happen? I said a bunch of shit that isn't true, even about myself. I guess that's my nature, if you want me gone I'll make it very easy for you to forget about me. What the fuck kind of possession was that? Why am I still writing about it?"

I havent been struck with these precarious emotions in my past and I dont trust them residing inside my head once again. The last person I trusted to guard these, he convinced me that I was nothing. That whatever we had wasnt worth what I was feeling and I wasnt worth him feeling them in return. It scares the absolute hell out of me, what if this ends up hurting just as bad? I dont know if I could ever tell you, but I tried ending my life multiple times over a situation gaining more and more similarities to ours as the days go by; without the bad and abusive parts of course.... but I dont know if I could survive another heartbreak like that, I barely survived the first one. But for some reason, something inside me has convinced me that our connection is worth the enduring try. You told me the other day that you come with a lot of baggage, and I laughed and shrugged it off. You immediately believed that it was just because it just possibly naive and have no idea what I am about to be dealing with... no. I laughed, because you dont know who I am. What I carry emotionally and mentally on my back every day. The turmoil I tend to bring into the lives of those who I love and cherish most. I want you to fall for me the way I see myself falling for you. I am so naturally vulnerable with you, so comfortable. I am terrified that I will disappoint you. That once again, I wont be enough for you, or possibly too much even. I have never been the one for anyone, the perfect fit, the person who they would do anything for. You are perfect, even more so that you claim to have a history with chaos. You are everything Ive wanted and possibly some things that I didnt picture myself craving before now. I wish I could tell you that that man I mentioned before I brushed on my fears Shawn it comes to you.... he conditioned me to think feel that any affection I showed, if not in private, was too much. Any emotional connection I allowed to develop within myself was overzealous because he never contributed to building them when all I was doing was building them upon his beautiful nothings hed whisper to me whenever he got a chance. That he is the reason why I am hesitant giving you endearments, intimate touches when we are alone or out at the disposal of anyones glancing eye. That all I want to do is hold your hand and kiss your lips.... but am afraid because maybe youll interpret it as me becoming clingy? Or attached too soon? That youll disapprove in some way or the other. You told me that you like the things I say, you like the sentences that I form... but what if that changes? What if I tell you what I really want to say and the way you see me changes? What if this ends in a way that makes it seem like it never was in the first place? What we have discovered we have is rare, at least in my existence and I want it to last forever. I dont want anyone else, but I feel as if I need to fill myself with as many as possible because youll end up leaving like everyone who almost loved me does. You have told me how you feel, and I believe you. But feelings are fickle, emotions are fleeting... only to be affected and/or drastically changed by whatever I chose to say or do next. I hope you decide to stay, I hope you decide to love and keep me in the most genuine way. I hope I dont disappoint you. I hope you decide to make me yours."

You were in management, but because management there was a joke, you were in the office goofing off with the hiring manager. I still dont think I filed my taxes correctly because all I remember thinking is I want to become friends with this person who suddenly makes the world around me hazy. I think, in a lot of ways, you love me too. You were there for me when my dad died. Matter of fact, you were the only one who invited me over after his death. We didnt talk much, but you seemed okay with that. We sat around in the dark with the tv glowing. Ive never had someone understand me as well as you do. I think I understand you too. We left the state when you had important news to tell your family. You needed those miles between your parents and yourself in order to tell them. You cried in front of people. You, the poker face prince, showed vulnerability. In that moment, I felt simultaneously trusted and enraged. I want to protect you. I feel safe with you and want to show you the same kindness. I love being your friend. Im completely happy just being someone you talk to and want to see. I would love to hold you close on rough days, though. Lay my head on your shoulder and feel loved. Your head on my shoulder. Anyway, I love you. If you ever want something more from me, Im down. You pick the song, Ill sing the high parts."

Honestly I wish I didn't awnswer so fast because now with having had so much time to think about my awnswers some still being the same others completely different and if I could tell you... I'd say o him....I love the way I'd be busy doing something and I'd feel that feeling when you know someone is watching you and it wasn't that you were looking at me me it was the piercing glare that I'd fall so hard for those eyes could say so many different things to me. Or the way you would suddenly just stop everything and grab me like a scared child I'd feel you shudder and your body as you started to breathe heavily and so much faster from the anxiety kicking in as I could actually feel your flashbacks or trauma set its course. You might think wtf but it was your vulnerability and weakness that you so willingly trusted me with the truth of your pain you let me also experience with you. The past you relived with me and I loved how frail your darkest thoughts were and the way you feared that you would hurt me if you allowed yourself to let go but yet you did and never once I was hurt by you. The way you didn't mind teaching me new things and how you took time to make sure N I understood and hoe pacient you could be when my mental health was at its worst. We bonded and was able to convey how we felt often through our passion for music. How I felt like I was able to make love not only be rough you taught me what intamacy was. How you was content with me and you always made me feel special sang to me I love you and your voice your different unique set apart from other people alot like the best movie we both got to see you have always been like my hero v and I was always there for you waiting like your one and only evee. Your quiet and intelligent you have always been the smartest in the room patiently waiting you're always waiting watching calculating.I always thought you would die rather than let me go and be with another but yet here we are .Last but not the least not in any way I love the animal inside that u keep hidden and locked away but guess what.... I love the most it's how you didn't ever hide from me .
172,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Do you know how much he obsesses over you?,1,flbrum,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/flbrum/do_you_know_how_much_he_obsesses_over_you/,2020-03-20 02:22:38,"Hello T, Weve never met in person, but you know of me, as I know of you. Im writing this to let you know how much S cares about you. The reality of the situation is grimm at best and a tragedy at worse, but there is one truth that seems to emerge from the rubble. Hes still in love with you, and hes obsessed with you. He will never admit it, but Im sure things became clear for him after that fateful DMT trip taken at a terribly wrong time. The words he speaks to me are the lies in which he likes to believe is reality, but his actions tell an entirely different story. Truth of the matter is, he used my near death situation to start talking to you again. You broke his heart so many years ago, yet through the power of mother ayahuasca did it dawn on him to reach back out to you to make amends, or at least that was the lie he sold me. As I was healing, staples in my head, he left me during my follow up appointments. Yet he could find time to spend hours doing research for you to get you help for your depression. All while spending his limited free time we shared together pondering his thoughts on what to email you next. Leaving me alone to go downstairs in the basement and spend hours typing them to you. I know your story, and it's similar to mine. Its maddening for me to hear him go on and on about your abuse, when in reality I have faced the same. When my medical bills started to come in, he had the audacity to ask me if he could use his bonus money to help you with the treatment plan he found for you. I was told to be virtuous, to use this as a giving back exercise of showing gratitude of having a renewed lease on life. Ive since realized that the reward was losing the man who supposedly loves me so much to his phone and emails, obsessed over an ex who dumped him almost a decade ago. He archives them you know, the pages and pages of emails you two write to one another. He even told me he keeps a doc of all his favorites. Im painfully aware of them and was told they would stop as he thought that you might get the wrong idea about your relationship. It was only after weeks of asking for some clarity, did he admit that he did still love you, but only as a friend. I think that's the closest to the truth we will get out of him to be honest, something that I have to amends with. He reads them as he spends time with me on the couch, glossing over the gmail thread over and over and over again. I cant bring myself to be intimate with him, as all his gaze seems to be either your emails, or random feet on reddit. Why bother anymore, I cant compete with a ghost, a cluster of happy memories from years long past. Im writing this to you, because I realize you probably have no idea what's going on. You take a few days to reply to him, I have to deal with his anxious emotions over it. I harbor no ill feelings towards you, but man did it burn to watch him research the fuck outta PMDD because that was the reason you turned down the money in the first place. His expression didnt even change when I let him know I had it too. Ah, but you see that's my problem. This will be my second failed marriage, where the dude just decided to spend his time on something else that's not me, so obviously the problem lies with me. I realize where we differ is that you still had someone to turn to, to connect and show true vulnerability to. I did not, my parents did not have the emotional capacity and were dealing with my brother who had more violent emotional outbursts. I was always the awkward older kid who never connected with anyone. The true loner, I grew to love being alone and spaced from everyone around me. The caveat of this personality type, however, is that it creates situations like this one we seem to be finding ourselves in, and that's something I need to make peace with in my own time. I learned from a young age that the only person who I can truly rely on, is myself. Everyone I seem to be intimate with ultimately lets me down and Ive finally reached a point where I would rather just not try at all. The beauty of that strength, if youd call it beauty, is that Ive reached a stability in which my excess in resources can be used to support the people I love. So now I sit here working from home, youve asked for assistance because youve lost your two server jobs, and Ive given him the ok to help you, even saying you can stay if you lose your place. As I know what it's like to have the rug pulled from under you, but I wanted to let you know that when we inevitably split, you know the reason why. And all I ask moving forward, once the world around him crumbles down and he spills his emotions through that gmail thread over our inevitable combustion, is that you give him a second chance. You two seem to connect really well, and should cherish it. I dont think Ill ever reach a point where I understand or comprehend it, but I realize that its something special. -Signed, The loner who wishes to disappear"

My bad. I know I can be a nuisance. But you don't have to worry about me troubling you with all these unwanted feelings because I'm ashamed of it too. It ain't your fault and I know it's unfair of me to dump it all on you. I know it's me. It's mine to shoulder and there's nothing you can do. I'm sorry. I fail in the simplest of tasks. I'm so sorry. When I do eventually reach out...I hope you simply accept it as it is and allow me that small window of vulnerability. I'm sorry I need it. I hope it doesn't disturb or irk you into distancing yourself again. I really don't harbour any bad intentions towards you. Just let me be selfish for a little bit.

You could not possibly have picked a more fucked up person than I, to be your girlfriend. My only wish is that youll let me go, so you can save yourself for someone else. Someone who deserves you, and who will cherish you openly and unconditionally, unlike I have in our time together. Im so ashamed of my love for you, Im ashamed of my feelings and my past, and all of me that youve seen. I feel tremendous shame, and guilt. And for what? I dont even know why I feel this way. Im so afraid to love, and to be loved. To open myself up to such incredible vulnerability. I knew I wasnt stable enough to be with you when I agreed to go on our first date. I knew I didnt want to kiss you when you asked me to, but I did. I knew I didnt want to hold hands and I didnt want to be with you like that, but I went through with it all. And then I caught feelings for you, and fell hard. Because of my stupidity, Ive now put you through hell. Ive made you chase me on countless occasions, through pitch black parks and down the street where that horrible monster lives. I ran away from you and put words in your mouth; You dont love me. Youre just using me as a comfort. You dont really care about me. You stayed out in the cold, just wanting to go home, and I wouldnt calm down. Then, I cried in your arms on the park bench, and apologised to you profusely. I blamed it on the meds I mixed with the alcohol, but its no excuse. I dont want to hurt you anymore. For some reason, it causes me so much pain to love you. Im terrified. How can someone possibly love me? How can I possibly love someone else? I dont know. Ive been socially isolated for so much of my life, how do I handle this? How can I open up? When you told me about your two suicide attempts, I felt so much pain for you, and for your family. Since then, I have selfishly only thought of myself, and for this I am so sorry. Ive only thought of my pathetic attempts to end my own life, Ive only thought of how badly I wish I could take my own life. I love you so much, but I know we cant be together. It just cant work, Im sorry. Im so messed up and my fear of abandonment, my fear of trusting, my inability to communicate with you, it destroys everything. You try so hard, but I want you to stop. I need you to stop. Im not made for this. I was never made for this, for friendships, for love. I was always alone, you know? You grow comfortable in that space, and you dont rely on people anymore when youre lonely, or sad. You just become numb and stop aching for love and for friendship. My darling, Im so sorry. I dont know what more I can say."
175,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,The Man You Revealed Yourself To Be,1,fo0kt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/fo0kt4/the_man_you_revealed_yourself_to_be/,2020-03-24 17:51:21,"At first, I thought you were the one (or could be the one). I thought I could fall madly in love with you, because I saw something in you, a vulnerability, a warmth that reminded me of the relationship I had with my own father. I thought that you would be my fighter, protector and defender. I thought you would be my or leviathan in training and we would build great things together. I weaved an image of that future but then things started breaking down, or rather you started revealing the man who you really are: full of unmitigated rage, anger and pettiness. The red flags I initially noted: the way you negatively gossiped about everyone, the way you always made mountains out of molehills, how you saw the world through the lens of paranoia, the way you burn bridges with everyone who tries to help you. I thought: Well, maybe he's been through a lot and he needs healing. I thought maybe I could be the one to heal you. I tried to build you up. I defended you when other people talked down about you. I tried to make other people see that you had a vision because at the time, I believed in us. I believed in us, me and you, and you and me. I thought we could take on the world together, we would be at each other's side and you would always protect me and defend me, the way I believed in you. In the end, all you wanted to do was hurt me. You hurt, so you wanted others around you to feel the same pain. You weren't the fighter I thought you were. You were a perpetual victim who blamed other people for the problems you created for yourself. You were always in a state of victimhood. Everyone else was the problem, and you never did any wrong. Then you started to hide your mistakes by pinning them on me. You would lie and obfuscate to make yourself look good to other people, so that you wouldn't appear as a weak leader, when really you never listened to the advice that I gave you. I tried to paint you in a positive light, to make you into a world of art. All you did was tear me down, and use verbal abuse as your weapons of choice. But still, I thought, maybe he's been through a lot, or he's under a lot of pressure and things haven't been solidified between us and you were feeling insecure or jealous. I excused so much of your behavior when I shouldn't have. When that event occurred, the day that I was nearly attacked by a large, aggressive roaming dog that someone had unleashed, I ran and wanted to talk to you first. I wanted to hear your voice and tell you how scared I was feeling, but instead, when I messaged you about it, all you said was, ""Big deal"". And then it clearly clicked in my mind's eye how callous and uncaring you really were. You didn't care about me at all, never cared about my welfare. You only liked the ego-tripping future I painted of you as a remarkable man. You only cared about that image, but never about me. If only you had said, ""Hey, are you ok? What happened, tell me."" And listened to me, but it wasn't something you're capable of - caring about others. You only care about yourself, and the image you portray to the world, pretending to be a caring father, using your daughter's picture in your social media, when all you did was yell at her while I was on the phone with you. When she sang, you yelled at her. When she lost her front teeth, you made fun of her speech. You would say borderline inappropriate things to her about having boobies. Then I realized that you were never like my own father. My father always listened to me, everything I had to say. He had a curiosity about the world that he instilled in me. We were always asking questions together. He taught me that a woman has to depend on her intelligence and personality to survive in the world, that looks would fade, and that I should focus on the internal. My father taught me a love of books, you don't even read books, you read stuff on twitter all day long. My father taught me to be strong and stand up to bullies. You teach your daughter how to become a future dependent housewife. You speak negatively about her mother in front of her, blaming your ex-wife for everything. And then it struck me, maybe your ex wife wasn't such the terrible woman you had always painted her to be, maybe all of it were lies, like the way you tried to pin all your mistakes on other people. But the last straw was when I needed you, when I need to talk to you after the traumatic incident where I was nearly mauled by a dog, and you so easily dismissed me with ""big deal"". That was when I realized the man you had revealed yourself to be. A callous, petty, uncaring man who only cares about perfect his social media image of the perfect dad, when really underneath, you only care about yourself. You use people around you, to try to get them to work for you for free, changing contract terms at the last minute, then blaming people when they're not spending 24/7 working for your goals. You blame the people around you when you make a mistake. When the coronavirus was here, and I told you things were becoming chaotic, you didn't care at all. Suddenly, when it's in your nation, you think it's the end of the world and that we're heading towards dark times. And I realized the signs were always there - how you only ever cared about yourself. Thank you for revealing your true self to me. If not, I might have devoted years of my life building a future for us, but now I will shift my power, creativity, love, devotion, affection to someone else who will care about me and love me in the same way that I do. You broke the spell of illusion from across the ocean and I thank you for that lesson."

It has always become my weakness, my fear and pain itself. I can never step out of this body and bare my naked soul to anyone. Never. Yet somehow, you slipped into my life so quietly that without realizing, I was peeling off the layers and layers of the mask I put on for the world to see. As time consumed us, with each phone call, the endless nights we've spent, the words you've given me... I stand before you, with every scar glimmering under the moonlight, every pain laid out and even the harshest thoughts all put on display like a museum filled with vile items with all the saddest words in the world as its description. I fear the aftermath of it, always preparing myself for the worst yet you took it with such tenderness that I grew more comfortable to let you have a glimpse of the darkest corners of my being, the very corners that I couldn't reach, the ones that I've kept hidden for so long, awaiting its time to resurface and end it all. In what seems like such a short period of time, every inch of me belonged to you. With it, I put all the love, care and the immense amount of trust in the palms of your delicate hands in hopes you'd treat it gently as much as you could. In hopes that I'd be blessed enough to have you letting me love every inch of you. The sky grew darker in ways that my days have been recently. As the bad dreams got worse to the point I find myself waking up drenched with sweat and tears, the words I've received got harsher and so brutal that I bleed on the cold, hard floor, and the breaths I take became harder the hatred towards this beating heart grew more as each day passes by. I've lost hope. For some reason, I've held on. For the two people I have loved so dearly, I hold onto them even if it became unbearable, I held on. Due to them, some days get easier, ended with love and care, filled with laughter and it almost felt like I was walking on air. Just some days that I grew to become blessed enough to still be alive. More often, I wished nothing but to leave and disappear to the point desperation fills me up and episodes of losing control became a daily occurrence. I was afraid of the things that were about to happen, things that could've change us, things that could make us lose each other in ways that it leaves a mark that can never be erased. How hard we tried to never hurt each other and along the way, in my own selfish way, we ended up letting the inevitable happen. I could never blame you for the way you see me, thoughts of me nor the words you have given me. The aftermath of it all, left me curled up with the pain eating me up inside. And I should've known better how powerful words can be. All the feelings I've kept hidden, you evoked it so easily, calling it out to light. It scared me just how you bring out the vulnerabilities in me. It feared me just how all the weaknesses I have was laid out before you. It terrified me just how much you cared for me and loved me to the point I wanted to leave and hide away and just disappear completely. And I wished I could have all my secrets back, how I wished I took my own advice instead of being reminded just why I never did it in the first place, how I wished to only hide and never come to light again. And I want to hide. I want to be kept hidden from everything and everyone. No one deserves to have such a vile museum visit in their lives, no one should ever love and care for something so shattered and painful and I never want to be one of the regrets nor pain in one's life. *yours truly,* ***C.***"

Online comrades? Invisible forces aligned to each other? Friends? Best friends? All hidden under different names, personas. Anything you would want to be, you could. But you chose to be this person. You chose to show this side of yourself. And I chose to be naive and gullible, pretty oblivious being unthoughtful about the circumstances and consequences. Being unaware of the lines I couldnt cross and what I shouldnt reveal. Which story to mix and to share exactly, and what to even explain? Complete confusion. Uncertainty. Doubts? But I always seem to find ways in brushing it off. Having some sort of confirmation in my own assumptions and beliefs about the situation. But it never meant that it was a concrete conclusion about reality. I often asked you for validation or reassurance, and you gave it to me without hesitation. You offered me your ears and a couple of wise words from your enriched experiences over the years. Your encouragement and support. Your care and your time to write such long &amp; meaningful replies. Your anticipation to my excitement. I hoped to see you open up more. Sharing out that bit of yourself to the world fearlessly, because I always found you brilliant and genuine. Was it enough? You always were good enough for me. Im not sure if you ever knew that. Or realized it yourself. Im not sure if you understood how beautiful I thought your vulnerability with me was. I just wanted to caress you in my arms and keep you safe somehow. But it turned out to be chaotic at the end anyways. Well, I still wished to be there for you either way. I wished I could have been more to you. Rather than just a disorganized and emotional mess. At least I am glad that I have been able to get to know you in that way. Even if it might not be the most convenient and absolute way to truly be in a state of certainty. I guess I learnt how to accept that in myself. Ill just never know everything there is to know in life, and that isnt the end of the world. It just means that theres much more to learn and the possibilities are endless. Which I am fine with. So create what you can with what you have right now. And from this memory of you? I think I am going to keep it. I love you. I hope youre okay."

The letter in which I confessed my love to you during our senior year of high school. It has been over a year since I wrote and left it on your desk before your econ class. The letter that was pretty much written in vain since the end result was not what I was hoping for. I felt heartbroken, but I could only blame myself for that. I remember the first day I saw you back in 2012 during the beginning of our 6th-grade year. You were wearing that navy hoodie, blue jeans, and black converse. Who knew I would develop feelings for you 4 years later. It was during a game of tennis during P.E. that I once again set my eyes upon you. Only this time I had a weird feeling looking at you. Your tennis ball rolled onto my court and I returned it to you as you gave me a smile and said: ""Thank you."" 2 years later, we were in our senior year. I still had feelings for you but I could not muster the courage to express those feelings. After a few months, I decided it was time to confess my love for you through a heartfelt letter. I took my fountain pen and some parchment paper and started writing my thoughts down. It took me 3 drafts to perfect the letter, only because there were grammatical errors in the first 2. Once I got the final draft done, I folded it up in a sophisticated way with the help of a YouTube tutorial and I left it on your desk the following day. In the following hours, you responded to me. You were very grateful for my letter and appreciated my vulnerability, but you did not feel the same way about me. You were always a very nice girl to everyone, probably the one trait that made me fall for you. Alas, you were willing to become friends and hang out sometime. Unfortunately, none of that really happened. I felt so embarrassed about myself that I sort of ignored you. I wish I could have spoken to you at least once but again, the courage to do that was nowhere to be found. I let the days, weeks, and months pass by. Before I knew it, we had finished finals and all we had to do was enjoy our senior activities and wait for graduation. The picnic, grad night, and prom flew by and it was only until after that I decided to send you a text. I waited for a few hours and saw that there was no response. When I checked a few hours later, I realized that you had read the message hours ago. That was the last time I tried to communicate with you. Graduation came and went, but I could not go home without seeing your beautiful face one last time. It took me a while to find you amongst the huge crowd. Once I laid my eyes on you I let out a deep sigh, smiled, and turned my back to walk away from the crowd. Being cooped up at home has made me think about many things, and you were one of them. It was only this week that I realized that I forgot your birthday was in February, which was odd since I tend to have a good memory for birthdays. I also remembered about the letter, which I am curious about its whereabouts. Whatever may have become of it, I hope it is something that you will cherish forever."

She couldn't get a word in edgewise because listening wasn't part of his skill set. He would often cut people off, interrupt them, then when they disagreed with his opinions, he would shift the narrative and say they weren't listening to him. She was more used to bantering with academics, men who liked to play devil's advocate and were charming and witty and knew the exact bon mot to entice her or otherwise would say something humorous in order to make her laugh. However, when she tried to banter with him, he would immediately get defensive. He saw opinions that strayed from his own as threats, whereas she saw it as a form of verbal foreplay. It was impossible to discuss abstract ideas with him, because he didn't have the curiosity to try to understand ideas out of his realm of knowledge, but would dictate that he knew best, like some tyrant who was feeding off his own power. ""I'm right, you're wrong!"" was his favorite unconvincing argument. He hadn't learned how to think critically, nor understand how to frame a debate because all he knew was based on some shifting-the-blame tactic he learned off some misogynistic site where he threw negs at everyone when he felt people weren't paying attention to him. At the same time, there was something sweet about him. For instance, when he woke up first thing in the morning with a groggy voice and would want to talk to her. There was a kind of rebelliousness to him, of defiance that she liked about him. She also liked the way he didn't seem particularly vain about his appearance. When he would wake up with messy, tousled hair and want to facetime. He wasn't like those men who would constantly be streaming their ultra edited photo-enhanced Instagram pics with the best lighting, apt poses and be constantly in front of the camera, flexing their muscles. He was sort of like that down-to-earth type of guy who wore what was clean and wasn't particularly interested in what he looked like and she felt comfortable around him. Perhaps the underlying problem was that they hadn't physically met yet. It appeared to her his primary love language was touch. He needed touch and body language to understand people. He was the type of guy who liked to touch things, not the kind of guy who would read books and understand theory. He was more action-oriented. She wondered what would happen if they were in the same room together? Would they get on? What would he smell like? Would he have more of a musky scent or more of a citrus flavor? The simple fact was that she couldn't just become infatuated with a man online. She had to see him, touch him, smell him, understand him through her senses. She too, had one of her love languages as touch. She had to experience him to understand if this would be love or going somewhere, yet there was that part of her, although irritated at his impatience, somehow, the fact that he was obsessively compulsive was something of a strange turn on for her. He became fixated on things, singularly focused, and she found that sort of intriguing. Her friend told her the same thing: *You have to see him and meet him before making a decision.* Unfortunately with the pandemic that wasn't particularly possible right now. Would they be having the same arguments if in person they were sitting right next to each other? Were they often misreading each other through text? It seemed to her that he had a slightly paranoid personality and would often read into negative connotations of what she said when she was merely bantering with him in a playful way. He would take everything she said so seriously and instantly react like a defensive animal that had been cruelly beaten and didn't realize that her hand over his head was meant to gently stroke him, not hurt him. The situation had become blown way out of proportion, and as usual, he was creating unnecessary drama when all was said and done. *But maybe he's doing it because he's hurt?* Was he just reacting because he was hurt and lashing out? Obviously she also said things to him while she was angry herself, and perhaps he took those things personally. It did seem to her that he had a bit of an abandonment complex. There was something powerfully needy and clingy about him, which on the exterior, seemed to be an unattractive trait to many, but she was strangely attracted to the fact that he was needy and clingy- it sort of reminded her of her puppy who would jump on her when he wanted attention, or follow her around the house and get excited when she took him out for a walk. He was someone who was meant to be adored. Then she remembered his words: *You want me to be like your pet dog.* She smiled a little thinking about this. Perhaps they just had some type of miscommunication. After all, they were both a bit high strung, it was hard to tell emotional context over text, and this social distancing wasn't helping them communicate in a clearer way. He had a lot of anger management issues and often he would be screaming at her over the phone like a madman which would lead her to hand up on him and put him on ignore until he calmed down. It also appeared to her that he was constantly testing her, trying to incite a reaction out of her, try to see if she would get jealous, to gauge how invested she was in him. The thing though was that even if she began to develop feelings for him, she didn't want to get her hopes up. She had been disappointed too many times. Emotional entanglements were always one thing that were her weakness which prevented her from her career goals. There was no point in being fixated over a person she has not physically met yet...yet she had some weird intuition that if they had met, they would get along. So much of their lapses in communication were probably due to the lack of emotional context when they would get testy with each other. *""Why do you think you're so drawn to him?""* There was something about him that reminded her of her father, something she couldn't quite quantify; they didn't have the same exact personality but there was something parallel about the situation. She had loved her father so much, but she wasn't able to save him. By the time she figured out what to do, it had been too late. Her father was gone, and it was one of the hardest thing she had to ever do, watch him slowly die while he held her hand. It filled her with regret every day and for a long time, there had been this rage growing inside her. However, when she first met him online, a lot of that anger started to dissipate. There was something about meeting him that began to eclipse the death of her father, as if two timelines were now merging. *""Do you think there are similarities between your father and him?""* There was something warm about him, even under the armor of emotional defenses, she could sense he was a gentle person inside, someone she would want to wake up next to and look at and be in his embrace, just hearing him mumble about one thing or another. But he had made some aggressive threats against her, and she had to take those seriously. ""*What would you like from him?""* Her therapist asked. She thought for a moment. ""*I would like an apology. A personal apology and a public one.""* ""*Do you think that's something he would be willing to do?""* She could see the image of his face, not smiling, but in a defiant stare, awaiting judgement. He was the type of man who thought showing vulnerability and admitting wrong was a sign of weakness. Would he be able to overcome his own ego? *""I want to know if I mean more to him than his pride. If he cared about me, he would apologize. If he doesn't, then I suppose I have my answer.""*"

I'm more than mad, I'm fuming! You had the audacity to just ghost me. You made me question my worth and everything I had believed in. You took advantage of my naivete, my vulnerability and shredded it to pieces. You came at me with your lies about love, about wanting a family, about you saying you're in love with my incredibly gullible ass. I'm mad at myself too. I'm mad that I believed it all. I soaked it all up like a sponge. I actually believed that you were my Prince Charming. I believed that we were going to have kids. I lost sleep over you. I cried so many tears and cursed the higher powers for making me love someone who is so near, yet so far away. After the shitstorm of a child-hood I had, he/she/them/whatever high power there is couldn't they have given me this one thing I wanted the most?! I hate you for still playing me. I hate myself for letting you still lead me on. I hate that you make me embarrass myself. I hate that i shared parts of me I want to share with my future husband. I hate you yet I want you to hug me. I want to yell at you. I want you to hear what is burdening me. I want you to see how much you destroyed me. I want you to feel bad about it all. I want you to fucken take it back and apologize for it all because I still have these angry days. It's been a while but I still have the angry days where I just want to cry and scream profanities until my throat is scratchy, and my voice gives way. But I chose this....I bloody hell chose this Me"

It would easy if you were terrible. If you were terrible, I could write all your behaviors off as attempts to humiliate me and drop out of your class. But you're not terrible, you're kind of amazing, so I have to live with the fact that someone actually cares about me and treats me like I matter. My therapist says that letting other people care about me and love me is my great fight. How can I feel worthy of love when I hate myself? So your warmth makes me uncomfortable. The amount of nightmares I have that involve you deciding to be like ""HEY KIDDO. :-)"" in the hallways and pulling me aside (for some reason that my brain usually boils down to either 1) I have failed him and he hates me now and I have to run away to Canada and 2) looks like the motherfucker is reporting me for suicidal thoughts again, goddamn this nice motherfucker and 3) I am about to be fucking slaughtered with kindness and it will be Painful,) is too much. I can handle hate. There's nothing anyone can say or do to me that my head hasn't already played a million times in my head to punish me. But how do I handle warmth? The answer-- I d o n ' t for I am A Failure. What I am trying to explain despite my brand of self deprecation and poor taste in humor is that I don't want you to think I hate you. I would love to hate you. I would very much love to hate you. But I'll face it and drag you down this path of realization with me: I don't hate you at all because I care about your well-being an embarassing amount and would love to see you as a guest at my future wedding, to make an awkward celebration of vulnerability even worse. I can't hate you if I tried. Are you happy now, you smug bastard? Your masterplan of caring about students and shaping their lives so they can be strong and happy is even halfway working here-- I sure as hell ain't happy or strong but goddammit that sure didn't stop you from trying. Saying the words ""thank you"" now seems like the absolute worst way to end this letter, because seriously, ""thank you"" just won't cut it. It's like you pull someone out of a flaming building and then save their ten babies and then as you're handing them their last one, they're like ""thanks"" and you never see them again. So I won't say ""thank you"". I don't feel exactly grateful that you did this for me but I am touched. And as with any kind of touching, I feel very alarmed and horrified that someone was stupid enough to approach me without a Hazmat on. I dint have the words to articulate how I feel, so I hope you can just read this letter and understand where I am coming from. I hate needles and vaccines. I am no anti vaxxer, I just hate needles and having stuff pushed into my blood. For you, I'd take ten vaccines at once and would remain stonefaced and calm with no tears, screaming, or Depression Naps after. That is the best way I can articulate it."

I hate that youve brought this into our lives, that you no longer know how to keep your promises, and that its not important enough for you to overcome your fear of admitting weakness me get help. Youre an addict. Its a cycle. It always goes this way: you seek out women, tell them what they want to hear, get your ego boost and and a few pics to assure yourself that youve still got it, then ghost them when the guilt hits, so you can pat yourself on the back for not having a physical affair. Then you try really hard to behave for a while, but the knowledge that youve betrayed me again after promising you wouldnt do it again eats you alive. It causes you to hear negativity and criticism when I intend none, it causes you to blame me for not trusting you, and not see the things I do to try to show you love and forgiveness. It makes you angry at me for, hurt me, then get angry at me for being hurt. So you justify it all with shes never going to forgive me and its never enough. But the guilt is always there under the surface. As is the urge for a quick fix. So you tell yourself that I make you feel like shit about yourself, that Im never going to trust you no matter what, and use it all as an excuse to engage in behavior that you kept swearing you werent addicted to. I know more than you think I do, its just a matter of getting together enough evidence that you wont be able to deny it. See, Im pretty fing pissed. Im pissed at you for your behavior, Im pissed at you for your denial that you have a problem, but above all, I am incredibly pissed at you for the shit youve put me through the last three years. The blame and the gaslighting and the trivialization and ridicule of my concerns... the guilt trips you sent me on and the all the apologies youve accepted. Your misplaced anger and your cowardice, the fear of facing yourself and admitting you have a problem has made life close to hell for me. Just admit you have a problem! We dont have a DB, my libido is higher than yours. This whole thing is as much about affirmation and attention. But you know seeking out external validation, though it may provide a temporary high, leaves you feeling worse about yourself in the long run. Im emerging from the hell you put me through stronger. So strong that I pity you more than anything. I fucking love you, you know how amazing we can be together with some work, but like a junkie, you seek out the temporary fix every time. I know you and I know what your capable of, thats why Im still here. And even with all of this, if you would show me one moment of complete authenticity, with your self and with me, would come clean and seek help, I would still give you another chance, because, like I said, I know who you are underneath the bullshit. But as long as you continue to maintain your fucking plausible deniability, I will be waiting for you to slip up. I dont care what kind of skills you have, nobody can maintain a secret addiction permanently.... especially when stuck at home with a suspicious spouse. If... no, WHEN I get proof that you cant deny, it will not go well for you. I dont suggest stopping for a while, trying to be good, because how many times have you tried that before, only to get pulled back in, like the addict you are? Because I have figured it out. I know when youre back to it from your shitty attitude and your complete loss of logic and perspective. I dont want to have to leave you. So please, babe, come clean and get help. And heres a hint so you will know this is for you: Watch out for King Cobras on the beach at night. Particularly at the end of September. PS- if there are any women out there who have been flattered, bread crumbed, ghosted, or otherwise manipulated by a man in his 40s (40-46. He lies about his age. SMH) who they met here on Reddit, especially if he never seemed to never be able to meet up, and would like to help put a stop to his bullshit, PM me and well go from there. The one Im looking for would have displayed a strange mix of charming egotism with flashes of vulnerability and self-deprecating humor that made you want to try to build him up. He may have complained about how mean his wife is so you would tell him how cool he is. He may have even said he was single. He would have played hot/cold, the purpose of which was to keep you on the hook but unsatisfied, because you needing/wanting something from him made him feel good about himself. I have no interest in knowing anything about anyone who he may have interacted with. I just need proof that hes done it."

You opened yourself and showed me your vulnerability, and it awe me. Instead of running away, I was falling, deeper and deeper. While on the other hand, you were falling out of love. I don't know if I ever gonna move on from you, because even after all the things happen after we broke up, there still a spot for you in my heart. I know you will not come back to me, maybe it is the best thing for us. I just wish, there's gonna be someone out there whose gonna love me the way I love you, and he will help me forget about you.

I'd forget my insecurities and spend my days with you filled with honestly, sharing our deepest insecurities and starting anew every time something goes wrong.

My stereotyping of young mums with a child to another man burned brightly in the front of my mind as if holding my palm above a candle knowing that it would take all but a second to burn. Yet out of boredom, shallow attraction and my need to find love I chased you and here we were. I couldn't speak, words evaded me. My ego and confidence as a young man able to talk to women deserted me. I stood in awe of your long dark curls, piercing eyes and as the confidence drained from my skin and the Caterpillars metamorphosed into butterflies in a heart beat. I fell so utterly in love. I had been here once before. I knew the mindset as a man that was expected of me with the ""baggage"" you carry. You needed stability and to feel safe that I did not judge or hold against you your past. That I loved your daughter like my own. I had never so much as held a child before let alone parented one. You saw my damage and you vowed to help me connect again. You teased my vulnerability from me with gentle tendrils and soft spoken words. You held me as I cried and spoke of things I'd kept locked away since I was a boy. We became best friends, I was convinced you were my soulmate. That I would face the world with you. You sang lullabies of the future that danced above my head at night as our bodies entwined with perfect symmetry. My arms enveloped your shoulders as we slept and dreamed of growing old. When we fought you resorted to the dirtiest of tactics. Often telling me to leave you as a form of defence, unable to take any criticism as gentle reminders that being rude is just not fair. That nasty comments delivered with a hammer and blown down a barrel leave holes in a person that words of ""I didnt mean it"" just dont fill. My patience waved and my frustration grew and telling me to leave??? Those holes they just grew. We sat in court about to give witness reports on your abusive ex baby daddy. You sided with him, you venomously told me how much you regretted this. I felt like an outsider. Only to find out he plead guilty before we were required and your venom and anger turned to a short lived apology and an excuse of stress. Still my loyalty remained. I after all had promised myself to you in my head for life. I had told myself that I needed to be the dad your daughter didnt have. I was not perfect, I had no training. My only qualification was my determination to keep trying. Your defenses of telling me to leave, they never fell. I kept us together even when you were not sure. I made sure I was an anchor for you and I promised you I would not leave. You threw things at my head, you forced me to leave, I sat in my car for hours waiting for you to calm down. I did everything I could to show you I was serious about us, to show you my loyalty and that I truly believed you were my future. Because when we were not arguing, you were/are an angel. You saved me from so much. And then you left. You had filled my head with engagement rings and marraige proposals and future events with your daughter, with our future children. You sold me a life and then once I had paid in full. You took it away from me. I feel lost, I feel abandoned. I feel like a child was taken from me that I never knew I wanted. I feel like a life has been taken from me, a grounding and an understanding of where I fit into this world. You gave me importance and you gave me a purpose. And now your friends taunt me with the knowledge you are off at a party 24 hours later, being introduced to other men with intentions that bring me to tears. Whilst I sit here wondering how I put this all away and look for a new future."

I don't know if you'll find your way back here again and be able to read this letter after the last time I showed you how to get here. To this... wall of memories and feelings. I've only taken only one other person here and you remind me of him even though you're both completely different. You're him and everyone else as sea glass. You're him smoothened out after years of riding the waves. I used to pray that he'd come back. Well, maybe not him, rather, the attention he gave me. I guess you can say I've been waiting for you and dreaming of you for some time. Maybe even before that. Maybe as soon as I learned English. While I'm sure I'm still atoning for sins I don't remember, at the same time the universe must felt my pain enough to return what I was missing. Lacrimae rerum. The world weeps for humans. How blessed are the mountains to stand proud for thousand of years without having its heart broken even once? Tonight I feel really sad. It has been a long time since I felt this way. A dull aching pain that I thought has left long ago coming back again to visit. A guest I'm too tired to refuse. A guest that overstays and puts his feet on the table while chewing loudly. Until he hears your voice and leaves on his own as he comes to realize that I am not alone. We are lucky to have each other. Because we only have what we have this once. And only in this lifetime. There are more stars in heaven than a happy connection between two people. And yet we fail to look at this with more wonder. But I think I do, sometimes. Not like I look up at the sky much anyway. You give me a reason to keep going. We're not related by blood or marriage. There's not much I can give you. But when I close my eyes, I see yours, blue and green, and it takes me back to that place. Not a geographical place but a place I've been to many times. A place of acceptance. Where I could just be. Where I was happy. Maybe this pain will heal. After all, there's nothing stronger than the human heart. But I'll try to keep this vulnerability. This permission for affection. Just in case, you know? My world in recent memories has been a hallway with many sliding doors. Behind every sliding door is a different country with different characters. Recently, I've been afraid to open any more doors because I've come to realize that leaving is much harder than entering. But behind yours, I take a peek and I see lights and I hear waves of laughter and they make me curious. Also, your world isn't speaking in a foreign tongue that's almost impossible to decipher. Instead, it's a tongue I've come to take on as my own. No secrets. No unwritten rules. Nothing lost in translation."
190,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Vulnerability and loving you,1,f11gd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/f11gd8/vulnerability_and_loving_you/,2020-02-09 12:37:21,"Who knows if you'll read this. I feel quite sure you don't care, but that's okay. I love Bren Brown and her research on courage and vulnerability. I love that there are people out there learning how to love openly and fearlessly, even when there are no guarantees. Even when pain or getting hurt is possible, they take the risks, a leap of faith because what we want is usually on the other side of fear. The people who see that life is about the little things, that deep connection and emotions are some of the best parts of being human. I am one of them, even if I thought I was too much. I don't love in halves, I follow my instincts when they are as strong as they were with you. If I love you and I commit, then I'm all in and you get all of what I have. It's the only way I know. Life is too short not to be all in on something, especially when what we had so deeply extraordinary. We joked at the beginning that I could be a catfish even though I'm brutally honest and always forthcoming, impossible to hide what I think or feel. It became our running inside joke that if I was catfishing you then I deserved an Oscar. You came to understand that I truly do mean what I say and say what I mean - you loved that I love so deeply and that my courage fueled you, that I was so passionate about you. I was so open with you but you made it easy to be so, you welcomed it and you opened up to me too. You broke down walls I never knew I had. That connection was uncanny, I still marvel at how easy and lovely it was; you said I was so easy to love but never quite believed me when I said the same to you. You wrote beautiful words, sent poetry, making sure I felt special, wanted, seen, understood. You told me I was safe and needed, loved. We both could see the same kind of future together and I was so ready and willing to walk that journey with you. I opened up my entire heart and soul to you and you to me. You were taking steps towards me until the day the switch flipped. We were making our way forward, until we weren't. I was your friend as much as anything and with what we are going through, we both needed that. Yet with a flip of a switch, you erased me from your life, no real explanation or concern for me or how it affected me. Cutting off contact like I was doing something wrong to you. How any human can do that to another is beyond my ability to understand. All control was out of my hands from beginning to end; I fell in love before I had a chance to even realize it, and scary though it was I made the most of it, enjoyed it, saw the best in what we had for as long as I could. I was completely vulnerable with you and I got burned badly. Yet it won't stop me from being who I am. I am not angry or bitter. And as with life, there is a lesson in this mess somewhere. I wonder if I let you down or disappointed you somehow. Your forward progress was a beautiful thing to watch, you coming into your own and figuring out who you really are. Your unbridled joy, contagious and hearty laugh, goofy accents, affectionate nature, beauty inside and out - so many things I miss, things I saw when you were with me. I like to think I brought out some good in you, even if only for a short while. But to see you go backwards, halted by your own mind and fear of the 'what-ifs' and unknowns was excruciating. Your inability to vulnerable, to allow yourself to be hopeful and see the potential greatness and adventure and life you always wanted instead of what you stood to 'lose' are what Bren talks so much about. If I got too close or said something too lovely, you got uncomfortable. You were only vulnerable to a point, and then you just withdrew, walled me out or changed the subject. The saddest part is that I was never mean or ugly towards you. Yes I am emotional and outwardly so, but you cannot keep comparing me to your past experiences and shying away from any discomfort when there is so much beauty in the relationship at hand. A discussion is not a confrontation and we were actually good at communicating with each other. And there was so much we could have had together, so much that outweighed everything negative. It would not have been easy (nothing worth having comes easily), but together we could have done anything. We could have made life any way we wanted. Even now it is easy to picture, even if it breaks my heart. I stood by as you pushed me away, closed off emotionally, only for us to come back into each other's orbit. A bond, like the red string of fate, the connection was that deep and beautiful. We had something incredible, we were so lucky to find that special thing so many people are desperately looking for. I listened as you unraveled all of your frustrations about the past decade of your life, encouraged you to keep pushing forward, reminded you that you have choices and options; what you were used to is unhealthy and it drains your soul. But I guess I ask myself now why was I fighting so hard for you and us when you couldn't do the same for me? I remained steadfast even when you told me you felt shame and guilt, showing and telling you that I see you for you, and love all of who and what you are, the good and the bad; that we could navigate all of it together. I don't care if you have mental health struggles, I don't care that you are anxious. I love the person you are, which is very different from the person you view yourself as. I was determined and persistent, to a fault perhaps. You were always your own worst critic and listened to that negativity even in the face of such a wonderful experience, but even so I believed with time that would change too. We balanced each other out in ways I have never had before. I brought things that you needed and wanted, some you didn't realize. The same was true for me. Is that not the definition of a great match? Every time it got too uncomfortable or scary, you wanted me to walk away, placing that burden or decision on me somehow when you know I would never do it. How many times did I tell you I don't just give up at the first sign of trouble? Should I have been worried then that you were so quick to give up on me? I wasn't. I just fought for the relationship we had because it was worth it. Something that amazing doesn't just come along like that. Why would I walk away from the love of my life? Why would you ever ask me or even let me walk away when you feel what you said? If you love someone as you loved me, why would you ever push me out and erase me? Those are the questions I'll always wonder. You said you wanted me and this more than anything but when it came down to it, you could not stand up for us and fight for what we had. To do so meant you had to take the reins and make choices for you, to be who you are and build the life you truly want but you could not seem to do it. Realizing that, try as I may I will never understand it. I know what you felt, I saw it in your gorgeous expressive eyes, the love written on your face, the words unspoken, the words written in black and white. And still I tried to reach out when emotions calmed down, you denied me at every turn. To go from what we had to being made to feel like a piece of trash is absolutely unfair. You can cut ties and still have compassion for another person. You can reach out and check on me, if you care, by setting aside the rest and asking as a friend. I wanted you to be able to envision a life that you choose, that you want, that isn't what you started out in - because change is inevitable. Just because you have that life now doesn't mean you have to remain that way. No one deserves to be unhappy, stuck, unfulfilled regardless of circumstances. And I wanted you to allow me in far enough to give us a chance to build us too. I was so willing to do whatever I needed and could for you, to help you step into the life you wanted. Yet I watched helplessly as doubts and guilt pulled you backwards, undoing all of the cementing we had done. I don't know if it's that misery and fear of unknown is what you know, or if the thought of opening up to true happiness terrifies you because you maybe don't know what to do with it; regardless, I did everything I could and somehow still at the end, it could not have been worse. When you get scared, you run. This time you ran for good and I had no say in any of it, no way to understand or talk to you. You went back to your regular life, I was left to pick up the pieces of my vulnerable heart (the beautiful heart you said my previous partners never knew what they had) with no answers or understanding. I don't regret any of what happened. God I loved you, and you made it so easy to fall in love with you. Maybe I was just an escape for you, I will never really know. Despite all the great and wonderful times, at the end you treated me like I had done something wrong and I didn't deserve that. At our age, I expected better from you, I deserved empathy at the very least. And maybe that's part of being vulnerable - being able to say I am truly sorry, I really messed this up and I would like to talk about it. I can respect that you had to end it for whatever reasons you tell me and yourself. But to string me along, actively dreaming and giving me hope in the days and weeks before...to tell me everything is going to be okay and to trust, how you could not imagine your life without me and then mood swing hours later to: we are done, this is how it has to be, accept it and goodbye? How else do I interpret that but being treated like a piece of dirt? The actions just don't line up with the words. And you of all people understand how important that is. Only with a lot of reflection over the past few weeks have I been able to see that you maybe in a way, you wanted to prove you aren't worthy of deep love somehow? You have this notion that anytime something great comes your way that you don't deserve it, so it gets ruined or taken away. That alone breaks my heart, even worse knowing you believe you don't deserve the deep love I poured out because I wanted to and because the heart chooses what it does for reasons the mind cannot fathom. Mostly J, I pray and hope you figure out that being vulnerable is a strength, having the courage to feel everything even when it scares you means finding out who you are and what you are made of; and to embrace what pulls so hard at your heartstrings. Your huge heart and soul drew me in and that has been why it is a struggle to let you go. Knowing what you felt, what I felt, what we had.. it's hard to accept that you are willing to let it all go and how easily you can just not care because of reasons I don't know. You are not damaged, having mental health struggles is something I'm very familiar with too. And I would have spent my life showing you just how lovely and worthy you are, helping you believe in yourself the way I do. Making the choices and decisions that are best for you and your life do not equate to forsaking others; you will never make everyone happy and it isn't your responsibility to do so. You weren't put here to suffer in silence, you don't belong to anyone but you, and life changes. You aren't the same person you were 10 years ago. You have so much to offer the world and the people around you, but only as much as you are willing to accept you aren't perfect, that you are worthy of love, and that great things do happen and won't be taken away. You are allowed to be happy, you should be happy! Ignoring your heart and what you feel in your gut is only hurting you and betraying you. I hope, lioness, you rediscover your courage to live wild and free. And for what it is worth, I truly am sorry for causing heartache and pain, and any ways my emotions overwhelmed you. I don't understand why this is how it has to be, but it goes along with the rest of the unanswered questions. Things this way because you are making that choice. You know how I feel, you don't need forgiveness from me, and I don't expect anything. I will always hope to have your friendship at the least. My door is always open, I will always be a safe place to land, if you just need a friend or an ear to bend. You know how to find me. I hope that you will one day. -B ""To love someone fiercely, to believe in something with your whole heart, to celebrate a fleeting moment in time, to fully engage in a life that doesnt come with guarantees  these are risks that involve vulnerability and often pain. But, Im learning that recognizing and leaning into the discomfort of vulnerability teaches us how to live with joy, gratitude and grace."" (Bren Brown)"

But I know that he would be upset if I did. So Ill say it here. You are a stupid, useless, Snapchat filter obsessed, cheating, self deprecating brat. You snuck around behind his back with one of his close friends. You single handedly destroyed an entire friend group. When he asked you if you were OK... you said nothing. When he tried to talk to both of you you both lied right to his face. He knew something was going on between you two. But hes such a good person he gave you both the benefit of the doubt. He blames himself for finding you two in **his** bed. You couldnt even be a slut in your own? You had to take every bit of his ego huh? Disgusting. What I hate the most is that Im sure you dont ever even think about him. Yet you two eat at his brain. He is so handsome, logical, rational but you two drive him insane. Dont you fucking worry you stupid stupid little girl. Im taking good care of him now and Ill never do the things that you did to him. Im looking at you too K. Im a better friend to him than you ever were you spoiled little rich boy. Hope you and your whore of a girlfriend enjoy living off of your parents money. I hope she cheats on you too as soon as she finds someone who she thinks will fix her next. Ya know. Since shes too childish and immature to admit shes got a problem. Hope you enjoy each other. He...Hahaha who am I kidding. I hope you fail miserably. But... I.... I keep him safe now. Every day he spends with me is one less day he thinks about you two. Do you know within a month we went from hanging out 2 times a week. To now I see him every day. A Month. Do you know what you left behind? I see it every day. I see the way he looks at me now and I know that he used to look at you that way and you never appreciated it. Do you know he plays me guitar? Gets on his knees in front of me and plays it like a God. You get it? He says with a smile. Of course I get it. I see the passion in his eyes and I see the vulnerability he is constantly trying to hide. But he tells me he cries over TV Shows like BoJack. Yet he acts all tough because he is scared to show how damaged you and his shit family made him. I will never abandon him even if in the end we only end up staying best friends. He gave me a guitar just in case I ever wanted to learn. But he never even offered you that.... even though you linger in his mind every time he talks about you now its to point out yet another fatal flaw you have. The flaws he wishes he saw before he fell in love with you. I told him you hurt him so badly because you were his first love. But you know what? He tells me you werent and honestly I used to think he just said that to save my feelings.... but now Im starting to believe him... why? Because I think I might be his first love. He told me how long it took to open up to you and you only used it against him. Gaslighting him by telling him he didnt have to do things then throwing it in his face as soon as it was convenient. When we first became friends he used to reminisce about you. Now all he does is ponder about the mistake he made of being a friend of yours. I dont care if it takes a month, six months, a year. He is so good, so kind and he deserves the whole world and more. Ill give that to him in anyway I can. He asked me to hold him last night because it makes him feel safe. Did he ever show you that vulnerable side of him? Or did you manipulate him so badly that he felt he couldnt be himself around you? Because he tells me all you two did was bicker and have sex. I dont have to fuck him to get his attention. I dont have to yell at him To get him to listen to me. The same parking lot that you sat in the car and yelled at each other in (yeah he told me about that night) is the same one that he and I laugh, giggle and eat Wendys in at midnight. Do you know he joked about us getting married one night? I bet he never did that with you. Maybe he thought about it. The same way you thought about fucking K. Good thing he didnt act on his bad thoughts. You are an evil evil little girl who destroyed a beautiful man. I will pick up every piece of him that you destroyed and smashed and glue him back together so he is even better. Stronger. Powerful. We went grocery shopping together for the first time yesterday. Everyone who walked past us gave us that Awh how cute smile. The power went out in his house tonight. He wanted to play guitar because he saw you drive-by him tonight. Guitar is his medicine. So you know what he did? He was so triggered by seeing you he needed to see me. So he came here as soon as that power went off just so he could see me again. He says that its because the power went out. But I know how you make him feel. Sick to his stomach, but he was saving my feelings and didnt want to tell me I need to see you so I dont see her. So instead it was my power went out. Im coming to see you. I know you wont mind that. As soon as he saw me get out of the shower... since... you know..... were close enough already that he just walks in my house even if I dont answer his knock. Every bit of you that was stuck in his brain was gone. I used to think he talked about you so much because he was still in love with you. But the way he touches me so intimately but so so far from sexual shows me that he talks about you because he trusts me. Because he wants to share his deepest pains with me so I can deeply understand him in a way you never could. He told me that you used to be his confidant. But the things he tells me I can tell by the way hes so nervous to say them that hes never said them to anybody in the world. Ive never met his shit mother but for some reason he talks about me so highly with her that she thinks Im his girlfriend. He wanted to love you. He really did but all you did was push him away. Little did he know you were lying the whole time. You never cared for him. He just stroked your insecurity filled little ego. So you chained him up only so you could run off without him catching on to you. I hate you for him because hes too nice to hate anybody. Well except you K. Im sure hed love to test out his karate skills on you. Not even for stealing his girl but because he knew you were such a fuckhead and yet he was still your friend anyway. I take care of him now. He tells me you try to message him sometimes. The audacity. You stupid girl.. Next time you think about him; dont."

It is physical. This ache, this heartbreak, the vulnerability of allowing you in. I am not sure if this is a delayed reaction but I am sobbing. I am so thankful that my self esteem and my belief in who I am is mostly intact. Knowing all of that, does not seem to be enough to assuage my hurt. I have not felt like drowning my sorrows in ages. I feel that desire. I am fighting it. As I have said, I have spent the last 8 years working on myself. Trying to deal with my hurts, my issues or whatever you want to call them. My fear of not being adequate no matter how hard I try. Its a theme in my life and I have tried so hard to work past it. Being back in contact with you, even for the short time we were brought up so much. 12+ years. I loved you so hard through some really hard stuff. You couldnt give me what I wanted back then and that is ok. It was not personal but I had to move on. It seems like ever since I cut contact the first time you have gone downhill. After nearly 3 years no contact I took a chance and confessed my guilt of feeling like I abandoned you when you could not love me the way I wanted. I wasnt sure where we fit into each others lives but I wanted you in mine. You knew I was sober, you knew there was no way I wanted to go backwards and yet you tried to pressure me into some old weird space. I rejected it and in the process you. Why couldnt you have been ready then? It was not personal I had to tell myself. We were in different places. Was it because I had a supportive family? Was your dip downwards because you didnt have the support of your family? I have never judged you regarding that. I have always taken you at your word. I have never judged you for hurting. For feeling lost in this world. I have never thought you were beneath me or that you were anything less than amazing. We are so fucking different but I never cared because there was, is and always be something about you. Even after that time and going no contact for another 4 years. I thought surely after all this time she must be doing better. When i heard from you my heart skipped a beat. I felt so hopeful. Surely after 7 years she must be ready to love me. That hopeful wounded soul of mine dared to believe, ignored red flags and went in heart first. I couldnt help myself. Youre the one who has always held my heart. It never made sense on paper. It was science, chemistry. The draw to each other. Ive never felt that with anyone. I cannot contact you. It would be detrimental to my mental health. When I feel weak i read your last 20 text messages. I listen to your voicemail and I remind myself that I want to heal. I will heal and I will stop repeating patterns that cause emotional and mental damage. I am worth and god damnit you are too. Please show up for yourself. Please love yourself. Please invest in yourself. Please stay sober. You are worth the world. I forgive you for all the hurtful stuff you said to me. I forgive but I will remind myself of it when I feel weak. -MM"

I wish I could have three minutes with you; 30 seconds; hell even to see you would be enough. To tell you how guilty I am. To tell you I still dream about apologising to you after all these years. But I cant. You blocked me, for a good reason. You made the right choice. After all, despite how much I denied it, you have always been the smarter of the two of us. I was in a bad place at the time. This isnt an excuse, I know, but its my coping mechanism. Its what I tell myself to keep the guilt from drowning me. As I write this and cry, I cry due to happiness. Happiness that you found joy in life; a boyfriend; degree; a future. I am so God damn proud of you and I wish I could tell you this. I wish I could be there for you. I wish you could be there for me. I just wish...That I could take it all back. That I hadnt pushed you away, took advantage of your vulnerability and your caring, tranquil side. I hope one day you will forgive me, just as I hope one day I will forget you. You are beautiful and perfect. The only person I have ever truly, genuinely loved. Im just so sorry."

Even if its for a little bit. I always get butterflies in my stomach whenever you hug and swoop me off the ground. For once, I actually like being small. I love that you share your art with me. Im sorry I said that one of your paintings reminded me of Taco Bell. I was hungry. I love our text audio messages too. I love many things about you.

Its one in the morning and I want to sleep. You gave me hope that I could have a relationship based on shared personal values, and then you tempted me past my limit and I broke my values and crossed my lines. And I did it all with my hand in yours. I cant eve blame you because I made the decision too. You know, I used to believe that it was alright for men to cry and to really feel and express their feelings. And I still believe that for every other man, and I would comfort them if they wanted it in their moment of sobbing and vulnerability. But I dont believe it for myself anymore. Because of you. My eyes have teared up with every letter I try to write and I cant let myself cry because if I do... I dont even know. I think Im a better person now. I hope. But I still am so scared that my peers secretly dont like me. That wasnt caused by you, dear ex, but you definitely didnt help when you took all my secrets and shared them with your bestie. And you know what, maybe she didnt share them with anyone else, and maybe you didnt with anyone but her, but I still trusted you, and you still broke that trust. I told you I was paranoid about my privacy being violated and my secrets spilt. But you couldnt keep it in. I wish I could just block you in everything. But I know too well that youre better than you should be at lying and pushing blame. And Im scared what you would make me out to be. A monster that I would never wish to see let alone be. For people to see me as trash because you decided it would be better to be even more of a victim. I hate you. And I wish I didnt hate anyone. I wish that I could hope you have a great life but I dont. I do however hope I never see you again. Or have to think of you again."

There is nothing wrong with being a normal human being who does normal human being things. It's incessant lying about basics that infuriate me. That's the last thing to absolve from my list. I no longer care about truth, openness or honesty. If all things are eventually up to myself and my own internal weather. I won't ever again seek out complete deconstruction or expect transparency. I won't ask for anything. I will just be. I suppose it's true that the only way to be a perfect counterpart is to maintain a disconnect. No two souls can truly merge. It has been an interesting 3 years of blind trust, vulnerability and a seemingly radical honesty. I think I was meant to reach the point I am at now before I met the Norse painter. I failed to see the lesson of grace lain in front of me by the matriarch palindrome. How is it that I learnt and integrated such valuable lessons from the Cyber princess, yet failed to maintain the spiritual integrity needed to properly understand the lessons that were being shown to me after. Am I not meant to get stronger with each step, I have gradually grown weaker in my determination and will to prioritise myself. Maybe I am wrong, maybe I have grown stronger in my will to accept, to offer and to be truly empty. Perhaps that softness and malleability is where the enlightened lay. Perhaps I immersed myself too far into this sacrificial removal of self. Perhaps my ego blocked all communication between the anima and the self. I know I never felt a stake in the things that I was perceived as overly egocentric for. It's possible this is the map, I've lived this before, these are the final pieces to put together. Maybe I needed to experience what that side is like, the side of being villified. I was certainly very bored with things before, I could read and infiltrate people too easily, I could see what needed to be done to achieve the superficial goals around me and I chose instead to play with fireballs. Intentionally removing myself from those very possible life paths. Maybe I've always known that I'm coming to the end of the karmic cycle. What's left is to experience all of these unique forms of suffering. So I can I combat it properly the next time around as 9. Women hold the secret knowledge. Women hold the lessons I seek. Women have always recognised me as a baby boy looking for answers and seeking them as teachers. The 1st meant princess The 2nd meant grace The 3rd meant love Now all of my torments swirl and well inside me, and they will certainly work with me for only a royal, gracious and loving second half of life. Perhaps all the pieces of this are exactly how the journey was meant to be all along. I went seeking the treasure of my heart only to find it was where I stated all along, and only to lose it as fast as I found it. The lessons and knowledge I now posses might be what makes my own heart treasured by another seeker. Maybe I'll die at 54."

Its because you dont support me when Im feeling strong emotions. Youve never asked me how I was feeling after a breakup. You werent happy for me when I got my Make-A-Wish trip. When I was asked to speak at the Make-A-Wish donor dinner, I got all dressed up, I was nervous, but I felt like I looked nice. All you said to me as I was leaving was, Are you wearing a bra? To which I said No and you responded with, I can tell. You couldnt even say something remotely supportive to me, you had to launch an attack before I could get out the door. When we would fight when we were younger, I would get really emotional and start yelling, and you would get quiet and taunt me. You had this sense of superiority because you had kept control. But do you know what else you did? You pushed me away. I hope your victories were worth it, because I dont even know how to talk to you. Me shutting down is a fear of being rejected and criticized by you like I have been time and time again. I feel like we barely know each other but I dont reach out because you scare me. I feel like when I show my emotions, or my true self, you judge me. Thats not the kind of person I want to go to for support. Do you remember when I came to you after my Tinder date assaulted me in his car? You said I shouldve known better because he looked creepy. You blamed me for getting attacked. You make me more nervous than any other person I have ever known. I looked up to you so much as a kid, all I wanted was to impress you and be like you. But you got mad when I tried to be like you. But you also made fun of the things I did that were too different. I still havent found a way to impress you. Im a sensitive person, Im easily hurt, but I dont like to show that side to you. Vulnerability isnt my strong suit so when I start to feel sad and weak, I hide it with anger. I feel like I have to be fake with you and that breaks my heart because all Ive ever wanted from you was a big sister who is willing to hug me when I cry, who will listen to me when Im scared, who will share their genuine emotions with me and let me be there for them, too. Now I want you to think hard about this one. Imagine, from the point of your earliest memories youve understood that youre sick and going to die before many of your friends. As you grow up, you start to feel sicker, and sicker. Youre scared and want someone to talk to. So, you talk to your friends about it and they all say they dont want to hear about sad things. Youre feeling isolated, so you think, I know who will be there for me! My big sister! Wrong. She doesnt want to hear about it either, it makes her uncomfortable. So, you go to your room to be alone, like you always do."
198,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,A Genuine Letter To My Best Friend;,1,f3ouv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/f3ouv6/a_genuine_letter_to_my_best_friend/,2020-02-14 18:35:51,"Im sorry I took my detective skills to a level that upset you. I know I said sorry 100 times but I knew you were hiding something from me. You have known since the beginning that my DID and Psychosis were apart of my life. Something I cant always control. Something that takes over me like a possession. From the first day we hung out again we connected in a way I couldnt understand. I found out you did terrible things in your past but I can see it in your eyes and how you talked to me that you are ashamed of that past. I didnt feel afraid of you. I was only scared to lose you. I see that you are changing for the better. I was so angry because I was projecting everything I never got to say to the men who hurt me in the past onto you. So Im sorry I called you a monster but I dont believe you are one. At first you were angry, justifiably so. I had no right to invade your past like that but I just care for you in a way I never imagined. I matched with a random person on tinder just so I could talk about you with someone who didnt know either of us. He didnt think you were a monster either. I couldnt get you out of my head. I think you felt the same. We were so deeply in sync my phone vibrated after the Tinder guy dropped me off... I just knew it was you before I even looked at my phone.... after 2 days of us not talking saying you were ready to talk. I was scared to tell you what I knew. Terrified because what if you **were** a monster? Would you hit me? Would you scream? It was 10 PM and you said you werent gunna do our normal 3AM but to meet you downstairs in a few minutes. My heart dropped because when I got into your car I thought I was going to be seeing my best friend for the last time. We started heading to the gas station. You werent expecting me to know the things I know. I wasnt expecting you to be so understanding. I wasnt expecting you to be so honest with me. Especially because honestly it was none of my damn business. You werent forgiving at first. You asked me how we could ever be friends after I did it? You said we were nothing alike but then.... Then you realized we are one in the same. Passionate for the truth. Desperate for it. Ive written two letters now one in the perspective of who I thought you were. The other in the perspective of who you thought you were. I realize now youre neither of those. You arent a victim or a villain and either am I. You are you through and through. She told me of this dark side of you. Ive seen your light side but last night you showed me the grey area of you. I think the grey I like the most. So thats who this letter is to. What started as frustration ended as understanding. You helped me realize that not all people who make terrible mistakes are terrible people forever. I helped you realize that letting out your demons to someone who understands can really clear your head. Otherwise theyll eat you alive. I still thought you were gunna tell me to get out of your car and never turn back once we pulled into my driveway... But you shut the car off and just started talking... and talking and we had an adult conversation about a serious matter. You didnt yell or belittle me. You listened to me cry about how sorry I was and why I did what I did. You told me to stop and that it wasnt that big of deal. I mean it is a big deal but you are being too hard on yourself. I asked why you even wanted me in your life and you cut me off because you thought I was being ridiculous. You were so nice to me and I was the one who did wrong. Then you finally started talking about *her*. For the first time since you and I became friends you were talking about her in reality and not in the delusional fantasy you made up about her. It was like the things I told you made everything click. At first you denied that you were crazy like me as I had told you. But then you started referring to yourself and you past behavior as psychotic. The word I wanted to use but didnt want to make you upset. You realized you *were* infatuated with her but something about our conversation had changed that. All the wrong things **she did to you** started to pop out of your mind. Why you started cheating on her. She was no longer this angel that you damaged. You remembered how and why it got so bad between you two. I could see the weight slowly lifting off your shoulders with every word you confessed. Like I was a priest and you were a sinner. You said, her and I would have worked out if we could have talked through things the way you and I always do. But she was too childish and you were too angry. A toxic ticking time bomb. But us? We solve everything we have gone through. Good and bad.... this being the first bad. You were so angry at first for what I did. Yet so considerate and in check. You could have flipped out but you didnt. In the end you thanked me because I did what you couldnt do. I just asked for the whole truth. I asked in a reasonable tone and I listened. Its something you couldnt do back then but you always do with me. Another change for the good in you. You began to process why she did what she did. Yes I lied to you and told you I didnt talk to her. But in reality she was the only one I talked to. All she did was play the victim when I talked to her. She never once took responsibility for anything. At least when you told me your side you told me some of the bad things you did. You didnt want me to be afraid of you which is why you didnt tell me the whole story. But she made herself out to be an angel. I got to tell you all the things you wanted to know from her. You thanked me because you needed to hear it. She will always love and care for you but you two were a time bomb that exploded and she cant have you in her life. Then you realized that all you were supposed to be were friends. That you loved her as a friend and the reason why your relationship failed immediately is because you mistook that friendship love for romantic love. But you both were desperate for whatever you could get. I see what you meant now when I called her your first love and you denied it. Then we started laughing like the crazy assholes you and I are about the crazy shit we did to land in that moment. Sitting in your car. Watching the beautiful snow slowly cover your windshield. Time stops when Im with you while simultaneously flying by. Five hours we sat in that car. The fight was long over after 2.5 of them. Hell I cant even call it a fight because did we even fight? Or were we just talking about a really sensitive subject. A subject that ruined a part of our brains in completely separate ways. It was such an intense conversation but it was so passionate. You said our lives were mirrors of each other. There was so much acceptance and realization rushing into your head. I could almost promise that my ex doesnt feel remorse for what he did to me the way you feel it for her. Even you said it. He looks evil in his pictures. But you are always smiling. Even if you can see the pain in your eyes. You told me why you hate drinking and smoking. Its the same reasons I hate them. Something you and I didnt know about each other. I love learning about you. You grabbed my hand at one point, telling me your shoulder was sore and you wanted to know if I could feel any knots. I dont think it was necessary but I think you wanted me to touch you. I was so close to your face all I wanted was to finally kiss you. But touching you relieved all the anxiety I had. I felt so out of line even thinking about kissing you so I brushed it off and said guess you have to wait til I see you again because I cant give you a massage in the car. You started telling me the good news about picking up another Kids Class at the Dojo. Which means youre going to be a Sensei soon. **Your dream.** You were so happy and it made me smile just as big. We were just talking like we always do. It was like that fight never happened. It wasnt like toxic avoidance where we pretended nothing happened. It was healthy. A beginning, a middle and an end. We moved on, peacefully and happily. You were watching the stars and the snowfall and you said, Im not even mad at you honestly. I really thought I would be but I get it. You did the same thing I did when I wanted to know what they were hiding from me. You wanted to know what I was hiding from you because I realize now it deeply affected you. The same way it affected me. Neither of us had a right to do what we did but we just couldnt help it. I smiled and just kept talking. If I stopped talking I would have started happy crying. You turned on the car to start to defrost the windows. **2AM now....** well at least it wasnt 3AM like you asked. Haha. I think you were just as shocked as me that it was that late. You told me you wanted to take some space for a few days before we hung out again. I told you you didnt have to do that. That if you never wanted to talk to me again Id underst..... You cut me off again telling me I was being dumb. I dont know why but I love when you say that. You always say it with a smile on your face. You dont like calling me crazy even though youd be absolutely right. I am so so thankful to have you in my life. You dont even like the kinkster lifestyle but you love indulging in it with me. You would be a wonderful master to me. Hell you **are** one. I looked you in the eyes and told you I didnt care about a relationship and I dont. But no one will ever compare to you and its officially been 24 hours since I stepped out of your car. I hope you sleep well tonight. You know damn well I would have told you that if I didnt respect you and your wanting space. I wanted to ask how your class with the Kids went. But I want you to miss me as much as I already miss you. So as hard as it is not to talk to you right now. I know that youll message me soon so we can hang out again. I know that your life can be overwhelming and that you need time to process things completely alone. Just know Im 22 and Im ready. To hold your hand through every bad thing you face whether it be as your friend or one day your wife. I meant it when I said I want to be there to support you through everything. To be your cheerleader. Ill do anything to keep you safe emotionally because I know youll do anything to keep me safe physically. We see each other vulnerability. I didnt believe in soulmates til I met you. I thank my lucky stars that our last names were only a letter apart and no one had a name of the letter inbetween. I would have never been forced to sit in front of you. I would have never spent that entire school year looking forward to seeing you in just that one class everyday. I never would have even thought to swipe on you on tinder. I never would have been brave enough to just be comfortable around you. My therapist told me Id never make real progress until I had something to lose. Well last night I almost lost you and you saw all of us for the first time. I even slipped up and called myself her and she. You noticed it and kind of smirked. You find me intriguing more than terrifying. You saw my alters and realized I really am more than one. There was a strange and new feeling we all collectively felt after seeing you smile how it glowed like magic in the dark.... Im in love with you Senpai."

After an spent of getting drunk and high we hung out together in a shed. I can't remember who initiated it but I was at on your lap and we platonically cuddled. You were so lovely to me and said about how small and dainty I was, like a little sister you wanted to protect. We talked about our lives and adventures, with different sexual orientations we found a common ground of shitty experiences. I didn't tell you but the week before, I was manhandled aggressively by someone who came to my flat and I didn't know how to stop them. They didn't touch me but I was scared and switched off, they did when we met again. In being around you, I felt safe for the first time in a very long time, I've never felt so affectionate to someone before. Instead of my vulnerability being exploited or resented, you understood and embraced it. When your sober friend kept trying to edge near me by going to you, you made sure I was safe on you and that I wouldn't leave. At one point sober friend complained about being a cuck, but we were too engaged in conversation to acknowledge the bitter remarks. I'm so glad that I met you and you definitely wouldn't remember this because you were off your head, but thank you so much for protecting me in that way. You were so gone by the time you left that you didn't hug me goodbye, sober friend begged you for a hug instead, I'll admit that it hurt a little but I understood. We'll probably never see each other again and nobody else would understand how special that night was, but I want to thank you with all my heart."

I know you never have. I gave you my virginity before I knew. I was somewhere around ten years past my due date and my ""innocence"" was starting to gnaw at me. A 26-year-old virgin? She's the butt of a joke. Ha. I was so self-conscious when we first had sex. You made me feel safe. When you fell asleep next to me that night, you mumbled, ""I love you."" I didn't know then that that was the only time I would hear those words from your lips. I wish I had cherished it more. I was in trouble from the moment I met you. I've never believed in cliches until I met you and I suddenly couldn't breathe. I couldn't fathom how someone so devastatingly handsome could be interested in me, a plain recluse who would rather spend her days in the pages of books than interacting with other humans. But you *saw* me. You saw me and I *melted*. Two years I have supported you. Two years I have stood by your side. I've helped you dress for other dates, encouraged you when they didn't go well, celebrated with you when they did. I've talked you down from suicide attempts and I've cried myself to sleep, sick with worry for you. Since I met you, I've watched you grapple with inadequacies. You want what we all want: someone you can establish a deep, profound connection with, someone who will reassure you of your worthiness and maybe even spark your belief in yourself, someone who will desire you desperately. Someone you can trust with your vulnerability. Someone who gets your idiosyncrasies and adores you for them. Someone you can love fiercely and who will love you just as wildly. Sometimes, I wish I could be that person for you. I fulfill some of those roles sometimes, but I know I can't be all of those things for you. You don't love me. You never will. It hurts, not because I want something you can't give but because I hate seeing you so heartbroken and lonely. I want to be your glue. I want to fix the broken parts of you. I wish I had the strength to trust you to fight through the hard days. I wish I had the strength to let go, to prioritize myself over you. I love you. So, so much. But I am not in love with you. Not anymore."

To the people who wrote my school reports detailing how I would ignore everyone in spite, that I was lazy, uncooperative, rude. To the school superiors who officially stated that I could hear the teacher from anywhere in the room, who rejected my mother and the audiogram that proved that I was severely Deaf. I was 7 years old. Through a childs eyes, adults were the voice of reason. Reason I made sure I listened to. I stared at your mouth, copied work, strained my ears to the point of physical exhaustion just to please you. In return, you laughed at me. Called me dumb. Publicly humiliated me. Matured the growing anxiety within me to the point where pissing myself where I stood was emotionally safer than asking your permission for the bathroom. For the only friends I made in secondary school. 15 years later, Im still finding out about the insults you made to my face. The drama you put me into for sport. The jokes you made at my expense. Thought you could get away with it forever, didnt you? To the 6th form teacher who looked me in the eye and smirked as she lied about the things she said. 20 students witnessed the constant ableism I experienced at your hands. The college took your side, and 5 years later, it seems as though they still do. To the government who sat me down and interrogated me needlessly, asking me why I hadnt yet killed myself, rejecting my claim to disability twice before accepting my medical proof. Scandal doesnt scare you, does it? After all, who would trust the word of a disabled woman? To the man and the woman who took advantage of my emotional vulnerability and physical inability to consent, on two separate occasions. To the men and women who continue to glorify me and use my story as a cheap shot at inspiration. Im building my own path with the blood that I shed when you cut me. The bruises you inflicted on my body and mind create a constellation on my soul, a Jackson Pollock of bravery in the face of adversity. You may have hurt me.. but you didnt kill me."

Im fine with being causal friends - but you did inspire me to look a little deeper into myself, and I am always grateful for being inspired :) In hindsight, I trail back to a conversation we had at the casino; I had said that sometimes I dont feel like people ever truly get to know me; that I feel like that line from ES; ""Im just a fucked up girl - whose trying to find her own piece of mind"" - that people liked the idea of me, to them I was a concept - something that could complete them, or save something within themselves...and I replay it; trying to remember what your reaction had been, if you looked down, away; or touched your face...I cant remember. I wish I had paid more attention. Then later; as if in a self fulfilling prophecy: After, in typical BPD fashion, I had bluntly questioned the validity; or even the existence of your feelings in relation to your actions; when you failed to fill my irrational need for attention. I ungracefully fell from my own self-sabotage. In actuality I was being triggered by a very real fear of abandonment before it was even happening. In retrospect, I am completely self aware of what I was doing, but desperate for a different ending than the one that always comes. Black and white thinking, all or nothing reaction based completely upon emotion. Then, it came: you then told me that you didnt think, ""dating was conducive to our schedules"" and gave me the grand old friend zone; stating ""I dont know you enough, to know if I like you; romantically..."" - ouch. The rest I didnt hear, or read, or even keep on my phone. Because, you see, I already knew that's what would happen. It had been designed all so specifically. So clich; was all I could think. When the real me shows up, and the cracks no longer form a pretty pattern, and the flaws are no longer quirky or endearing, when the emotions get real - you realize youll never knowme, Ill never know you either, because well both end it before it has a chance to start. Different game plan, aligned objective. Im easily led, and I put too much stock into things too quickly, let me burn it out before it has a chance to be kindred, rush the ending before it crashes down on me. Perfect protection plan. Whether it be my own self-sabotage of questioning (that I am fully aware of NOT being conducive), or your arms length turning into introverted defense mechanisms, we both lead to be lead. Im the manifestation of the cool girl, the real life manic pixiedream girl. The Clementine, the Susanna Kaysen, Tiffany trying to win the dance competition- the 500th day of Summer, ""just a fucked up girl"" But IRL, its not as ironically beautiful as it is on film. All those girls are legitimately fucked up, and they rarely ever get to tell their side. Penny Lane runs out of cool things to say, people start to feel overwhelmed or quite simply people leave, ""if you never take it seriously, you can never get hurt"" - but people get hurt anyway. If it isnt somehow tragic, melonchalicly dramatic, can it even be beautiful? The problem with the ""concept of me"" is youre only shown a one-sided, often without inner dialogue, character. The real thing; its too much, Im too intense, too needy - I am flawed if I'm not free; but yearning not to be free because I am so flawed. When the words hit, they are vivid adjectives and intense emotions that push the intended away. The sheer velocity of their honesty, its overwhelming - for so many people. Then the extreme shame for expressing that honesty afterward is often nothing short of a sort of diabolical self-loathing. Youve obviously experienced this. I unloaded those emotions on you, and then I hated myself for it. Was I a concept to you? Your lack of commentary, erring on the ""good guy"" staple answer to my emotional reaction to your ending the ""trying to get to know you better"" phase spoke volumes without saying a word. BUT I cannot place negativity on the latter statement, because - I too; boxed you up and was intrigued by what was outwardly presented to me. I stated that you ""didnt need to reply"" but instead my push/pull mentality craved emotional validation. How would you even know that; would you even care? It doesn't matter. In the earlier days of our slightly reappearing/disappearing flirtatious ways of communicating I compartmentalized my categorization of you as a ""different kind of guy"" than I usually go for; and I unknowingly idealized you because of your innate talent of creating the air of emotional vulnerability. I, in actuality, was actively participating in directly playing out my own most hated clich from the opposite side - I liked the concept of you; maybe I thought you could maybe complete me, understand me, finally someone who could potentially validate me. When in all actuality all your ability to feel so deeply and relate to such sadness and hurt and create such beautiful writings comes from somewhere deep and dark, some time in your story where youve been robbed of security, trust, and or love - and that what makes you tragic and magnetic, and albeit, what also makes you completely unavailable. Dancing the line of projection and mirroring what we want to understand in ourselves; or myself anyway - I am drawn to the familiarity -but also taken a back at what this shows me; two humans with the extreme capacity for emotion, empathy, and understanding subconsciously ending things, almost always, before they can begin. Desperate to love and be loved; but who will endlessly complicate the situation so they may revel in that familiar protected state of undamaged - AND UNFEELING emotion; or at least in this particular short chapter of us. Ultimately, making you closed off, distant, and not so easy to get to know; and myself eccentric, intense, and overly emotional. Two sides of one coin...therefore actually dooming anything before it ever even had a chance to happen. Operation defense mechanisms. Game over. But at least we will never have the chance to ruin each other; the coin toss will always go unmatched. You tragic, and me dramatic. cya around"

You won't talk. You close me off. You intentionally twist my words and my meanings. You gaslight me, straight up denying you've done the things you have. It makes me question my own perception of reality. You won't have an open and honest conversation about anything. You get into a mood but won't work through why, only making sure I know it's my fault somehow. You leave me in silence, always guessing, always on the back foot, always trying to puzzle it out, caught up still in something that happened days or weeks ago because for some reason leaving me confused and alone is fun for you. Okay, I'm not a perfect person, but I sometimes wonder what the hell I have done to deserve this. It's kinda sad, you know. You so much like being in control, having the upper hand, getting the last word, and pulling my emotional strings, that you can't be vulnerable for one second, or honest and open. That kind of power is hollow and empty. The real strength lies in vulnerability. This time is different.

So much. I will never express any of this because it's best I try and keep you at arms length, but you have no idea how much of a blessing you are these last few months. You've invested enough time trying to break down my walls but I've strategically kept them held up for reasons you'll maybe learn once all your desires and passions for me run out. I'm holding back a lot of what makes me 'me', to preserve and keep interesting what we have until we run it into the ground. Neither of us are actually interested in discussing my darkness or trauma so I refuse to shine any light on it. It's better that you're playing the part of the patient instead, since I won't ever hurt you and you can't ever hurt me, so it works out beautifully. It's actually quite refreshing not talking about my shit and being the sane one in a relationship, to be honest. You've discovered recently how much of your crazy I can weather without being phased, but you don't know just how much I understand it and how minuscule it is in comparison to the unfathomable mountains of madness I've been at the mercy of in my own minds darkest days. You think you're a broken POS but other than me being impressed and charmed by how well you can put yourself down, I think you're pretty alright. I low-key enjoy the unpredictability and stimulation of your particular brand of fucked up. It's easy. And shit yes it helps that you're so ridiculously attractive and for some reason you're still thinking I am as well. But I've learned hard lessons that lust and love do not last, so unless we can be smart and switch the dynamic to friendship after what we have runs its course, we were ultimately doomed from the start. So while we're still enjoying our time together, I'll continue to look out for myself and won't tell or show you what lies behind my walls, so when we inevitably fall out, I won't feel so exposed and deserted. I'll be able to walk away with my secrets intact, my vulnerability on a tight leash, my dignity in your memories preserved and my investment only at a safe return as opposed to lost. I'll never tell you I love you, no matter how tempting, not just because my heart is as cold as the possum behind the bar, but because it would be a lie since I won't be sharing all of myself with you, and I think you know this now as I can sense a storm brewing. You're a few years too late. But thank you for trying and for all the warmth and all the good times and distractions from the grind you constantly insist upon us. I promise to make our time together as healthy and healthy as possible and to let us down gently. Xo"

Astrology is one of my hobbies. It keeps me out of trouble and it helps me to make sense of some of myself- even if it's all just hypothetical, I enjoy it. Whenever something happens that ""makes sense"" with the planetary transits, I can't help but reflect on it. I'm quite introspective- it's a quality I gained from spending most of my waking life on my own, left with my thoughts. You call it overthinking. I call it reflection. I call it willingness. I call it vulnerability. Given the characteristics of Mercury Rx, it doesn't necessarily surprise me that somehow, after like four years, we ended up almost running into one another today. I wasn't surprised, but I was definitely caught off guard. I panicked immediately. I wanted to leave but there were so many people around me and I was kind of just stuck there... So I pretended that nothing was happening. We both did. It struck me as oddly timed because I was just reflecting on my feelings around what happened to make us stop trusting each other. I wonder if I accidentally manifested it? It was just a weird coincidence I guess. I tried to act normal but I felt sick because I just kept thinking about ... like, everything? Like how I wish I didn't hurt your feelings or worry you for so long or burden you ever at all. I also think about how hurt I was too though, and while I wasn't able to articulate or even understand what was going on for me then, I feel like there's not 100% fault on either side of things. I also assume it doesn't bother you nearly as much as it bothers me, because you didn't lose anything when we lost contact. Actually, you probably gained some peace. I get why we can't talk and I have accepted it 100%. That's why I'm not sending this. I'm still allowed to be sad, right? I have a lot of mixed emotions about the situation but I'm not about to voice them into the redditsphere. I get overwhelmed when it's all in my brain,, but not overwhelmed in the same way that I used to. I'm actually so much more skillful with tolerating and experiencing emotions. So much has changed for me in the last two years. Even I'm amazed because I didn't think that life could ever be different. I'm rambling now. It wasn't the time and place to have a conversation. We both had places to be. I was late for class. I don't know where you had to be but I'm sure it was important to you. Well, if anything, now I know that there's absolutely no need to hold onto any thread that I once believed still connected us. I will always be grateful for the role you played in my life.

You didnt even really seem interested in the end, which couldve been you pulling away like I tried but was unable to, but I really dont know. That last night, I needed to see you one last time, and despite knowing how stupid it was, I cant regret it. The utter exhaustion was worth the comfort I derived from your closeness. Im so sorry for everything Ive done since then. I had never before had romantic feelings for anyone, and I guess I didnt know how to balance that attachment with keeping you as a friend. You probably think Im a despicable person now, if you ever think of me at all. God, I hate how I embarrassed myself with you. I get why you blocked me; hell, I wouldve done the same. Cant say it doesnt hurt, though, even now. I still want to provide you with updates about my life and think of you when I hear certain songs. I hope this doesnt make me a head case. I realize we saw each other for a very short amount of time and didnt exactly divulge everything about ourselves (I wish Id dug deeper about the meaning behind that tattoo), but I still got attached and still wish I had been mature enough to keep you in my life.

You can make me love or hate myself in a single sentence, and I dont like when someone has that control over me.

It couldnt be from you, could it? We play this beautifully depressed waltz. You begin with light small talk for a few weeks. I swear to myself that it never goes beyond that. Then you show vulnerability. It is just a small glimpse. In fact, I often wonder if you mean to show it at all, but it is there. You look concerned when people whisper, and you think it is about you. You worry about not being as successful as the rest of your family. You teeter on the edge of not feeling good enough. Then you go back to the next extreme. You over boast your confidence, and I begin to wonder if your feelings for yourself or anyone are genuine at all. I tell myself that when I see those vulnerable moments, I will help. After all, I know what it feels like. I show you softness thinking that maybe this will be the time. Maybe something will finally break through, and I will understand you. But it doesnt happen. You go back to leaving me on read. You go back to no replies, and I hate every inch of myself for falling for it. You tell me your stories with every other woman, and I cringe at the though of how similar our first kiss was to those. I realize you play the game well. So well that I dont realize that I am even a part of it. I feel the sinking in my stomach when I realized that the moments that were special to me probably mean nothing to you. And then I begin the self hatred. Maybe, if I was prettier he wouldnt do this. Maybe if I was skinnier. Maybe if I acted cooler. Maybe, just maybe if I didnt let my emotions lead me, this wouldnt have happened. But it does. It always does. And we end this beautifully dying dance with both of us having hurt feelings and not talking. It doesnt last. In a few months to a year we will pick back up, and embrace each other once again. Ill feel special for a brief moment, and maybe you will feel powerful again. I hope and pray that we are finished with our enchantment. I also hope and pray that I am wrong. I debate whether I want you gone or I want to keep risking the hurt. Im willing to tear myself apart just to be with you, but only little bits at a time. Not all at once. So I remove you from everything and tell myself that I will do better. But what is better? Some days I forget you, and I can somewhat function. But today... I cant. I dont know how to express to you what I feel, and I doubt you would even care at this point because you have moved onto the next dance partner, but Im standing on the wall debating to leave or stay for one more turn with you. I should take all the signs and realize that there were no true feelings coming from you, but I cant. I cant shake the feeling of your vulnerability. I cant shake the idea that for brief moments you wanted me for more than just lust too. Maybe. Maybe you will decide that for me. Because you are the only person that can make me feel like standing still is where I need to be right now. You."
211,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,I cant help loving you,2,f8hh2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/f8hh2z/i_cant_help_loving_you/,2020-02-24 09:55:25,"J-We saw and understood each others inner pain/struggles, we loved each other in a gentle way that we had always wanted and needed. The first year of our relationship was really great. The second year came with a lot of struggles regarding your trauma manifesting as avoidance to our deep emotional connection, and mine manifesting as anxious attachment style. It sucked. I tried to support your healing in every way that I could, I did a lot more work than I should have. And I realize a lot of my own mistakes, and Ive owned up to them with you. Our breakup last year was a long time coming, because we had a lot of healing left to do before we could ever move forward. I tried remaining your friend, because I loved you so deeply despite the pain our love brought. We triggered our childhood wounds too well and werent equipped to use them as healing opportunities. You recently still didnt want to own up to your part of the mistakes made and still were deflective. A lot of the same toxic habits you had were manifesting while mine have truly changed and grown. I no longer think and act through my inner child, all of me guides me. Being your friend and still having the wounds of loving you made it very easy for you to disrupt the peace and stability I worked so hard to build. When I mentioned this with as much tact as I could-you went straight for the block button versus talking to me. Im confused still about my feelings. I dreamt of you last night, and we were cuddling with the cats like we used to. Being goofy and laughing about our stupid inside jokes that often pertain of really odd noises and no words. Its the most vivid dream Ive had in awhile. I keep hoping that one day youll get to moving on from your inner child wounds or learn to manage them too. Because outside of that we were so beautiful together. We were so pure and gentle, our spontaneous adventures were amazing. We got to do a lot of cool things like see wild horses at the beach, dream about renovating old homes, and moving overseas. Spending NYE with you in a hotel with champagne. Going to this odd museum where this man interrupted our art analysis with a loud and disgusting fart-you ran and I stayed out of shock and embarrassment. Petting bb goats and eating goat cheese. Slurped trips and video game battles. I had fun indoors and outdoors. It was always like a sleepover fest with your best friend. Sometimes I wish we could start over. Neither of us is having fun dating other people, I know you know its not the same. Opening up to others is hard but for us it was immediate waterfalls of vulnerability. I dont attain that easily, I have to fight for that. Is there a phrase for soulmates that dont end up together? Because I feel that way about you. Dreaming of you made me go through some of our old photos and videos and fuck were we cute. Just two big old soft bbs. I hope in another parallel universe end up soulmates that end up as life partners. I hope we meet in another timeline where you are at the same healing point Im at now and we work through the shit in a healthy way and I give you space while you are present/accountable. Ill always love you, and Ill keep working on myself to hopefully experience something like that again one day"

You might like some of them. If you reach out again, I'll share them with you. I'm done hiding away. Done protecting myself. It just makes me weird and frightened. And, it doesn't work anyway. I end up running in circles like some frightened animal. Snarling unthinkingly at anyone who gets too close, then asking why they stay so far away. If you don't come back, I understand. I wouldn't either. You must think I'm insane. If you do, I'll be different. Not ruled by fear. Not so guarded. Not so worried about potential hurt. If you don't- I'm still better for having met you, for learning that I am ok, and vulnerability won't kill me. And...for learning he doesn't own me anymore. Thank you."

I don't know if I could stop. You know how to feel empathy. I know this because I used it against you before. You felt empathy for me when I came to you after my great-grandmother died. I used that to start the love-bombing phase. You felt empathy for me when I told you I couldn't afford the books for the classes that I wasn't taking. I used that to convince you and your parents that I was worth the investment. You felt empathy for me when I lied to you about why I was getting kicked out of Ewing. I used that to convince you that I was a victim. You felt empathy for me when my friend took his own life. I used that to convince you that my next failure was the result of circumstances beyond my control. I don't know how to stop. That's the problem with me. That's the problem with all abusers like me. Every vulnerability, every emotional opening, every chink in your armor; those aren't signs of love to me. They're opportunities; opportunities for exploitation. That I recognize it now isn't noble, or a sign of healing. It's yet another indicator to me that I'm better; that I'm superior. I know I have a monster inside of so I'm a better person than those who don't know. Never mind that it's the monster who's telling me that I'm better; I don't care where the validation comes from, just so long as it comes. I can make you empathize with me again. I can slide back into your world, insidiously, and you'll never know that the monster is coming for you. I can slowly leech the euphoria of redemption and forgiveness from you and convince you that I'm all better. I can make you believe that I won't hurt you again. I can make you have faith that I have changed. But I won't stop. I will leave you spent this time. I will abandon the empty shell of you. I will leave you unable to recover. I do love you. I always have. My monster hates you. My monster will always hate you. I will leave you to your happiness, and, in doing so, I will fight the monster. When I die, I will win."

It will end not because my patience with it will break down, not because , as you fear, I will become dissatisfied with its limitations. It will fail because you will not take the tiny amount of responsibility you have toward me.You have little responsibility, I understand that my love comes without the benefit of being being given back. But last night, you were in a crappy mood. I came to the conversation unarmed, playful. My tone didnt work. You got irritated at me. You shut me down even as I apologised sincerely for missing the mark. You shut me down when I last expressed vulnerability. And then disconnected, so that I was left to mull overnight, wondering how on earth the conversation went so badly. This morning you had little for me. I barely slept. I explained calmly that I was scared. You couldn't do it. You couldn't realise that I was hurt, tired, that I didn't want to fight. That I offered a series of apologies without any ""buts"". Maybe you don't remember what it's like to be hurt. To care so deeply about someone that they have that power to make you cry. Sometimes ""it's ok"" is not enough response. That's what will end us. Your lack of empathy for the hurt you cause. The hurt that is situational, contextual, that's fine. That's my choice. The hurt you cause deliberately is another thing."

I'm so tired of being used, you preyed on my emotional vulnerability. I don't look like it but I'm an extremely emotional guy, I can tune it out and choose to become cold hearted but that's not what I wanted. I want to feel god damn it. I really wanted this to be real. I just wanted someone to connect with. I just wanted someone to text me good morning without expecting a Taj Mahal in return. Why's that too much to ask? Why were you do cruel?"

Logically, shes gone, shes taken, shes not interested. As those thoughts swirl through my mind, a feeling of calmness comes over me. Acceptance of my reality sets in, and mentally i move on to the next task. Without any ability to communicate or observe her, Im assuming that all is well and that makes me genuinely happy for her. When logic fails, and my i allow myself to be overcome with emotion, i fall down. Its so hard for me negate, ignore or forget what we shared. The vulnerability, the investment, the bond, it fueled me. When it ended, it felt and still feels like something that I truly loved with every ounce of my being, died. Those feelings make me tear up every time. When i pair those two head spaces together, they dont reconcile. Unfortunately, Im left with a vicious and unsustainable cycle of pain and my harsh reality. My internal mental dialog: - Get over it - She doesnt want you - Focus on something else - Its time to move on What my heart feels: - Never give up - I love her - I would do anything for her - Your bond is indomitable My logical side hates my emotional being and my emotional being ignores all of my logical thoughts.

I have hang ups and habits. Ive been breaking them to the best of my ability. I want to be the best I can be for myself and the people I love. Im nervous because maybe youre a bit farther ahead than I am and I wont be able to keep up. I want to hold hands and do everything. I want us to grow as individuals but also do it together. (But I also respectfully want us to have time to ourselves as well.) I feel like I fell too hard for you and now everything hurts. I think of you and I cant get anything done. Everything youve ever said to me, everything youve ever done for me is replayed inside my mind over and over. I feel like Ive known you my whole life. I want to be with you all the time. I want to kiss you every morning and night. Do you feel the same way? I know relationships can be scary because they make people feel vulnerable. I like vulnerability sometimes. I want to be as open, communicative, and honest with you as much as I possibly can/capable of. Will you in return do the same? Are you comfortable with the pace of our relationship? Is it too quick or too slow? Are you emotionally involved enough or are there things youre holding back on? Should I be more emotionally involved? Are your wants/needs being met? Do you have any anxieties? Maybe Im in my head again, maybe Im not. Maybe youre comfortable and Im mistaking it for something else. Who knows. Ive never been in a healthy relationship before truthfully; which means Im learning as I go as well. Im just going to keep being myself, loving myself and loving you; and hopefully thatll be enough to keep you with me. I love you more than you could ever know. Yours truly, "

All I want right now is you by my side on top of a mountain after a night of camping. You say you dont feel this way about me anymore, but I still felt loved by you last time we cuddled. I felt your loving energy towards me when you werent zombied out from being so high. You changed your habits after moving in June, negative habits came back and you stopped your internal/emotional work. I wish I had hugged you harder, kissed you more if I had known it was the last time. You cried while breaking up with me, part of you didnt want to do it but I cant change your mind. I wish you had, not because I fear loneliness (you know that) but because youre special to me. My love is different than the kind youve recived before its the conscious nurturing, lasting, warm, peaceful, encourage you to grow kind of love. I saw and accepted all of you, the light and the dark. I thought things were moving towards a better direction you had started to emotionally open up to me more. You allowed me to have a glimpse of a dark painful past. You doing that made me love you more, because it takes vulnerability to share pain. What a thing it is to be human. Youre a good guy with a lot of unresolved issues but Fuck, I still love you so much. I care about you I wanted to be by your side as a supportive partner who you could rely on as you resolved those issues. Im a great girl Im not perfect but Im pretty rare, I wish you had embraced that. I love you, I cherish you. Again like I said in my last text to you, if after time apart you realize you miss me and are willing to change things then come back to me. I understand you so deeply, not holding anything against you. Im not saying Im waiting outside your bedroom window, all Im saying is Ill be working on myself and if things change I want you to call me. I love you."

You know vulnerability isn't where I like to stay for too long. Though, you keep me standing in place, begging me to drop my guard. Asking me to let you in. You calm the chaos in my head when I am with you. Everything seems to fall away and your eyes drown me in peace. You give me this reassurance that everything will be okay. You take control when I refuse to give it up and I'm learning that it is okay to let go. I wanted to beg you to stay. I should have. I should have gave into fantasy and hope. I knew I would regret doing either though. Letting you go without a fight or fighting with everything I had for you to stay. The outcome and answer is still the same and begging would just make things harder for you. You know me and I can't help but need you."

Im so grateful for you. That wont be the tone of this whole letter, but I am. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You are so important to me. We have had such an intense, charged relationship with each other that has activated a lot within me and I am so grateful for that. Its extremely painful and difficult to express all of the things I feel. But glowing beneath it all is a deep gratitude for this season of my life and the ways I have broken, shed, and crumbled to return to the deepest sense of who I am and what my work is. It could have been activated in other ways, as its been there all along, but in relationship with you I was gifted the profound sense of fear and pain that prompted a hard sense of self reflection and a deep need to turn inward and return home. In the end, this isnt about you. Its about me. The things I need to learn and unlearn, the patterns I need to break, and the wounds I need to heal. However, I want to honor my experience in relationship with you and release the ugly and hold gratitude for the beautiful. Meeting you was a catalyst for this blinding reaction and fundamental change within the ways I now walk in this world. It was instantly electric. Your smile. Your voice. Your vocabulary. Your ease, however awkward. Your stupid face. Your inflections. And your remove from my real life. It was all intoxicating. You were an escape for me. A chance to be new. Seen as something other than this girl he was dating. I was now the woman you had your sights set on. You made me laugh. You made me feel confident, sexy, desired and desirable. Giddy as all hell. It was instant. You came in hard and fast and I was captivated by you and I didnt want anything or anyone else more. I fell in love with you and your ukulele. I fell in love with dancing with you. I fell in love with your vulnerability and emotion. You felt things, feel things, so deeply. I connected to your hurt. I wanted to make you feel better. I wanted to be the reason you felt confident, sexy, desirable and desired. Giddy as all hell. I dont know how else to describe my love for you but it was there. It was real. And though it wound up being so incredibly hard I wouldnt change it. As wrong as it was, I was also allured by your struggles and your pain. They made you feel so different than me, yet familiar. My type... was definitely met by you. And Im sorry for that. Its not fair to you. It was something that I should have been more self aware of rather than giving it a cute name and giggling about it to brush it off. I enjoyed being the innocent the rebel falls for. Being seen as pure with the desire to be the reason someone gets their act together or leaves their old ways out of love. Its unfair. Its wrong. And Im so sorry. It created an awful dynamic of shame and guilt. It fed into my desire to be needed. Relied on. Loved. The best. The most important. Special. But.. what does that say about how I viewed myself? That I needed someone else to make me feel important? That without someone relying on me to be good or a better version of themselves... I was nothing? Yes. And it also says I didnt love you for who you are. I love all of the amazing things I see within you. But it wasnt the honest way you were showing up in my life that I held onto so tightly. It was the promise of something else. Who you were becoming because of me. It makes me frown to write that. Because I see how wrong that is. This cyclical pattern of me loving/helping you started innocent enough. Quitting a nasty habit, smiling more, making big and important purchases... doesnt seem too bad. But it intensified as things do. It turned into suicide attempts and threats. It turned into substance use. It turned into me feeling so self important that I thought without me intervening, youd die. That is so wrong. And that is not love. Its anxious attachment and fear and such an unbelievably misguided sense of my own impact on someone else. Its something I will no longer return to. Ever. Thank you. I bow to our relationship in gratitude for this lesson. This first recognition of equitable exchange in everything. For better or worse. I dont write this letter to take or give blame or praise to either of us. We were both there. We both brought all of our past experience into relationship with each other. We both did what we knew how to do. Some of it good. Some of it bad. All of it... wrong now. All of it lessons. I could spend a lifetime sitting here and tracing the lines of my actions to their roots, speculating about who did what when and why, which of my well intentioned actions cut the deepest, where I reacted when I could have responded, the ways I was deeply hurt by you, justifying my anger or hurtful ways by saying they arose from fear. But there is a simplicity uncovered here. We hurt, and we hurt each other. And thats okay. This is okay. Humans are greatly fallible creatures and we are all here to learn our lessons and do our work and it is impossible to do so perfectly without misstep and without getting enmeshed and tangled up in all of the sides of being human. This is one of them. Hurt is one of them. Wrong is one of them. Bad is one of them. But in gratitude, let these human experiences give way to my growth on my journey onwards. On my journey home. Return, return, return. This is a letter to you because youre the 151st iteration of this lesson. The biggest and brightest. The culmination of all my experiences and hurt that brought me to this dock to reflect in this way. I was shown all of my patterns in relationship with you. I did it all. In new ways and old ways I interacted with you retracing steps Id already taken, failing to break the patterns until they broke me. Losing myself further into what I thought was the right thing to do. You little light. Im here doing this work because of these lessons. Because of the light I was able to see the darkness in myself. Truth be told, Im mad. Im incredibly hurt. Embarrassed. Ashamed. I want to sob...more. Scream. Wail. Give the fuck up because this has all been so hard. It has all been so hard. And I know writing this now it will continue to be hard. Im deeply grieving the loss of you and us and my old comfort. Im going to need to continue to access and bow in gratitude to these feelings and these lessons and release them to return home. This is my work. Mine. And I am showing up to do it. I wont be trying to do others work any longer. Thats the lesson. Thats the beauty here. Now. I get to see myself for all that I am. In truth. I get to tap into the unconditional love that runs through Mother Earth and know so deeply that love ISNT pain. Growth is individual. Relationship is slow, sacred, and special. And this is okay. And I am okay. And I will do this work. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. In gratitude I bow to this life and these lessons and this beauty."

I still believed in love and was a hopeless romantic. I may have cried myself to sleep almost every night because the loneliness I felt overwhelmed me, but I still had some strength left in me to keep me going. I still got up the next morning with a smile on my face so I didnt worry the people who cared about me. But you. You preyed on my loneliness, you preyed on my vulnerability. You took whatever life I had left in me and crushed it down into a grain of sand. You deceived me and fooled me into believing you were something that you were not. I was elated with happiness believing I had met my soulmate, that I would finally be able to settle down, start a family and finally live the simple yet humble life Ive always wanted. I never thought that Id feel lonely again. I even told you that I believed my father who passed away when I was child was the one who brought us together, it was stupid. I was stupid. But then the lies started to dawn on me, my eyes started to open and I finally started to see the truth. You were a sick and twisted being. You were stringing me along and I dont know how long you would have continued to do so if I never found the truth. You made me feel ashamed, embarrassed, stupid and hopeless. You manipulated me and gaslighted me, making me believe I was the crazy one. You made me alienate the only friends I had left due to your insecurities, so now I have no one. Now Im more lonely than I ever was before because of you. Even when I confronted you with the truth, you denied it and believed I was stupid enough to still fall for it. It turns out the only stupid one here was you. The pathetic excuses you came up with made me laugh, the most genuine laugh Ive had in a long while. So thanks for that, at least. I dont know how you can live with yourself but I suppose even monsters can sleep comfortably at night. If only your family knew about the real you, I could easily tell them, I could easily ruin your life if I wanted to but even now I cant bring myself down to your level. Im not like you. Despite everything you did to me, Ill take that grain of sand and find myself a beach. Ill carry on, Ill regain my strength. The waves will wash you away. You didnt win. Good riddance, R."

I knew nobody so I reached out, seeing we shared interest in music. At first it was silly, you would send funny memes while I was too busy chasing something stupid without realizing you were chasing me. You were persistent though, you started as a great friend. After a bit, we started texting everyday and practically all day. You wanted to hang, grab pizza (specifically pineapple pizza because you disagreed on it being a tasty pizza) and I was skeptical at first but with the restriction of my mom, I couldn't get away with meeting a stranger right as I moved to a new state. It took two months till we finally hung out. Within those two months, texting became facetiming and the giggles became laughs and my grins became smiles and before I knew it, I had completely fallen for you. I remember sharing music, hoping you'd get the hint. Music became my voice to you and I always loved when you'd share music. There was a charm and homey feeling that I'd never felt before. I remember how comfortable I was when you came over, it was as if I'd known you for ages despite it only being 2 months. I remember how respectful you were (so much that we didnt hug or nothing hahaha), we kept at a distance while we watched movies though neither of us were really paying attention. Despite the odd silences from time to time, it was always comfortable. Being with you was always comfortable. After that, that was when I knew I wanted you to know I liked you, just about everything so far intrigued me. It was late September when the confession came. I loved the feeling of finally getting it off my chest, the vulnerability and the reciprocation. Then the next time we hung out, you were able to sleep over which is usually odd for the second time hanging out within 2 months of meeting but I knew it was something I was sure was right. I had work in the morning till early afternoon and you came over after I had work. I was thrilled to see you again. The butterflies and the warmth I felt when I finally got to hug you and the feeling of familiarity. Being with you that day was the start of something I was unprepared for. I knew I wanted to be yours though you said it would be hard. After I had decided that I was going to go through with it, I knew I made the right choice because the happiness I feel every single day is bliss. You are incredibly patient and kind. You helped me build confidence and lent me an ear when I needed someone to listen to my rants and random bullshit that I felt everyone else would be annoyed to hear. As time went on, I fell for your touch, your voice, your SMILE, your laugh, your scent, absolutely everything. Lately things have been a little rough and I messed up. I got stressed out with personal and family things and took it out on you and you didn't deserve that. Yet you were patient with me. Man, I worry that I might lose you and that scares me so much. Your heart is so precious and I want to protect it forever. You mean so much to me than you know. You've taught me so much about myself and you helped me heal in so many ways. Fuck, I am so grateful for you and I don't even know where to begin to tell you. I felt this for a bit but was afraid to say it though sometimes it would almost come out naturally but I had to stop myself...I love you. I hope I get to tell you that in person because I mean it. Fuck, I love you. I pray that my stupidity didn't ruin it for us and I am so sorry I upset you. You have been quiet all day, which is hard because we've talked everyday and I remember you saying that you wouldn't not text me but I know something is wrong when I don't hear from you at all. I just feel stuck. I woke up at 7 in the morning and I just sat up and cried. I cried for an hour and then fell back asleep. I cried because hurting you is something I would never want to do and I did. I feel terrible and I am so sorry. I can't stop thinking that maybe the last text you sent will be the last, the last picture you sent of yourself will be the last I will ever receive and the last phone call will be the last that I'll ever hear your voice. Fuck, my heart aches with the thought that I accused you of being insincere when all you've done was care for me. I just want you to tell me it'll be okay and that we can work through this together. I understand if I won't get anything back. I pray that I will be so lucky enough to hear from you again."

To my great grandparents who I never really understood while they were alive. To my uncle who decided another year wasn't worth it. To the mother I thought I had, that never existed. I was never good at handling my emotions, I would deny and hide anything that could possibly be a vulnerability because I couldn't trust the living around me. I still can't more often than not. However things are looking up, and I wanted to let you know that I loved every one of you, and I'm sorry that you had to face the hardships you did. Now I'm facing mine, even the ones I was oblivious of most of my life. I will struggle, I will fall down, but I will continue until I'm no longer just surviving, but thriving."

I was pretty good at hiding it for awhile, letting you think I had high standards, if you wanted me you had to prove how badly. I think I was mostly trying to hide from myself. I didnt date or fall in love.... was never really my thing. Eventually you saw through me, you realized my entire heart belonged to you. For a while you showed me your heart, too. We were so beautiful and happy. We discovered a place of love and vulnerability I have never known before. (Ive spent the last 2 years chasing that place, no luck to date) Im not sure what happened or why, but you closed off from me. I wasnt mad..maybe sad, but all I wanted was honesty and communication. I just needed to know what was going on in that beautiful brain of yours. I could see you were unhappy and it hurt me. You once told me you were a nut, and I cracked you. You and I both knew that was a lie. I could only meet you where you met yourself, and there were still places you hadnt the courage to trek yet.. The type of love we have, I believe to be once in a lifetime. I dont think I will ever find that place of paradise in anyone elses heart, mind, or soul. But we werent ready. We both projected so much onto each other, in efforts of protecting ourselves we only caused more pain. I wish I would have had the strength to leave you before it got so ugly. I wish you could have been straight up with me about the things you were learning about your heart. The way our relationship ended was so traumatic for me, which I do not blame entirely on you. (K) played the largest part in the trauma, but you gave him a helping hand. Im sorry I was so easily manipulated. This is something you have always hated about me, which is ironic because its my big heart that allows me to see the good in everyone, including your broken self. So now, 2 years later..2 years of trying to piece back together my heart. It took me a long time to even remember who I was without you, and who I was despite the things K had done to me. I was so broken and lost. All wanted was you by my side to help me heal. But I thought you hated me, for my weakness. We didnt speak for so long. I had allowed so much anger and hate fill in the spaces in my heart you left empty. Then one day I decided I was done. I didnt want to be angry. You did some fucked up stuff. The way you would treat me and speak to me when things would get hard....often left me traumatized. Your words of disgust are burned into my mind forever and I will never forget them. But I want to forgive, because also your words of kindness, love, and your soul in general has left a more lasting imprint on my soul than words said in the heat of the moment ever could. I hope I am not being dumb. You tell me you have learned from the past. You tell me you have grown as a human being. You tell me you have changed. Please be telling me the truth. Please be the person you are saying you are. I am. I have reopened my heart to you. Free of expectations and conditions. I want to love you purely. Be free. Be happy. Be safe. But please, be real with me. And Ill be real with you. Lets never hurt each other. With all my love, Your nurse joy"

Ive known it for a while, but didnt quite understand it to its full extent until now. When I look into your eyes, I feel extremely vulnerable. And I have not allowed myself to be vulnerable with anyone for an incredibly long time. Even the friends in my life whom I have been very close to in the past I have completely isolated myself from, against my own best interest. Even my ex who I accepted a proposal for marriage, hes only ever been let in so much. Because I for one knew I couldnt trust him, but also I have just refused to let anyone in. But with you, I dont know why but I know I can be vulnerable with you. And vulnerability and pain go hand in hand. And this is why you are so goddamn terrifying to me. Because everyone who Ive ever loved deeply, romantic or not, theyve either left or are dead. I have tried really to change this about myself, especially since meeting you because I understand what I am doing. It is self sabotage to the worst degree, but I dont know how I can open up myself again without fearing the worst. This is not an excuse or justification for my behavior. Its just the ugly fucking truth. I know its fucked and youre not anyone from my past. I know all of this. But Im just fucking scared. I fee like I have no one, but Ive bought this on myself because Im so fucking fucked with abandonment issues. Even after years of therapy and reading a ton of self help books, here I am still blocking everyone out and bitching about being alone when Ive done this to myself. But I want to change. I dont want to live with regrets and what ifs. But Im still scared. I wish I wasnt, but I am."

What they didnt realize was that they took a picture that was at least Renaissance style in composition and beautiful for that alone. Girl standing with nearly invisible cigarette in one hand, crimson hoodie blending into the folds of your crimson t-shirt, somehow mingling with the puffy vest jacket in blue and black as she leans into your shoulder with a dreamy smile. Your head rests upon hers, eyes closed; your hand reaches to the small of her back, neither hiding on her shoulder (as it would be within a few moments) or grabbing her ass (as it would be before the first five passionate kisses). I dont know very much about body language, but to me it looks like a pair in love. \-- If it werent that you looked like the one I wanted when he was in college, you wouldnt even be here at all. And yet somehow, despite your not being him and your own demons (the drug habits, emotional unavailability), you have achieved in moments what he could not: my heart, freely given; my vulnerability given my own life and the circumstances I brought to the table, freely given; my lips pursed toward yours, demanding the prizes Id rightfully earned during that game of darts and the coin flip, I want you to kiss me, and the upturning of lips, freely given. \-- Here is a super vague list of everything you want to do to me, per your wording: * \[Item I cant repeat in public\] * \[Item I cant repeat in public\] * \[Can you even *do* that to somebody?\] * \[Yes, okay, I am down with this too\] * \[*So why wont you take me home now?*\] Because then you walked off after I was willing to go. \-- You texted me after that. You heard I was having a hard time at work, to the point of near suicide, straight from the lips you kissed. You texted to say are you okay? I tried to tell you how I was feeling. Im not trying to be existential, because you have stuff to do. And then you sent nothing but positivity. And you sent Kisses. And you didnt try to course correct (because I waited, for a minute, for you to go ""jk"" or ""Oops,"" or ""I mean...""), but followed up with Kick ass today. Be safe. Do you want me in love with you? This is how you get me in love with you. But I couldnt say that. Maybe I should have. \-- I admit it. I drunk texted you too much--I have feelings for you, pay attention, please!--and maybe thats why you didnt answer. \-- I saw you in person today where our beautiful mess happened. You said youd be back after 12/27. Its 1/11, and this is the first time I saw you or even heard from you. Oh, hey. Thats all I received. Im hurt, but I get it. Im just destined to have beautiful feeling moments. I just believed that you might be better than that, and that I might be worth more than that. Thats all. Thank you for our beautiful messy moment. At least every time I look at our paparazzi picture, I can delude myself into thinking its real."

You didnt like it so you talked shit about me to my family; My grandmother. You then attacked her like it was nothing.. Youre only ever nice to me when you want something, when youve needed cash or for me to bail you out. You called me at all hours asking &amp; begging for money but never paid it back. Youd play on the fact that I was going through chemotherapy &amp; my memory was mush. I never cared about the money but it hurts that you took advantage of me In such a vulnerability.

I originally wrote this on paper with the full intention to mail it as a good bye. I acquiesced knowing that I dont think theres anything I can do or say to bring you back to me. When we first met you asked me if I believe in fate; I so reluctantly do. Only fate could explain the way we met and became so intimately entwined. Its only fate that could create the gulf that exists between us now. We fit so well together; in spirit and soul; in carnal desire. You bet me that I would fit perfectly within you; I was never so happy to lose in my life. When my lips first grazed yours it was electrifying. My hands knew your body as if it wasnt my first foray with you. It was like going back to a book you havent read in ages but intimately remember; those dogeared pages and annotations are just how you remembered them. The notes you scribbled so hurriedly tell you just how to move. Maybe we were lovers in a past life; now were ships passing in the night. The next time around we may just get it right. We are so similar; impulsive, emotional, intelligent, dreamers, passionate, indecisive, and quick to anger. We burned so brightly that Im afraid we pushed each other away. In wanting each other so badly, we ensured the opposite would occur. Each time you told me you wanted to push everything to the side to be with me, I wish I just said do it. But I wanted to take things slow. I wanted to be patient and cautious. Ive been hurt before and you knew that. You knew things that I never uttered to anyone. We were confidants for one another. You said it was the right thing but the wrong time. But is there ever a right time for what we shared? I think the story of your parents is what gives you hope. Maybe like them we will rediscover each other in ten years and pick up without missing a beat. While you were always the optimist, thats where I diverged. You saw something in me that I couldnt see myself. You couldnt explain itnot verbally. But your eyes said it all. Ive never had someone look at me the way you did. For the first time; someone saw me. It was a vulnerability I wasnt ready for but it was something that never felt so right. When you picked up my hand &amp; kissed the scars on my arm, I knew you loved all of me; not just the light I project but the dark hiding deep within. You made me feel safe and comfortable enough to cover up those scars permanently. What replaces that is a symbol of you; a deer for you, dear. That last song you added to our playlist makes me question if you regret letting me go. Is that you asking me to reach out or is that wishful thinking? Letting go is hard but you showed me how. Now I need to put that into practice and let go of you...Im not so sure that I can. You will always be a part of me. -Your boy, Blue"

What do you call someone who alienated all your loved ones from your life so that you only have one, manipulative, dependent, toxic, abusive relationship? You knew that no one had ever liked me before, and you took advantage of my naive excitement that an older more experienced man was showing interest in me. You found excuses for everything, how everyone around me who hated you was crazy and selfish and idiotic and how you were the victim because everyone was so jealous of your charm and wit. How you were such a genius with an incredibly high IQ that was TOO smart to just get a stable normal job, when the truth was you lied to everyone that you had a degree, you lied to everyone that you had a high GPA, in fact you had failed out of school. How even when you were charged with a CRIME that somehow you were the victim and that the law was attacking you for no reason? You took out your frustration with life on me. When life gave you lemons, you destroyed me. Everything I own was torn apart by you, my glasses, my laptop, my clothing, my furniture. And when that wasnt enough you decided to use me as a human stress ball, digging your nails into my sides, or elbowing into my back, or slapping my face,or using your entire body weight of a 65 man on a 53 girl so she couldnt move and could barely breath. You knew of a close friend of mine that committed suicide and would use it against me by threatening to commit suicide every other week. You knew that it haunted me to leave a friend in any unknown state of mind for fear of consequences, and you preyed on that vulnerability by threatening to kill yourself so I wouldnt leave. You even had the gall to say no wonder they killed themselves you were a terrible friend who didnt care when they said they were going to do it. You were insatiable for sex so you made it my fault when I tried to say no. You would cry if you couldnt have it every time you wanted. You would force yourself on me even when I was just lying there, motionless, unable to feel even an ounce of excitement for your disgusting greed. I would wake up at night with you attempting to be inside of me and you would still make me out to be the bad guy if I was screaming at you to get the fucking hint that Im not interested. You even had the audacity to say you make it sound like Im raping you, thats not true Im your boyfriend. Fuck you for never understanding a boundary. For being the most disgusting person I know. Fuck you for stalking me when I finally found the healthiest most loving person I could have ever found to spend my life with. I wish I couldve said any of this to your face but truth be told Im still absolutely terrified of you. So for now, fuck you."

But Im no good with vulnerability, suck at talking about my feelings, and would rather hide instead. But I want to thank you. Thank you for being you. I know you took what I said the wrong way, but I was scared, and I think you know that. So I came up with some convoluted explanation as to why I was acting weird, but the words all came out wrong. It came out as a garbled mess, an unintelligible string of words that all meant the same thing. Im scared. Because I suck at talking; even if I say I believe in honest conversation, I suck at it. Life hasnt always been kind to me. Youre the first person Ive cared about whos treated me with any kind of decency in over a decade. Youre the first one whos treated me with kindness, rather than icing me out. Youre the first one whos allowed me close to you, whos allowed me to be myself, without judgment, without fear of anything, really. And thats a funny feeling for me. To know, to trust that even in your anger, you wont turn on me. I cant tell you how huge that is for me. Even as I sit here writing this, Im crying, wondering how it is I landed with you, how it is you saw fit to be in my life. Even with all of my hurts, all of my pains, and everything else I have going on. And all I want is to give you the same beauty, the same deeper sense of security and trust. I want to be there for you when you come home, with coffee, the way you like it. I want to be the person you come home to sometimes, with a smile, and all of the caring and love I could possibly give to you. I want you to know that Ill be there, rain-or-shine, waiting for you. ...Because thats all I know how to do. I cant be perfect, because Im not. I cant promise you the world, because thats impossible. All I have to give is myself. But I hope its enough. I really, really, truly do. So thank you for being you. Thank you for being all that you are. xo-"

The girl you told me, as you broke my heart, ""We only went on one date and there was no chemistry. We never even kissed!"". Even after you broke up with me after my birthday, I held out hope. I still held onto the idea that you were so different to the men that scarred me before you. But you just added another scar. The final one. The final nail in my coffin. I promise myself I will learn my lesson after every heart break, but it seems like I don't. I promise that I will love myself as much as I will love my partner. But with what you had, what you were diagnosed with, I stuck by your side helplessly. I never gave up on you. But you gave up on me. Blaming your OCD. Blaming your scars from the previous girls who hurt you, the scars I so desperately tried to heal and mend. Blaming the effects of your parents divorce on who you are now, when I never once brought up my parent's separation, because what we had was OURS. Now, it is yours and hers. Her, who you quickly went to after breaking my heart. Her, who you get flowers for every weekend. Her, who I wonder will love you more than herself as I did. Her, who I wonder will be the perfect maternal replacement -- because looking back on it now, that is what I was.... Wasn't I? Someone who held you while you cried about your OCD diagnosis. Someone who reassured you that you are a man despite the issues you had. That told you how much of a man I thought you were with your vulnerability. Someone who broke their own back for their partner. Someone who mended their own broken back while you ran off. I mended you, wondering why you couldn't even give me even a splint of support. I wonder what is wrong with me to see all.the ones I loved before cheat, leave and go to another woman. I wonder if I am woman enough. Is it because I am not vulnerable? Is it because I insist on fighting my own battles? Is it because I like my independence? Was it me that made you feel less than because I took on the protective role? I see she is a princess in so many aspects and definition of the word itself. Is this what I was supposed to be? Maybe it doesn't matter anymore. Maybe this is a life lesson. Love isn't enough. Nice guys finish last, me being the guy this time. I want to forgive you. Be thankful for the good times. But all I can thank you for is the greatest lesson I needed.

I hope, if you felt angry and sad, that those feelings gave way to clarity and peace. I hope you understand now what was happening in my heart, how catastrophically painful and deeply confusing it is to love and trust someone completely, for them to use that love to deceive you and take advantage of your navet. I feel less innocent now. I cant put adequate words to that despair. I hope you dont have to learn that by someone doing it to you, I hope you never have to feel that. I have never been in such incredible pain before. Please, please do not do that to someone again. I hope you know I dont hate you for it, that I can follow your logic, but it still doesnt make sense. the door is closed. I endured it because I felt it was my loving duty to you to see your pain as real and deserving of the space it needed to take up, despite how it harmed me. I tried to see it as a thing with a reason for existing, and in need of the healing salve of being lovingly witnessed and accepted. I tried to see in you what you could not see yourself and elevate that to a higher order of realness than the things you were doing to me on the day to day. And you grew to expect it, and a pattern formed, and thats abusive codependency in a nutshell. I stayed 6 months too long. I still have a picture of you in my desk, face down and in the back of the drawer. It reminds me of how it was before it became so much work just to feel safe and loved. it makes me deeply happy to know that I had the capacity to love you that much. So much. It makes me feel like I must have grown since 2018 to accommodate the kind of love I felt for you, but now I have also grown a spine and words to defend myself, and the ability to detach and keep a wise distance from the epicenter of other people, to not invite myself into someones soul and think I belonged there, that they belonged there in me. I do not confuse abusive actions, however unintentional, with vulnerability and pain that I must sit with. If its pointed at me without me having caused it, even if its because of trauma, its abuse and I do not need to hang around for that shit. But like, fuck. I see you. It makes sense, thats why it was so fucking hard to leave. I see that pain and it makes sense, and I thought I could help, but I just couldnt do enough. I didnt want to fail you when you needed someone, I really wanted to be there for you but it was wrecking me quickly and I didnt want to inwardly die to keep you floating. Thank you, c, for the time at the beginning when we were together and happy. Thank you for seeing me, opening me up and loving me the way you did. Thank you for trying. I know it was hard. I hate that wisdom acquisition is so fucking painful and disorienting, but I believe in the endless possibility the future offers beyond this experience. I feel better now. I truly wish you the best in your world. I miss you, but I wont reach out. Know this: Behind everything superficial, all the ways you hide yourself and protect yourself and falsely portray yourself out of a feeling of inferiority, all the angry guards from your past that stabbed at me and hurt me and deceived me and blamed me for things, there is pure, brilliant light. I still feel unromaticized love for you that is safe to feel from this distance. you are at your core, beyond that pain, an incredible beast thats gonna keep learning and growing into the kind, smart, driven, and brilliantly shining creative human you are already. By enduring this with me, I hope you have gained something useful and beautiful for yourself, and I hope you know not to do those things again to someone, I hope you find different ways to create a feeling of safety and peace for yourself, and I hope that finding them makes you feel proud of yourself for doing such incredibly difficult and painstaking inner work. I am already very proud of you for surviving the true shitstorm of your life before now and turning out who you are right now. I hope you believe in yourself. I do, fully. You are worth that."

I wish I could tell you I had a reason. I wish there was somthing you did that made me angry. I think that would be easier. But you didnt do anything wrong. You were just you. I fell for you, and I'm sorry. I've been down this road before in my life. I get close to a girl. She is cute and shows me a little attention. I misread her just being nice as flirting with me. I ask her out. She rejects me. I'm in pain over being rejected and she is too uncomfortable to be around me anymore. I didn't want to go through that with you. I didnt want to make you feel uncomfortable. I didnt want our friendship to be completely over with no way to reconcile. So I tried somthing new. I tried at first to limit how much we talked. I tried not to message you as much, but I'm fucking weak. I didnt have self control. So after increasingly distancing myself from you. I finally blocked you on everything. I didnt do this as a ""punishment"". I did it for my own wellbeing. I was thinking about you pretty much non stop. I couldnt get you off my mind no matter how hard I tried. I blocked you for very selfish reasons. I know there is a very good chance out friendship will never be saved. You have to obligation to forgive me. I think i see the hurt in your eyes when you look at me. I'm sorry if I caused you pain. It wasn't my intention, but I knew it could be an outcome. There is also the possibility that you dont care about me in the slightest. That me blocking you had no effect on you. You didnt notice or didnt care. I'm okay with that too. I think that's one of the reasons I'm afraid to send this. I'm afraid that I've been overthinking everything. That I thought we were closer than we really were. Incase you did notice, and I caused you pain. I just want you to know. You are the first person that I have truly cared about in about 2 years. I'm afraid of my own emotions. I'm afraid of rejection. I'm afraid of vulnerability. I'm afraid to care. Please have a good life. After all the stupid shit I have done. I don't think I will be apart of it. Goodbye Bridget."

Life has a funny way of showing you the things that at the time you werent able to see. As a child you were so wound up with anxiety, eager to please, solitary and never really knowing how important you were to the world. You were constantly compared to others by your father. Never feeling good enough because you didnt look like them so therefore you were unworthy. Though you loved him so much because you were his daughter. Even through all the times when he was meant to pick you up for your weekends but instead disappeared for months on end with no contact.You were still there waiting for him. He didnt mean this in malice. He was battling his own demons. He had such a skewered view of the world and how it works that he felt like it was helping you be the best you could be. But being a good kind person didnt come into it. It was all about looks, money, status. He did love you. You know that now but didnt back then. You spent most of your childhood, teenage years and early adulthood trying to either fit in, trying to please everyone but never really liking who you were or what you looked like. Being overweight was like a protective cloak around you. Made you accept the shit that people gave you because all you ever wanted was to be loved and accepted and being told you were good enough. You needed to have friends, you needed to be needed because that was your comfort. You chose to be with men who needed you to love them without them being able to love themselves. They were emotionally unavailable, cruel and used your kindness because it made them feel good but would discard you like a piece of used tissue on a side walk. And you accepted that. You accepted it because thats all you have known. To give and give and give and put your heart out on a platter to someone who doesnt deserve it. To feel abandoned when they leave because you didnt think you were ever good enough or tried hard enough to get them to love you back. Countless tears, heartbreak, emotions- all for you to blame it on yourself because you werent thin enough, smart enough or funny enough to make them stay. But you were good at putting on a facade. Shrug it all off and trying again all the while you were constantly comparing yourself to others knowing that if you just had a better job, a smaller waistline or a better life you would finally be enough for someone to love you like you loved them. Why am I not enough. Why am I in this world. Why should I even be here when nothing about me is deserving. Feeling lonely in a crowd full of people, them not knowing what constant destructive thoughts were going through your head- every second, every minute, every hour. To current self, You are 29 now- almost 30. Life whilst a whirlwind has really started opening your eyes. You know that real happiness doesnt come from being thin, good job, good social network. You know that because you have it. You have gone through such a transformation physically with weight loss and ultimately plastic surgery. You have the body you have always wanted. You can wear the clothes you have always wanted to wear. Constantly being told how much you have changed and how pretty you are. You have a great job, and you are good at it. You have supportive friends and family- people who you choose to be around you because you no longer associate with venomous people who are only friends with you to maybe add one more like to their Facebook profile photo. You have done the hard work emotionally, physically and spiritually but it has been bloody hard to have to go through this journey. You forgive your dad, he is so proud of you of what you have become. You love him even though he is still so lost. But you will always still be there. But your heart hasnt changed. The outside may have have transformed but inside you are still the same person. You are still caring, funny, empathetic, intelligent, emotional, anxious, wise and you attract people with your bubbly nature. You have had 3 relationships in the last 2.5 years. All 3 whilst initially were devoted and kind and loving showed that they too were emotionally unavailable. You still put yourself last. You always put them and their needs first. They loved your spirit and your confidence. But as soon as they saw the vulnerability in you, they changed. They couldnt be there for you like you were there for them. You were sidelined and felt like that lost little girl again waiting for just some form of validation or something to show you were important to them. You were never the priority for them though for once in your life you just wanted to be loved like you loved them. But Im proud of you. You walked away from all of them. That takes a strength that you never used to have. You walk away knowing you are good enough, they just cant see it and dont deserve to. You dont need to be someones permanent counsellor or caretaker. Your feelings are valid and important as well. What you want and need from a relationship should be heard. You dont need to beg to get them to see your worth. To those men I gave my heart away to. I dont hate you or wish you ill. I want to thankyou for opening my eyes up to what I needed to see. For teaching me the lessons I needed to learn. I needed to learn I keep choosing the wrong people to give my heart to. Showing me what I do and do not want in a future partner. So today, you are writing this as a cathartic exercise- fresh from recent heartbreak where again you started doubting yourself and your worth. You are reclaiming your strength. This year, you are going to work on the most important person there is. You. You are going to work on loving yourself again. Be alone-be vulnerable but be kind to yourself. Its ok to not feel amazing every day. Sometimes you will feel beautiful, strong and confident with the world at your feet. Sometimes you will feel sad, lonely, unattractive and again questioning your place in this world. Its going to be ok. Be with the people that make you happy, educate yourself, read more books, travel to more places, have some amazing experiences. Be open to the universe and all the amazing gifts it has to offer you. It has a plan. Loving yourself sounds easy but it is actually really hard. This is now the journey to find you again. Just take it hour by hour, day by day, month by month, year by year. Dear future self- I hope you are happy. Not happy with material things but happy in life. I hope you are still working on loving yourself and you are either happy being alone or happy in the partnership/ marriage that you have always wanted be in. They prioritise you, make you feel important and give you back what you give them. They make you laugh, they look after you when you are sick, the calls you beautiful everyday and really mean it. Because they love the person you are and they choose to be with you. Maybe with children, maybe not. Its ok what you choose. I hope you have found something you are passionate about either in a job or a hobby. I hope you still have an amazing supportive network of people around you. I hope you have travelled more and experienced things this world has to offer. I hope you continue to grow to become an even better version of yourself. I hope you get to laugh everyday and feel grateful for the things you have. Ill keep this letter as a reminder because you have come so far and the beautiful thing about life is that there is always more things it needs to show you. Not only to grow and to learn from but it also shows you happiness in the smallest of places. You will always have a place in this world. Keep sharing your kindness, empathy, compassion. You are loved. Most importantly, its you who loves you. Just for who you are and nothing else. Just take it day by day, month by month, year by year. Love always. Me."

I find myself waking, gasping in and out of air periodically, only to slumber back into the dream. I fight myself from falling back to sleep but it is no use. When I finally force myself to wake I am trying to grasp physically onto anything to reassure myself I am rooted in reality. I will see you in my dreams again but please stop haunting me... You noticed me first. That day. I was talking to several friends when one came to me telling me that you were interested in me. I was 19 and you were 16. Being a bit of a 'player' I turned with my slick smile and walked right up to you. Your back was turned to me, your head tilted in my direction. I walked right by you and ran my hand through your hair. And that was when I actually noticed you. Our eyes met and my slick smile melted. This felt completely different. My chest tightened and I was getting hot. I tried to play it cool and left to go home. I was questioning myself what the hell happened to me. I had a few days to think it over before I got my shit together and reminded myself of who I was. I could get any girl I wanted, how is she any different? I had balls of steel. I didn't let girls have this affect on me, it was I who had this affect on them. Your friends had told me that you worked at a video store in town. When I walked in our eyes met immediately. You smiled and all semblance of confidence in myself melted. Here I was again for the second time completely vulnerable. Your first words to me that day were that you heard I had a reputation of being a 'player' and you found it amusing as I embarassingly tried to explain myself. But it was true. I stole girls hearts in various towns and used my looks, personality and popularity to get anyone I wanted. I used my charm to get into popular crowds of the surrounding towns and always seemed to be the 'it' guy. I could hardly look you into the eyes because I displayed such vulnerability around you. How were you doing this to me? I didn't let my emotions break through my tough display but there was no controlling how I was feeling. The tough guy act didn't impress you and trying to act all cool didn't garnish anything but a joking laugh. I couldn't win with you. Over the next few months we would find each other at social gatherings, and although some of the most popular and good looking guys in your town fought for your attention your eyes wouldn't leave mine. When I smeared soft marshmallows on your face you did the same to me. We both went to the sink to wash our faces and the old me would have grabbed onto you and made the most passionate kiss. I was too scared. So like a dork I smeared soft marshmallows onto your face again and you looked at me as if you were expecting me to make the first move. But I was still too scared. I had a friend invite you to his house to watch a movie and as we sat next to each other, you would just smile that same smile which looked right through every act I tried to put on. I thought, this was it. I noticed another guy pawing at you. He was the high school quarterback. No way I could compete with him. He was a rich kid and I couldn't find a stable place to sleep at night. And your father was the Deputy Sherriff. I think I realized then why I felt so afraid around you. You were the head cheerleader, the captain of the soccer team, adored by everyone in your presence. Those were the things you were and I was just a boy with an act to put on. No matter how much persona I would put on, in the end, it wouldn't matter in any serious long term point. I put on these personas because I was hiding my life to others. We would eventually start writting letters to one another. I would tell you exactly how I was feeling and how much you were meaning to me. It didn't matter to you that I was not rich or with a fancy car. You were the first woman that liked me for who I really was. You saw a great heart under the exterior and you wanted to be part of my life. I knew how this was going to end though. Your mother and father came into the video store with some things for you and they saw me walking the isles pretending to look at movies to rent. I wanted to introduce myself for the first time but no matter how I felt I knew they would never accept me. Slowly you began to tell me of your parents objection to the relationship we were having. I saw that it was bothering you and I didn't want a rift in your family because of me. Through letters I would explain this and that I wanted to respect the wishes of your parents. Slowly I stopped coming by your work, slowly I stopped writting you letters. The last time I came to see you at the video store I saw the quarterbacks truck parked. He was in his football jacket smiling at you while your eyes wandered around not paying much attention to him. I went inside to give you a last letter. The quarterback looked at me as if I was in the wrong place and I gave him a look of lets step outside. You took the letter and my tough demeanor melted as I walked out the door. But who was I kidding? I wasn't good enough. That is why your mother and father wanted me to stay away from you. But your prom was coming up. And through our mutual friend you asked that I come and go with you but that your parents would never allow it. So our friend would invite me. So, time to get all suited up and put on the greatest show of my life. (Part 2 Soon. Until then, please stop haunting my dreams...) Troy."

I know everyone says that they feel like their alone, but i am alone. Maybe i wont be in the future. Ill find someone whos just like me. The therapist friend. They can give their friends the best advice, and use pretty words that make sense and open their eyes. Ill find someone who is too wise for their own good. who knows a thing or two about dealing with emotions. Not their own, of course. But others. But because they are the therapist friend, they will never be counseled. They will never have an in depth response like they give to their friends. All theyd ever get would be a that sucks, Im sorry. things will get better. and they will have always said thank you for talking to me, you really helped when really they didnt do shit. But they know they tried their best, so you wont tell them that. because they do care about you, they just dont know the things you know. But its always different when its yourself that has the inner emotional turmoil. You dont know how to fix yourself, so you fix others because its the only thing that makes you feel good. All you want is someone to care about you like you care about them. And the one time you had that someone, you fucked it up because you try to fix everyone, and of course if there is someone out there as therapeutic and wise as you, they are most definitely just as fucked up as you, so you need to fix them before they can fix you. so all you can do is continue fixing others because it makes you feel good. Seeing them happy makes you happy, and it distracts you from the desperate need to let everything out. to just scream and punch and kick. but you cant do that. because that would show that youre hurting, and showing people that youre hurt makes you vulnerable. and vulnerability is your greatest fear. Youve always been he strong one, the one people can rely on to make them feel better, to help them when they are in need. You need to be the strong one. for them. I can deal with my shit on my own, ill be okay. They need me, and thats what important. But that voice in my head  the selfish one with always come back, and say well..what about me? who do i have? no one. because that's showing someone that i need help, and then they wont have their therapist friend because they dont want to push their burden onto you anymore, because they care. But then who will they have? The friends that will say that sucks, Im sorry. things will get better. and that never helps. im tired of being alone. and im tired of not knowing how to even begin to love myself"

But I cant tell you that again at length, I cant vent my self-judgement to you; it would only confuse you further, weaken the resolve youve been so brave to uphold. Im ridden with guilt, and human fallibility is a testament to the possibility that this decision was a wrong one; as much as my logic may seem consistent to me, I cant trust myself to be perfectly logical. I know that. But right now I dont deserve you again. You dont deserve to be admitted to what Ive just forced you to endure a second time, only because my guilt has undermined my confidence. My only resort now is to criticize myself, to scrutinize my actions until I can be confident, away from my guilt, that what Ive done either was or wasnt right. And if the latter holds true, Ill learn from it. I owe at least that much to you. But before Ive done that, I cant allow my guilt to get the better of me, to grip me and pull me back to you so that my vulnerability can supplement yours. I owe at least that much to you as well.

I worry that you are genuinely predatory. I can see the boy I was once close to and I can also see the mask that thinly veiled some seriously fucked up tendencies. I mean, theres the miscommunication and the lies and the using. You told me on our acid trip, in the car, with the snow that you once fucked a girl out of frustration. That youve lied to many a girl. Used them, hurt them. You told me stories. It didnt click. It should have. It predicted the next several months. I was so entrenched that I forced myself to see the best in you and couldnt bear to face the truths in front of me about the person I loved. You left me pacing back and forth in the inpatient unit, waiting for you. You abandoned me when I needed you, when you promised to be there, one last time. But that was to be expected. Nothing new there. You asked me to come back, to move back in, only to break up with me. I wouldve rather stayed at Elizabeths if I knew that would happen. But you wanted me to come home. You asked me to sleep next to you. You wanted me to stay through the lease. You asked me for sex. You were affectionate again. You were giddy to be near me after you dumped me. Living with you broken up was hell. You asked me to stay at that job, in Seattle, with you. You told me you wanted to get healthy for me one day, that i was just not the girl for you the next. I watched you move on so rapidly. Its like I was a sandbox to you, not a person. A punching bag. A resource. You could treat me any way you wanted and Id stay and support you and love you. Its like any love I had to offer you was just there for the taking, and you never felt obligated to reciprocate. Your authentic self shows through your action, not words. It seems as though you choose your girlfriends using the categories tab on pornhub. You look at people as sexual experiences, fetishize them in strange ways. It clicks now that all the people you wanted for threesomes were young. Too young. You only really swiped 18 year olds on tinder and I was just too blind to put 2 and 2 together. Things would happen- like that upskirt video you took of our coworker in the back room. Then the lying about it. I have watched you lie your way out of things a few times. Ive caught you: and didnt say anything. It was like watching an animal in a corner. And I didnt leave. It amazes me I didnt leave. No self respecting person should want you back. I felt lonely and sad all the time. I wanted reassurance and I got none. I reached for you and you were not there, on purpose. It became clear to me Id have to go it alone, but I was so afraid of that. In denial. Unwilling to pursue or conquer until I could know that I would have a safe place to return to at the end of the day. All you did was abandon me. What goes through your head? I know youre not a seriously bad person, deep down, you just dont think through your decisions. An 18 year old, r? Really? Shes so young. Just because you might actually want her and treat her better than you treated me doesnt mean shes prepared or ready for the world of hurt you can be. She cant see your patterns. She isnt capable of understanding this shit. And she will suffer for it. I hope she is okay. I hope youre not fetishizing her or making her feel pressured. Its eerie honestly. Before we broke up you said you wanted to fuck a big titty goth girl. Specifically you wanted to fuck a brown girl. That was your next fantasy. And here you are. I remember how you used to initiate sex. Without a second thought about where I was at, how I was feeling. There were many moments where I genuinely didnt feel like it would be ok to say no. Where I felt like an object. I never said anything because I lied to myself. I just figured I was a cool girl with a high sex drive and you could do whatever you wanted and I would like it. I liked being an object, in a sexual way. It was the only time during our relationship where I felt wanted in any capacity. I bought your attention and affection with sex. But now Im realizing that framework is all you offer. There is no love or vulnerability in your sex. Just a lustful push for new experience. I hope your barely legal girlfriend doesnt get seriously scarred or hurt. I hope she doesnt know how often you think about me. I hope youre not secretly looking at her with those destructive eyes I know well. The ones that wipe out peoples worth and personhood so they can serve your needs. I shouldnt want you back. I shouldnt think about you anymore. These things are serious dealbreakers. I forgave way too much. These things prove to me that growth you think youre making- where opening up more is your concern- is cyclical; fake, pandering, and not nearly as deep and transformative as it needs to be. How self centered to think being open about your emotions is the only better version of you people deserve. How deluded. This aint it, chief. Try again. Back to the drawing board. Work on the shit that hurts, the deeper shit. Purge. Before its too late. That is what Ive been doing in the time since our separation. Ive been bathing in my wound and healing. But doing the real work. The things that make me difficult, the things that make me painful. It was so hard at first but I pulled through. Its like a wound that festered forever so it hurt extra to pull out the infection but its draining and healing so nicely now. It looks like you dove in and almost made it but gave up next to the comfort of affirmation and easy companionship. You ran away from what we had, because it required a better version of you that probably wont exist for quite some time. I deserve better. Than to be dragged around and used. You fucking used me right up, didnt you R? You left when the shell of the person you sucked out had nothing more to offer you. Dwindled down to just a hurt soul. I deserve so much fucking better than you. I deserve that love I gave you. Im sorry I ever put up with you. I trained you to be the petty selfish child you are by totally lacking boundaries."

You just prevent people from getting close enough to be able to see, and think critically about it all. You leave before this sinks in and replace your constant stream of support as soon as youre able. For being so independent, being alone doesnt bode well for you.

What scared me most about our breakup and the dishonesty was coming to terms with this dichotomy about you. The wonderful person you present and can be, versus the darker, dirty little secrets youre afraid to even acknowledge. Those moments are blips and then they go back to their hiding place. After we broke up you started talking the way your sister does. Polite, friendly, distant. It made me change how I thought about who you are. It made me afraid you are a much darker and more manipulative person than I had considered before. I was so unsure about you. I didnt know you anymore. Every word seemed like a ploy or a lie. I felt manipulated as fuck any time you tried to placate me with kindness. How easily you could control my narrative and tell me I shouldnt have been sad and shouldnt have thought bad things about you. Im realizing I have a certain power now with you. I see you, morherfucker. I know about all this shit. And part of the reason for my raging and crusading against you was my insistence that these things still exist. You cannot run. They are unresolved and you cant mislead me. I was willing to bear the cross of my story with you. I watched you reconnect with your exes on social media and I knew I was just the last duck you wanted in a row before you tied a neat bow on the experience and moved on, ego in tact. I didnt want to lie down. I wanted you to be forced to look at the truth every time you saw me at work. If that meant being testy or unpleasant I embraced it. It was wrong. But it was where I was at. And it made a lot of sense to me. And I didnt leave. It amazes me I didnt leave. No self respecting person should want you back. I felt lonely and sad all the time. I wanted reassurance and I got none. I reached for you and you were not there, on purpose. It became clear to me Id have to go things alone, but I was so afraid of that. In denial. Unwilling to pursue or conquer any of my problems alone until I could know that I would have a safe place to return to at the end of the day. Unfortunately I left my last sliver of safety back, way back where I moved from. What goes through your head? I know youre not a seriously bad person, deep down, you just dont think through your emotional decisions sometimes. Lack of critical thinking. An 18 year old, r? Really? Shes so young. And so soon after swearing to me you werent even dating. So soon after our breakup. Just because you might want her more or treat her better than you treated me doesnt mean shes prepared or ready for the world of hurt you can be. It doesnt mean youre ready to truly love or be as asset as a partner. It doesnt mean youre ready for a relationship, or that she is. She cant see your patterns. She isnt capable of understanding this shit. Age gaps like that matter. This is like me dating our youngest coworker. Just inappropriate and wrong. And she will suffer for it. I hope she is okay. I hope youre not fetishizing her or making her feel pressured. Its eerie honestly. Before we broke up you said you wanted to fuck a big titty goth girl. Specifically you wanted to fuck a brown girl. That was your next fantasy. And here you are. Not only is she young and vulnerable but you probably thrive off the inherent lack of boundaries that comes with that age gap. She is just barely figuring herself out as a person. How will she stand up to her much older boyfriend when these darker moments spill out? How will she take you to task? I remember how you used to initiate sex. Without a second thought about where I was at, how I was feeling. There were many moments where I genuinely didnt feel like it would be ok to say no. Where I felt like an object. I never said anything because I lied to myself. I just figured I was a cool girl with a high sex drive and you could do whatever you wanted and I would like it. Whipping it out at any time, assuming I was a buffet table you could take from at ease. I liked being an object, in a sexual way. Always sexually available and offering everything while expecting little in return. It was the only time during our relationship where I felt wanted in any capacity. I bought your attention and affection with sex. But now Im realizing that framework is all you offer. There is no love or vulnerability in your sex. There is no value or true joy. Just a lustful push for new experience. I hope your barely legal girlfriend doesnt get seriously scarred or hurt. I hope she doesnt know how often you think about me, or those things you said to me while dating her. I hope youre not secretly looking at her with those destructive eyes I know well. The ones that wipe out peoples worth and personhood so they can serve your needs. I shouldnt want you back I suppose. Maybe I shouldnt think about you anymore. These things should be serious dealbreakers. I forgave way too much. These things prove to me that growth you think youre making- where opening up more is your concern- is cyclical, fake, pandering, and not nearly as deep and transformative as it needs to be. How self centered to think being open about your emotions is the only better version of you people deserve. How deluded. Your heart is shallow and your ability to love is a kiddie pool. You could never be able to love me this same way. With honesty or gentleness or sternness. You could never love someone unconditionally. You dont know this ocean of love like I do. Youre weak. This aint it, chief. Try again. Back to the drawing board. Work on the shit that hurts, the deeper shit. Purge. Before its too late. Its been so clear to me with you that you repeat your cycles. Youre doing the same thing over again that you did with our relationship- hopping right back in, not healing or taking true time to be alone or get better. That is what Ive been doing in the time since our separation. Ive been bathing in my wound and healing. But doing the real work. The things that make me difficult, the things that make me painful to be near, the things that fester and make me sick deep down. It looks like you dove in and almost made it but gave up next to the comfort of affirmation and easy companionship. You ran away from what we had, because it required a better version of you that probably wont exist for quite some time. I deserve better. Than to be dragged around and used. You fucking used me right up, didnt you R? You left when the shell of the person you sucked out had nothing more to offer you. Dwindled down to just a hurt soul. I deserve so much fucking better than you. I deserve that love I gave you. Im sorry I ever put up with you. I trained you to be the person you are by totally lacking boundaries. By letting you do pretty much whatever you wanted without repercussions. It wouldve been a service to us both if Id taken you to task more about these hard to face truths. You need it. Youve been babied your whole life. The only real, whole love you know from a woman is contingent w the traits your mother has- lovely, giving, but never the one to say the hard truth. She was the one to jump in and make it better for you and comfort you. The one to take care of you, who doesnt expect it back. The one who doesnt ask you to be a better person for her. Maybe one day well reintroduce ourselves as better people. We always talked about doing so. Im not going to lie to myself about you anymore. You are all the good and bad and complex things that come with being a human and nothing is black or white. I will no longer rob myself of self respect at your benefit or pine or cry. Objectively I was good to you. And you were not so good to me. You were lucky, R. You gave up something honest and beautiful and real. Im sad to think of how much potential you have. Please, reconsider all this. Think on it. Be better because I know you are capable."

Im over it. Apparently being honest about how we feel is too much. You think you can avoid vulnerability by pretending like they dont care. I hope whatever youre avoiding feels worse than regret. I keep finding you people. Scared people. Non communicative people. You think youre the victim (because you never say what you want so you dont get it as often as you could) and youre not accountable when *youre* the one doing the hurting because you think you are somehow incapable of being human?! Sweetheart you are an adult and the resentment youre pretending not to have is poisoning your relationships. Its kind of my fault for finding yall and choosing to be friends instead of leaving you alone! Not anymore. I can find people like me in this world.
244,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,M1,1,euqhfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/euqhfv/m1/,2020-01-28 03:48:46,"Dear M- I decided to use this to write to you without actually writing to you. I am hoping this will help as an outlet for myself, but more important, I know it wont hurt you, which I just cant do anymore. Ive already hurt you too much over the last few days by stirring up emotions right as you were finally feeling OK again. If we stay in contact, I think I might show you this one day, when emotions are a bit removed and heads and hearts have cooled. I dont know if that is going to happen. Staying in contact, that is. I know you say you want it, and I believe you. I know I want it. However, in my experience, it just doesnt seem to happen. At least not to the extent where I would ever be able to show you something like this. Right now I believe I have lost you forever, and you just havent realized it. It hurts me so much to even write that out, but it is my honest belief. This morning I told you Im going to stop reaching out to you, because each time I do it just seems to make things worse. Its going to be so hard for me. All Ive wanted to do since we broke up is talk to you. Each time you messaged me something small or insignificant my world lit up. And every time the conversation fizzled out so did the warmth in my heart. I didnt say anything and I purposely avoided your questions whenever you asked me how I was doing because I wanted you to heal. Right now I selfishly hate that I did that, I wish had just I told you to come to New Zealand when you asked, or told you I loved you when I knew you were still vulnerable, just so I could have you back. But I also know that would not have been good for either of us. It was your innocent small talk that lead to the utter destruction of the proverbial damn I had built to hold in all my feelings. I thought to myself Maybe she is messaging me because she misses me. Maybe she regrets her decision. Maybe she will take me back. Well we both saw how that went. Im in a weird place right now with everything. I would do anything to get you back, except hurt or manipulate you. If I keep pleading/bargaining for you to take me back, I will be hurting you. If I try to exploit to your currently fragile emotional state, I would be manipulating you. I am willing to do anything to get you back except the only two things that may actually work, which is hard for me. But I couldnt live with myself if I did that. So here I am. BUT I can plead with you here since you wont see it! \[insert evil laugh here\] I understand everything you have said and on some level know you are right. But at the same time, I also know that you are so, so wrong. You have laid blame to a lot of the issues in our relationship on yourself and your issues with mental health / feelings of inadequacy. I also believe you blame me for more than you will tell me. I understand if you do and I agree with both. But I dont think the relationship failed because of its issues. I think it failed because we didnt try to stop it from failing. What we had was a real relationship, not some high school or college fling. We had talked about marriage and babies and I think we honestly believed we would spend our entire lives together. I know I did. Real relationships take work, we did not work for our relationship. Real relationships take brutal, open honesty, we held things from each other for fear of upsetting one another. Real relationships take vulnerability, I was too afraid to let you see all of me for fear that you would reject it and I have a feeling you did the same. Losing you has made me realize that you are worth any amount of work. It has made me realize that you deserve to know the truth of whats going on in my life, even when it might hurt. It has made me realize that as scary as it is, if I cant allow myself to be vulnerable with you, there will forever be a barrier between us. I just want the chance to show you this. I want the chance to show you that fate has not doomed us, that we are in charge of our destiny and we can be happy IF we are willing to fight for it. It wont be perfect, it sure as hell wont be easy, but it will be beautiful, because it will be us, and we love each other so much. I am willing to fight for that. You kept saying that you dont want to force our relationship. What does mean? Is working for a relationship forcing it? I ask that you dont force *away* our relationship. I ask that you give it a chance. A real chance, where we both fight for each other. I am so sorry it took me losing you to realize all this. I should have figured this out when I had you. I promise I will be better to whoever comes after you. But right now it feels like I could never love anyone again after you. Rationally, I know that isnt true, but I just dont know how it could be possible. How could I settle for a match when I used to have the sun? I miss your mischievous smile. The one where you tip your head town, look up at me, and give a half smile that shows only your top teeth. I miss your laugh, and how your whole face lights up and your eyes shine like spotlights. I miss your cute nose that you dont think is cute. I miss your warmth when you squeeze me. I miss your weight pressing down on my body when you pretend to be a blanket. I miss the scent of your hair when I hold you as you sleep. I miss your incredible kindness that leads you to buy hotels for homeless people even when you are worried about how your going to afford your own groceries. Bust most of all, I miss your love. Your seemingly bottomless, incredible, love. I dont know what to do without it. Love, M"

But you always were. Every time. I didnt see it. I didnt know. Because you were my first; I believed what you said it has a mind of its own. Disconnected from emotion. Disconnected from the tears the woman who loved you shed. I really believed it just meant that you wanted me, but I was stupid; ignorant. I hate you. I feel like an idiot. I feel violated. I feel manipulated. I am an idiot for not realizing this any sooner. Fuck you, RJP. You are..fucking horrendous; youre sick. I should have known. I didnt. But now I do. I feel disgusting.

I have to do it without seeking the encouragement and validation I hungrily seek from you. That is a bottomless void I need to fix within myself. I need to stretch my wings and fly, risking failure without the safety net of the fun distraction you offer. I need to focus without losing hours and days to meaningless and petty bickering, and knowing I can't be what you want. Days and hours I'll never get back. You know I'm reading what is being said. You know I worry because I care. Yet you remain resolute in your stance of not discussing it, like you have for the past month. A month where instead of leaping into vulnerability, you hid. And that's something I need to be free from too: wanting something that's not reciprocated. This is how it has to be. I have to do this on my own."

But thats how it used to be... before the boundaries became blurry and I found myself begging my heart not to bind to yours. Now, each silence stings a little more as it becomes fragranced with notes of rejection. And I know that we should talk about this, but Id much rather chase the high than expose my own vulnerability. Im sure that Im hurting you. And for that, I am sorry. I want you to be happy, and I dont see my honestly as the catalyst for that.

I still touch myself to the thought of you, with your hand around my neck and the other running up my spine. The sex was fantastic, but the thought of the emotional connection we had during gets me off more. I had never felt that before. Maybe I shouldve told you that. Maybe I need to stop choosing vulnerability only when its convenient for me. I still speak to you in my mind. I still fuck you in my mind. I still hold you, laugh and cry with you in mind. I cant let go of the hope that one day you will return. But I need to. Ultimately Im just to sad, lonely and horny right now to let you go.

I immediately began to panic, I was scared she would tell you whatever I said and I would lose you either way, I was scared if I said yes she would think I had been using her to get close to you (something I had NOT been doing... my mother just made me paranoid with stories of her ""friends"" doing that) or if I said no... she would tell you and we wouldn't be us anymore (also I was scared you just thought of me as a sister and you'd come track me down to give me a ""gentle"" rejection to which i would've responded to by sobbing) well... I decided lie. *high pitched voice which indicates someone is wildly lying* ""WHAT haha your BROTHER haha no that's crazy haha!!!!!!"" she responds with ""....okay..."" and I think ""oh god she didnt believe me i have to cool it down with him i can't be so obvious anymore but also oh god she's gonna tell him i don't like him and things are gonna change oh god oh god oh god..."" Now I have a theory about what happened and caused the next events to occur (my mom has a theory too), I think she told you and you were like ""Oh."" and between the ""supposed rejection"" and my resolve to back off of our little friendship, i ended up pushing you away. my mom thinks you asked your sister to ask me and i probably broke your heart by lying to her. whatever happens, i regret that moment so so SO much, i think everything was going so great between us and my little damaged brain thought ""time to self sabotage teehehehehe!"" god i wish that was it but there's more. so we started drifting further and further and I'm like ""great i ruined that good job v you always ruin everything!"" and one day me and your sister C. go outside to play with the neighborhood kids. i wondered why we had to play with them, since I felt they didn't really like me, especially this one girl let's call her uhh... Asia, she was very good friends with my cousins who literally tried to kill me. I went because C. wanted to go. Asia whips out a lighter and starts playing with fire and I get kinda nervous. C. begins to play with the lighter too, I decide this is all too much for me and I want to go back home, C. looks disappointed but I just leave. I walk home thinking ""what was that?? god am I losing my best friend now too?"" I go inside and my mom asks me why I'm home so early, I say ""i just wanted to come back"" very sadly so my mom keeps pressing me and I blurt out ""they were playing with fire."" I then realize my mistake and beg her not to tell your mom, but she says she has to and your mom whoops C. C. is obviously mad at me for snitching and I decide to give her space because I thought she hated me and didn't want to be my best friend anymore, now as a 20 year old I realize this is stupid and friendships like ours don't end over mistakes, but 11 year old me took it to heart. so I didn't talk to you guys anymore (1. to give her space 2. because i thought she hated me 3. because i realized i couldn't come over and say ""hey I came to see C.L! ....yeah C.L not C..."" (because A. we just didn't do that. B. I thought you were kinda upset with me too because of my lie AND because I got your sister in trouble) sorry this apology is years late and not to your face.... or anywhere near where you may see it. this is everything I'm terrified to say to you. im sorry for distancing myself and never calling you. im sorry for almost leaving town without saying goodbye. im sorry for lying to your sister about liking you. i thought i was doing the right thing by letting you go (or at least backing off a little), your sister was my best friend, but i think i really broke your heart. i regret nothing more than how i treated you, how we stopped being us. i never imagined we wouldn't talk for 7 years. i missed you so much, but my mind couldn't handle the thought of not being with you or your family and it erased you out of my memory, crazy i know, something out of the vow. my mom told me you used to cancel on your friends just to come hang out with me, i don't know why but it made me so emotional. you chose me over the batting cage with your friends. you chose me over my evil cousins. you always chose me. you were so much more to me than just a friend. you were the only one who understood me, you were the only one who could make me really feel better, your presence brought me so much comfort. i was your jenna and you were my matty. i felt safe around you. we would always sneak away to talk for hours. i wish i could ask you something, that night at the library, under the stars, before someone came to find us (because we had snuck away to talk), did you want to kiss me? i think about that night all the time. we had so much fun, so many meaningful moments. i liked who i was around you. i dont think i would've survived those years without you and your family. you brought light to my life. i wish i could relive that time, i wish my mom would've never moved me away from you, i begged her not to, i tried to stop it. i loved you when we were kids, i think i still love you now, i suppressed those feelings for so long and it all came bubbling back when i found you on facebook. no one else compared to you. im sorry i found you in the middle of grief. im sorry we couldn't save her. i wish life would've only got better and better for you after we left. i love you, i love you, i love you. i want to be there for you, but now you won't talk to me and you have a girlfriend now and it hurts so much. i want to be mad at you (even i don't have the right to be??), but im mad at myself for ever letting you slip out of my hands. i cant help but think we'd probably be married now if i never would've moved or if i would've made more of an effort to keep in contact with you. i feel like you're my soulmate. when your mom showed you my picture she said you said ""from a young girl to a beautiful young woman"" and i just know you remember what we used to be. (i wrote this like a week or two ago) i'm sitting here listening to sad songs about lost love (my eyes adored you) and others being with the one you love and i just wish you would give me another chance, to be your friend again at the very least. i miss you. okay now I'm sitting here listening to ""take a chance on me"" from mamma mia and wishing you would take a chance on me, maybe even if i don't deserve it. im gonna text you encouraging stuff because i care about you and i want you to heal and feel better. i hope you text or call me back eventually, sooner than later though."

Not because he necessarily wanted to, but because he was behind me in line and figured itd be faster just pay for both. Still a win. Still thinking about everything thats been going on, but not a hint of anxiety, no heartbreak, just sadness. You miss your little twin, dontcha? Tears flow from your eyes as you replay the live screenshots from FaceTime. Its ok. Let the tears go. It hurts and it always will. That will never change. Let the pain make you want to better yourself. She loves you too. You can see it in her eyes as she calls out for you during your FaceTime sessions. My sweet little baby... Lots of things have happened recently. Suspicions were confirmed, Relationships ended, stern talking to at work. (Get your shit together) but the one thing Youve been longing for for years and years Is starting to unfold. The one woman that you truly love with all your might has asked you if youd like to attempt another shot at a relationship. The one whos been with you every step of the way. Highs and lows.... but why? (I hate that you even have to ask that) This whole scenario sounds a little too familiar, doesnt it. Its been roughly 4 weeks since the same thing went down with another person. We both know how that worked out. Shes nothing like her though. Nobody will ever compare to this one. Could it be that shes finally seen you in a different light? Shes positive now that youre human and not an emotionless sack. Because youve helped her recently? Shes your home. where You feel the safest. where You feel like nobody will hurt you. Shes the strongest woman you know. Home.... thats a word we havent felt for a long time. Vulnerability is a slippery slope. You can get hurt or maybe in my case, someone will notice that youre a broken soul. Youve been so good about not showing your pain, now its in the wide open.

I think about the way you do cutely waited for me to hug you after we went for coffee the first time. Im extremely proud of myself for even getting here in the first place, I think it paints an extremely promising picture of my future but Im thinking about it a lot now. Im excited, Im waiting for you, but I need reassurance, and Im ready to get hurt."

What the fuck is this. Why are we so stupid and stubborn that weve let these things come between us? I dont think we could realistically come back well from this, not this time. But Im so tempted to message you and tell you how I feel. Weve both said this isnt how we wanted things to go, so I dont understand why we both decided to let it go?! We are both terrified of being hurt but this hurts way more I think. Knowing youre out there and you love, or loved me, and I love you yet someone else will probably end up having you. What the hell. What the actual hell. Im so scared though. Because two weeks have passed and maybe youve changed your mind now and prefer being alone or maybe youre even looking at other options. I dont want to show my vulnerability and have you reject me and take my power. This is so fucked G. We really fucked it this time. And it would have been something amazing. I know it. I feel it in my fucking soul. I really fucking hope we will have our actual tone to shine because we DO work well and you know it deep down."

Everything destroyed. Start from nothing again, but this time a more nothing-er nothing. And the antagonist continues to antagonize. Maybe you wont start to know yourself anymore. You can be so gone from the planet that you can't even formulate words correctly and someone will seize your vulnerability and maybe you will still be blamed Maybe you will fall in love with anyone who has kind eyes Or kind words for you Or god forbid, validates you.

Pain I never anticipated to have. Pain from loneliness in my life. Pain from barrenness. I used to tell you how I was created for motherhood. I never knew it could be this hard to become one. Pain from the depression that Ive been living in due to years of trying to be strong and not let myself feel things I needed to. I know for certain that there are seasons in my life where I felt pure unadulterated joy. And one of those seasons was you. So as Im searching for joy in my life right now, my mind inevitably continues taking me back to one of my favorite seasons. My season with you. Im reliving it because it was happy. I need happy again. I want THAT kind of happy again. But I know happiness doesnt stem from you. Its found somewhere else. You were a kind and loving partner and you brought me immense joy. You did that for me. Thank you for being a bright spot in my life. Thank you for showing me that kind of crazy love, that kind of vulnerability, that kind of care. Its something I look back on all these years later with such gratitude. I smile. But I think I understand it now. That it may not be you that Im so infatuated with and missing right now, but the season of life I was in when we were together. Im trying and working through hard things and I feel like there is an upswing on the horizon. A new season, a new wave, is coming for me. Thank you for giving me a life raft of memories to hold on to until I reach my next shore."

Trying to make sense of things between us. This time, I turned the tables on you. I went to the coast- your part of the coast. 27 minutes away from you. But I didn't see you. And its you, again. Being a jerk to me last week, while high as a kite. Deliberately provoking me. Telling me to come see you. Saying there's another girl you're messaging, but its me you want. Me, getting pissed, and arguing with you. Hanging up on you. Wondering who the person on the other end of the phone call, is. Then, this week, its you, sober. Asking how long I'm on the coast for. Opening up to me. Letting me into your life. Telling me about work getting on your nerves. Teasing and laughing with me. The tension sits thick in the air between us. You tell me you love me, then you'll yank the rug out from under me when you're high. You show vulnerability when you're sober, but then throw the walls up and lash out when you're high. It gets harder for me to answer your calls. You swear its going to be you and I, in the end. You swear you're going to marry me, have kids and grow old with me. You swear you won't settle down, unless its with me. You ask me if I'm seeing anyone. If I've moved on, from you. But everytime I think I do, you rattle the cage again. You remind me of our history. And so I sit here now, 6 hours from you, trying to make sense of it all. Trying to make sense of you. And wondering if it really is going to be us, in the end."

I'm glad that I can bring you my fears and you can hush them. I kind of lied to you when I said I had never made excuses for you. Whenever I doubt you/us, I use the same technique to calm myself and remind myself that I'm just overthinking. It's dangerous because that's how I fall into making excuses for people and letting them get away with too much...the alternative is me not trusting at all. I don't like that. You know I trust too much sometimes and I kinda like that. I think 6 months is a long time to decide if we want to be serious...I think at that point we basically already are...but I appreciate you doing what you can to make me comfortable. You make me so comfortable...the only reason I haven't said anything is because maybe you need that time to figure out of you want to be serious about me. I'm okay with that. I do wonder if you've ever felt like you were in love. I hope you're not afraid of the vulnerability of love...but if you are I hope I can help you ease out of it the way you've helped me with so many things. I'll tell you all of this later, I'm sure...but you're sleeping now and I have to get this out there or else I wont be able to focus.

So here I am now, after everything, sharing them with internet strangers and perhaps you. I hope one day you realize these truths and take my words and soak them into your being, your soul. Because this is what was real with us. And this is what you need to hear. I know now that my truth and words were all too real for you to hear. You were raised with liars, half-truths and deceit. Why would I expect anything more from you? But I did. I took your words and stories at face value. And maybe that was my mistake, but now I know so much better. I know you and your distrustful family so much more than you will ever realize. You knew they were lies and yet you still told them. They knew you were lying and deceitful but still had your back, never letting on to our demise. Our marriage, our union of bullshit you fed me. Ive always been the one to speak the truth, see through the mask and let you hear it...but you never wanted to hear it, you always ran from the truth. Thats why we never worked out, and thats it why I left. I left you, your family and all your lies and secrets you all hold so close against one another. So here they are for you to read or not, most likely you will run away from this as well. Either way, youre welcome to the truth. You didnt know how to love me the way that I wanted or needed at the worst of times. You used control and manipulation to keep me with you. You strung me along and fed me pipe dreams when I was at my lowest and when I couldnt see up from down. And you knew it! You knew when I wasnt at my best and you took full advantage of it. You reaped the rewards and the fruits of my labor for your benefit. Youre welcome. You enjoyed the image you portrayed to everyone on the outside as the doting and loving husband. You wanted so much for a happy family, I believe this, but you could never actually bring your intentions or pre-tensions into fruition. You never had the gusto to make it real. The selflessness and authenticity was never there. It wasnt in your vows and it was never in your actions. All bullshit crumbs for me to survive on for a while, until I woke the fuck up. You couldnt love me through the pain I was going through when we were together. You took it as a sign of weakness and you used it against me. The vulnerability I showed and shared with you were met with disgust and ammo. That was a hurtful experience, betrayal at its finest! And my concerns about your health and well-being...forget about it. You would cry and throw tantrums like a child if I ever brought up my loving concern for you. And then you would throw it back at me like I was being a cold hearted bitch for ever asking a 40-something year old man to get a basic check up. What the fuck is that about?! We literally got into a fight because I ask you to get a annual check up??? Grow up dude! The lies...oh the fucking lies you told me and half truths really started to take a toll on us. You fucked up BIG TIME with this one. The lies in the beginning all the way to the end, Ive not trusted someone so much as you. But I always gave you the benefit of the doubt until it was just too much anymore. Any word that came out of your mouth was considered a lie. I still dont believe you loved me. How could some one love another when they throw shit at them? Or kick them out of the bed while they are sleeping to make them sleep on the couch? Or lock them out of the bedroom or corner them in the kitchen with a knife? Those are not healthy responses to emotions or disagreements, much less love. Maybe it was your type of love, but it sure the hell wasnt mine! Not for me. Never again. The hard fact is, you dont know how to love. And maybe it was because your upbringing, but its no excuse for a man your age. It is no excuse for someone who is supposed to love you. Yes; I fucking left you. I would do it all over again because you will never change. It was always my fault that I left, in your eyes. But in my eyes, I see the truth. This was the truth. I may be heartbroken and (was) broken, but leaving you made me whole again. I know my worth. And you arent worth it. Bye."

Especially in my youth, most times I will admit to intentionally being defiant. I was the man that would do what you said couldn't be done. I would say my track record was half and half. As I found half the time, people were just too lazy or unwilling. If you don't have the desire to do something, you won't 100 percent of the time and therefore, I win because I did it. The other half, they were right. But these things helped me to figure out what made sense sometimes, especially when distinguish between people's lies and truths. I wasn't scared to push buttons for the sake of doing it or for the sake of honesty. I rather you hurt my feelings with the truth than hurt them with a lie. I'm a big boy, or so I think, I can handle it. I'm not scared to be stupid. I'm not scared to chase rabbit holes in search of phenomenons others are just convinced with no tangible evidence is horseshit. I'm not scared. But the choices that I make have always been mine. For better or worse. If I win, great, but I can do better. And if I lose, fine, I can do better. I had the desire to want that once upon a time. To me, life is a neverending period of growth. You don't stop. If you stop, you might as well be dead. And this is why I also wasnt always scared to be vulnerable with others. To put my authentic self out there to a world that I know damn well don't deserve it and won't appreciate the heart I really want to show. But there was a day I was resilient, I'd do it only to be disappointed, but I kept doing it because I held out hope or I wanted to believe that one day I would meet someone that got it, that understood. I haven't met them yet. I really do feel alone in a crowded room. And as I get older it gets harder and I'm afraid that when the day comes, I will treat them like shit cause of all the others before them. But regardless, it's different when I put myself out there. It's another when someone else does. And I'm not talking an A-B conversation. That's totally different too. I'm talking a mass of folks. That's my right. Cause when I'm being foolish, I know I'm be foolish. But when I'm made a fool of, well, as I've learned in my little ole existence we're all fools."
259,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,"Dear ASPD Redditor, and Dear Former Master",1,e91sbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/e91sbo/dear_aspd_redditor_and_dear_former_master/,2019-12-11 14:49:05,"In talking to you and revisiting old notes I had about the questions in my mind, I came to a greater understanding of myself, those around me, and my relation to those around me. I do wish you had left out the bit about limbs and beastiality though. Perhaps you felt the sense that I would be repulsed by such a conversation and would promptly leave you alone. If so, bravo. You were successful in painting a false image of yourself. And if you actually shared the views you presented, well then good for me, for not continuing to allow such an individual in my life. Once the repulsion subsided, I realized why I was drawn to you - the empty space that was mentioned. The taste I received, of the stoic, of the cold and aloof, the calculating. It's so very interesting, like a chess match of words and intents, disinformation and deception. A mentor is not what I need. I don't need someone to create a routine for me. I don't need to be told what to do. That's not really what's missing. And the individual who filled that role for a time, well, I've come to realize that he may be a coward, yes, or he might not really care less if he is labeled as one, for what difference does it make if I know not who he is? Why would the perception in one mind matter when there are so many different perceptions that could be created in the minds of others? I realized that I was asking the wrong question the whole time, regarding him. It affected the way I see the fake smiles and transactions that occur daily in the workplace, elsewhere. ""Do they really care?"" ""Are they being genuine?"" The truth will usually disappoint, though I can say the same about myself as well. The answer, quite frankly, is more often than not, ""No"", not outside of what I can provide him or her. Yes, this person is being ""genuine - genuine to his or her values and priorities. He or she is being their authentic self. I used to think there were more layers to unearth if the surface could just be peeled back by one more conversation, one more encounter, one more shared experience, but that's often not the case. Sometimes we have to accept that the type of person someone is showing themselves to be is who they really are. That's not to say you can't give them the space or opportunity to choose differently, to assume a new behavioral pattern. But one cannot expect that and one should not count on it happening. What questions should I be asking? Subconsciously we already ask ""what value does this relationship bring?"" if not more directly, ""what can this person do for me?"" At one point I sought out those that are sincere, genuine people who care. Lol. What does that even mean? The words are contextual. The questions I've come to ask more and more are, ""What does this person value?"" ""What past experiences have they had?"" ""How do these experiences/biases affect his or her interactions with other people?"" I recognize that vulnerability creates a sense of intimacy, but I've come to realize this too can be false. One can always expose a supposed weakness or bit of information that provides no strategic advantage or can't really be exploited, but might be seen as being vulnerable, and creating that false sense of closeness. I've come to see ""caring"" as manifested by giving time or something of value to someone, in a sort of spectrum or degrees of benevolence. And I've come to realize that I don't really miss my old Master, I miss the perception of himself which he created in me. I miss the character he wrote. I miss a person that doesn't exist. How does one talk to someone that doesn't exist? I suppose I will seek out another mask to converse with. Much like you, with less morbidness hopefully. And as for my former Master, Thank you for sowing seeds. I hate that you manipulated and exploited me. But you have had a great impact on me, even if you aren't the person you portrayed. You showed me how resilient I can be physically, you taught me how to deny myself towards financial and personal goals, you revealed in practice multiple manipulation techniques and tactics. I thank you. \*Sincerely.\* Perhaps I'll stop searching for you now. After all, you don't exist. ;)"

He was overbearing and authoritarian, and because of that none of his kids liked being around him as children or adults. My grandfather died a lonely old man with no friends at his funeral, and family who was there out of obligation not love. For some reason, that stuck with you. And it stuck with me that you didnt want to be like him. We had a good relationship when I was young. I was your little girl. I was your princess. You tucked me in to bed every night and told me you wouldnt trade me for all the gold in the world. Those memories seem like a hazy, out of reach dream now. Maybe I made them up? Because something changed after that. As a young teenager, we somehow went sideways. Yes, I was young and made stupid choices. I was dramatic and moody, I was angry, I was a rebel without a cause. Because somehow you stopped seeing me. I became invisible to you. We got into a bad cycle, I think. You didnt understand me. You hardly knew me. I resented that you didnt even try. You had all these expectations for me. I failed them. You were always angry. I was always angry. But I loved you, and I wanted our good relationship back, I just didnt know how to get there. It didnt seem like you would meet me halfway. Eventually, I became totally invisible to you unless I had fucked up again. Then youd be angry and could see me as the fuck up I was. But at least you saw me. You became more strict with the rules, with me, and more harsh in your punishments as I became older. You would ground me for months on end for simple mistakes. I spent most of my teenage years isolated from my friends because of your punishments. You would take my phone, my radio, my books, throw away the clothes I had bought, take my door off the hinges. You grounded me from the library. Youd forbid me from after school activities and the sports that I loved. I was isolated. Alone. You took everything I loved from me in order to grind me under your thumb. I was free spirited and strong willed, and you did everything you could think of to make me march to your beat. I stopped trying to follow your rules, your demands, your expectation. I stopped trying to live up to your version of me. Because you only loved a version of me- you didnt love the actual me. I stopped trying to talk to you. There was a time when I could come to you for advice. But I stopped trusting you, because anything I said or admitted to, you would use against me. You would punish me for it. If I ever got in too deep or over my head, youd be the last to know if I drowned. I started chasing boys. Older boys, sometimes even men, who I had no business being around. But they saw me. They told me I was smart and pretty. They took me out on dates and gave me the attention I was starving for. I wasnt invisible anymore. Once you realized why I was sneaking around, you called me a whore. You yelled at me. You told me if I got pregnant, youd kick me out. You told me I was a slut and Id end up alone because boys dont want girls like me. One night we had a fight. Something stupid, Im sure. I stayed at a friends house over the weekend because I couldnt handle the fallout. You changed the locks while I was gone. When I came back that morning and realized what you had done, I vowed Id never sleep another night in your house. Because it obviously wasnt my home anymore. I moved in with a boy I had known for 3 weeks. You threw my things out on the curb in trash bags, and I left them there. I kept my vow. Sometimes I see fathers and daughters with happy relationships in real life and I burn with jealousy. I missed out on that. I will never have the chance to have that again. Our relationship left me angry and bitter. It left me scarred and hurt. You taught me to expect to be hurt by the men in my life. You taught me to expect the negative emotions and harmful cycles, because I knew nothing different from you. Im in a happier place now. I have a home with a man who loves me and treats me well. Hes the man who took me in when you kicked me out. He has been excellent to me. I have dogs that have taught me more about unconditional love than you ever could. As an adult, I wish that you could see me. I wish you could see how well I am doing. I wish we had a good relationship. But our relationship is irreparable. The damage youve done is hidden and unseen, but I feel it every day. You never questioned your parenting method. You might tell yourself you did the best you could with a willful daughter with a rebellious streak. But you never talked to me. You never tried to understand me. You never knew me. You didnt even see me, hurting and desperate for your love. I dont need you now. One day you might wonder why you dont have a close relationship to your daughter. In that rare moment of self reflection, I hope all those moments you spent grinding me down and breaking my spirit when I was just a child flash through your mind. I hope you realize that you have become your own father. A lonely old man. No friends. Not even a daughter who will attend your funeral out of obligation. Because I will never forgive you."

It was the same winter snow and the same twilight sky when the one thing I ever wanted, drifted away. Two years later I met you naturally or accidentally I don't know. You were a hot mess of emotions, the cold solitude of a lady and the restlessness of a teen. You are just like a lager beer ya know, cold and blunt but warm when taken in. I felt that emotional connect of a friend and I shared the stories with you that would otherwise be forever unsaid. And then, the story repeated itself just like a dj vu and you drifted away. I understand your rationale behind this and it was in the best interest. My wisdom also saw it coming one day. I guess I deserved one more lamenting to change forever and for good reasons. I also deserved a better farewell though :( I'm just gonna hate winters even more now. So here's wishing you the best. -Roy :)"

I dragged you out to watch the sunrise on the back porch that morning. We just worked. You were funny, and passionate, and smart, and kind, and genuine, and every other clich, lovely adjective in the book. I feel like Id regret it if I didnt kiss you. Ive never had to put myself out there like that before, you sure did make me work for it. But kissing you, fuck I felt like I was 16 again, feeling that fuzzy feeling of utter closeness and vulnerability for the first time. My heart was so, so broken when we crossed paths. I only told you a bit about that, and its sappy to say you made me believe in soulmates, but you made me feel whole. Now, some years later, I find myself looking for you in every guy I meet. Its sad, but I havent quite been able to find that spark in anyone else. I dont love you, and you dont love me. We will likely never be together.

Your confession was part of your seduction. I have had to conclude that you were seducing me the whole time. I scarcely got to know you. The person you showed me is the person who you thought I wanted. That's the beginning of seduction, as you understand it. It took me three years to understand a little of seduction and the tangled mess it can make of a person who depends upon it to get through life. I had never understood the topic. Knowing what you displayed, I want none of it. I have learned to fear women who try to seduce me in the way that you did. I am grateful for this fear. I confessed to you my naivety in dating. I confessed that I had long since ruled myself out of the dating pool, for reasons of mental imbalance. You did not believe me. You assumed I was seducing you in kind. Was I? Did I do or say something seductive? You also confessed to me, twice, that you ""only make friends with men who I would date."" Honey, we weren't friends. We were dating, de facto, even if there was no touch. It was not friendship. It could never have been friendship. It will never be friendship. I regret that I ever allowed this fiction between us. I regret that I sought you out more than once. I was euphoric at the time, but in the end I was exhausted, angry, panicky, obsessed. I showed you myself at depths that I have shared with no others. You welcomed it, from the get go. We hung out for seven hours on the first day we met. You confessed your severe eating disorder to me before we had gone twenty paces. Yeah, you showed me yourself, but that's your schtik, isn't? You get by thanks to would-be heroes. Gals don't do it for you, but you wish they would. I wish I had bailed after after those first twenty steps, but I had never heard such candor from a woman. More the fool me. I didn't understand, till years afterwards, that you seduce by pity. I tell you this: your vulnerability invited me to share depths of myself that I had shared with no one. Compare Lewis Capaldi's hit. But your vulnerability is part of your whole con to get a man's attention, and it's only a man's attention that you want. If you can get the attention without the sex, all the better. You confessed your trauma and hurt to me. You confessed your mistrust of men. You confessed your dislike of ""anything boy-girl."" I believed you. Nonetheless, you invested yourself in me, a man, for hundreds of hours in a period of five months. What's more, I invested myself in you, or in thoughts of you, for three years beyond those foolish few months. I believed you. I listened to you. I was willing to emasculate myself for you. I did so, just to remain close to you. It was a sham. You resent me and my flaws. You can see only flaws, in yourself or in others. You can't say a kind word and mean it. The signs were there but I did not believe it. You claimed to have modeled yourself after my habit of kind speech. That should have been sign enough, but at the time I was a sucker for flattery. You despise me for being so easily seduced, yet you seduce freely. You know only how to seduce. I fell in love with you, darling. I fell in love with you. I fell in love with the fucked-up addicted woman that you showed me, just because I am a fucked-up addicted man. What's worse is that you confessed to knowing all along that I was falling in love with you. You counted on it. You preyed on my loneliness. You are not the only vulnerable one, hun. It's a shame you will never know it."

Nothing else mattered but you for so long, and it took me so long to understand that you were changing irrevocably. So yesterday, when I saw you and you were so dead on the inside. So angry, and that light wasn't there. I realized it after we got home. I realized that I haven't seen that light inside of you for a long time. And that makes me sad, and scared. Because if I met you now oh, I would never have wanted to have a family with you. I wouldn't even have wanted to be with you. I miss your light. It took me a long time to understand how much of my upbringing formed my tie to you. it took me so long to understand how the toxic nature of my relationship with my father drew me to you because it was the safest place that I knew inside myself. And I'm sorry I can't say this to you, because I know you would only use it to hurt me, and not come from a place of understanding that my opening up to you and sharing this vulnerability with you, is to help you heal too. To help you understand who I was and why things happened the way they did so you can let go, even if you don't forgive. The problem is now, of course, that both of us are almost totally passed forgiveness. Both of us have reached, after so many years, a place where we don't want to forgive each other. We want to be done with each other, but we can't. We have a child together, and she's not going anywhere. So we are stuck, detesting each other, fighting each other, but even more painful, trying to avoid each other because we know that there is no way that this is working. I don't mind the avoiding. I fought for a long time for us to work together, and even if I was making mistakes, at least I tried. I don't think I can say the same of you. I think you withdrew for me the moment you found out I was pregnant, and you just continued to widen that got between us. I know why you did it, and I understand from a place of having read about many other people in this situation. I don't like it though, and I never will. But I have the capacity to understand why you did the things you did and I've let go of most of it. The problem is that I can't let go of your recent behavior. Because it's recent, it's not old news, it's not the past, it's not something that I can look back at with the decreased emotional pain that comes with time. and just like back then, you have no room in yourself to look at what you're doing, and see how it's impacted the people around you. I miss your light. We both changed, but I never expected you would become this. I never expected that we would grow so far apart, when you were so important to me. Even if I can look back and see objectively that it wouldn't have worked, there's still something left in me from that very first moment, and I don't know if the correct course of action is to seek to expunge that moment from my mind and my heart so that I can just deal with you as you are now, or if I should hold that piece of you in my heart as if it is a precious Jewel that needs to be kept shiny and new so that I can always remember the boy that I fell in love with. Either way, in the last year you have hurt me more than I've ever been hurt by you, and I don't think I will ever be able to truly trust you again. And that makes me incredibly sad."
265,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,I wish I didn't love you,1,edg1xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/edg1xj/i_wish_i_didnt_love_you/,2019-12-21 08:05:31,"Dear J, I don't even know how to begin this. I met you almost a year ago, and everything changed. never have I ever felt a connection so deep as I have to you. so comfortable in your presence, so relieved to fully be me. you taught me so very much, you taught me vulnerability. you taught me how to take risks. how to love. you taught me that it was okay to feel pain, to feel heartache, to open up. you were a breath of fresh air for me. one that I constantly needed to breathe in. you were intoxicating. I never thought I could fall in love with anyone, the idea always drove me insane. having been in previous relationships, I never fell in love, it was purely appreciation with a hint of infatuation. but then you came along, and I found myself falling, falling so fast and so hard, I couldn't control it. But I wish I never loved you. you've got my devotion but man, I can hate you sometimes. you've hurt me so many times, that all I can expect from you is disappointment. you've dealt with my emotions as though they were a switch, easy to turn on and off. you've left me questioning my value to you, whether I was worth anything to you, whether you truly loved me in the first place. was I enough? was it ever going to be enough? I wish I knew why you're constantly cycling between being platonic and being romantic. why can't you just make your mind up? why are you stringing me along for the ride? can't you see that this hurts? can't you see that I'm so close to turning my back and never coming back? I'm so tired. loving you has been exhausting. I can feel my heart expanding, only to be left empty. I don't know if you love me, or if you mean to do all this. but I do know that if loving someone was meant to be easy, you were the exception. I wish I didn't love you. maybe then, I could finally look at life peacefully and not resentfully, for introducing you to me. Best, Yours truly."

Wish you would join me. I wish you would join me in everything. I wish youd let me join you in everything. So now, I wont have to worry about Lexi. Or you. And neither of you need to even concern yourself with me...assuming you ever did. I reactivated my Facebook briefly. You've not changed your name yet. (Betcha you will shortly after I post this). But you have blocked all your pictures. You need to tell me if there is anything you want to save from mine before I delete it permanently. This person, this therapist or counselor or whatever they are...they wont be able to provide answers or closure. Or perspective. I know what this is about. I've always known what this about. And time will tell. In time, all things come to light. In time, we will both see. I'll never forget what you have done for me. And what you have done to me. Its amazing, how you have become the single greatest thing, and the thing I most regret, in my life. I wish you would be honest with me. I've been honest with you, and I certainly dont lie so cheaply to you. And you go on about vulnerability and trust... I suppose none of this matters anymore, does it? I'm right here. I love you. And you are enough for me. I know you are scared. Maybe this mental health person will give me some insight into my pain, my trauma. Or at least some way to cope with it all. Cope with losing my brother. You. My life. You wanted to ""break the cycle"", but you are just fine letting run *alllllll* the way through one last time, to give yourself the space and time and distance you need and want. Break the cycle by letting me in, and letting my stay in, and not running from me. But you wont. You cant do that. It's ok. You want a happy, quiet life? I dont know what was wrong with our life. I wasnt very happy with it for a while. I was sick. Like, actually ill. I had shingles. Everything hurt. Everything. Inside and out, backwards and forwards, emotionally and physically. Everything hurt. Work kept...fucking me. I was lost. Confused. Angry. But it wasnt against you. I miss you very much. But you dont miss me, do you? Or do you? What's true anymore? What difference does it all make? Over time, it wont. We will both stop caring, what little we have left to care for...and we will be memories. *""All those moments, will be lost in time. Like tears, in rain.""*"

Maybe start acting like it? I refuse to bring any more uncertainty or anxiety over this shit into another damn year. Figure it out then dude. Im sure none of your buddies ever get left on read. Im sure when things are weighing them down youd drop everything to help them. You got pissed bc I took myself off the app but you dont even barely touch it anymore. You dont do or stick by any of the things you said you would that are even remotely related to that app. What do you want for Christmas? Hell I didnt even know I matter enough that would even ask.

Last Christmas, you took something from me I can never have back. My sense of peace. My sanity. The life and innocent naivety I had. Now, I fear snow. It feels so pathetic to say that, but I fear this time of year now. Theres an endless amount of triggers. I didnt even know what triggers were until I was robbed of my normal life. Last Christmas, you took my ability to sleep and eat away. I didnt eat for weeks; I didnt sleep for months. I became a weak, dying version of the person I once knew as myself. Last Christmas, you took my ability to trust away. I watched myself isolate myself from the people I loved out of fear. I blamed myself. I could barely walk by the time I finally accepted help. I was starving, exhausted; dying. I had given up. But last Christmas, you also gave me some things. Last Christmas, you gave me a challenge. The biggest challenge of my life, a challenge to see who I really was and what parts of me I could use to heal from this. Last Christmas, you gave me the insight of who was really there for me, who I COULD truly trust. Last Christmas, you gave me a breakup. One I am now incredibly thankful for and had no idea I needed. This Christmas, Im healing. This Christmas, I took everything you had given and taken from me and I made a new life. And I love it. This Christmas, I am thankful. Not for you or what you did to me, but thankful for the journey. Ive grown so much this year. This Christmas, I am in the arms of someone who taught me what love really is. Someone who was there for me every step of the way when I lost so many others throughout this journey. This Christmas, I am no longer afraid. I see my strength in the snow. I hear my willingness to keep going in the Christmas music. This Christmas, I am still not entirely healed. I still have bad days and bad nights. But this Christmas, I am giving you something back. My strength, my kindness, and my vulnerability. Though I will never see you again and you will never read this letter, I wish you to know this season- I will not become bitter, unkind, or untrusting. There is strength in who I am and who I was and I will not let you take those things away from me. You did not break me, you made me stronger. I made me stronger. Merry Christmas."

You saw me in a state of complete vulnerability, and you took advantage. It might not have been assault and it might have not been harrassment, but it broke me. To hear the of events i didnt know happened. I was in a broken place when you told me and ive been repairing myself to this day. You took from me my peace of mind and trust. I don't know why i keep it a secret. You probably don't even remember. In a time where i needed a friend and confidant. You spoke the words that shattered my already fragile grasp on reality and life. To this day i don't know if you lied or actually did it, why you might lie about somethings so grave i will never understand. That tears me up inside. You, the one i called my best friend and someone i considered my sister, were the catalyst of my eternal feeling of filth. I wish the best in life, because you took from me months of mental stability and have given me a life time of insecurity and emotional pain. You hang out with those i still consider friends. Friends that will never know what you told me, because i cannot bring myself to ruin you like you did me. I wish you a good life because you have robbed me of my own."

When you left, you took my heart with you. Now Im just empty. Now Im just waiting for you to return it. Fate tore us apart, maybe it can bring us back together.

I spent the first two years coaxing my heart into falling in love with you. It wasnt possible, but I loved you. I thought: This is the person Ill be spending my life with, I need to make it a happy one. I did love you. I loved you unconditionally; that was the only way I knew how to love. Despite the pain that you caused, despite the accusations, despite the passive aggression that chocked me, I let it all slip away, because I loved you. Falling in love and loving someone is incredibly different, I tell you, but I loved you nonetheless. You got sick, I stayed by your side, naturally. We had a kid. You got very sick, and I was never tired. Sad, yes. Sometimes frustrated, yes. But I never ever felt that it was your fault. You fell into depression, I tiptoed. I swept away everything that triggered your illness. I took care of you like a mother takes care of her children. I was balancing being a wife taking care of her falling apart husband, I was a 20 year old mother, I was studying, I had to keep an image. Although I was exposed to your vulnerability, which I sincerely felt beautifully proud of you, you still felt the need to act tough, lying through your teeth, belittling me just because I was a woman. You would spark fights and arguments about petty things: raising my voice, being tired, busy with my son, studying for an exam. Yes, I was constantly tired. Because I didnt want you to break even more. I cleaned everything spotless. I became an invisible support for you just so that people would not notice your weakness and make you feel bad about yourself. I was tired, but every time I saw you smiling... that was my reward. They told me you have loved me ever since we were little. When we got married, you professed your undying love. I took comfort in those daily proclamations of love. After you got sick, and about three years later of managing everything for you, I got sick. I was way worse. You had an irrational fear of a particular thing. My OCD included everything I touched. I had meltdowns. I had seizures. I was losing my mind. Two months later, you started giving up on me. I never gave up on you, so why? Where was this love you talked about? I needed you during that time, but you only stood far away. I gave you excuses, you werent mentally capable, perhaps, due to your own illness? But then, it got worse. You would prefer yourself over me. You were selfish. I was dying, scrubbing away for you, then grating my flesh away because of my OCD. I am disappointed. Disappointed that you gave up on me, after eight years, you just gave up. Disappointed that you did not remember all that I gave you. Disappointed. You did not love me. You liked how I looked. You had a preconceived idea of who I was and you thought that in reality I would be the same image you have thought in your mind. I am not. I married you at 18, we separated at 25, I grew, I bloomed, I learnt, I experienced, but you stayed the same. That is really disappointing. I could write and write and write, but I feel like a bad person, bad mouthing you. I have to say, you had a good side. You liked to shower me with gifts. You would buy me anything I wanted. You would watch a romance movie just to learn what to do with me. You would try your hardest to surprise me. Thank you, those were enough to make me love you. I loved you for how much you tried. We are separated now, despite the fact that I am relieved, I still chock and cry whenever I hear your name. Your son loves you. I still have a connection with because of him. My heart aches when I have to discuss things with you regarding our son ... I have so much to say."

Why else would you bring up the book I gave you forever ago? Why else would you sit down and read it again? Why else would you feel the need to randomly tell me you did? So yes. I still love you. It doesnt matter that Im a million miles away now. So what if Ive moved on and seen other people and so have you? I still do. It doesnt mean Ive stopped. I love you. And that use to terrify me. But Ive made my piece with it. You can tell. You see that Ive grown comfortable in my skin. That Ive grown into the personality Ive always faked. That Ive learned to be the woman I needed to be. And you know. But does it scare you? That I can still openly love you and be okay at the same time? That Im comfortable with the sheer vulnerability I allow myself to have around you? Why? Is it my strength, or is it because you dont truly believe that love can exist independently, without constant fuel? Is it because we were taught that love had to be the huge rollercoaster, an unstable thing? No see Ive learned THATS passion, and we have that once we feed it, but what I keep is love. So yes, to answer the unasked question. I love you. And thats okay. - your platonic lover"

drink after another hoping it will give me the energy i need to get through the day. i have no trouble, however, getting out of bed at 4AM, leaving the house in no more than a loose t-shirt and sweatpants, and walking in circles for what seems like forever. everything is suspended in a different dimension in the early morning and the isolating feeling is near romantic, as only i am here to see the sleeping world, and feeling my arms and feet freeze is so numbing and peaceful *i want to stay here forever* youve always asked why i am so anxious all the time. well i am *never* doing enough to satisfy anxietys hungry maw because when i do something it just tells me to do more and i am never feeding anxiety enough to sate it and its hunger ripples through me in waves and i am always *so worried* that i am starting everything too late that i will never succeed that i will never be happy and depression sees this and takes me in and tells me that im right and maybe, instead of trying, i should just stay in bed because ill never get anything done anyways. anxiety comes back, it's still starving and jealous of the sadness depression leeches out of me desperately, and anxiety comes and whispers in my ear that i am useless and that if i stay in bed everyone will hate me and theres a growing feeling of overwhelming doom growing from the pit of my stomach. i have been reduced to a game of tug of war being played by my thoughts i feel like i am constantly drowning in the null void i have hollowed out of my heart and filled with gasoline and that i am swallowing myself whole and throwing myself back up again and that i am caught in a cycle of vicious self hate and that i no longer can look in a mirror and recognize myself and then i am so hungry all the time *i am just trying to make you proud* *seven -* *truthfully,* it is so hard trying to love you because i keep replaying the way you look at me in my head when i show you a memory ive kept under lock and key in a cabinet in the back of my head and dare to put myself in that vulnerability and *all i can see* is *disappointment* in your eyes. i am sorry for being something i cannot control you just dont seem to think

i try to carve some semblance of feeling into my skin it is *not* your place to tell me that i am doing this for attention. you wonder why i do not talk to you anymore when every time ive talked to you all i was asking for was a moment of your understanding, but *no,* you *always* have to make things about yourself i am *so sorry* but i am absolutely sick of looking at myself from your shoes. you are not the victim of my struggles and you definitely do not hurt more from my problems than i do. *no* your emotions arent the most important in the world, and im not saying mine are either, just that is first thing you really want to say is that i hurt *you?* i am just so tired all the time, not just of myself or work or school or sports but of *you.* i know the sound of your footsteps, i know the sound of your breathing, and you keep asking where does anxiety come from? where does anxiety come from look *down* at your hands and *realize* its pouring from the constant terror i live in every day of *you*, overflowing from the thoughts that that i am not what you wanted, because if you dont want me, who else would? *you mean so much to me.*"

I'm writing this as a means of catharsis, a farewell to you and a farewell to the last few agonizing months since I've met you. September to December have been the slowest fucking months for me this entire year. Mostly November. You probably haven't realized what I've done- unfriending you from all social media platforms a few days ago honestly. And when you do realize, you most likely won't have much of a reaction. Trust me when I said I forgive you for what you've done to me. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. Remember what I said? The last time I saw you. That I don't have the heart to resent you. That my trauma from my childhood drove me into my worst depressive spiral, as if I were the one drinking poison whilst expecting the one who hurt me the most to die. That I simply don't have the energy and heart to despise someone so immensely anymore. That there is absolutely no hatred or anger towards in you in my heart and even if there was a drop of anger, it would only last a few short minutes. I only wish you were more clear that you didn't see a future with me. Not even as a friend. I didn't tell you this but the basis of my most traumatic childhood memory was having my trust on a significant figure in my life to be absolute broken. I highly value honesty, so what if I got hurt by the truth? You were always the logical, honest and upfront one anyways. This is why I had to unfriend you everywhere. Your name whenever I saw it was a reminder of how ashamed I am of my actions, allowing myself to become so vulnerable to someone that never saw any value in me. This is what I regret, I don't regret meeting you. In fact, I'm actually glad that you exist in this world. But what I do regret is allowing myself to show you so much of if not all, of my vulnerability. I wish I can take that back. Instead I ignored all the blaring signs and allowed myself to get strung along all those weeks. I should have left after you said you weren't ready to enter a relationship so soon. I should have stopped trying anyways. Truthfully I should have left the moment you constantly brought up your ex-girlfriend, almost every time I met you always slipped her into our conversations. I should have left the moment you said you we're afraid of tricking and hurting me. It was only then when I confronted you about it, the last day of October was when I had enough. That yes it was psychotic of you. Absolutely selfish. But Christ R, why can I easily forgive you but I can't even forgive myself? I'm back in that dark pit again, slipped and now falling in this endless spiral just when I barely climbed my way out. I feel so disgusted and disappointed towards my entire being. I can't believe I allowed myself to be like this, allowing myself to lose grip of who I am. One thing I do appreciate and acknowledge is that you were sincere in your apology. I forgive you, I do I really really do. I messaged you last Monday. Its not because I wanted to ask a lousy favour from you. But because I can't continue the arrangement anymore. I intended in giving you a gift for Christmas along with the intention of saying everything I am writing in this letter straight to your face. I felt as if seeing you was more sincere that way. But knowing me, I would forget everything I wanted to say if I ever saw you one more time. That it would just be a waste of your time, gas and energy again anyways. Even if I disappeared completely I know you wouldn't bat an eye. I'm merely a passing person in your life, not even worth a page of your story. I know I mean nothing to you. That's why this silent farewell is for the best. Writing this with a heavy heart, I wish I confessed how I really did feel about you. I think I would feel lighter now if I did. You we're like a fireball that crashed in to my mundane life. Remember the 2nd time I met you was on your birthday, I told you that my first impression of you was that you were so darn bright. Now I fear that you meeting me has completely dimmed that beautiful light of yours. I admit I suppose I did idealize you the first few times we met. Despite it all, after you spilled out so vulnerably about your past, your mistakes and all the reckless shit you've done- I still liked you. Terribly so. I remember this memory so clearly. We were sitting at that overly priced hot pot placed you dragged me into. That was the third time I saw you. It terrified me because I wanted to see you navigate through this life no matter what. As an idealist,the one this I can never imagine is a life where I would be loved. Maybe that's why I was so desperate for answers. Desperate to label what we were. So desperate to hang onto what eventually came to be nothing. I don't fear loneliness like you. I've been alone for my entire life, how is it going to be any different when I'm older? What's hilariously contradictory is what I do fear, is never creating a connection with anyone. A genuine connection, whether it platonic or romantic. I want to be seen, R. I want to be embraced for who I am, to be unabashedly be *me*. So even if I never find this person, so be it. I've already reconciled with loneliness anyways. I'm so sorry that we ever crossed paths. If ever I was given the chance to press a button that would erase all your memories of me I would press it in a heartbeat. Now, I don't really want to end this letter in a sad note. The next few paragraphs are written forms of the memories we shared. Because there were some pretty great moments we had that I will cherish forever. Our first encounter was a strange one. Something that I will always fondly look back on. What time was it? Around 2 AM I was waiting at the train station for you to pick me up as we headed to grab some donuts. We picked up your friend who needed a ride back home. He passed out drunk in the back seat, whilst we continued our conversation that was so bright and happy. For the longest time I never felt so refreshed, no actually I don't think I've ever felt a sensation that made me feel so free. I really fooled myself thinking that we clicked really well. The other day actually I laughed out loud remembering the time we went bowling. It was your birthday. Oh god did I dread the words that came out of your mouth: ""We have time to kill before the movie, so billiards or bowling?"". I wanted to make you happy, and since I don't understand a single thing about billiards I chose bowling. I wanted to die, did you not see my soul leaving my body? Was this what it was like hanging out with an extrovert? I was totally out of my comfort zone then since I've mostly been with other introverts my whole life. It's been years since I last went bowling too. Oh man those were happy times though, even if I lost. Then I remembered that ping pong game at the arcade you took me on my birthday a week later. Fuck was I awful at that, I was so embarrassed I wanted to melt into a pool on the floor and evaporate outta there. I had so much fun though. Thanks for being patient with me that day too, I was so exhausted after my construction tutorial I felt so guilty I was killing your excitement. You chose the food for me at the restaurant too. I also remember that you matched your socks with your shirt that day with the flamingos- it was cute and sweet. Even your coworkers mentioned that they liked it you said. When you said you we're glad that I looked like the way I was I was confused. We were eating maccas inside your car on your birthday. We talked about identity, and how I never felt like I really had one because I didn't look like my race and was constantly pissed off when 'my people' wouldn't acknowledge the fact that yes, I am one of them. I was always made fun of by my friends that I was adopted because I didn't look like my parents or siblings, so often they did this that I was at a point where I was already numb to it all. But It was like I was seen for who I was for the first time when you told me that. You know how much fun it is to finally share and talk to someone that had similar interests as me? You were that very first someone. You don't know how you look like when you smile and your eyes crinkle when you we're happy, and excited. Your smirk when I said something that was funny. You look so young and boyish when you were in a good mood. Despite it all I really did enjoy your company. And at the very least I was glad that I made you happy the last time I saw you. I cut you off, I was talking about how you should watch my favourite series of all time (trying to convince you the millionth time again), but I heard you during the drive back to my house. I just didn't acknowledge it then. ""My mood really went up because of you."" Fifth time we met. The 2nd movie we watched together. You know, I didn't cry because of how tragic that scene with the van was. But I cried because I knew you were thinking about your ex-girlfriend during that scene. The entire movie in fact. I felt so much of your pain flow through me when you cried in the theatre, I so badly wished that I could take some of that pain away. When you dropped me off I fixed your hair. You said that you knew what my type was after i fixed your fringe parting to how I liked it. What the hell even is my type. I said my type was someone opposite me. We even have the exact opposite personalities. That's why it was always refreshing to be with you because you were so different from me. Even though I know that I'm nothing like you ideal, unfortunately you are very close to what I think mine is. Sixth time. We left your glasses at the playground when I realized I was late for my train and sprinted off to the station. I still feel so bad about that. You look really good with your new one's by the way. You suit the new style way better. You don't know how scared I was when you got into a car accident again. I broke a glass earlier that week, and for some reason I just knew that something bad happened with you and your car before you even messaged me. Thank you for introducing me to Kingsway. I'm constantly over there now. It's funny because it really reminds me of a place near my high school back home, so it feels so familiar. Thank you. The only thing I kept is the playlist I made you. I'm glad you enjoy the songs. I do realize that the lyrics might be a bit sensitive and I feel so bad if they do trigger memories for you. I forgot to tell you but I only really listen for the music, an not for the lyrics. I'll try to add songs that you like from time to time. I don't think you'll listen to it anymore after you realize that I removed myself from you everywhere though. I look back at all the memories with fondness, there's so much more but I'll keep them to myself for now. Thank you for being patient with me. I know I'm so emotional and sensitive but that does not mean I'm weak. Sometimes though, I feel as if you we're sick of me repeating the same shit again so you kissed me every time to shut me up. I wish you didn't do that because I didn't feel heard. I apologise for not being so vocal and straightforward about everything. My entire life I never shared a lot to those close to me in fear that my vulnerability would hurt them. Everything came easy with you maybe because you were a complete stranger and sharing things with someone that knew nothing about me is easier sometimes. When you played with my hair, cup my face and held my hand. I felt desired and honestly. I'm so ashamed to admit that I crave such simple intimacy. The last day of October I wish we could have watched the show we both like that's coming out in ten days together. That you could come to the One Ok Rock concert with me. That I could talk to you about the visual novel that you introduced me to, that I have yet to get back on because it just reminds me of you. I wish we could go back to that pizza place because I really wanted to try their garlic pizza. So much places I associate with you now, I can't deny it doesn't hurt every time I remember the memories. Too late to tell you all of this now huh. I really liked you R. I mean, you're my first love after all. Be honoured, haha! I know that I won't find someone like you ever. That you will always have a place in my heart. I can't ever forget someone like you. I won't be trying with love again anytime soon, a long while or ever again really. I wish you a good life. May the new year be kinder to you. But most importantly I hope you'll be kinder to yourself. Forgive yourself. I hope that there will come a time again that you'll allow to open up your heart again. I hope she makes you happy. I hope she makes you feel so loved like you really deserve. I'm easily replaceable to you so I'm not worried that you won't find the one again. You naturally attract others, you're fun to be with and you're pretty social too. I hope love will find you again. Please drive safe wherever you go. I wish you all the best in returning back to uni. Don't slack off and get that degree of yours. Know that I am really proud of you. You survived a really tough year this year. I proud of you hanging on to your job, I know its repetitive and that work is exhausting and driving you absolutely nuts but keep going. This job was given to you as a blessing and you're financially stable because of it. I know you're not religious, and I'm not the most religious person ever either but I do pray for you. Always. May you be heal healthily over the new year. Anyways, this was long huh. I want to say thank you for making me feel like I could be loved and cared for. For making me feel as if I was worthy of that. Even if it was for a short while. Even if it meant nothing to you. Even if I was used in the end. Because in the very least, it meant something to me. If we cross paths again I hope you'll smile at me. I hope you understand why I had to do what I did, that I had to protect myself. To finally give myself a little kindness. To my first love. To a friend that I really have come to deeply value but recently had to let go of. I'm sending you all my love. Best, C."
278,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Clarity,3,ejirxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/ejirxi/clarity/,2020-01-04 04:41:26,"Hey, So I know you said you didnt want to talk on my birthday because it might end badly, so I would really like to talk now. I think Im starting to understand that you probably wont give me clarity, because for entirely fair reasons you dont want to think about things that put you in a bad head space. Im going to just have to take the clarity I can get. Im sorry I have to push but the sad thing is, the current state of whatever we are has put ME in a bad head space, and there is only so long you can sit in a dark place before you have to come up for air, whatever the cost. There are sooooo many things I want to say to you. Firstly I love you, I probably always will and I am coming to terms with that. The second is I deserve better. You know I deserve someone who acts like they care about how I feel. And Im not saying that to be a defeatist, or start a fight, its because as much as I love you, I also love me, and I know what being loved should feel like. The third is Im not stupid, I know when youre manipulating me. Ive kind of pushed it off for so long because if I admit it means there is a problem with us. But I know when you do it. and just so you know, every time I see you do it to me, my heart breaks just a little more. Every time I see you ignore my messages for days because it gives you power, every time you make me feel bad for something that is totally legitimate, every time you reference something super sad because you know Ill give you whatever you want in the face of it. I know what youre doing. Ive just been trying to give you the benefit of the doubt. Regardless of me and how its made me feel, please address that, for your own happiness. Youll never form real connections if you always have to have the power in a relationship. I understand why vulnerability would be hard given what happened in your past, and why manipulating people so that you have the power would feel safe, but being vulnerable and open is the only way to love and connection. There are thousands of years of human history that can attest to that. So because I love you so much and I want you to be happy, Im asking you please dont get defensive when you read this. Im not saying it out of anger. There is really very little anger left. I just want you to realise that because youre crazy smart and have had to fight to get what you want, youre very good and playing on emotions. But when you do it, it made me feel small and powerless, and thats not a feeling that can be sustained by anyone without damage. The fourth is Im sorry. I know Im fucked up. I have been able to coast for long enough on my current psych because its never really been pushed. Thinking Im healthy and mature. But know Im fucked up. I can blame it on childhood or academic pressure, but the truth is Im just as avoidant as you, so when you want to avoid things I just cave because it means I dont have to deal with the problem either. And when I really want to avoid things, the words never even leave my brain, instead a thousand excuses flood and I conclude now is not the time. And then the pressure builds. What happened earlier this year was totally my fault for that reason. I should have said something way earlier, whether you made it easy for me to say or not. Instead my annoyances came out in passive aggressive jibs, and fb stalking. For that Im really sorry, theres no excuse for it - its immature and toxic and I am working on being better. Lastly, I wish you could be honest with me, I dont know what I did to make you feel like you had to lie to me or hide things from me. It sucks that you feel you need to do that. All I ever wanted was to be a part of you life and have you be a part of mine. Thats all the ulterior motive I ever had haha. But it takes two people to be in a relationship, not one pushy person. Thanks for reading all this and for the all the laughing and fun and connection we had. Ive never felt anything like it and maybe never will again. Its been a life lesson. I might not get an answer to all of this, and if thats the case that would suck but Ill be okay. Hope you figure stuff out and are happy. Xx"

Its a mechanism Ive developed to keep those feelings from chewing and ripping at my heart when they get angry with me after encountering disappointment. I believe that if Im strong and courageous enough to tame them, they cant hurt me. This sordid habit is the reason that, despite opening your texts right away, I wait anywhere from thirty minutes to hours to text you back. Its the reason that I havent sent you voice messages to say goodnightwhen you have. Or the reason that I dont call you as often as Id like. Id love to hold your hand more often and tell you how your smell drives me crazy; Ive worn your t-shirt to bed for four nights in a row now (and I only ever wear t-shirts for a max of two). I realize that these actions might seem like Im disinterested, or that I dont like you as much as youd wish. The truth is, Im terrified of letting those brutish, wild feelings roam freely. What if you dont like me as much as I like you? Or, what if you dont like me at all? *You offered and drove me in the infamous LA traffic to the airport (and woke up at 6am to drive me back when I didnt even ask!), you told your mom about me, you call me gorgeous, you call to ask about me, take pictures of us all the time, and cuddle me all night whenever you sleep over*. Surely you must like meperhaps a littleright? Why do I feel like I dont deserve this? Trusting people has always been a challenge for me; and after a relationship that left me very hurt after showing absolute naked vulnerability, the challenge has become even harder. Im now trying to swim in a tempestuous, salty ocean while my arms and legs are covered in small cuts, and although it hurts, Im learning that it is not impossible. For now, please keep laughing at my stupid jokes and sleeping over. Those cuts will heal soon enough anyway."

Goodness knows you thought about it; your prolific and graphic writing well and truly demonstrated that. There were opportunities. Weren't there? There seemed to be. If not, you could have created one, or more. Which leads me to wonder sometimes if you were a coward, too afraid of the ramifications to go beyond the surface level, even if it meant your need remained un-sated. I wonder how much of it was about me, personally. Maybe it was a rejection of me that you didn't want to. I know I filled a certain space for you. My vulnerability was appealing, I think, among other things. But perhaps it could have been anyone. I don't know. I wonder if you thought I'd reject you. Plenty can be said in writing that may not translate to reality. You weren't to know that I wouldn't have, not without putting yourself out there, a toe in the water, and if I had declined, or if I hadn't - either way, the whole thing would have blown apart. I wonder if you weighed that up, and on balance decided it wasn't worth risking *knowing*. I wonder if you were more scared that I'd assent. Maybe you really *were* just cognizant of the consequences. Perhaps you felt if you kept it all within certain lines, it wouldn't be that bad, for me, or for you. That there'd be no lasting impact. I think you'd agree neither of us can say that's the case. Or maybe it was never about sex at all. Power can be seductive. Manipulation, games, a hunter playing with it's prey. I wonder how long it would have continued and what might have transpired, if left to unfurl naturally. Maybe I wouldn't be wondering anymore."
285,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,What I wish I could have said,1,dwlht9,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/dwlht9/what_i_wish_i_could_have_said/,2019-11-15 15:24:15,"Dear A, You met me during a time in my life where I was scared and confused. Vulnerable. Sifting through my feelings, wondering how to feel. Reeling from a pregnancy I wasnt ready for, an abortion that left me with invisible scars, and a relationship with a lying narcissist that was a crumbly mess. And I was alone, processing it all. So let me tell you, you were like a warm, comforting embrace during this chaotic time in my life. One that I leaned into, without hesitation. Even if it was wrong. When I opened your message, I was just looking for a friend. Sometime to talk to, to make me feel like I wasnt alone in all of this. To pass the time. To make a meaningful connection with. I met you and it all just clicked. You couldnt deny we had a sort of chemistry. It was dynamic. We could talk for hours about the most random things and laugh. I confided in you, with all my secrets. You listened and reassured me. No judgements. I needed that so much. You have no idea. But then, you started to push the boundaries. You admit that. Flirting here and there. Seemingly harmless comments. Ones that normally would make me uncomfortable, because I was not yet single and you were aware of that, but I didnt push them away. I almost embraced it. I didnt realize how starved I was for attention. I knew, I knew, I knew. But for once, I felt seen and heard and cared for. From someone who I had never even met. But, it felt so warm. One day, it just escalated into something inappropriate and romantic. It was so intense and quick, snowballing from there. Instead of pushing you away, I fell into it without resistance, because I was weak and hungry for something to fill the void. All that love bombing you showered me with *did* fill that void. It felt so magical and absolutely unreal. I had never felt like this before and it made me hungry for more. It even made me ignore all the red flags. Deep down, I knew it was wrong when you told me you loved me three weeks after we started talking. How do you love someone youve never met, let alone barely know? I knew it was wrong when you asked me to send 'photos', when everyday turned into phone sex. When youd slip in during that phone sex that you wanted to pretend to rape me. When about a month later, you came out to meet me for a weekend and afterwards decided I was who you wanted to marry. When you told me you always get what you want and that you wanted to take what was yours. When youd accuse me of lying or question the validity of the emotionally abusive relationship I was in and if it was ""as bad as I claimed"" why I didn't leave. When you suddenly started trying to control aspects of my life under the guise of knowing what was best for me and knowing me better than anyone else. And you know, I actually believed that. I would tell you that too. Thinking back on that now, I sound crazy. What the fuck I doing? So. Many. Red. Flags. All in such a short time frame. And suddenly, the love bombing didn't matter. Because I was just left feeling wounded and lost again. In the midst of this, I was trying to figure out my life. Trying to heal. I started to feel like I was going from one toxic relationship to the next. Even without all the glaring red flags, this was all happening for the wrong reasons. I never wanted that, and you knew. You wanted to be my knight, to ""save me"" from my life. But I never asked to be saved. I told you, it was wrong and unfair for you to get involved. I knew that the only person who could save me, was myself. There was so much unresolved trauma I needed to work through before pursuing something. I didnt need this bullshit. I needed therapy, I needed to work on ME.. and not this mess we both created. I should have never allowed what happened between us to happen. But I cant blame myself so much anymore. Because I realize now, how vulnerable and lost I was. I take responsibility for the poor decisions I made. I'm sorry for the ways I know I have hurt you. However, I also realize you completely took advantage of me and my vulnerability. Maybe you convinced yourself it really was love, that you were doing the right thing. But that doesnt mean it was right. That doesnt mean you should have pursued me or done the things you did. We are ultimately both at fault. But it taught me an important lesson. I wish I could have been stronger. I want to be stronger. I want to be someone I can be proud of. I still find myself wishing you were in my life, wishing I could call you up again. Missing your voice, the love bombing, the way you made me feel at the beginning. But I know I cant have in my life ever again. It is too messy, toxic, complicated, and unfair for both of us. Despite everything, I want the best for you because I will always care. I want you to better yourself too. We both have things to work on. I believe we can both become the people we want to be. Im still in therapy, Im starting to take better care of myself, I feel myself healing each day. Some days, I actually feel alive. Im starting to feel happy again. And I can't wait to someday be genuinely happy with myself. I hope you can find happiness too, A."

I always thought you would be happy for me the way Im happy for you and Its weighing on our friendship. I always thought you would be the one to take control of your feelings and actions but it seems like the only thing you want to control are the people in your life. I always thought that you were mature and capable of rational thinking but as time goes on its getting more and more clear that its a facade you put on to hide your true vulnerability and lack of confidence. My wish for you is to get to know yourself better, be open to changing and let go of the control you feel like you need to have over the people in your life, youre only going to drive them away. Sincerely, Your disappointed friend"

You make promises you don't keep. You see someone who is vulnerable and you choose to target that person not just in spite of the vulnerability, but because of it. Because if you find someone who isn't loved, it is easier to get them to fall for it. There is another person on the other side of that screen. Your actions have consequences and my blood is on your hands. I was looking for a way to make my life more tolerable and instead I have found out the true nature of people.

To be in your early twenties with little to no sexual experience and a list of 'we-almost-dated' type relationships I can count on one hand is never ideal. I still remember the first time I saw your photos. You were my version of an adonis. Hardly the conventional type, but my type exactly. The messy, long brown hair. The eclectic clothes. The way I could tell by the smirk in your photos that you'd probably fuck me once, twice if I was lucky, then never speak to me again without a second thought. I was intimidated- convinced you were far too good for me. Not even in terms of physical attraction, just in the person you were. The person you are. I still remember the first night we spoke from midnight until 9AM. My hyper fingers never swiping out of our text messages. My drunk friend passed out in bed next to me. My unfiltered text messages as a result of both Vodka and the way the words we type past midnight don't seem as heavy as they do when the sun comes up. I was terrified to meet you. Scared I wouldn't live up to everything you thought I might be. Fearful you wouldn't find me as attractive as you did through your cracked iPhone screen. You were my first for many things, but I'm pleased I never fully gave myself to you. Sneaking around with you made me feel alive. It made me feel like an adult. It made me feel dirty and slutty and wanted. We both knew this had an expiration date. The desperate, hopeless romantic in me wanted it to be more than it was, but if you have to constantly question whether or not somebody has feelings for you, they probably don't. I tried to convince myself that I could be the cool, laid-back girl. The one who could disconnect herself emotionally and be fine with casual, temporary, going-absolutely-nowhere type of undefined relationships. I acted like I was made of ice because I didn't want you to hurt me, because I didn't want to feel used. Both were inevitable. I think this is something I had to experience. Something that would help me grow as a person. Something that would help me define my standards. I probably should be bitter, but I'm not. Is it a lack of my own self-worth that is letting me take this lying down, or my acknowledgement that this had to end sooner than later? Although I'm sure you haven't thought into this nearly as much as I have, I hope you can look back at those winter nights in your king-size bed fondly. Maybe even miss me a little. Thank you for being a lesson in growth. In maturity. In vulnerability. In becoming clearer of the type of love I know I deserve. Onto the next one..."

I've been trying to figure out who you're meant to be in my life. And I'm wondering if we just need the distance between us, so I have the freedom to grow my career, and flourish within myself without you. And I wonder if you subconsciously know this. You tried to win me over, then I hurt you by not choosing you. I tried to make things right, but you still held onto hurt, then tried to push me away. When you tried to push me away again last time, I quietly told you I was leaving. I was leaving on my own, to move far away. You've asked since then, a couple of times, just where I am. Sometimes, I'm transported back to the heat of summer of 2013 and your loud, distinctive laugh breaking through the humid night air. Sometimes, I see a black ball cap and remember shadows over your dark eyes, watching me and smiling. It's mirrored, tiny elevators with us squashed in, you smiling down at me, black singlet top. It's you, walking up the main street of my little hometown, case of beer on your shoulder, and my friend driving us past. It's Johnny Walker red, coke, and drinking out of cheap white mugs. Green shirts and brown eyes becoming one of my favourite things. It's snapchats and butterflies in my stomach. It's telling you, on a tiny balcony, that I got into university. Then, it's me, falling out of touch with you. Growing, thriving, moving on, believing it was nothing more than a casual crush. Then its you, walking back into my life, reminding me it wasn't ever a simple crush. Begging me to choose you, to believe in us. You dropped your guard down a little, not long ago, asking again where I was. I heard the sheer vulnerability. My heart ached for you and for what could have been started two years ago. And when you threw the walls back up, you laughed off some of the things I told you about my daily life, now. But the old you also started to emerge. You once suggested that I should move to the coast and live with you, while working. I have my career far away from you now, even though you still ask me where I'm living. Maybe for now, you know we need this distance. Maybe I need to grow and establish into my career. Maybe you know this, you remember what life was like when you were my age, the very age you met me at. Maybe, in a couple of years, timing will be right. Or maybe, before then, we'll throw caution to the wind. It sounds crazy, but I know that you have hope that I'll come back to you. Maybe we need this distance so that I will."
290,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Vulnerability,1,dya3hf,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/dya3hf/vulnerability/,2019-11-19 08:46:05,"Yesterday, I listened to some of Brene Browns TED talks about vulnerability, empathy, guilt and shame. I highly recommend them. It helped me to realize that I wasnt wrong for sharing things with you. I wasnt wrong for being my authentic self and letting you see some of my vulnerability. Thats how people form connections, how they have successful relationships (any kind of relationship, not just romantic ones). It is how my instincts have told me to behave with people I trusted for years and I made a lot of solid connections with awesome people because of it. Ive always been willing to own my quirks, admit my fears, and share my unique approach to life. Sure, there are some things, like my anxiety disorder, that I am embarrassed of that I keep to myself. Everyone has some shame that they dont talk about. But, Ive mostly been open and honest about who I am, what I need, and why. And people have been open with me in return and it has never been a problem. So, I was open with you. I was vulnerable with you. It wasnt like we were strangers who had just met or like I dumped my life story on you at our second meeting. We had known each other for a year. Over the course of that year, we had gradually gotten to know each other better. I felt like I could trust you. And you trusted me enough to share some of your vulnerability as well. It was actually a really normal development of a friendship (until you got weird about it and then made me feel self conscious and that made me weird). I just want to make sure you understand that because I lost that understanding for a while. I lost it because you acted like I was crazy for being vulnerable with you, like I crossed some line into inappropriateness by sharing. You seem to believe that vulnerability is a bad thing (or perhaps that it is only reserved for romantic relationships?) and you made me feel ashamed for being open and honest and authentic with you as our friendship developed. For the longest time, I have blamed myself, felt guilt, and felt shame because I thought I did something wrong, that I hurt you, by being vulnerable with you. That shame drove me into depression and it made it impossible to get over your loss. But, now I see it wasnt wrong to be vulnerable. It was normal and acceptable. I have nothing to be ashamed of. I hope you can accept this because you were vulnerable with me, too. You shared some of your pain and fear and insecurity with me. You sought my feedback and support as a friend because you needed it. Given the way you feel about vulnerability, you must be shaming yourself for doing that. Shame is the source of so much pain and unhappiness. But, you didnt do anything wrong by being vulnerable with me. It was totally appropriate for you to want to connect with a new friend. It was appropriate to let me see your authentic self, including your worries, fears, and pain. And it was appropriate to seek feedback and support during a time when you clearly needed it. As your friend, I was happy to provide those things. You dont need to be embarrassed. You did nothing wrong. You just forged a connection that would have deepened a healthy friendship if things had not subsequently gone so screwy."

You've been drowning. Quite literally gasping for air and your chest is constricting. The life is actually draining from your eyes and you know it. But you're no longer trying to stop it. You entered this thing, it's been what? Four years now? With hopeful intentions, like all the others. And there have been *many* others. Giddy and filling up the spaces in your mind with falsities and the half-truths that you concocted to make the bleeding stop, if only for a time. We all know the truth; you know the truth. You did this all, stood in front of that judge, to say '**LOOK**' someone does really want me. To try and rid yourself of the reality that the gut wrenching dream that you were left with (the one with the three of you and the city), was picked up with someone new (in a new city far away from this place you both hated); you wanted to scream '**I CAN HAVE IT TOO. SEE.**' Even though this new, although known, 'he' wouldn't ever really make the sacrifices you needed him too. You knew it. You knew he'd never see inside the parts of your mind and soul that breathed for healing and a desperate need to be touched. Not in this societal trivial lust-filled way; your spirit needed touched. Gently, but with fierce intention to remove the band-aids you placed over the gaping wounds in the places between your ribs that were dug into by one failed attempt after the other. You wanted it all to stop so even though he wouldn't write you vows or ever be the type to write about you on social media like you'd always dreamed, like HE (the real he) did once; you went through with it. HE was happy with her. They were living YOUR dream together, they built the forts and strung up the lights and painted together. He sung her songs on long drives and he wrote paragraphs about his love for her. You tried to believe that it wasn't real and he was just pretending like you were now. That the smiles plastered all over your screen you kept staring at as you hid under the covers, were forced. Were fake. Were all a facade to try and hurt you. But years and years later, they're still happy and he is still writing paragraphs and paragraphs about her. He made the sacrifices you so desperately wanted, but for her and not you. They live in their warm home surrounded by all the love you thought YOU'D share and you know. You know it's real. They are real. You are living in your glass house. Waiting for the crack from the words flung back and forth, from the growing resentment you both feel, to shatter the fragile house and clear those spaces in your mind you've been filling with your half truths. You secretly want it sometimes. But then think, he loves me or he wouldn't stay. He loves this family or he wouldn't stay. He needs me or he wouldn't stay. He forgives me or he wouldn't stay. But come on; you know. You know the truth because you've been drowning. Your chest has been aching and you've been struggling to breathe for years since you screamed **'I CAN HAVE IT TOO. SEE.'** Spite. Bitterness. Anger. You didn't really make that decision in love like you'd always thought you would. He's not leaving you because he's scared. He doesn't want to have to pay you. To owe you. You're not leaving because you'd have to admit you're true intentions. Sure, you love him. You did once deeply anyway. He was there first, right? He keeps staying, right? First love, true love, right? No. I see you. We all see you. Reality is you won't try to change it. You'll stay. He'll stay. You'll buy more band aids. You'll get a cat. You'll turn your backs to one another at night and feel the heat radiating off of each others bodies and hate the way each other breathes. You'll make posts on his social media accounts about yourself to keep up the half-truths. Heart emoji. HE doesn't need to know he doesn't love you and you're living in a glass house. Holes in walls, stains on walls; these walls hold your truth. They know. But HE never will because you're good at pretending. You feign vulnerability and transparency, but you'll be real in the night alone with those walls in the dark. The small light from self medicated righteousness dimly lighting the blankness behind your eyes. The hollow soul that's left after years and years of this. It used to hurt you. Every day that ache growing and growing. But no more. It's dull. Or you're numb. Or it's become so normal it's a part of your blood stream, pumping through your body while you're completely unaware it's happening. You feel the heated space next to you and reach out and touch him. At least you're not physically alone, right? This is what you always wanted. You have it. You can have it too. I see you. Reality is, I see you.."

These lies try to fill the cracks but in reality all it does it heavy the load on the bridge. Underneath flows a strong river of the unknown.

She nodded and said its about him/them, not about you which is what she, and everyone else who I have talked to about this situation, has been telling me from the start. It isnt that I havent heard them. It is just that, because I have poor self esteem right now and because you arent alone in your opinions about vulnerability since most of the people in the state we live in would agree with you, I couldnt accept it. I was convinced that you were right, that I was crazy, that it was all my fault, that there was something seriously wrong with me. Nothing anyone said could reassure me. I took all of the blame onto my shoulders and I was drowning in shame. I dont know why Brene Browns talk broke through when no one else could. Maybe it is because she actually demonstrated that vulnerability is okay. She let herself be vulnerable in front of an audience of 500 people and showed that it is nothing to be ashamed of. That opened my eyes, I guess, and I finally heard it. I dont need to feel shame for being vulnerable and sharing my authentic self with you. It was your shame and your insecurities that drove you to shame me for my vulnerability not something fundamentally wrong with me. After I shared my epiphany, my therapist asked if I am ready to trust people again, to reach out and try to form connections and let myself be vulnerable. I told her that I honestly dont know. I agree with her that I need to do it. I am so lonely right now. Despite being an introvert, I need social connection to thrive and I cant get by only having one person and my therapist to talk to. I feel so isolated. But, the truth is, Im scared, A. Im really scared. I cant go through something like what happened with you again. Im not strong enough. And, I dont know how to be sure it wont happen again. I trusted you. I felt a connection. I thought you were safe. I didnt see any red flags to warn me of the eventual outcome. I didnt see the train coming until it had already hit me and gone 500 feet past me down the tracks. How do I know that it wont happen again? Especially in this state we live in where vulnerability is predominantly seen as a weakness. Im terrified. And I dont know how to get past that. So, I need to trust but I dont know if I can. I guess that is the next challenge to tackle. At the end of the conversation, I told my therapist that I am still going to be sad about losing your friendship and I am still going to hope that someday you will come around. She said that that is okay. I told her it was kind of an empty hope since you have probably forgotten me. And, she said she highly doubted that you have forgotten me. She said I am likely still an issue for you and probably will be for a long time and that, if I have been drowning in shame these last couple of years, you have probably had it much much worse. I truly hope that isnt the case and that you have also been working through whatever emotional trauma you suffered as a result of our falling out. It hurts my heart to think that you may be unhappy. And, I want you to know that, if you ever want to talk about it, you can be vulnerable with me again. I wont think any less of you for it and I wont stop caring about you because of it. Everyone has their challenges to face and Im not one to fault people for their struggles. So, you can always trust me. I promise."

How I'm not the person you think I am. You've been through too much and as much as I wanted to, I couldn't offer you the kind of support you deserve. But you showed me what it felt like to be seen, to be heard, to be noticed, to be accepted, to be cherished. Not as some piece of ass, not as vulnerability to be extorted, not as a caretaker, not as the comic relief. I still don't understand what exactly you saw, but you'll never know how grateful I am to you for SAYING what you were thinking. Truly, thank you.

But you were different. Maybe I'm just too young to really get ""it"". But you changed me. You showed me maturity in a man and intelligence. Care and consideration. I tend to be an excellent judge of character and you gave me nothing to fear. Every moment we spent together talking or holding one another I felt like I could fly. I felt like there was no way I could meet anyone as capable of being my lover as you. A part of me, a large part, is still forever altered. You broke my fucking heart. You showed me vulnerability and for that I learned to trust you. You cried in front of me the night before you left and I knew right then and there, you weren't just screwing with me. But the longer we were apart the more cold you became. In small moments I could feel your warmth but the fear and the heartbreak I know I felt, and I could sense in you ruined everything. I was planning to come see you. I could hardly stand to be so far apart and you showed excitement for it as well. Telling me to pace myself and make sure I thoroughly planned and thought it through before booking any tickets out of concern for me making rash decisions. That made sense. So I held off and focused on working to build up some extra cash and coin working toward a stable future. The longer we were separated, the harder it got. You kept making stupid, mean jokes and I brushed it off but eventually I couldn't take it. I couldn't understand why you had gone so cold. Maybe it was just how hard it was. Now we haven't spoken in over 3 weeks and I didn't think about you for most of them as it's been easier to block it all out and remain numb over crumbling every waking second under the weight of my heartbreak. I made the choice to cut you out. You still have the ability to message or call me if you please but I no longer will make the first move. It's just too difficult. There is no plan, there never was. We dove in headfirst knowing you would be leaving in a week. I fell hard, fast as I always do. But you were different. It felt worth it. Now, I would still give you all my attention if you let me. But you are cold. You are gone. The last words you spoke to me in person, the night, well, it was 4am, so the morning you were scheduled to get on your plane you said, ""Until we meet again"". Those words will ring loudly in my skull for as long as they do. We sat in my car so long. It was so long. If you ever were to read this, you would know it's me. I'm sorry."

They say it is better to give your heart, to trust, to go all in, even if things dont work out. I can understand that. Love and trust and vulnerability and connection are powerful things, things we need to live a fulfilling life. And they truly are worth pursuing and experiencing even if we arent able to hold on to them. I get that. But no one tells you about the other losses that come with losing someone. No one warns you that your relationship with other things in your life that are important to you can be forever altered by the loss of someone you care about. Your relationship with that person didnt happen in a vacuum. It happened in the midst of an already full life and, sometimes, the loss gets tied up with pieces of that life in a way that cant be undone, like separate pieces of metal melting down and melding together in a fire. In my case, my relationship with music seems to be permanently altered because of your loss. I have loved music my whole life, have been passionate about choral music in particular. It makes my heart sing, lifts my spirits, calms my anxieties, and brings me a transcendent peace that lets me escape from my overthinking brain for a period of time. This passion is what brought me to you in the first place. It is what caused me to want to connect with you. The passion is still there. I still love it deep in my heart. It is evident to others. My new director recently told me unprompted that he could tell that I love choral music. I said, noncommittally yes, I love to sing and he said, its not just singing, you are passionate about choral music, I can see it when you sing in rehearsal. So, its still there. Its still evident when I sing. But, there is also tremendous pain there now. I feel it when I carefully edit out my time with your group when people ask about my background in singing. Its there when I hear or sing pieces I associate with you. Its there every rehearsal when people make jokes or engage in banter that reminds me of my time bonding with your group. And, for some reason, it is particularly strong when I watch other choirs perform. I went to a family members concert tonight and I was excited to hear the choir perform a couple of my favorite pieces. But, when I got there, almost from the moment I found my seat, a heaviness settled on my heart. All I could feel was painpain in my chest, a lump in my throat, darkness in my mind. I heard the music but I couldnt listen to it. I couldnt connect with it. All I could think about was singing with you, memories of our performances and rehearsals, memories of how badly it ended, how you went no contact and shunned me. The pain these memories caused completely blotted out the music. I have been to a number of concerts since our falling out and looking back, this intense pain has come every single time. I have made strides in coming to terms with the loss of your friendship but, when it comes to choral music, the pain has taken up permanent residence with the passion. The two go hand-in-hand now, like an old married couple. I fear that the two will always be intertwined, that I will never be able to fully enjoy a rehearsal or a live performance."

That level of intimacy has only come and gone a few times in my life. I dont ever intend to send this letter. I dont ever intend for anyone else to read it, but I need to write down how I feel right now. I have never fallen for someone as hard as I fell for you. Every single day you were the first person Id think of when I woke up, the last person Id think about before I went to sleep, and the only person I would want to text when something good happened to me, even if it was just something small. Frankly, you were the only person I HAD with whom I could share those small moments of joy. You were absolutely a light in my life in a time when there wasnt much light. You gave me something to look forward to every single day after work. I got weird looks at work and on the train and in meetings when Id be looking at my phone smiling, and every single time that was because of you. You worked your way into my life in such an important way that you actually became my life outside of work, class, and meetings. I wish that I had been able to be that person for you, but unfortunately that wasnt the case. Three times throughout our time together I brought up the idea of exclusivity and becoming serious, each time around two weeks apart. Twice in person, once over text. And every single time, you downplayed it and pushed things off to be discussed some other time. I figured this was anxiety about your concerns with your parents or just not being ready to commit, and I did my best to give you some space and distance to think and breathe. I figured that if you werent interested in exclusivity or if you wanted to see other people, youd tell me. I once phrased this question as please let me know when youre ready to have a discussion about being serious and exclusivity, because I need you to know Im ready. That was WELL more than a month before you ended things. Between those two conversations, you were with other people. You knew how I felt, and you kept me in the dark intentionally. When we discussed it in the park and I apologized for crying because I didnt want you to see how badly you were hurting me and because it wasnt even a real relationship, you said did it really need the label? Yes. Because where I was at and what I had communicated to you was that I was very emotionally attached to you and that I hadnt been seeing anyone else. Without the label, you were just someone who I gave my all to, who slept over multiple times a week, who I shared every moment of joy with, who I trusted so deeply, for whom I was willing to sacrifice my own time and happiness to ensure yours. That wouldnt have changed with the label, but what would have changed is that your actions would have been cheating. You took advantage of my compassion, my care, and my trust and hurt me in a way I could have never even imagined. A mere four days before you broke things off, you told me that I make you so happy. When I read that message, I didnt stop smiling until I fell asleep. Four days later, you looked at me, stone faced, while I sobbed in front of you, knowing that giving you my all wasnt enough. You took advantage of me and hurt me in ways Ive never been hurt before. I cried myself to sleep that night. I cried in the shower when I woke up the next morning. I cried on the train in. I cried in the bathroom at work. I cried on the train home. I sobbed in front of my mother when she asked if I was doing okay and how school was going. Ive never cried this much in front of my mother in my life. I dont think you understand how badly you hurt me. I dont think you know, and I dont think you care, and thats the worst part. I genuinely and foolishly believed for the first time in my life that someone was possibly capable of caring about me beyond just the surface level in a romantic way. I think the worst part is that Im struggling to stay mad at you. It was never defined. We were never together. You just led me to believe that that was something that may be a possibility and took advantage of my naivete. Ive already wondered if you woke up with someone else by the time one of my good morning texts reached you, and I realized that worrying about hypotheticals will do nothing but make me hurt more. You really reached into some of the most vulnerable corners of my being, took what you wanted, and left the rest for dead. I was there for you the day you shattered your front two teeth and held you while you cried. I comforted you when you were alone. I did everything I possibly could to be the person you wanted me to be and the person I thought you needed. And, in turn, you shattered my trust and my heart into a million pieces. In some of my lowest moments, you were my only spot of light. And thats gone too. You told me thank you for being a part of my senior year. Youre welcome. Thank you for being a part of my life. But I want you to know when I look back on this otherwise very dark stage of it, itll be even darker. When I think of you, Im not going to remember how nervous I was to try and hold your hand on our first date. Im not going to remember picking out our favorite pieces at the art museum on our second. Im not going to remember going to \[a place of importance\] with you and awkwardly doing my best to act less drunk so that I wouldnt embarrass you or get you in trouble. Im not going to remember my heart fluttering at the thought of you wanting to be seen with me in public when you kissed my cheek at the party you threw in your apartment. Im not going to remember your playful teasing. Im not going to remember the joy I felt to finally be able to share a formal with someone who I genuinely cared about. Im going to remember that you took advantage of my vulnerability, my trust, and my genuine, heartfelt care because it was convenient for you. I didnt know I could feel as low, as worthless, as genuinely in pain as I do right now. You were the best part of my life for as long as you were in it, even if it was only 3 or 4 months. You were the only person I wanted to see or talk to. What Im going to remember is that when I helped you through your lows, you were just waiting to bring me mine. No matter how much Im hurting right now and no matter how much I miss the feeling of your arms around me, I know that I can never forgive you for taking advantage of me how you did. I hope you remember me if you ever think of doing this to anyone else. Youve crushed me into a tiny shell and I feel miserable. I feel hurt in ways others could only dream of hurting me. I feel hurt in ways that I would have never imagined you would be capable of hurting me. So yes, Im sorry. Im sorry I trusted you. Im sorry I cared for you. Im sorry I helped you at those lows. Im sorry that I did so much and that it wasnt enough. I hope youre happier now and I hope you find someone who can make you happy in ways that I clearly couldnt. If you ever cared about me, it means nothing now. People dont do this to people they care about. I hope my brief chapter in your life doesnt disrupt your larger story. I hope you remember this and never do this to anybody else, because Ive never felt this horrible in my life. I feel worthless, unloved, and broken. And thats how I know you could have never cared  because if you did, throwing me away like this, with such callousness, wouldnt even be possible. Seeing other people when you knew every single day that I was ready to give you my all wouldnt have been possible. But clearly it was. Regardless, I hope youre happier now. I have no ill will towards you, I really just have pain. Thats it. But if thats what it takes for you to be happy, then I guess its pain well borne. I hope you create a beautiful life for yourself wherever you end up and I hope you forget me as quickly as you changed how you felt about me, because I know I will never, ever forget how I feel right now. I wish you nothing but the best on your journey to find yourself. Sincerely, Me"

You go from being their everything to suddenly you are not good enough. They may not physically hurt you, but mentally they destroy you! They make you defendant on them and make you think you'll never survive without them. They beat you down so very far, that you forget who you are. You end up becoming who they want you to be. They tell you that you overreacted or you are too much. They tell you that you are dramatic or threaten you with something dear to you. They take your money, they take your security, they take your peace, they turn your dreams into nightmares. They leave you with nothing and wanting to die. They control every single thing you do. They appear so polite and amazing in public and you actually think things are getting better.... then you get home and boom the explosions start. You wore the wrong makeup or your outfit was top revealing. You talked to much or insert some random thing you may have done wrong. You escape this toxic relationship only to find yourself in another. Only this time you are sp desperate you refuse to leave. You put up with the emotional abuse you try and beg them to stay. You insist you love them and if you just loved them more, they would return your love. They break you even more! You went from a strong independent woman to someone so dependent on someone that treats you like shit. You think they care but they only care about themselves. They tell you they are empathetic, but they are full of bullshit. They tell you that you are too much, they tell you that you talk too much, that you complain to much, that you are just too much for them. Well I know my worth and I know I am not the problem... well my problem was falling for assholes that only cared about themselves. They only cared to kick me when I was down. They only cared to use me to play their games. They only cared to make them look like the victim and me the narcissist. Well those days are over! I am done letting anyone tell me I am less than. The problem wasn't me....it was them! I was too good to you and you took advantage of it. You took advantage of my weakness and vulnerability. That's ok though,it brought me to the most amazing man ever. The kind of man every woman dreams of. The one that doesn't talk down to me,the one that doesn't tell me I'm too much,the one that won't ever lay a hand on me! The kind of real man that opens doors (yes they do really exist) the real kind of man that loves me and my kids. The real kind of man that would lay his life on the line for me just as I would him! The real kind of man that values me for who I am,flaws and all! The man that saw me at my darkest moment of my life and didn't push me further. No head games no nothing.... just pure raw emotions that turned into the most amazing and beautiful relationship! It took me so long to realize I wasn't crazy or narcissistic at all... it took me so long to realize who I am and what I really want. I stopped being your little pawn... that last big fight. I was done with your games and knew you had issues. I saw the real you and then boom you were done. I am the happiest I have ever been.... so thank you to all the narcissistic assholes that got me to where I am today. I am stronger and braver than I was when you met me and I sure as hell won't ever be knocked down again. It feels so amazing to me me again. So have fun playing your game with someone else and I hope one day the favor gets returned! Love, Your ex little pawn"

Youre ridiculously selfish, unknowing of your sins and flaws, yet so insecure in your body. I wish I could understand, but its so difficult to comprehend how somebody could be so aware of the faults in their appearance but never once question their character. Do you not feel shame? Do you not feel guilt? Do you not gaze into the eyes of the people you have broken and feel your stomach twisting into knots? You took my vulnerability, my secrets, the crumpled paper balls of my thoughts, and threw it onto the arms of its subject. Its so, so terribly unfair. He was my first almost love, a reminder of what couldve been. We couldve been a mystery... you broke it. Twice. How? Why? But thats not the only sin youve committed. Remember the man who loved you with every fiber of his being? The one and only person who despite the screaming and slamming doors and silent treatment, still dug deep enough to see the very best in you. The one who fell apart the moment you packed your bags and left him to rot and decay. The one who let you use him because he still had hope that you loved him. Are you happy? Are you really, truly happy with yourself? You say you loved him, but after leaving him behind, you just proceeded to spread lies on top of lies about how he used you. What for? I wish I could understand. I loved you. A part of me, still holds a couple more fucks, but the remaining 75% screams for you to go fuck yourself. You ruined our friendship. You ruined your first love. What else do you plan to ruin? Is this what you wanted? Youre human. So devastatingly human. I forgive you for succumbing to your suffering and self preservation, and I thank you for the good memories. It was great while it lasted.. in truth, I greatly appreciated you. Youre not a bad person, deep down. Youve got your qualities. Being funny is a talent, and so is your tendency to procrastinate and still get the job done. I grew fond of you, a million times over the betrayals, like callouses frosting over guitar fingers. No one I know could ever have such an odd, peculiar fascination with smutty fanfiction of a MCU villain, and in its essence, it amused me. I entertained it, often. Its funny. Youre funny. An interesting human being, if Ive ever seen one. But thats what makes this so terribly heartbreaking. I love you, but lets be human together, from a distance."

My first love almost destroyed me. I gave him my heart and soul and for every vulnerability I gave him, he turned around and used it as a weapon against me. But stupid me kept doing it. I believe in forgiveness but sadly it has taken me this long to realize that there are only so many chances that you should give to certain people. I dont have friends anymore because he used those against me too. He had a sick fucking game where he would also get close to the people I was closest with, my confidants, and he would exploit that relationship. At this count he has impregnated my best friend and fucked a sister that I was close to. Right now he is insinuating himself into my relationships with my other siblings so that he can STILL keep tabs on me and they think hes just the best guy *hard eye roll. So yeah, I have a hard time trusting people. But because of these things I have a hard time trusting even those who truly have my best interests at heart. Maybe you were one of those people who have my best interest in mind. Maybe you werent, I dont know. I dont know how to find out because Im mad at you too. I am going to hold this anger close to me like a blanket so it keeps me away from you. If Im wrong to do so, youll have to find a way to let me know."

The one who could easily be brought to laughter and had a shine in their eyes. Not the one who brings me to tears and makes me look away in humiliation. The one who was intrigued enough to dig for my opinions, eager to explore my mind. Not the one who cuts me off and doesn't give me a chance to explain myself. The one who made my heart race with excitement and a childish joy. Not the one who takes my breath away with fear for what's to come.

It was a strange moment of vulnerability for me, seeing as I was crying in your arms in the middle of an empty classroom and in many ways, its the most intimate I have ever been with another person. Being held by you, that day, brought a warmth Ive never been able to replicate. You were there for me when I needed you most and provided me with something I never had before, but that wasnt enough for you. You HAD to confront the person who made me feel that way. I didnt know at the time why that made me so uncomfortable, but suddenly I was filled with shame. I understand now. I understand so many things about that day that I was unable to all those years ago. I told you about my problems in confidence, but you put yourself at the center of it. I understand that what overwhelmed me, all those years ago, was a feeling of betrayal. I was hurt. But all these years apart have granted me a great amount of clarity. Looking back, I realize this has always been your greatest flaw. You cant stand by. All the pain and abandonment youve felt has made it incapable for you to sit idly by when you have the power to take a stand. I realize that all thoughts of logic and consideration are cast aside by the reflexive compulsion that overwhelms you to do the right thing. I wasnt even that special to you. I was just the boy that sat next to you in home period. But that didnt stop you from making me feel as if I mattered. I wish I realized all this sooner. Taking the time to reflect and understand the insecurities behind the hurt, I cant help but realize it was the very reason I fell in love with you. But what right do I have to love you? When the tables were turned during our senior year class trip and you were crying all alone and had no one to talk too, I acted like I didnt notice you because I didnt want people to think I liked you. Imagine that. I wasted the only opportunity Ill ever have of returning your kindness because I didnt want my feelings to be known. If theres any consolation is that you never needed others to persevere. Despite not speaking to you in years, youve amassed quite a reputation back home. Often, I find people speaking ill of you since youre still butting in peoples problems without a care of what theyll think of you for it. I hope one day to be a pillar you can rely on. I have a lot to make up for and despite knowing Ill never be worthy of your love, I hope at the very least I gain the strength to finally let my feelings be known. One day I hope to send this letter to you. I love you and Im sorry fear of rejection kept me from telling you. A person deserves to know if theyre loved and its selfish to keep that hidden from people just because they dont fell the same way. I hope I can live up to the expectations youve allowed me to set up for myself. I owe you that much. With Love, An Ant"

How could you possibly know that Im not cis and my thoughts about society and politics when you ***didnt ask me and we never talked about it***? We didnt have exchange of ideas, there was no reciprocity. I always asked what you thought, and you always shut down when it came time to give your opinion. Its nuts because you were dismissive to me, you would literally tell me you dont care about something I bring up, you would shut a conversation down and never bring it up again. You said so much stuff to me to discourage me from sharing with you. But we had a shared language?! Lmao. Did you even realize that I was the only one sharing? Sometimes I think, She definitely did and was too cowardly to say something, and other times I think, She is not self aware. How can someone who doesnt share believe that they have been sharing? When I said you act like you know me this is what I was talking about. You acted like I was supposed to understand you without you sharing who you are. You acted like you knew what I needed and wanted without asking me. How could you know that? Did you realize how disempowering that is? I told you Im not cis, thats a big deal. I already knew that is not something that makes sense from someone I DONT KNOW, you didnt know me! You didnt ask! You didnt listen! How could you know me enough to be so confident about something like that? You know that a connection cant happen without vulnerability, right?"

I didnt have much to say except to see if youre awake thousands of miles away from me. I couldnt sleep tonight, cause all I had been thinking about is if our marriage pact in 10 years will still stand. The chances are low that wed somehow find our way back to each other in the way I had always wanted since we met 9 years ago, but there are still chances. You were so certain that I was the only one feeling this wholesome love between us and that yours for me was different, and yet there you were: suggesting one of my wildest dreams to be possibly fulfilled in 10 years. How would I ever say no to you, when no one has ever compared to the amount of care, adoration, trust and love I have had and still have for you? You understand the things that I cant admit freely to, and in return I hold your trust when you struggle with vulnerability - in the darkest of nights and the brightest of days. You laugh with me at the most redundant of jokes, and ponder the meaning of the the most uninteresting things in life - I wonder if we should just start a guidebook of nothing and everything for ourselves. You taught me that I was always good enough for everyone, including you, even when the worst times have beaten me down - a struggle that you relate to as well, except you never really had anyone else to fall back to, but me. What you dont realize that I too, fall back to you because even with everyone else around me; there is no comfort like you. The problem with our marriage pact is that while we could possibly result in falling in love with each other when its in effect; Im already breaking the pact. You already know that I love you like all the analogies and quantities known to the world. But the problem is, I still love you in this other way that you dont seem to reciprocate: Im IN love WITH you. Right now. Have been. Still am. Probably still will be for a while."

She pegged you even before you started blaming everything on your father, your girlfriend, your sister, your daughter... everyone but yourself. You re-introduced so many things into her life that she had worked so hard to get away from. Drugs, racism, pornography, alcohol, stalking, sneaking, lying, narcissistic networking. You were a terrible influence and I thank god everyday that she is finally away from you. Even though her life will never recover. She may never recover and all because she pegged you for the type of man you are, but she continued to ignore the flaming red flags and the Flare. She should have trusted her instincts, and walked away the first time you told her she would never find a man as good as you. She should have ran as fast as her legs could carry her the first moment you told her that you were the best man she had ever had the opportunity to sleep with, that being with you was a heaven compared to what she had known before, that you just wanted to have a chance to show her (finally!!!) what a decent life could look like, or that all the men she had known before you were BETA in comparison. She should have packed her bags and drove far far away the first time you tried to make her believe that her being graced with your presence was the framework for any possible happy she might dare to imagine, and that without you there would be no love, no money, no people, no kayaking, no camping, and no life worth living. You actually tried to make her believe that anything bad that could possibly happen in that relationship was a result of her worthlessness ricocheting throughout your life. When you told her that her ex-girlfriend P had swallowed a barely incomplete bottle of pills in front of your daughter, like a mad cat, chasing it down with a bottle of vodka because you wouldn't give her a baby, but that you would gladly give her one, she should have known right then (and honestly she did) that you were completely APE shit and full of shit and lying out of your pi hole. She should have seen every covert insult, every subversive disregard of her abilities, every bullet fired, and every fist into wall ram for what they really were. Slow building attempts to crunch her down and to bully her into a hysterical and weak thing, to bully her into a state of dependent and unrecognizable vulnerability, to penetrate her core, and to attempt to erase every last shred of her confidence. NO! It was not your ability to do these things that amazes me as much as it was your willingness. Your willingness to so so slowly strip away her defenses while purposely leading her down lost pathways, strategically pushing her into isolation and confusion, before exposing her every flaw, her every misspoken word, her every mistake, and hoarding and twisting something which was truly a passive mistake, into such a devastating lie. Actually, your ability to somehow justify this misfiling and renaming of the truth and to silently hold on to it is... hard to swallow. Your willingness to exploit her, like a secret forensic agent dead set on exacting revenge, logging every wrong, in the event that your relationship should succumb to the inevitable, crashing like a self-fulfilled prophecy, is in truth... UnfuckingforgiveAble. Knowing she had so innocently and trustingly came to you, placed her future and the future of her child in your hands, and so foolishly confessing all of her secrets, her fears, her defenses, and her private affairs at your feet, for the sake of goodness, you were still able to sustain a false and hybrid presentation of love. Encouraged her even, as you plotted, crackled, and schemed behind her back. The knowledge, that anything inside of you is capable of allowing yourself to slither down to such a disgusting low is really nothing more than overwhelming proof of your pre-existing insecurities. SpaCkled cracks in your wall, and most likely your sexuality. Insecurities which she tried for so long and so hard to take away from you, all while you were trying to implant and install them into her. All of that suffocating Aarogance, nothing more than a shallow facade, a flimsy skin, covering lbs and lbs misdirected overconfidence. She really should have known. &amp;#x200B; But, I guess you showed her. Didn't you? She forgives you. I hope you can forgive yourself. I, on the other hand, can never forgive you. Because I, removed from the emotions and the nothingness of it all, see it and you with complete clarity. What a petty and pittiful shame. What a fucking shame."

But you hurt me, a lot. Every night I struggle to relax to go to sleep, because I just want to share my day with someone... And no one is here. I feel even more trapped and like everything positive I had was fake and gone. I loved having someone be excited for stuff with me, to encourage me. I loved being able to do that for someone else too. This past week, I made a beautiful cake and pulled out two huge ass watermelons out of my garden. My first thought was to tell you, to share it all with you as I have always done... Because you felt like part of my family. I loved you and a person and and my friend. Fully. You said you didn't have a sense of family, but I could tell when you hugged me sometimes that you felt the same with me... I could feel your shoulders relax and your breaths slow. That's how people who truly care about you make you feel. Centered. Grounded. But it feels fake now. This weekend, I took the kids camping with my parents...and I felt so alone, even surrounded by family. They don't get me. They don't *want* to get me...I have fallen into this role as a caretaker for everyone around me... You included, and I hate myself every day for it. It used to be something I enjoyed, helping people. To some extent, I still do, and I still find myself falling into that roll when I am around other people. It's always nice to see someone smile and feel good when you've done something for them. That's my reward. Happiness. Even if it's brief. 2+ years of lying and gaslighting and being fully taken advantage of. It was too much. I broke. You were on your trip and I just had this urge to purge everything from my life that included you. I deleted over 7000 photos and videos of our 5 year friendship, removed you from stuff and purged all of your belongings I had acquired. It hurt me to my core. I cried for so long... Because I felt alone, but I also felt like I lost time with my children... It made me feel like a bad mom... Worse than ever before. If I can't have respectful relationships outside of my home, how am I going to teach them to do the same? I needed to purge it all though. It helped me to push through and move on. I hope that you get the mental help you need. I hope that you find your happiness and someone to be your cheerleader. I'm truly sorry you didn't ever feel like I was good enough for you. Sometimes we need to focus on the real people around us. Life is happening here. All I thought we wanted was to be there for each other, support one another and be decent people. I wanted to do that for you... I tried to help you, but I broke. At the end of the day, the only person who is going to take care of me, is me. I had to find my happiness without all the doubt... And I couldn't be just a secret friend for you. I was here. I was real. You pushed me too far, and took advantage of my kindness and my vulnerability... But for what? Was it worth it? I found your truth, now you need to do the same."

Please know that I see each and every one of you in the most unique and beautiful lights. And also your words. I don't think that it was completely understood that some of the things done to provide ""support"" were more harmful than good. But I appreciate it all, nonetheless. I hope you all have a bit better grasp of who I am as a person, now, since I have chosen to be vulnerable about recent events. It may take a village to raise but it only takes a single brick to make it fall. One solitary well placed brick. Thank you for being a support in the ways you all thought was best. I hope that my vulnerability has been eye opening as to what kind of character I have my willingness to step out and onward. I love you all. Thank you for being my friends and foes. And in the future, never tell me the odds. QQ"

Its been a little over a year since you broke my heart. Yet I still about you everyday. I dont know why. I dont want to be in a relationship with someone like you. I know I deserve better. You know what kills me above all else is you just walked away from what we had. I dont even know what we had because clearly it wasnt love. You told me I was too much and you left. That was it. There was no conversation. Nothing. Then to find out that everything you said was a lie. When did you make things official with her? A day after? A week? A month? How long after until she moved in with you? When did you pop the question? When did you all buy a place? When did you all agree on a summer wedding? All in less than a year. Wow. I cant help but wonder if she was pregnant? Did she lose the baby? Or have an abortion? I have so many questions, none of which will be answered because we will never speak again? Why? Because youre a fucking coward. Thats what you said at least or were you trying to soften the blows. Something in me died that day; the day you betrayed me and tossed me in the trash. My trust, my love, my self esteem, my confidence, my vulnerability. All gone in an instant because you couldnt be the man that you claimed to be. I didnt ask for much. And sure sometimes I was too emotional. But you acted like you loved me beyond my issues. It was just that, an act. You are a great fucking liar by the way. The gaslighting and manipulation still amaze me to this day. Im not in love with you anymore. Did you ever love me? Or were you so emblazoned by cheating on me that you fell in love or really lust with your friend? I frequently wonder how long will that work out. I give it one-two more years. But then again, maybe it will last a lifetime and you just had to steamroll me to achieve that. I had a dream about you last night. Somehow I ended up at your wedding (a tacky affair in a gym). Your wife was coming down the aisle, pregnant as I always suspected, and you were sitting down waiting for her. You looked at me once and the rest of the time you looked down in shame. Then I walked with your mom to the bathroom to get her insight on what happened. She didnt know either. For the last year, Ive tried to see things from your perspective. Ive tried to be an empath to determine how you feel about what you did. I truly dont know how you feel. Some times I think you are ashamed. That you regret what you did. Then I think of your lack of EI and realize that you probably dgaf about me or my feelings or about the affect this had on me. Because believe it or not, I am traumatized. You think you made the best decision for yourself in that moment. You didnt care about cheating because it just happened. You told me once that people just know when they want to get married. There doesnt have to be a time frame. Clearly you knew something with this girl that you didnt know with me because you two got married at lightening speed. Either way Im picking the pieces alone and having to keep moving forward, day by day, until I move on. Maybe not today or tomorrow or this year, you will regret what you did. Hopefully when that happens you will be a big enough man to apologize (I doubt it), and hopefully Im a strong enough woman to not even need to hear it. Signed, cc"

Even after the devastation of war, new cities are built, and it creates a stronger type of generation. I can say finally that I've been through the tsunami that was you. You came into my life unexpectedly and elicited the extremes of emotion, we were always on a roller coaster. I had my friends to support me, to pull me out of the emotional quicksand that was you. I believed in you for so long, I think I wanted to rescue you, rescue that little boy who was violently abused as a child. I wanted to go back in time and stand up for you when no one else did, hold you and kiss you and teach you what it was like to be loved and not have the door always slammed in your face, and now look at us now. I've left you just as you had predicted when we first met. I'm leaving you in the same every woman has left you, after examining the beast that is your heart, that which cannot be mended, and which even the fiercest of soldiers cannot fight all the traumas of your past. On the lighter side, I was telling my friends that you might one day have a promising career in p..olitics. Cheating, lying, stealing and still winning the respect of the men around you, that is what you're best at doing. You grew up in the slums and you learned how to survive to stay alive, but you never learned how to love. **Imagine Dragons - Bad Liar** There were beautiful things about you. I loved your eyes the most. All that pent up rage and hurt and vulnerability were always present in your eyes. When you looked into my eyes, I could always tell what you were keeping from me. The way the light hit the browns, like a doe caught under the headlights. You never knew how to navigate around the puzzle that was my mind's eye. I saw more of you than you had realized, but because you were able to survey my mind, it put you at a great disadvantage. You became insecure, you began to compare yourself to every other man. You never thought you deserved me, you thought you were dumb. In your eyes, I would always leave you for a more intelligent man, who understands the subtleties of my wit and humor, a man who knows how to navigate social circles and who can write poetry in 4 different languages. I wished that man had been you, my Pygmalian project. But alas, you were comfortable being simple. You didn't want to change the world, you were still that little boy trying to survive a violent childhood. Your goal in life was to make mid 5 figures in salary in order to sustain your drug addictions and have enough to buy whiskey and vodka from the nearest convenient store. I wanted you to become a leader, experience all the beauty of life, you wanted to disappear into the background of sleazy motels and one night stands. **Winona Oak - He don't love me** We've already had our last goodbyes, but memory has a way of only remembering the nostalgic parts and all the bad experiences are dulled after time. But I will never forget the carelessness and callousness that you have treated me. I'll never forget how you tried to tear my self-esteem down, to always make me feel inadequate, to always criticize me. These are behaviors that I would never have mirrored, but as more time went on, I found that I disliked myself around you. I tried to fill your life with laughter, love and kindness. You could never return the same. But, I hope you will have learned from me the values that I hold dear to my heart: *integrity, honor and dignity.* I hope one day you will learn to love someone with just that: integrity, honor and dignity. I hope you will hold yourself up to the same standards as you hold yourself. I hope you let go of all the hatred of women you have accumulated over the years. I hope one day, you will look in the mirror and actually like yourself instead of hating the way you look. I hope you don't repeat all the verbal abuse others have told you as you were growing up. I hope one day, you'll be able to open your heart completely to someone who will see all the beauty and potential in you and who will inspire you to change and overcome your toxic childhood, to be free from the pain of your past instead of using women as chess pieces for your end game. The greatest power I have over you is to forgive you. *I forgive you.* May you have a beautiful life and become self-aware enough to change for the better."

You want someone to want you. To gift you things. To think about you and care for you. I know it. But I couldnt see past the things Im going through. I was too prideful to let go and reciprocate. You gave me thoughtful things and your time. I didnt wanna cry over you but I am. You were keeping me warm on this lonely campus. We were friends and never established anything else, but we were really more and we both knew it. I always wanted to pull back. I have real problems with getting too close to people. I legitimately think I will not treat you right and if I were to I would have a very hard time forgiving myself. But you saw my lack of vulnerability as a lack of interest for you. I am interested, but Im just too stuck in the fears in my head. I could get lost for hours in my pool of fears and I have lost many emotions. I bought chocolate for you the other day just like you always do for me and I wanted to give it to, but you didnt wanna meet up that day and I understand why. Im too forced and not open. I know Im not attractive because I cannot open my heart though I have in the past and it seems Pandoras box of emotions now and I dont wanna deal with it. I know thats not fair to you and I dont want you to deal with that even though were friends. When you leave me on read its a dagger in my cold heart that I thought was too numb to feel."

I'm either too much or not enough with it. I want more than anything to be able to tell you anything, and everything, and with you most of all that would be incredibly easy. Almost seamless. But I'm also terrified, afraid I'll read you wrong and offer up too much too soon. I told you I felt things more intensely than most people, that wasn't a gimmick. I wasn't lying. It sincerely feels like I'm on the verge of exploding with lust, adoration, and possibly even love for you. Which sounds insane when it has been such a short time. But the feelings persist. You're always on my mind. I've been in a fair amount of relationships before this. Some wonderful, but quite a few that were traumatizing. I've experienced real love too, the kind that makes you believe soul-mates exist. I don't grieve the loss of that relationship, I celebrate it ever happened at all. Without that experience I would most likely be dead. Before it, I thought to love someone it had to involve being treated with deception and envy, and a horrific dance of emotional withholding and abuse. But that one relationship changed everything. Instead of a noose I chose to seek truth, love, and beauty. You are an exceptional person, and the energy you give off is intoxicating. I know you probably think I only want you sexually, but I want you in every way I could possibly have you. I just want to be close enough to experience life with you, the good, the bad, the exciting, and the lame. I've only felt like this one other time in my life. I have maximum anxiety about everything, but with this I've never felt so certain. I know it sounds absolutely crazy relying on some gut instinct, but I'm done denying these feelings exist. I'm falling in love with you, truly."

You never wrote back to me. I was frustrated and all over the place because of what was going on, not because I didn't want you. I didn't mean you, when I said I didn't care about anything anymore. Hell, I didn't even mean that. I wanted to argue and be done with it, and move on. Maybe I was hoping that it was a test for us - one that we'd pass anyway. We passed it when you told me that you lied about yourself, and I forgave that. I understood why, and appreciated you coming clean to me so sincerely. But when I wanted to know just a bit more, and share the same about myself... It was evident I was just an online girl for you. A game. A simulation. Not a real person and experience; something to kill time perhaps, or something to stirr up butterflies in your stomach. You immediately got defensive. I got angry. It couldn't had ended differently. I'm sorry if I gave you weird impressions. My mind was in a very weird place, and I was speaking faster than I was thinking. I had no hidden agenda. I was just genuinely in a bad place. Stuck in a place where I felt awful and lonely, with people I had bad history with, past I couldn't escape, stress of final exams I didn't feel prepared for, I was starving myself quietly, and I couldn't deal with it all. Maybe like your friend, I was ranting about something seemingly stupid and irrelevant, because I couldn't articulate what was really going on. Maybe it was easier to reduce some things to ""teen drama."" I didn't want you to think I'm weak and infantile. Back on track though... Can you really blame me for wanting to know that? For wanting to be a bit more secure in my knowledge and image of you? I was the one that was vulnerable. I shared with you something that made me very vulnerable, but you couldn't do the same for me. My first fear was that I'd find this vulnerability online sooner or later. And I did check, many times. I haven't yet, but I suppose I'll never know anymore if all this trust I put in you was misplaced. I hate you a bit, but I also love you a bit. ""Read that as you wish,"" as you told me once, but have no doubt that it was so close to ""ti amo."" Maybe you'll never read those messages I left for you, and maybe that's for the better. Who would want to see a pitiful, enamored teenager clutch at something that wasn't even a real relationship. We did just talk online, after all. You didn't want to play with my feelings, but you did. You told me to live a little, relax, not think so much, but you were thinking too, definitely. You knew we didn't *really* have a chance, and it was only during that argument that I made you finally say that. Never a chance to meet face to face. Of course, you were busy with your studies and work, and living the full student experience, and I was on the verge of starting that life myself - a sea away. I really wish you thought a bit less too, and let me enjoy those few moments we had together just a little longer. Just for a little longer having you say good morning and good night to me. Enjoy looking at just one more picture of you, with those amazing eyes and relaxed smile. Just one more evening when you vent to me about how stressed and tired you are with studying, patients, and and everything else. Just one more evening we'd both spend too long talking to each other, teasing each other, exploring each other's lives, experiences, and feelings. You'll never read this, and that's alright. But I hope that in the depths of your soul, you know that during that thing that we had between us, I was the happiest girl in the world. That I spent so many nights daydreaming about a future we'd never have, and so many of my journal pages writing about you. I waited impatiently for messages from you, and smiled nonstop when talking with you. Maybe you're not as charming in real life, maybe it would be significantly more awkward, but I didn't fall for you because of some deeply rooted daddy issues, or because you were my first very intimate love, or because you were so skilled with words - I fell for the person you were. Sentiments aside, I could get a similar excited feeling in my stomach from reading a good romance novel, I have seen guys - my age - so much better looking than you, I've talked to boys who should had been so much more relatable, and I've been on dates ever since with guys who made me feel like a spoiled little princess... But not a single of them was you. And I ended up comparing them all to you in my mind. I remember our Skype calls. They were short and awkward, and maybe you didn't really like me enough to want to talk to me face to face - whatever - I enjoyed them thoroughly. I loved them. And they felt like a much more genuine and true experience of you. You didn't know what to say, you looked at everything but me, and at times we couldn't understand each other's accents. And yet... I'm not sure where I'm going with this, or why I'm writing it, but I'll end here. I'm sorry it's all over the place. If I could tell you one thing, I'd tell you that you'd be pleased to know that I did get into university, and that I'm a good little Christian girl of my words; whatever happens, **I will never forget you.** Although, you probably don't remember me anymore :) I hope that are still in good health, I pray for it, and I hope you passed your July exam well. And since January is coming up, here's an early happy birthday, you old, old man :) and if there's one thing I'll take out of this pseudo-relationship we had, it's definitely what is pneumothorax and how it's dealt with! Hahaha"

So much.",3,dlro0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/dlro0z/right_now_baby_so_much/,2019-10-23 11:58:36,"Hi, baby - We just got off the phone and, as I'm writing this, it's nearly 6PM. I don't know what to say other than I am so, so sorry for upsetting you. I got too loose with my words in some of my texts and I know that I made you feel guilty. I promise that I didn't mean to upset you; the last thing in the world I want to do is make you feel anything but good, happy, and safe. It tears my heart out to think that (at the very least some of) what you're feeling right now is because of me. I could apologize for two more pages (this was originally written on paper) but, instead, I'm going to tell you all of the ways you make me so, incredibly, genuinely happy. (Okay - I can't write *all* of the ways right now, but I will write enough to show you that you fill me with nothing but joy.) But, before I start, I want to say that I know it's really easy to focus on the negative, the difficult things, and what we can't have right now, but I promise you that I am constantly consumed by, and filled with, the good: the happy memories, our inside jokes, the ways we care for one another, the ways we find to show our feelings and intentions for each other, the peace, calm, safety, and truth of us, and our bright, beautiful future together. Okay, so... here goes: * **You have the most kind, fair, and beautiful heart that I have ever known**. Even in a situation like the one that surrounds us - hard, unrelenting, heavy, and sometimes uncomfortable - you are constantly thinking of others, and me, first. You do so even when the person in question has no idea that's the case. I could give you so many examples of this, but I'll wait until I can tell you in person. * **You are so strong**. You may argue me on this point, but I believe that you are easily the stronger of us two. I can't wrap my mind around how you go back, every day, and shoulder the burden of everything that is happening here yet still manage, at every opportunity, to comfort me. * **You have the most incredible, winsome, captivating mind**. I know I tell you this all the time but I am in constant awe of your intellect. Every time you speak I feel a surge of pride and admiration so intense that I can barely contain it. You know that I have always looked to you for advice, for input, and and for direction, but I want you to know that those inclinations and feelings grow stronger every single day. * **You are so, incredibly, unimaginably sexy**. The statement would hold true if based on the physical alone, but you are so much more. I feel powerless - in the most delicious, perfect of ways - against the hold you have on me. The way you gesture, move, speak, laugh, touch, look, and listen - you are my undoing. I wish I could make you know what you do to me by simply being. * **You have the most amazing sense of humor**. Everything, from your perfectly terrible dad jokes, to your dry, well-timed, sarcastic comments, to the nearly unbelievable stories of your past, make me laugh so much that I struggle to breathe sometimes. I can't tell you how much of a release it is, in the middle of what life is right now, to be with you and truly, genuinely laugh until I cry. * **Your drive is inspiring to me**. When I think about the way you've built your career, your knowledge, and authority from the ground up, it makes me believe in myself. You aren't satisfied with mediocrity and you aren't fulfilled by doing enough to get by; you want to understand, to know, and to thrive in your career, and just knowing you makes me strive for the same. * **Your vulnerability with me is so brave**, sweetheart. Sometimes, when I sit and think about it, I am completely overcome by my emotions: I can't fathom what I have done to deserve that with, and from, you. You never cease to leave me speechless by what you share with me, how open and unguarded you are when we are together. I may not understand how I got so lucky, but I promise you that I will never take it for granted or use it against you. * **Your evenness, your perpetual calm, is one of my greatest comforts in this life**. You always tell me that, one day, this will be a source of frustration for me, but after the things that I've seen, the people I've encountered, the experiences I've had, and the subjugation I've known... you couldn't possibly understand how much I value and respect this trait of yours. You are akin to a savior to me, an unmovable, perfectly safe haven in which to rest. I've never known this kind of security before, especially in a relationship (of, quite literally, any kind) with a man. The simple fact that I can open up to you without fear of rejection, retaliation, judgement, anger, or overreaction means more to me than you could possibly know. There are tears in my eyes as I write this, because I have never felt so cared for, so wholly and gently held, in my life. That may sound like a lot, but I promise you that it doesn't begin to scratch the surface of my feelings for you. If only you knew that every sunset I watch, every star in the sky, every cool Fall morning, and every warm, rainy night makes me want nothing more than to be next to you. I want to experience, share, shoulder, endure, accomplish, celebrate, understand, discover, and live every single thing in my life by your side, with you. You are my person, my missing piece, the counterpart of my soul, and the thing that brings me the most joy. I couldn't dream up someone more perfect for me. I know that things are hard right now - trust me, I'm feeling it too - but there will be a time, soon, that we will spend all of our nights together, let each other in completely, and spend all of our moments at peace, resting, residing in each other's arms. You make me more myself, happier, and more complete than anything ever has. Thank you so much for finding me and for choosing me, baby. And, thank you so much for believing in us before I even realized what was possible with you. Right now, and tonight, and tomorrow, and the next day. Right now, forever."

And the statement itself is pithy and weak. Especially since it's ***your cynicism*** that is the dead weight you needed to leave behind. That's your *burden*. Not me! Not your company. You are so self-important and arrogant, but you know that's so hot. You are so stubborn too... and that's fucking adorable. I'm more headstrong than you... had to be to survive. You lack the self-awareness to realize that you wouldn't be wallowing in your cynicism if only you didn't take your oppressive disappointments out on **everyone** in your life from time to time: your co-owners, your colleagues, your friends, your mom. Your former friend's betrayal, the audit, our breakup. Disappointments that changed you, and you lashed out at me in resentment because I dared to want to share this burden. You shoved me away and froze me out. Turned your heart to stone, let your mind warp me into another burden. Always absolving your proud, arrogant self for how much he carries ""alone."" You set yourself up for that over and again. The sun doesn't shine out of your ass, but you've always hidden that fact from yourself better than the rest of us ever could. To me, with me you've been an insecure quitter. I'm angry you did, heartbroken you have. We understand each other better than anyone else. And you're choosing to punish both of us for that, indefinitely. Vulnerability isn't a weakness. It's a strength of the deepest kind. And I am so angry, so hurt, and have so many practical things to do that I cannot be wallowing in that. I'd thought I'd left my past behind when we met, but clearly I hadn't. Now I have. Debt free, aside from the student loans. 10 kilos down since our breakup. Saving money, walking, walking so far, every day. Cut off the dead weight of my family. The only ""imbalance"" left will soon be the imbalance in the amount of faith I have... which is a lot more than you. I have faith in myself, in you, in us, in people generally. But you are no disappointed idealist. You're just a quitter. You gave up on us  on me  over a year before you dumped me, during your tantrum in the car. But every action and interactionwe had in that year had already wrought the end result, as you domineered your disappointment into a self-fulfilling prophecy, as I allowed this energy to socially condition me into the angry, weak, terrified, anxious, and clumsy shell of your former Lioness. So yes, you do owe me an apology. And you should feel bad. That's the only way to self-improvement. All I wanted was not to be your rebound. So you'll do it again, because you won't change or grow. You are rigid in your ways, and your ex-wife stole your ability to trust women. And it's *beyond* intellectually lazy to have so much ride in the shoulders of one woman when *everything* disappoints you so. You set us up to fail by expecting me to be some escapist fantasy from your disappointing reality, which only got worse right away. As did my own: hormonal fluctuations post-IUD, paranoia from my previous employer, year-long cancer scare. Please grow the fuck up, stop projecting, and let me come home. I want a redo, and I love you for the things we have in common as much as I find your flaws and shortcomings so endearing. You're human. And you'll always be *my* human. Even *if* you're determined to freeze me out for the ways you set us up to fail. But there is no if. You are choosing to let your insecurities make both of us miserable. And that's totally fucked."

You have done everything possible to not deserve it, but I can't deny my feelings any longer. With you time stands still. With you, I feel like I can be me. With you, I can be the smart and hot woman I am. You sang along to one of my favorite songs. I have never had a man I could really share myself with like I can with you. The chemistry is there. The night we kissed, I was putty in your hands. Then you had to go ruin it by telling me you were gonna hurt me. Honestly, I feel like I don't know you, but somehow I do. I know your heart. I know your mind. I have this ability to accurately see people intuitively. I'm rarely ever wrong. It's just trusting it. You sabotaged yourself. Why? Are you really that much like me? I know you're a good man deep down. I know you'd be an amazing partner. You're sweet and affectionate. You'd be a fun dad and my son would adore you. I somehow know you feel for me in some way. You see me the way I see you, but I think you're not ready to give up your old life for a one of vulnerability and real love. You're years away from it, I think. So what do I do? I have to let you go. I have to move on and maybe I'll meet someone who can love me and build with me. Right now I'm really focused on getting to where I wanna be in my life. Maybe we'll meet again when we're both in a place to build a life and really be open to this kind of love. I love you, -Me"

I've only managed to get there once before, and it was with you. Remember we had that massive argument in your house? We had to be quiet because your housemate came home, so we were just sitting in your room, hissing at each other until the anger faded away, and we just spoke. We've never communicated so well. You said what you had to say, I said what I had to say. We took each other's points in, understood each other and fell a little deeper in love. I managed to reach that state in therapy but that's the only time I've managed to in three years, and I want to return to it. But you were the only person I ever trusted to take me seriously. I only ever trusted you to talk to about my deepest self. On nights like tonight, when this overwhelming sense of apathy is growing, one thing rings true. I miss you, poops."

326,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,For G,2,d0ra7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/d0ra7f/for_g/,2019-09-07 13:55:28,"To a lost boy, This letter will not be my best, I am exhausted and sickly, but I will try to adequately explain what I feel you need. I know that for the majority of your life you have felt lonely, isolated, and insecure. I know you often felt misunderstood by your peers and that most of your kind intentions were wrongly received. When you were bullied or spoken ill of, it cut you with embarrassment and resentment. This is where your anger first began to flourish. And so you added an extra layer to defend yourself. And then another. And another. After every painful incident you built your wall higher and swore to yourself that no one would ever hurt you again. You began to distrust others completely, shunning true friendship and intimacy in the process. If it seems to good to be true, it's because it is, you told yourself. So you wore your distrust, skepticism, and suspicion around like armor. You try to present yourself as this armored man who walks with his shoulders back and chest puffed out. He cannot be bothered by weak emotions or illogical motivations. He has to remain strong and resolute so that he can continue to support himself. It is that man who also lashes out to put others in their place should they get to close or try to approach his territory. He thinks vulnerability is weakness and he won't stand for it. Rather than open himself up, he hurts those who try to pull him out of his comfort zone. It's easier that way, he tells himself, and if someone truly gives a damn about me then they won't mind it and they'll come back. But he knows most will not and he prefers it this way. When someone does not return, he pats himself on the back and says well, I got rid of someone who wasn't loyal to begin with and would have hurt me anyway. He sees it as weeding them out for his own protection. He would rather be lonely than surrounded by selfish individuals who want nothing but to use him or hurt him. I can assume this routine has gone on for a decade or more. I don't believe that man to be you, however, I think you've convinced yourself that you are that person. When I used to say I see you for what you are, you laughed at me and said you had been yourself this entire time. But that was a lie, wasn't it? You were still defensive and hostile and closed off. I knew what was underneath that exterior you had suctioned to yourself. It had become so ingrained in you that you had believed it to be your personality and not the result of several years of trauma and suffering. I knew that just wasn't true. You are not a bad or evil man. You are not someone who is to be feared or hated. You were hurt and you were harmed. I have seen who you are, who you truly are, at the quick of you. You are curious, loving, empathetic, emotional, and warm. You are kind hearted and passionate. You love to create and imagine. You want to please others. You have dreams and goals. You are funny and carefree. You light up rooms you walk into. You pull focus. You draw others in like magnets. You glow. You radiate. I fell in love with the person I know you to be and that is not the armored man. No, it is magical boy on the inside that I know is still there fighting for his chance in the world. Here are the things I feel you need, beautiful boy. I feel that the most important thing you require is healing. I know it is difficult to unload so much over the years and I understand healing isn't a linear process. It takes time. It's not easy either. But the first step is to want to heal. I know that your life would change dramatically just in talking out your darkest days and sorting through the feelings you still have hanging over your head. I know how you feel about therapy, but I hope you would still seek out a psychologist or counselor you feel like you could trust in order to help you. And trust you will have to. I know it's scary to explain those things to a complete stranger but you have to if you want to heal. I know that you do or else none of this would have ever happened. So please, for me, look into therapy of some sort if you haven't already done so. I know you've probably tried but please try again. Once you feel like you're on an upward trend of healing or at least properly dealing with your emotions, you need to find something to focus on in order to motivate change. I know that you have used creative projects in the past as this focal point, but you have to find a way to make it tangible to the real world. I'm not saying a career is the way to do it but have you ever considered going back to school? Do you think that your current situation would allow for that? And before you give me the whole it's too late for me spiel, just remember that I just went back to school for the second time. It's never too late to start over. That's an eyerolling statement but it's a true one. Just find something that starts to propel you forward, but it needs to be big. It needs to push you outside of your realm you've been in or else you won't do anything differently. You need a support system. Everyone does. You need to find people in your life who will support you and encourage you on your journey. I'm not talking about the yes men who appease you and let you slack, I'm talking about the ones who poke you in the ass and tell you hey it's time to wake up and get moving. That's what a true friend is- someone who brings out the best in you. Think about who those people are in your life. The ones who motivate and inspire you to want to be better. Tell them about your plans and ask them to help you achieve them. You need to expect and plan for failure. Success is similar to healing in that it's not linear. It's going to take many attempts in many different ways, but as long as you continue to try and get up after you fail, you will find something that sticks. I swear to you. This is coming from personal experience. You cannot give up when something challenging comes your way. You can't throw in the towel on yourself. If you want something you have to be willing to do everything in your power to get it. You need to open yourself up and allow yourself to love again. You can't keep up this trend of pushing others away if you want people to stay in your life. You have to be vulnerable with them and then they will be vulnerable with you. See it as an equal trade-off. I can't promise you that you won't get hurt again in the process but if you want love this is something you will have to practice religiously. People want to love you but you have to be willing to accept that love without distrust or suspicion. You have to allow yourself to be loved. I don't know what else to say. I could be completely and totally wrong about you and about what I feel you need. This is just my opinion from where I stand now. I just want you to be happy, whatever that entails. I fell in love with the person you are deep down and I want him to be a permanent fixture. I'd do anything to help him and please him if I could. I want to be with him more than I've ever wanted anything. I hope this letter doesn't hurt you. It's late and I'm not feeling well, but I care about you and I'm thinking of you always. Yours,"

Its a vice Im guilty of myself. Im breaking the fourth wall here and its for a reason. I want my listeners to be comfortable. Why though? Is there something I should be missing? Or was my life that pathetic that I thought you were perfect? I actually dont know the answer myself. Im torn between I hate you and I care about you. Two contrasts that rip me in opposite directions throughout a daily basis. Is this what you wanted? For me to be left in absolute confusion as to who you are? I dont understand. Who you were was the most amazing person Ive ever met, but who you became? It hurts me. Youll never give me credit for it, youll never acknowledge me. But I changed you.. How? Why? Was I just a learning curve? Did I drop water into hot oil expecting it not to explode? I guess I was fishing for a reaction. Something to assure me that someone I deeply cared about; someone who claimed to care about me in the same fashion, actually meant what they said. And if you did mean it at any point in time, I dont feel it. At all. You probably say the same about me, but is it true? Fuck no. I do hope youre happy. I hope life treats you in the most amazing way that you smile with glee and joy for the eternity of your existence. I really do. I loved you, I missed you, I will always but like, you just made it very hard for me to move on. You flipped a switch and I was your enemy the day after being your lover. I cant forget. I can forgive but this will never leave from me. This was something different and something I cant even begin to comprehend. So, Im just going to drop it. I moved away. To heaven. Its a work-hard play-hard environment but it is a walk of life unlike any other. It doesnt matter how weird you are. How broken you are. How immensely lost you were before you got here. This is the end of the road. We have the mountains, we have the ocean. Were all running from something here but weve also found a place where we are accepted despite our differences and honestly, its rejuvenated me. I can stand tall (so punny cuz Im a shorty pi) because I am loved fully not just by one person. I am loved and accepted by everyone here because a lot of them have ran in my shoes for a few miles. The people here recycle, there is no such thing as littering. There are massage parties and life on the beach is amazing and I just dont think you understand exactly what you tossed aside. But its okay. I understand that you know nothing about me. You just think you have a grasp on what I am. For that, Im also sorry. I am a generous soul that you never fully opened yourself to, and I dont blame you. Its scary. Its absolute vulnerability. But I opened up to you, told you my fears, weaknesses. I even cooked a BOMB green curry for you that one day. But none of it matters anymore? Really? Am I expected to believe Im just left behind by someone who claimed theyd never leave me behind no matter what? Thats what hurts the most. You claimed I was it. The end game. Genuinely made me feel like I was in love with someone until I just wasnt. There was no real argument, I just got dropped for no rhyme or reason. But it helped me, Im here, Im healing. Living a healthy lifestyle with a healthy mindset capable of feeling compassion, guilt, and love and I dont know if youre quite there yet. Youre still young, I guess you have some exploring to do. Havent quite had the consequences of life hit you yet. But they will, and you wanna know what? Id STILL be a shoulder to cry on. But you have not been the same for me, and all I want to know, is why? Am I that bad? And, honestly"

You addressed them, and work with me through them - calming me even when my nightmares are at their worst. &amp;#x200B; Is this what it's supposed to be like? Is this what I've been missing? I wonder if you know how much it scares me. How having you so close and knowing that I might mess this up keeps me awake when you're not here. ...I wonder if you know that you chase those fears away every time you kiss me. I've told you how I feel, but I wonder if you know the other implications behind those three small, overused words.

Hey what's up? Don't get too excited, you do become victor if the contest is becoming the focus of my frustration and anger. Here's the thing, I tried to like you, I wanted to get along with you. I didn't care to be your friend, you are correct in saying I have few, but I strive to stay on neutral ground with most people i encounter anhymore. Don't worry, this i9sn't about Gary. My issue is the disrespect you showed me after I told you a small portion of my story. I with clear conscious, would NEVER treat a person the way you treated me, and while I accept that not all people will behave as i do, i expect most to possess an ability to treat people with respect. I did not arrive in this town with an expectation of picking up where I left off with him, after five years and many life happenings, that would be unrealistic. I recognize that people can't be excpected to drtop everytyhing over my life dramas. Prior to making my way out here, I had exhausted every other option, and burned many bridges. I called ""your man"" after an unexpected occurrance with the father of my children, and asked if, in the even of myu ability to find a way over I could stay with him and get on my feet. We did not discuss anything rergarding a relationship, and i'm mature enough to respect the boundaries of my exes, the majority of whom I still remain on friendly terms. When you appeared, i was more confused than anything, and only ever asked for clarification on my place in his life. I respected when he asked that I remove my shit from his room, and did my best to show apprecation for a place to crash by trying to help around the house. I had a job interview scheduled and had plans to get a pair of glasses. In a few weeks, I would have been on my own. Instead, you behaved like a mean girl, and acted as if mouthing off and establishing your ""claim"" on another person made you a badass, and that your belittlement of me was a conquest. I find it sadf that your mind and ability to reason is still so primitive. One does not benefit from loudly demeaning a person. Lucky for you I am uneasily harmed by threats and put downs and beating me up is no accomplishment if the person doesn't fight back. I was extremely amused at your threat to ""drag me out by my hair"", like seriously, i know for a fact I would beat the living shit out of you in ANY physical altercation if it were a fair figtht. The problem is I have pretty extreme PTSD with combat-like exhibition of symptoms, meaning I am not only capable of negotiating my way through hostage like situations, I also possess the knopwledge of enough self-defeense to make sure a person never touches me again, but I choose to remain inactive in my fight response, meaning when given a choice, I will always flee. I will cry like a bitch, and express my hurt feelings and fear, and trust that I hate nothing more than vulnerability on that level. I realize you felt that my ability to recognize and identify my emotions was a sign of immaturity, and i'm sorry you feel that way. What are you afraid of? Anger is stemmed in fear, and I was once similar. Until i identified those fears and insecurities, I was unable to live with my own mind. Thank God for Wisdom! I hope you have the patience to one day gain some, but first you must possess insight. Nobody can develop that besides the self. so, good luck.

I've always known that I *could* ask, but I'm human and the fear of rejection is strong - especially after you initiated, and then never brought the subject up again. You were honest. You said you just didn't have the time, and you were sorry for not being more open about it. I knew that already - you move from event to event so fast I can't blink or I'll miss you passing by, and you do it on purpose. You said you weren't ready, and I support and understand that. I appreciated your frankness - but what caught me off guard was when you said you were jealous. You play the asshole all the time, and so well, it didn't occur to me that you actually *felt* something for me. I was still recovering from the surprise when you said you hoped I didn't take it wrong if you were awkward about me dating other people, not towards me, but towards them. You said you couldn't help it. You? Impervious, devil-may-care you? Jealous? It's a moot point now, because we missed our chance, and who knows if we'll have another one someday. But when you took my hand and held it tight for a moment, your eyes revealed more vulnerability than they've ever had in the six years we've been friends. I hope you won't go away - I won't. I was completely sincere, though, when I said I wish you'd been ready. I wish you'd taken the chance. P.S.

You replace memories of trauma with memories of pure and crazy love. No matter how scared or stressed I get, you make it all go away. Im not sure if you know just how much Ive struggled with sexuality and vulnerability. Its something Ive been sheltered from for all these years. Because of this, I never expected to fall in love with you. However, without trying, youve taught me that I dont have to have all the answers. I dont have to stick a label on myself in order to have an identity. All that matters is giving and receiving love. And thats what we do. Thank you for never pushing me further than where Im comfortable. Thank you for being patient with me. Thank you for talking me through my internal battles and telling me that I got this shit. Thank you for being my favorite person in the world and thank you for the honor of being yours. I love you."

Here I thought I had found a friend who could make me laugh and pick me up in a way I needed to be picked up, when I was down. A friend who was too loyal to their spouse to ever stray but felt something for me and was there for me in the way they could be. I admired your level of loyalty. The feelings were always there. You knew that. I was vulnerable. You knew that, too. You used the things you knew about me, against me. You took my vulnerability and used it to your advantage, to try fix what is broken in your life, not realizing that what is actually broken, is you. It's not just that you turned out to be a habitual cheater. It's that you presented yourself to be someone entirely different. I was friends with a lie and that makes me feel like a chump. I felt safe with you. But I never was. And that sucks. You are a sad person. You make yourself feel better about how sad you are by tricking people into thinking you deserve more than you do. You made me laugh. You made me smile. You fed me crap knowing I'd lop it up like a starving kitten, because you knew I was hurting. You reeled me in. You took advantage. I will never say these things to you. The last thing I'm going to do is give you the knowledge of how deeply you cut me. I don't want you to know how much you matter. Mattered."

I opened up a little about some of the ways you make me feel, obviously still pretty guarded and vague. I honestly didnt expect much of a reaction because if I were you I wouldnt know how to respond to it either, but you did. I apologized for my confession because vulnerability doesnt look very good on me. Your response was heartbreaking and cold. I couldnt even respond. Its weird because the words you sent werent inherently bad or damning... but in context did shine quite a light on how you might actually feel about me, Indifferent.

336,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Vicky,2,d8c85f,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/d8c85f/vicky/,2019-09-24 06:16:22,"I'm writing you this in a letter because I don't feel that I will be able to express it verbally in our sessions. I have spent time reflecting on what has happened in the past couple of months in my therapy and I feel uncomfortable about my observations. &amp;#x200B; I am concerned that my attempts to understand what has been happening in our therapy sessions will be misconstrued as an emotional reaction, a problem with relationships, or a recreation of a previous pattern with other therapists/ relationships. &amp;#x200B; In fact my current efforts to critically and seriously evaluate what my therapist is doing represent a a new way of responding for me. This change in my response is a result of the fact that I was recently manipulated by someone who used many tactics to exploit my trust and my natural inclination to assume the best of people and to give the benefit of doubt to everyone automatically. I understand what I write below may come across as hypervigilance, but I think that although I may be wrong in some aspects, I am able to evaluate whether my concerns are valid and how likely they are to be factual. &amp;#x200B; I am human and this means that I don't simply recreate patterns in my behaviours and relationships. As a human I learn from situations in the past and the current way I am addressing this situation reflects my best understanding of how to do things in an effective way. It is not reminiscent of any past problems I have had, but it is an evolution of how I have learned to handle difficulties in my life. I have improved my ways of handling difficulties throughout my life but this is often missed in therapies where the working assumption must be that I lack good ways of handling difficulties and have a deficient ability to learn and evolve my responses to situations. These working assumptions don't fit reality but it seems that they are required for engaging me in a mode of therapy that attempts to teach me new life skills in order to improve my life, or in a mode of therapy that attempts to read my current reactions to situations as a hidden code that reveals what I did in past situations. &amp;#x200B; I wanted to address a few specific things: &amp;#x200B; 1. In our session before last, you asked me if I had thought about what we discussed in the previous session. I asked you to remind me what that was. You read from your notes that apparently I told you that I feel my previous therapies didn't work because the therapists made it all about them. I immediately objected to this. I said ""that's not what I said, you said that."" I stated that I wouldn't have expressed myself that way and that I don't agree with the notion. You didn't correct this statement in your notes. So this statement ""previous therapists made it all about them"" is still misattributed to me in my therapy notes. &amp;#x200B; Upon reflecting on this I feel uncomfortable that you put your words in my mouth in my therapy notes. I didn't say that and I don't view the situation this way and I have good reasons for that. Beyond the fact that it simply doesn't match my thoughts or my feelings about my previous therapists, you may not realise that if I expressed myself in that way I would be stigmatised for it. &amp;#x200B; You in turn can express that you think I think something, and as a socially adjusted and employed person you can even state that you personally think that way about your own life, and you won't suffer any stigma. However in my situation I don't have the luxury of summarising my relationship difficulties with statements like ""he just didn't care about me"" or ""she made it all about her"" as this will be seen by various ""helpers"" as emotional coping intended to deflect from the reality of complex interpersonal situations. &amp;#x200B; This kind of emotional coping with difficult interpersonal situations is good enough for people who don't have diagnosed mental health problems. However, when people who do have diagnosed mental health problems make the mistake of expressing such subjective, one-sided statements about their difficulties in relationships, it is considered by the current ""therapeutic"" approach to mental illness that in order to get better, those diagnosed with serious issues must be disabused of these simplistic comforting assumptions about people, and must replace these emotional coping methods with more realistic and nuanced interpretations of situations, and that these mentally ill people should strive to replace their simplistic emotional coping assumptions with new interpretations that take into account both parties in the relationship and not just the subjective feelings of being hurt and uncared for. &amp;#x200B; I hope you can understand that if you represent me as someone who thinks all previous therapies failed because the therapists made it ""all about them,"" then you will erase the fact that I actually have a more complex, less self centered view of the situation. Your misattribution of your own statement as if it's what I feel and think might give someone the wrong impression as if I need to work on my perception regarding this. Or you might give someone the wrong impression that I previously had the attitude that it was ""all about them"" and only with the help of more therapy came to learn a more nuanced perspective. &amp;#x200B; I think this process that I described has repeated in my previous therapies a lot - where the therapist projects their own feelings on me, tells me that I feel what they say I feel, and then try to view my problems and the potential solutions through that interpretation. The feelings that therapists project onto me seem to derive from their own most immature, emotional, subjective interpretations of what it would be like to walk in my shoes - as if by using these interpretations, the therapists are connecting with the immature, emotional, subjective way that I ""must"" be feeling. It seems to be the assumption that these projections about my feelings must be correct, because it is assumed that if I wasn't so wrapped up in immature, emotional, subjective interpretations, I wouldn't be having all these problems in my life. &amp;#x200B; It's fine if you want to include your own interpretation in my notes but please don't misattribute your own interpretations to me. I would have never made that statement about my previous therapists. It feels unsafe that you represented my sentiments in this way because this leaves me open to being stigmatised for hiding my problems behind a narrative that is subjective, emotional, and not factual, about my previous therapists, and makes me seem solipsistic and immature in my attitude to my past therapists. Although that might be perfectly fine and normal as a way of coping for someone else, I don't have the luxury of thinking in that way, nor do I have the luxury of presenting my thoughts in that way, as someone who has multiple serious mental health diagnoses and hardly any social relationships. &amp;#x200B; 2. I have been dreading our sessions over the past few months because when I become silent during the session, you begin to stare at me intensely in silence for a long time, and I don't think this staring is a natural part of a therapeutic relationship or any relationship. &amp;#x200B; I think it is harmful because if I learned from you that staring at distressed people like that was normal and applied it in similar situations to people in my life, I would be making them uncomfortable. Also it is likely that unlike me, most people will automatically identify that the intense staring is not appropriate, and this will cause them to draw conclusions about me based on a behaviour that I learned from you and mistook as appropriate. &amp;#x200B; It is actually really hard for me to make eye contact in the way you expect as normal, and I don't automatically know what to make of the way you stare at me in those times when I'm silent and seem sad and withdrawn. When you do it, the thought that goes through my head is that I'm supposed to know how to respond to this staring by some show of vulnerability, and that this staring is supposed to make me want to reach out and connect to you, and that it is a form of reproach or pity for the fact your staring doesn't lead me to experience care or intimacy. I don't feel any desire to show vulnerability in response to this staring and it doesn't make me want to connect with you or feel that proceeding towards more intimacy from that situation would be healing to me. Then I start to think that the fact I don't respond the way you are trying to get me to respond must be what I need to fix about myself. Then I intuitively feel that this is incorrect and harmful to me, and I start to feel very anxious, confused and uncomfortable. &amp;#x200B; The first time you did it I asked you to please not do it anymore. It still continued to happen regularly every time I became silent and seemed sad and withdrawn. I am not actually withdrawn in any way in those moments but I understand that it seems that way. &amp;#x200B; As it continued to happen I continued to ask for it to stop and continued to ask you not to respond like that. It still continued to happen in our last session and three sessions ago. It seems like you don't respect my request no matter how many times I repeat it, so I drew the conclusion from this that your staring must be normal and that my request is unnatural. But I reflected more on this and I realised that it is not appropriate, that other people haven't done it to me, and that other people wouldn't like it done to them either. &amp;#x200B; If it makes you uncomfortable or you don't know how to handle it when I seem withdrawn and go silent, please simply ask me what to do. Please simply ask me questions or share your observations during that time and this will allow me to engage comfortably with you if I want to. Please don't apply any emotional pressure on me or any techniques when I seem withdrawn, and please don't make statements during that time that are designed to make me emotional. I think that you interpret what happens when I get silent as me becoming withdrawn and you think the right thing to do in that moment is to make me emotional, get me to feel that you care about me, break me out of my shell etc. This is not the case and the attempts to make me have an emotional response or display intimate behaviour during a time of distress, anxiety, and discomfort with how you're acting, are painful to me and adding stress in my life, without having any therapeutic effect on me. &amp;#x200B; If you asked me you would understand the context better for my presentation when I become silent. I think instead of asking me, you assumed that this is ""something that happens to me in relationships."" In fact it is not something that happens to me in relationships. It is not something that ""happens"" to me at all. It is something that I do in therapy, and only in therapy and nowhere else, because I am trying to feel comfortable, in the only social setting where I am simply supposed to be the way that I am. &amp;#x200B; I do this in therapy at the point where I become fed up with all the nonsense that passes for ""insight"" in therapy, and tired of pretending that the therapist's theories about me or my needs have any meaning, and tired of pushing myself to engage with the treatment when it's obvious that ""having someone to talk to"" and ""help me discover who I am"" has no connection to my actual needs and has no capacity to make my life better. It's true I need to see someone weekly anyway because therapy sessions are often the only time I communicate during the week and the only occassion I travel any distance from my house when I am depressed. &amp;#x200B; When I don't waste my breath on saying things that no one understands, don't get myself irritated by answering people who try to get the right answers with the wrong questions, don't have to make eye contact, and don't have to pretend that I want to be alive, I feel more comfortable. You seem to interpret this comfort and permission I give myself to let myself act the way I feel, as if I'm struggling to connect with you and becoming withdrawn, when actually I am just giving myself a break from the constant self parenting that I have to do every single minute that I am awake, and giving myself a break from the constant expectation during social interaction to pretend that I want to be alive and that I feel good whenever I interact with people. &amp;#x200B; When I get silent and seem withdrawn I think this is your chance to actually help me if you actually try to connect with me in that moment, instead of trying to push me or pull me out of something that you don't seem to understand. When I seem withdrawn to yo, I can answer questions and communicate about anything as long as it isn't manipulative, pressuring, laden with hidden subtext, or demanding intimacy. I am fine with all of those things after I walk out of the therapy room because I have to live in a world full of that type of communication and I think I have adjusted myself to that. So you can try to connect with me in those emotional ways when I seem fine and not distressed. But when I do seem distressed, this is because I am allowing you to see how I feel most of the time. In those moments, please don't try to connect with me by trying to make me emotional or trying to push me to express intimacy, because this is just putting me in crisis in service of your idea of how a normal person should act in a relationship, and unfortunately this has nothing to do with my needs or how to make my relationships better. &amp;#x200B; 3. The time before last that you stared at me during my period of silence, this happened towards the end of the session, and went on for minutes, and I felt very uncomfortable and confused about why it was still happening after I had asked for it to stop. I decided to stop submitting to the situation that made me uncomfortable and decided to break out of the silence and end the situation. So through my anxiety I tried to remember what we spoke about before I became silent. &amp;#x200B; I remembered what we spoke about and then snapped out of the silence and made a general statement about the topic discussed prior to the silence in a composed tone and with normal eye contact. It seemed like you were disappointed and hurt that I did this, and that you interpreted it as a failure on my part to connect with you, and it seemed like you felt that by doing what I did, I was pushing you away. &amp;#x200B; However what I did was healthy and useful, and it wasn't about getting distance from a feared connection (I think this is how you interpret that situation.) It was about taking action to end a situation that made me uncomfortable and that I didn't want to continue, in a way that was respectful to you and not meant to hurt you and not intended to send you any messages, emotional or otherwise. It was not intended to send any messages because I already directly told you what I thought and what I wanted with regards to the intense staring so there is no need for me to send any hidden emotional messages when I already directly stated how I felt about the situation. &amp;#x200B; It was about making myself feel better by ending the uncomfortable situation without making myself feel worse by ending the uncomfortable situation with the kind of response that you seem to want. I assume in those moments that you stare at me, you want me to look up and make eye contact with you and help you feel that we are establishing a connection and a sense of intimacy. That is not what I want in those moments. Especially not when it seems like in reaction to seeing me in distress, your response ignores my needs in favour of what you think my needs ought to be. &amp;#x200B; 4. I am not sure if there is any connection but during our next session, after you seemed to feel that I rejected you by ending the silence, we had the session where you told me that I always disagree or correct the statements you make about me, and that you think that I correct you way more than would be reasonable, so there must be some problem in play, and that it's not likely to be simply a consistent failure on your part to properly understand me and a constant attempt on my part to be understood more accurately. You seemed to be telling me that you already understand me as well as can be expected, or that your understanding should be enough because I can't expect to be perfectly understood, and it's not likely I'll find someone who can understand me better. &amp;#x200B; I know that I shared with you in confidence and out of trust that a previous therapist did the same thing in a way that hurt me and I also shared with you that I disagreed with what the therapist did and with the way she did it, and that it had a bad impact on me, although you don't know the full extent of the negative impact it had on me and the way it played into the abuse I subsequently experienced from my ex partner. &amp;#x200B; I'm not sure if you remembered that you were repeating the same action that a previous therapist took, or if you remembered that I found that action by the previous therapist to have been hurtful and damaging to me. &amp;#x200B; I feel concerned about this, because it seems like you repeated something hurtful that another therapist did to me, the session after I did something that seemed to hurt you. I don't know if it's a coincidence or a punishment. Just for the sake of clarity - I don't tend to think in terms of punishment, in my family punishments have never been a disciplinary tool, and I don't try to punish people in emotional ways, but my ex partner was very much into punishment and he would punish me a lot, and also tried to get me to punish him when he thought he did something bad, and I had to constantly resist this behaviour on his part and identify when it was happening. So as a result of this I think I was able to notice that it's possible to interpret what you did as a punishment, when in the past I would have assumed best intentions on your part and would not have considered this type of explanation for your action. &amp;#x200B; I shared in confidence with my ex partner criticisms and negative things other people have said about me, and my ex partner used it to punish me, even though he didn't personally experience those negative things in our relationship, and simply because he knew how much it would hurt me. although this is probably not the case with what you did, I am having a hard time with the similarity. &amp;#x200B; I know that my ex partner did this deliberately and insincerely, but in your case I am sure that your feedback was honest to your experience and that you simply had the same experience with me as the previous therapist and that's the reason why you repeated her feedback. &amp;#x200B; I think that if I shared in confidence with you something that a previous therapist did, something that hurt me and had a bad impact on me, that you shouldn't do a repeat performance of that hurtful thing. You don't really know the meaning or the context of how and when that previous therapist did that, but you brought it all back up for me with your action and I don't think this was the right way to help me. &amp;#x200B; It would have been possible to discuss this if you wanted to, but not by repeating so abruptly the same action that hurt me with another therapist, and in a timing that wasn't helpful to me, and wasn't the right timing with all the problems we were having in previous sessions, with your expectations for me to trust you more in the background of all of this, and during the holiday period when we didn't have sessions on a weekly basis. When problems come up for me in therapy it's hard enough that I have to wait a week to address them again, so a period of time when I have to wait two weeks is not the right time to explore these kinds of problems with the therapy relationship. &amp;#x200B; It's probably a coincidence that you recreated something painful I shared with you that a previous therapist did, the session after I did something that you seemed to interpret as rejection. I would be interested in hearing what you think but there is no way for me to feel safe with you after this because from now on I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop. I know you were only trying to ""help"" me and I am sure you didn't mean to hurt me, but just in case it wasn't a coincidence, then whatever the reason it happened, I am not in a position where I can trust you to take care with my wellbeing. &amp;#x200B; 5. In the last session you you began by asking if I wanted to do some resourcing this week and I responded that I did not and that I wanted to talk about what has been happening in previous sessions. We had a conversation and at some point I asked to tell me how you understood what I was saying. You said a few things to reflect what I said and none of the things you said felt right to me, and I didn't think any of what you said matched the things I was trying to express to you. &amp;#x200B; However I felt like I couldn't say anything to correct you, because of the criticism that I seem to reject too many things or feel more misunderstood than you think is reasonable. So as a result I felt like I was supposed to take on your reflection of what I had said, even though it didn't match what I tried to express at all. I think the things you mirrored back to me are more about your sensitivities of things that can go wrong in therapy and didn't actually match the content of what I was expressing. It seemed like you tried to match the emotional content of what I wanted to express, but it's not really enough for me to feel understood if the feelings match, when your understanding of my thoughts, needs, perceptions, doesn't match, and you've made it hard for me to say so, by telling me that your understanding of me is as good as understanding can get. &amp;#x200B; One thing in particular that didn't match for me was the fact you said I ""felt pathologised."" I don't see how this came accross in anything I said, and I actually feel the opposite with you. I feel that you de-pathologise me when I have a real debilitating physical illness. &amp;#x200B; I don't know if you realise for example that bipolar disorder causes gradual brain damage because of lactic acid in the brain. You told me ""you've got all these skills, why don't you work?"" and it's like you don't understand that for me to go and get active and achieve the things you seem to think I can simply go and do if I put my mind to them, means that I actually experience what it's like to have a nervous system that doesn't work properly, and what it's like when lactic acid gets produced in my brain, because my body has to use an alternative process to create energy for the brain, because the cycle of energy production in every cell in my body is defective. &amp;#x200B; Beyond the fact that my nervous system doesn't work properly and the fact that I get brain damage every time I have to put myself into overdrive to achieve something, there's the fact that I am never going to be able to manage my time and affairs in the way that other people are trying to ""help me"" do myself, even if this means that I have to spend more money on this ""help"" to teach me how to do things myself, than the money it would cost to pay someone to do on my behalf the things that I can't do properly, even when the neglect of those things has meant my life has been unbearable for the past decade, and not worth living. &amp;#x200B; So I feel the opposite of ""pathologised"" when my issues get attributed to passing life difficulties or adverse experiences. I am never going to be able to do all the things that people take for granted and this is not because of the damage that I have suffered, although the damage has made it worse. &amp;#x200B; I have different capabilities than what people consider normal, so there are things I can do really well, and since my difficulties are not so obvious, people assume that this means I can do everything well enough compared to what's normal. &amp;#x200B; Because my parents only wanted a normal child, and because of everything I did to handle my problems myself, I never received support beyond all the nudging, manipulations, pressure, to fix me into other people's vision of what I could be if I wasn't what I actually am. &amp;#x200B; When I told you that I was scared and anxious because how was I ever going to be able to do all those things to keep my life managed? You told me that I'll be able to do them like everyone else has to. If you think that some resolution of trauma could make a difference to this you don't understand that I already handled my traumas well during my entire life, and that the way I am doesn't have anything to do with theories about my brain remembering things in a fragmented way. &amp;#x200B; The effects of trauma in my life are not going to be explained by a theory about my brain getting confused about how to remember traumatic events. The brain has a way of remembering traumatic events and you know more about this than me, but this is not the cause of my problems and I have been resilient to the traumas because of the ways I dealt with them. If you think I am this way because of lack of resilience you will never actually understand what happened in my life and how I ended up in the current situation where my difficulties don't make sense to anyone when I seem to have everything I would need to lead a good life, except for a functioning brain and nervous system. &amp;#x200B; The effects of trauma in my life are because I understand what's happening to me and why I'm so vulnerable to people's harmful influences, and why it's so hard for me to communicate myself properly, and so hard for others to realise that they don't understand me when they're convinced that they're there help me, and instead of helping me, the ""helpers"" try to force feed me with lies as if I can do everything that normal people can do, and lies as if I can expect the same safety from abuse and exploitation that normal people expect. The lies are bad enough on their own, but then telling me I need to trust more in order to let the lies override my understanding of reality is not going to make me healthy."

No one claiming that I see patterns others dont and to question my sanity for it. No corporate Bullshit about diversity, inclusion, no labels, and trust. Hey, guess what company that has outsourced almost everything to cut costs and to inflate shareholder value? Culture is not made by a company. Culture is created by the collective integrity of the employees, leadership, and actions of the board. Youve made so many cuts that your culture is bleeding from a lack of ethical leadership. Also, Ive known my whole life that I see the world differently than 99.9% of the population. Know what? Im fucking proud of who I am, my dyslexia, and how it allows me to notice what others dont. I see your lack of authentic leadership; I see you lack of integrity &amp; ethics; I see how you treat employees with disabilities and well, anyone that embraces diversity. Youre right; Im not a good fit. Youve lost your values and Ive learned to stand courageously to fight for mine. Today, I woke up with everything: my core values intact and more important than ever. A heart full of love, trust, vulnerability, and humility. A mind eager to fail, learn, and grow. Hope that more corporations will get back to what really matters - the ethical treatment of its employees over board member pay raises, and higher shareholder value. Sure its pays off in the short term, but you cannot create, sustain, and grow long term value by stepping all over your people. Best of luck with that strategy. PS: to the person who unintentionally took the brunt of my unhealthy, toxic workplace. Im sorry.

I hope I thank you in person for helping me find my self worth, self love, and value deep within. You mean more to me than you can ever truly know. H"

Your compassion, vulnerability, kindness. Your passion, sexiness, sensuality. Those eyes. That smile. You care about me. Your affection for me is plain. Mine for you remains locked away for now. Letting myself do that, open myself up after earlier being crushed by doing the same with another, that's terrifying. It took me 7 months to get over the last one. I don't want to do another 7 months. But, god! You are handsome and bright; deep and caring. Yes, I could fall so fast I'd never see the ground rushing at me. So hard I'd splatter upon impact. I'd take that journey with you, but not yet. I need to understand your level of engagement. I need to make sure this has wings. That when I fall we'll fly."

My heart broke to think that the someone I was so excited to plan the rest of my life with was just another seemingly heartless individual. My stomach went into knots knowing the person I was talking with wasn't something I could bear to tolerate for the forever we talked about. Because I am going cry sometimes, things are going to sting my soul. I am a strong willed person with a heart of gold that was made to love passionately. I am edgy and sarcastic, but that doesn't mean I haven't been faced with situations that kept me up wondering how much more I could handle. I don't wear my hardships on my sleeve and I shouldn't have to in order to obtain support and love. I am deserving of the same compassion and support I give to others. Maybe you can understand that I do express love obnoxiously because I know what it's like to feel physically and mentally debilitated by sadness. I show intense love and support to prevent others from being where I've been. I don't feel obligated to convince anyone that the pain I've endured is valid, I'm not going to explain why the hard points in my life are entitled to sympathy, it's not a contest. I am not going to write you an essay about why people should feel bad for me, I don't want anyone to feel bad for me. What I will do is tell you that I don't have the energy to teach you to be compassionate. One of my talents is understanding people and being a beacon of support for people in their times of vulnerability, I credit some of that talent to having been in many different situations. But to be that person for another in pain, you don't have to understand. All you need to know is the person shedding tears in front of you is hurting, you don't need an impressive resume of experience to be someone's rock."
343,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Last Farewell,0,dakftl,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/dakftl/last_farewell/,2019-09-29 05:16:45,"My dear angel monkey, We've known one another for only a short while, but it feels like a lifetime. Those first days together were unbelievable. Our conversations skipped right over the mundane, and instead we touched on what seems like every big subject, whether of a cosmic nature or a personal one. We walked arm in arm (both smiling for a change) and would cuddle on the grass in the shade of the trees afterward. You felt protected and safe in that physical intimacy; I, accepted, and vulnerable in a good way. When we were caught by surprise by the rain that one time we fled the scene laughing, and then I loaned you some dry clothes to wear. The hoodie (comically large on you) you wore pretty much constantly over the following weeks, as you later confided in me. When you asked that day if you could take said hoodie home with you, accompanied by the remark ""Guess I'll have to come over soon, to give it back"", I didn't dare hope. You see, I've been lonely for damn near a decade now. There have been some women in my life - but ever since that fledgling romance of my late teens, nothing that went anywhere. It seems there's something off about me, romantically, something that scares people off. Don't let me burden you with my speculations though; this letter will be dense enough without them. I have actively avoided dating for over three years now. Partly out of a gossamer-thin thread of hope that I might change for the better - and god knows I've been working hard to that end - and partly out of a certain resignation. You see, whether there's something wrong with my character, or I'm a result of my upbringing, or my mental health issues are to blame: I've been screwed up in this way for so long that it's unlikely I'll ever come out the other end 'normal'. But then, there you were. The one who proved wrong all my longheld, self-limiting beliefs. Though I'd decided never to let myself be vulnerable again, you made me change my mind. And not too long afterward... you proved me right. Love isn't something I'm likely ever to know. I know I'm not entitled to it, and some days I don't even think I deserve it. But still, I had a glimmer of hope left - and now even that is gone. I'm a broken man. I don't blame you. Like I said, I'm not entitled to love, yours or anyone else's. It's good that you recognized your own wants and needs, and no one can expect you to make these choices based on any motivation other than a purely personal one. Besides, you couldn't have known how spectacularly the entire affair was going to mess me up - I know I didn't, beforehand. I never meant for you to be my salvation. I'm not that naive. Or am I? Was it hope, or was it naivity, that prompted me to let you in? I knew the dangers of vulnerability. I just never expected you to be the one to hurt me this badly. Either way, you have proven to be the opposite of salvation to me. Our decision to move on as friends was doomed from the beginning. You, unwittingly flirting and teasing; me, utterly well-behaved until those inevitable late-night conversations of ours, where I would slowly break down and treat you like my therapist, my best friend and my worst enemy, all rolled into one. I managed to refrain from lashing out, assigning blame, or (god forbid) pleading and begging; but still I burdened you, and hurt you. Five days ago I broke off contact, to protect both you and myself. (This letter is one intended for you never to get to read.) Today I cleared our chats and messages, unfriended and unfollowed you, and deleted your details. But I didn't, couldn't, block your number. Twisted and pathetic though it is, I suppose there's some hope left in me still. Please don't call. Please call. Please don't call. Love, Your goose man"

Ive never felt so deeply about someone. But rationally I think it was all the drugs. I loved you in abstract. Your vulnerability was intoxicating. But the things you believed and cared about were so foreign to me. At times they were even offensive to me. But you also showed me a different way of looking at things that I still carry with me. But mostly I dont feel like you were a good influence. We were horrible to each other. Ive never been so mean and tried to hurt someone so deeply before. And Ive never sought out someone so mean who hurt me so deeply as much as you did. You are a ghost (how fucking ironic) who haunts me every day. Im so glad you have finally stopped spamming me. I hope you move on and find happiness. But you were special to me as hard as that might be to believe. I miss you but I hope I never ever hear from you again. I think I might die if I do and I know it sounds dramatic but I think I really mean that. If I never see you again in this life youll find me in Tahiti in the next. -SP
345,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Theater Feelings for J.P.,2,db3u8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/db3u8v/theater_feelings_for_jp/,2019-09-30 10:39:14,"I just realized I have deeper feelings for you than I realized. I am so confused and I feel like you push me away and rarely open up. It is different for me and difficult to handle. I dont understand why I can pour my heart out to you and get a thanks. What am I supposed to think of that? Am I supposed to think you care or what I am saying to you means anything? It hurts me. I know I said I wanted to be open with how I feel and so far I have been but I cant be like that with everything and frankly you have other things to deal with anyway right now. You and I both really arent ready to be in a relationship and I understand that and told you I was okay with it but it doesnt deny the fact that I still have feelings for you. I hate to just throw the word around, especially because I have misused it. In fact, I have done it pretty recently. I told D, the 17-year old I was sexting with that I loved him and we were in a pending relationship and I wasnt really ready to say it but when I got to the peak of my lust for him, I said it. He was semi respectful but he was quite iffy. I didnt understand how he could just say I love you when he knew me for two weeks and most of all, I didnt understand how I could say it back. I couldnt understand why I sent him nudes. I was fucking horny and wanted to feel loved and wanted and more than anything, I just wanted to feel like I was in a relationship and nobody likes me. I feel really guilty, like extremely guilty about telling him I wanted to have babies with him. I was just *horny,* like, damn. I need some gosh dang self-control. I guess part of me want to be in a relationship is because I dont get the type of romantic attention I have always wanted. The kind I read about, watched, heard, dreamt, wrote and have constantly had a want for. Nobody asks me out or cares to even say I am beautiful or anything. I get none of the type of attention I am craving. I got my period today but I am not as horny. I did some research and for some reason, I am supposed to be horny during my period, not before, but I became horny a week before. I know I am talking from all feelings. I never had the type of physical intimacy with anyone like I did with you. It was romantic. Yes I have kissed other kids when I was little and yea I kissed a girl my first year of seventh grade at Bridgeway Island but those were meaningless and worth nothing to me. Yes, J and I groped each other's breast but it doesnt change the fact that it was purely off of lust and a truth or dare game in 2nd-period math class. I dont count all those times as a *real* first kiss and I have the right not to. Just like if you pop your cherry on your own or are raped, you are still considered a virgin until you willingly give your virginity away to someone and have vaginal intercourse. Our intimacy was purely off of romance. The relationship we were planning on having after the time in the theater wasnt moving too fast and I have known you for a year. We were just friends for a year and I know a lot about you, just like you do about me. I know that your dad died when you were 5 and you dont have many memories with him but you have the option to listen to his voice on a home video if you really wanted to hear it. I know that you live with your single mom and grandma and that last year was really hard for you because you almost thought you would lose her. I know that you are a kickass boss on overwatch and you have been playing video games for a long time. You love art and enjoy MMA and would rather be doing that instead of football which you are forced to do by your family and mom. It takes up most of the days of your week and you feel overwhelmed because you dont have the option to back out of football and do something else you enjoy. You were a really goofy kid who took a bunch of cute funny pictures of yourself. It runs in your family to be tall but I am sure anyone could guess that just by looking at you. Your eyes are a divine, pulchritudinous, dark chocolate brown and when I looked into your eyes in the dark theater and saw the vulnerability inside, I wanted to full-on hold you and kiss you. It felt hard to look at you but I still wanted to. I guess it was so intense seeing the way you looked at me. But you dont know what I would give to see it again. I wanted to kiss you and I thought maybe I would but I had self-control and thought I would have other opportunities to. I wanted to try to have my first real, real-life relationship. After the theater, I went home and messaged D, telling him we couldnt be a thing anymore and it wasnt the first time I lured boys in just to cut them off but I swear this time it wasnt my intention. I think I really did just want a relationship so I was settling for him because he wanted me and made me feel good as bad as it sounds. I feel really bad though. I was annoyed that he wanted more nudes from me when I said I wanted to wait until we were three months in and we were a week into the pending relationship and two weeks into knowing each other. I barely knew anything about him and he was about to be 18 in December and totally illegal. Not only that, he lives all the way in Europe, Belgium and I was ruining my sleep schedule talking to him when I should have been sleeping so I could do well in daily functioning and school. In a way, not being together is one less distraction nevertheless, but thinking about you all the time is still distracting me. I wish you would stop popping up in my thought process. I dont know what to do and part of me wonders if you even like me anymore. I dont want you to act weird around me if we dont end up being a thing but we have the theater in our past and I cant say that I will be able to lose my feelings. I am so distraught and it is all your fault! *JUST GET OUT OF MY HEAD ALREADY!!!* I dont know what to do and part of me hurts at the fact that I truly dont know what to say that will just get you to clearly open up to me in a detailed manner that makes sense. *Fuck.* I am hung up on you. The tiniest, microscopic piece of me wishes I didnt like you so I didnt spend time picking out a cute outfit even though I didnt think anything would happen other than I might impress you or even attract you but not make you say anything. I also wish I didnt hope you wouldnt invite anybody else to the movies so we could be alone, I wish I wouldnt have wanted to be close to you in the theater and instead let Eli sit in the middle, I wish I swallowed my feelings and everything would just be friendly and back to normal again. I wonder if you would ask someone at Rodriguez to homecoming and not even have a clue I was hurt because you wouldn't have a clue that I liked you. Its not your fault. Nothing is your fault. It is all my fault. I flirted with you and you reciprocated and I put my head on your shoulder and took your cold hand when you put it out and I warmed it. I made the first moves, you just reciprocated. I *need* to and *want* to stop liking people at my age. I need to simply care about school and teen stuff that has nothing to do with exploring sex or dating. I already know most of where there is to know about sex so I should just put away that knowledge. If only there was a way to put away the *feelings* though My main point I got too off-topic to express was I fell in love with you and I love you. Aghh! Ugh! I hate that I just actually watched myself put it down. I hate you no, I dont, not a chance. I dont think I could ever say that I hate such a wonderful person like you. You deserve better, I am clearly not ready to have and hold your fragile beautiful kind heart and I dont want to hurt you because I love you. I dont know if you are ready to deal with the stress of being the holder of my heart either. I am not just saying that I love you because you are a boy I fell in love with but because you are the J.P I care, so very deeply about. You are the one who is funny and just simply a joy to be around. You are real and modest. You are my friend. At the end of the day, we dont have to be a thing as long as I can cuddle with you and say I love you and be close with you. If we can be *best friends,* that will be enough for me. I will learn to make it enough for me. Maybe you arent even capable of that type of relationship or interaction and I dont expect you to be which is exactly why I wont even say to myself that it will happen. I barely believe it, I just want it. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; So just when I thought things were going well, you broke up with me. I wrote this a week ago. I basically poured my heart out, this is basically my diary... Idk why I am posting this. You didn't see this and you never will J.P. Payback is definitely a bitch I can see even though someone else broke up with me as I did with D before J.P."

Ill never let myself fully enjoy it. There are too many other females in your energy space for me right now. Besides, everytime I feel close or let myself come close, you do something that fucks me up. Last time it was miss half naked friend who needed support with her goal of being a magazine model. Good stuff. That's why I will never ever trust you with my vulnerability. Nope. You never cut me slack. You never take it easy on me. You never treat me like I feel the way I do about you because feelings are useless. Especially mine. Therefore, we do this weird damn dance and I'm rather tired of it. I'll forgive you every time but just know that with each forgiveness, comes a small step away from you.....and these past few months. I've taken a lot of steps backwards."

The timing wasnt consistent so I never knew when he would show up. I was lonely and alone with my babies for twelve to fourteen hours a day and I just wanted to be with him. I gave him all of me. I showed him inside of me even though in all our years together he never let me in. All I got for my patience and vulnerability was a broken heart. And now Ive gone and done it again. I gave my heart away too easily. I opened the door again only to face ridicule and rejection. I was just a joke to you and her and him and everyone else involved in your little game. Stupid stupid me. So now I get to process this hurt and the associated panic attacks that come with it. When you get hurt you get angry. I wish I could be angry but I dont know how to be. Ive buried my anger so deep under the teachings of forgiveness that now Im just left with this deep deep sadness that only gives way to apathy when the tears run out. I dont want you to come for me anymore. I just want to cry this out and walk away embarrassed (again) from what ever this was. I dont know if Ill recover from this. I know that sounds dramatic, even to my own ears but I dont know how to do things by halves. I either love with my whole heart or not at all. I either grieve with my whole soul or shut it off in coldness. But whatever I do I need to heal. I need to let the hurt wash over me. I thought Id cried all the tears I had over you but I guess I didnt. I held on for so long hoping you felt the same but with yesterdays realization I also realized that Id waited in vain. Yes my egos a little wounded too realizing that you were just playing with my heart but Ill get over it. I always do. If my marriage taught me anything it was how to push on in spite of the hurt. I know how to smile through the pain, another lesson from my time with him. Today Ill cry (and every day after if needed) because Im going to allow it. Im going to be soft with myself like no one else is. Im going to wrap my arms around myself and squeeze tight because I need to be alright. I have a boy who needs his momma and I need to be whole for him. Im not waiting anymore."

Youll never know.... because I wont intrude on the life youre just starting to create no matter how much I wish to reach out to you. You. I heard our song last night. I cried. A lot. You said it took you 8 years to start living again. My awareness of this, and of losing the other you unfortunately, fell on the same fateful you make me feel worthless night. You and you were shelved because some monsters beat their chest so loud one can only see the ruckus. And shortly after deciding the monster was a choice I found out about you. You were the focus of the past 9 months. And now the other you is once again. 8 years.... is that really the time it will take. I worry that you stayed in the land of nonsense for so long. Part of me enjoys the pain when it brings surges of realization.... but the strong part of me says... my time has been served. O. Yes it has you pesky spider. You are no longer welcome here. This is change and you dont like it. I am changing and you dont like it. Please abandon your attempts... or just ask you. He knows my annoyance can turn to anger. And my bite for you.... Im not sure if I care to find out. You I love you. Go be you. Go build. The best is always last. You.

Just because of the strange hours we inhabit, and the music we shared to liven these quiet hours, we got close quickly. But now, it feels like its slipping away. Its not solely your fault. We both got busy. I understand. Maybe its not your fault at allI know I can overdramatize and that the veil over my eyes betrays me. Maybe I should just have different expectations. Maybe I was too petty. It does seem so little, after all. Whats a couple unreturned texts? But youve made no other effort to reach out either. No plans or calls. No invitations. No initiative on your part these past weeks. Is it so petty for me to not want to make the first move? Would it be giving up to send this letter? To be honest, Im hurtyour apparent apathy has hurt me. Maybe Ill open up again when Im better, but these weeks I cant handle the vulnerability it takes to be a friend, when every advance is met so coldly. Maybe youre going through something yourself, but Im not in a position to help you right now, especially if you wont tell me whats wrong. We would have parted in May anyway. Many friendships end in graduation. But the inevitability doesnt make this slow burn of our friendship breaking any less bitter. I hope youre alright, friend, but for now at least, this is goodbye."

I havent seen you in four years. I texted you three years back and you did not reply. You always made me feel that I wasnt good enough, that I wasnt talented, and you took my vulnerability for granted. But I still miss you, because you taught me so much. We never ever were a thing. You never had feelings for me. But it was my favourite unrequited love to this date. The funny thing is, I thought I had forgotten how good it was for a while. Recently though, I have started missing you again and it feels like that pain will never go away. I dont think it is healthy for me to love you. Which is exactly why, I dont even want to talk you. I just want to see you. See what youre doing, see you laughing. Believe me, that is all I want. And I know this isnt good. But no one has ever made me feel this way. I dont think I will be able to handle it if you suddenly come in front of me. I dont think I will be able to speak. But at the same time, I want you to come - so that I get to know that at least you remember me. I was 18 when I fell for you. I was stupid and immature and said stupid things, but our friendship was good enough to not be ruined so easily. I dont know anymore.

You wish for me to bloom, even if it will take years. I feel you rooting for me. I feel you wishing for the most glorious flowers to erupt from my fingertips. Even as much as I want to say, no, please, pleaselove me and come back. Ill bottle the whole world up and give it to you if it means youre ready to be with me, I know the selfishness behind this. You encourage me to find myself in my younger age and I should do nothing but the same for yours. Instead, I begplease, please, find your happiness. Even it means I will never be the one that you love as much as I love you. Sincerely, E.M. [disclaimer: I am 20, we met when I was 20.]"

Other days, the hurt emerges from the background to envelope my thoughts. Perspective has only made this more difficult. Was our love too easy on me? Were the deep conversation you missed because I wasnt present for myself? Did you hurt when I practiced self love and asked for space? Were you a saint for being compassionate while I was trying to figure out my life? Was the lack of reconnection and interest after your busy period because I wasnt good enough? Answer to all of these is probably yes. The fantasy in my head that I could fix myself and be everything we needed is still there. In some ways, I think Ive exceeded what I thought I needed to learn. These thoughts, however, will kill you. The person that you have in your head is merely a fantasy. They dont exist anymore. All I can do now, is keep working on myself. To bring myself my own closure... and by becoming who I want to do, maybe, just maybe, the vulnerability can give way to joy. Whether you come back... well."

I woke to see 3 missed calls from you, around 5am. Drunk, I guessed. I called you back. 8.30am and you hadn't slept yet. You were drunk and high. I told you that you're getting too old for it. You disagreed. I said you're Peter Pan. You agreed. You said things to me, that were said to intentionally hurt me. To try to get a reaction out of me. Because you had a mate there, you were trying to impress. But I wasn't going to let you get away with it &amp; reminded you how easily I can put you in your place. When you asked me to drive 2 hours to see you, because you were drunk and high, I told you to call up one of the local girls you probably keep around. You asked me again to drive down and see you. I told you to stop wasting your money on partying and getting high, save up and move to the next state. Throughout your words, I heard snatches of the man I knew. When your ego started getting too much of the best of you, I reminded you of the thinhs you said. Of the sweet things you did. Of the promises you made. You tried to downplay these things. I brought up the dream I had about you. The one in that I attended your funeral. I asked if you remembered me telling you about it. You quietly told me you did. I got pissed at you, told you to quit the partying and getting high, or you will end up dying of an overdose and I will end up attending your funeral. You went quiet and I heard you breathe ""I know"" down the phone to me. Vulnerability shone through your voice when you asked me again, where I'm living now. I told you 6 hours away from you. I heard fragments of hurt in your voice when you asked me why I moved so far away. Wanting to hurt you back, for some of the things you said earlier, I told you ""I moved as far away from you as possible"". You went quiet. I told you ""Don't worry, I don't expect you to drive 6.5. hours to see me, since you won't even drive 2 right now"". You made some comment asking about if I'd found someone else. I told you that I had a few lined up, how it wasn't just a drought of water; young, single women were few and far between, too. You went quiet again. Annoyed at you, I told you that I'll settle down, but make sure to send you an invite to my wedding in 5 years time. You were quiet for a bit, before marking a remark that you still wanted to be in my life, even if I was getting married. When you started to get carried away with your words, trying to get a rise out of me, I reminded you of the night you told me you loved me. You tried countering it, saying that you were drunk. I reminded you that you weren't, that you were sobering up pretty quickly. You said something along the lines of ""Ok you said I said it, you want to hear it again? I'll say it. I love you"". It didn't sound sincere. It sounded like you were just saying it for the sake of it. I told you ""No, you don't. I don't think you do"". You went quiet. I don't know where this thing is headed."

I have a dark side that exudes when I bring in my stride. I see how it might rub some wrong, others right but when it concerns us, Im perfectly comfortable embracing what makes you happy, I think good of you. I love you. Youre not always very nice, you know. Maybe I cant physically embrace you vulnerability, naked, and transparent to be seen as how we truly are and thats okay. Even if we never get to, I think youve shown me Im ready to embrace it with someone. With more people and in beautiful forms. With you, it may never be possible but when it finds me, well know if it was ever meant to be. It might even be better. But I surrender. The day is coming.

What you did last time was selfish and assholish. Much as my brain hesitates, I really do forgive you; not that I've forgotten about that night, but that I really have nothing to feel towards it. My non-ability to hold any type of emotions has always been a sort of vulnerability. Is it being selfish on my part to enjoy being leaned on? That for once, I'm not the wrecked and problematic one. I know what you're going through. Or part of it, at least. I would never wish upon my worst enemies this disability. I am your depression friend. I'll just be here when it's really bad."

Instead, I offer you mine. A celestial kaleidoscope of colors and forgiveness; the emerald stars in my eyes laid out a map of cosmic love to help you find your way to me. And you did. Three fucking times. With nothing more than whispers in the dark to lead you home. The truth is stranger than all my dreams. Philophobia sent you floundering off the path, which in turn left me in a pool of apprehension, rippling the seemingly serene waters of my subconscious into a tidal wave that crashes down on me again, and again, and again. For is that not why you retreated all those weeks ago? You were starting to fall for me, and you got scared. Im still not sure if you were just a shadow sent to torment me with amorally amorous false promises, or if there was ever something extraordinarily real between us. Desires dreamt into life which have the power to put aside past pains if you let them. But even that frightens you. It occurred to me later that perhaps it was so easy to let me walk away because that is what you have come to expect. That your heart is often abandoned because few actually speak your language. And the ones that do (hello) cant offer the patience a skittish heart like yours requires. Im telling you I can. I just made a mistake. Or rather a couple of them. But so did you. I left you in the doorway before we settled upon a rendezvous. I will spend the next lifetime or several trying to atone for that. Dont forget though, that you fled into the darkness of the woods, letting me to think youd return once the torn torpor of your psyche had healed. That we didnt have to leave things in such a beautifully extravagant mess. Yet that wasnt really the truth, was it? Here I was, lost in my own metaphysical flaggulation, rehashing what I might have done wrong, what I could have said to make you feel safer and wanted. That if I sent enough positivity, enough light and healing your way, that maybe youd forgive my transgression and come back to me, despite my tumble being a result of your misstep off the path to begin with. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, after all. The seeming actuality is that you were just ready for the next connection to feed off. Besotted with one person whilst searching for another. Again and again. Lining up the next vulnerable, hopeful woman to make her fall in love with you why? Because you enjoy breaking hearts? I dont believe that, though the thought has entered my mind, at times. Rather I think its that you are so afraid. Not of me, because I dont mean you any harm. I wish you happiness and healing even if its without me. I think you fear love so much because then youd have to be vulnerable. You are terrified that someone could love you for all those broken pieces. You fear the vulnerability, because in letting love in youre also allowing someone the potential to really, truly hurt you. But what if for a moment you let yourself believe I wouldnt intentionally do that to you. To promise I would never hurt you would be a fallacy, as weve both hurt each other already and surely will again. Instead, I offer you the strength in vulnerability. The hubris of trust, loyalty and understanding. The humility of thoughtfulness and love. In learning to live with honesty and earnestness of vulnerability, youll stop solitarily slinking away into the forest to lick the wounds you helped create. And if you cant find the courage to do that, then let this be the moment of surrender. Surrender to the one who is offering to hold you; to help you repair those fragmented lines and soothe the scars suffered by the slings and arrows mere mortals have thrown at you your entire life (I can only imagine, but I think weve been through similar trials). Even though you will struggle to believe that, maybe Ill surprise you instead of disappoint you. You obviously want love, or something resembling it, or else you wouldnt keep looking for it. Yet you you keep pedalling backwards, alone, to re-live the stories you know with new people. Its safer that way. Comfortable. Ive been here from the very beginning, actually trying to help you, even if I wasnt who you thought I was for the last several weeks. Which, I realize reeks of noxious neurosis. My defense being that those who have gone mad will justify their actions as rational. I knew I had become unhinged, for I am hurt. A beautiful spectre slashed at the fragile dreams in my heart. So I think I am justified in being hurt. My intention was not to wound you in return; not to harbor a grudge or entwine embittered roots around my broken heart. I sought to do one of two things. One, to calmly climb the ladder to the oubliette of truth; to end my suffering by gaining an understanding of your callousness and cowardice. Or two, to open the pandorica of your genius mind from the inside out. Planting seeds of morality and allegories on the parallelity of pain. All in the hope of amends. Manipulative? Maybe. But no more than you manipulated me. Neither one of us is more wrong or more right in this tale of Shakespearean noir; is this to be a comedy, tragedy, or an unfinished work? Can two wrongs make a right in this truth is stranger than fiction narrative? Arent you the one who wants to live a life more extraordinary than those we dream? Here it is. Stop hiding behind virtual walls; stories left like crumbs in cyberspace. Rehashing the same digital dreams with each new nymph you seek to possess; the delight in discovering someone new. Yet once their affections are returned, fearfully you flee, deep into the forests of your heart. Tis better to become the one that hurts by haunting, instead of daring to be vulnerable. So make a choice. Continue the choice of nothing. Dismiss me, treat me like I am nothing and not worthy of knowing what happened. Wouldnt want you being uncomfortable for a few minutes, would we? Better to save your discomfort and let your conquest fester in the grief of ambiguity for weeks while you vanish into the safety of scarred dimensions. Thats the easier choice, hey? Continue the choice of the cowardly, the cold, the cruel. I didnt take you for any of those things, and yet your actions have yet to match your words, so this is the impression I am left with. Or, you could release me from this darkness. The two of us heal, move on separately; taking these lessons in love and both of us be gentler with the next ones who cross our paths. Or rather still, choose to believe everything Im about to tell you is real. That I choose to love you (because love is, at least partially, an active choice) for all the broken pieces and fragmented lines, the ones I know and the ones yet to be discovered. Love isnt perfect. It is messy and complicated, and we will both make mistakes beyond those we already have (for both of us have things to atone for). Love has to be made and remade all the time. We strive to accept our love for who they are in each passing moment and the moments yet to come. And sometimes those we love may bring us pain, but we choose to go on loving them anyway. Stop rotting inside your labyrinth of insecurities and self doubt. Mazes arent games; they are puzzles. This has never been something as trivial as a game, at least not for me. Im not sure what youve been playing at. Games are one side against another: a winner and a loser. Puzzles, on the other hand, dont have losers. You either solve the puzzle, or you remain stuck in the deja vu of the spiraling nexus. Im asking you to escape the limits of your own thinking trapped inside the labyrinth of your psyche. To fight against your tempestuous nature. Bonds that go nowhere through parroted philosophies and mirrored moralities will keep you in a loop of frivolous, meaningless connections that will never ascend to the next echelon. Instead, believe the lampstands at my side are real and not merely will-othe-wisps in the desert after midnight, mirages before the flood. Accept the olive branch from this winged dove, and believe that she will climb crumbling towers, swim across fiery rivers, and wander through the levels of the underworld to pull you from the buried earth, no matter what it takes. Only when the sun stops waking up over the fields, when the mountains blow in the wind like dust, when each star in the sky has gone cold. Only then will I stop fighting for you. But only if you want it. Only if you choose to believe it. Without it, these words will be returned to the earth like ash to dust. Stop being a coward. Make your choice."
358,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,To a friend of mine,3,cor9id,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/cor9id/to_a_friend_of_mine/,2019-08-11 12:31:50,"Hey zz, hope youre getting by, I know the whole having strangers in your house all the time because parents is less than ideal. Just wanna thank you for something you did for me a little while back, its really not a big deal, and you wouldnt have guessed it had this big of an effect on me, but it did. You know how weird I used to get when you suggested I sit on your lap on the couch when there was no room anywhere else? I would always refuse and just be really weird about it. I did that stuff for a really stupid reason, one that Im glad doesnt affect me (as much) anymore. Basically Ive always kinda struggled with being vulnerable and how it affects my perceived masculinity; its not uncommon for guys to be like this, toxic masculinity and all of that bullshit is a real big issue for a lot of guys, even ones who werent very skinny and sensitive, and surrounded by people who wouldnt let them forget it. But that whole mess of biases and perceived needs to be strong and dominant put me in a really weird situation when you said that. I thought that I couldnt do that without sacrificing some of my thin veneer of masculine dominance (yeah I was an idiot) by sitting on your lap instead of the other way around; so I didnt. But eventually after this sort of thing happening way too many times, I caved and sat down, you just kinda put your arms around me, and it felt really nice. Now Id already done a bit of platonic cuddling with people in our friend group (Emma just kinda locked herself onto me for like a week), but this was different; in previous situations I was always in the sort of protector position, they were the ones under my arm; but in this case I was the one who was in the more vulnerable position, and it felt nice. I let myself just kinda sink into that moment, it was short, but I can still remember exactly how it made my feel. I felt safe, and protected for once, like I could be vulnerable, or even weak with you in that moment. You have no idea how much that means to me. Id always had the idea that I had to eliminate my weakness, and hide my vulnerability if I was to be respected or loved, I was a man after all. But none of that mattered then, I gave in to my vulnerability, and you held me. After that I realized that I didnt need to make myself stronger for the people who made fun of me for being weak, I just needed to find people who wouldnt judge me for my weakness, and that has helped me a whole lot. I wouldnt have come to that realization without you; and all things considered, me realizing this has made my feelings for you make a lot more sense, even if I still hate that I have them. So thanks for that zz, I hope nothing gets weird between us cause of the whole liking you thing, Ive become accustomed to having a shit ton of fun every time we hang out, and dont want to lose that anytime soon. With love, your friend."

I dont know how to say this, and Ive been tossing it around in my head for a long time now. You are with someone who was dangerous to me, and might be dangerous to you. I have so many concerns, but I dont know if I can voice them to you. After all, who am I to you? Other than what he told you. Perhaps he told you that I am crazy. That I used him for money. That I never loved him. That I forced him into sexual activity, just the way his other exes did. Or.... did he tell you the truth? I think it is weird that our names are similar, and he gave you the same nickname he gave me. And we look so similar. And our hair, if mine were still long as it was when I was with him, would be the same. I dont know how you stayed, and I dont know what he did to cause you to fall for him. But I only can imagine how it was with me. Where he gained my trust very fast, and held me in conversation for hours, playing on my insecurities, that he was the only one who was interested in me. Sending gifts. And telling me that he had visions from God about us together, years and years before. Convincing me that because we were meant for each other, we should blend our finances. Its our money, not mine or yours. And replacing my last name with his because he liked his better and I needed to get used to it Things that were mine were ours, and things that were his remained his. As if I wasnt allowed to have my own things. My own friends. He tried to forcing me into marriage. We broke up 8 months into the relationship. And you know what? You got engaged by the time you were in an 8 month relationship. Have you ever heard of the child grooming process? I hadnt until after our relationship. But I realized so quickly why it was familiar, and it was because of him. Thats what he used. 1. Targeting the victim Offender sizes up victim for emotional neediness and the vulnerability, low self confidence or esteem, and isolation. 2. Gaining the victim's trust The sex offender gains trust by watching and gathering information about the child, getting to know his needs and how to fill them. In this regard, sex offenders mix effortlessly with responsible caretakers because they generate warm and calibrated attention. 3. Filling a need Once the sex offender begins to fill the child's needs, that adult may assume noticeably more importance in the child's life and may become idealized. Gifts, extra attention, affection. 4. Isolating the child The grooming sex offender uses the developing special relationship with the child to create situations in which they are alone together. This isolation further reinforces a special connection. Stage 5: Sexualizing the relationship At a stage of sufficient emotional dependence and trust, the offender progressively sexualizes the relationship. Desensitization occurs through talking, pictures, even creating situations (like going swimming) in which both offender and victim are naked. Stage 6: Maintaining control Once the sex abuse is occurring, offenders commonly use secrecy and blame to maintain the child's continued participation and silence Did he tell you about the time he was touching my chest while I slept? I woke up to it, but I was so defeated by him that I went back to sleep. Or about the time when he would take his erect penis out of his pants and stick it in my face? Or would touch me sexually and when I would express that I didnt want to, he got angry at me. And when I complied and would try to explain later that I didnt want us to be sexual, he told me it was my fault for being so sexy. I recently learned that if a child was sexually assaulted, they may start wetting the bed. And that explained why I began to wet the bed at a 19 year old. If this struck anything with you, get out immediately."

You swooped in to save me at my weakest moment and created a haven for me to hide from my world as it shattered around me, but part of the fun for you had to be throwing your own blows at my fragile state of mind. I cant imagine any other explanation beyond the fact that you are sick and need help. Your ex said you gas lit her and you convinced me she was crazy. What a sign! My best friends used to ask me why I kept seeing you when we fought so often, and I said we only argued because we were both smart and opinionated, passionate about our ideas as if we were arguing over politics or what to watch on tv. In reality, you are selfish and callous and only pretended to consider my feelings when you wanted something from me, and couldnt even acknowledge that I was upset when I finally called you out for your latest fuck boy escapades, only scrambling to defend yourself and deflect blame. You asked me what I would do if you were to start seeing somebody else instead of finally locking me down after months of playing games. 57 days later, you made sure to tell me in the cruelest way possible that you and I were over for good. I mean, seriously, you *laughed at me.* I know now what Id do. Id panic, Id tell you I loved you for the first time and then run, blocking you on everything I could think of. Id lose 15 pounds in 3 days, not being able to hold down food. Id feel like the world was ripped out from under my feet, like the person who framed himself as my biggest supporter, a safe place for me to get away from the violence at home, no matter what happened romantically between us, flipped the script entirely, and threw me away like trash for a chance at Emily Tinder 4. But then Id get better. Id cry, for the first time since I told you about my childhood. Id see an old friend, and fall asleep in his arms without worrying if he was going to mock me for my vulnerability later. Id move on, just like it took you no time at all to do and no time at all to tell me. And Id finally realize, after all of this emotional manipulation and frustration, that I dont love you anymore. I did, for so long. I gave you everything I could think of when I had nothing. But now? I. Dont. Love. You. I said it, I lied, I take it back. I dont love you anymore. And if youre searching my Reddit profile again after Ive blocked you AGAIN, I dont want to hear from you anymore. Carry on with Emily Tinder 4.

You might find this. You might not. I'm not taking the 3 mins making a throwaway to secretly write it haha. I still feel bad for embarrassing you. I know you said it was okay, but I do. I'm happy you told me. I'm way too anxious about you not messaging me back on my dumb joke. It's not like we have to talk everyday. It's just that I've got used to it. You're one of my best friends. I know I've said that and you know, but I don't let most people in like that. I really didn't expect that we'd get close when we met. Don't get me wrong, you were interesting and kind enough, but I'm older than you and we only met because I was dating your friend and idk if we'd have ever have talked or had anything in common outside of him. I married him and he's amazing and perfect for me and not only because he puts up with all my weird shit haha. I kind of said ""we're friends now"" and kept you in the process. Idk why you and not robin or something. Maybe I didn't really want to 'peer into his soul' for lack of a better phrase like I did yours, or pifs. Haha I'm weirdly extra anxious this week and worried that I'm going to do something to fuck up being friends, embarrass you further, or you'll just decide that it's not worth putting up with me. I've made so many things weird that didn't have to be. I'm not even sure if you'd use the term ""weird"", maybe just ""interesting"", but you're nice like that. I'm terrible with people. It's extra hard to read you because you're so introverted and not very expressive. I just never really know. I wouldn't invade on your privacy or break the non aggression principal, but sometimes I wish I could read your mind (consentualy) lol so I'd know what you actually think about basically anything you'd let me. I wasn't joking about wanting to take weird truth serium and laugh on a disgusting bathroom floor with you and run away from Russians. I just need a White Court Vampire to come regulate my anxiety. I'm fine with that over a dog. I'm not sending this directly to you because I've already been weirder about literally everything than I should have been. I miss when we used to just joke about everything before I had to go and get to know you deeper and push for a closer friendship and make everything weird or maybe weird? I don't really know to be honest. I could ask but I'd rather not ask again. From now on, I don't think I'm letting anyone in like I did with you. I hate the vulnerability. Massively. It's the worst. That feels so one sided and really it's just myself I can blame for it. Idk if I'm ever going to be less self conscious when I'm vulnerable, probably not. I know it's not your fault for this. You didn't ask for it. You were content with distance and not talking often and occasionally discussing interesting topics, articles, or stupid funny things in passing. I wish I would have been. If so I wouldn't be where I am now wishing white court vampires not only existed, but that one would ""befriend"" me, ""adopt"" me? Fix me. The fact that I'd want that probably means I have much shittier boundaries than I thought and I'm sorry that you were burned by my lack of boundaries. I'm really sorry, at least to myself. I really have no idea if you're even aware of this shit fully and even if you do, it's my responsibility not yours so idk. I just had to get it off my chest. If you stumble across how to fix adhd people's broken emotional regulation, impulse control, or whatever while looking at bacteria in a lab I guess let me know? And as always if it's too much for you, you want out, or just dislike my (apparently lacking) boundaries, I get it. It would suck but I'd get it. I wouldn't blame you or see it as your responsibility. I'd be embarrassed if you told everyone I was basically crazy underneath it all though lol but that's just my vanity. I never expected friendships to be so much more difficult than literally being married, but they are to me. Maybe it's because I trust that I'm not going to push him too far away and he's consistently open and honest with me? Idk. Friendships have less ""rules"" or ""structure"" or something and that makes less sense. Establishing trust in friendships is exhausting. Why can't people just jump in 12 years into knowing each other? --human that's probably being way too clingy and annoying and isn't usually like that.

It's really long - sorry - and it may have a multitude of errors and/or logical/narrative holes - sorry again\* \*9:51am:\* I woke up this morning, and my mind was all a blur. You see, even after the moment we broke up, even after you cut me off from your life until you can see me face-to-face, I hadn't had a serious physical response until today. I spend this morning, leaning over a toilet at 5am, dry-heaving the dinner I didn't eat last night. Why? I swear I spent half of the morning sifting through my thoughts, even posting about it on reddit. But it just occurred to me, at 11:43 am, that I have an internal turmoil, not external (i.e. you), that is causing me this pain. But now I have to go to the gym, so I'll leave this post as a draft for later. \*2:32 pm:\* Maybe it's not just internal (?). I have written to you, read your reddit, reread your notes in my phone, rereread your messages to me, and there are moments when I feel at ease - I have this feeling that the woman I came to love might actually come back to me. But you won't, will you. And I think the rational side of me knows this. I guess that defines an internal struggle then, right? My irrational side of me feels like you're just a conversation away from running into my arms, while my rational side feels like you're already so far gone, that there is no bridge left for us. Perhaps these two extremes are trying to find equilibrium and I am still searching for it. But now I have to go and take my sister to her gymnastics class... Maybe I'll go to the music store nearby and get a case for all my records. \*1:12 pm:\* I'm in the music store. I'm sick because this is where I bought your birthday present. How could I have been so stupid and overlook that? At least they have a vinyl case. \*2:59 pm:\* Well, I'm finally done packing. Your shirt you gave me to wear over this summer to remember when we slept together and cuddled was the most heartbreaking thing to fold and put away. I haven't worn it since we broke up. I think I'm going to spend the next hour composing my thoughts like I told the one guy on reddit on my \*offmychest\* post. \*5:34 pm:\* It's time for this (late) cathartic letter to you. I think it's going to be the best way to formulate my thoughts. Please know that whatever happens, this probably reflects my truest feelings and struggles. I know you follow this subreddit and you know my username. I don't know if you will see this before I see you in person. If you don't, I think I'll tell you to read it. \[Martha\] My Dear, I think I know why I hurt so much, and why my stomach felt inside out this morning. My love for you is irrational - and not in the sense that all love is roughly irrational. I have this unending drive to keep you in my life. And I managed to figure out why. Of all the hook-ups I've had, all the 'girlfriends' before you, all the rejected girls who asked me out, all the female friends I have, all the girls I've crushed on, you were the only one who made me happy in a way I've never felt before. From the moment I heard you laugh in the dorm lounge the day we met, I knew you were someone special. You talked so eloquently. You had this crude humor sort of quirk mixed in. You genuinely seemed interested in getting to develop and emotionally intimate relationship with people. You were gorgeous too. And all that together really turned me on. That really got me eager to get to know you. To get to know who \[Martha Eleanor Rigby\] really was. So I ran back to my room; I got the interesting and conversationally relevant debate file out; I focused on only you. And when you looked at me that night - you know, the one where we stayed up to 7:41am - I felt so special. You called me cute. You dug your head into the couch but swept off my feet. This queen that I happened to be living next to was into me too. I got butterflies like I've never had before. I remember touching your cheek that night (morning) and going off to my room. I was overjoyed. But the other guys in the dorm were eyeing you, but only for your physical beauty. I knew I had to act fast, but not be too fast. So one day, I took you to that sub place. Every girl in the hall really though I was taking you on an official date. The girls who lived next door to you were telling me what to wear, before they even knew where we were going. So we went and ate a delicious sub at their closing time. And as we walked back to the dorm, you told me you wanted to just walk and talk. Score! But you were feeling a little sick, so we sat down. And we talked for an hour about the nature of dating. How you werent ready for a relationship and didnt know if you wanted to date in college. But suddenly you leaned in for a kiss. And I hesitated. I pulled away. And I remember coming up with a lie to preserve that friendship stage you wanted to have before dating. But we kissed anyways afterwards. But you didnt want to date still? We walked somewhere else on campus and then u asked me to ask you a question. Was this it? Was I supposed to ask you out here? So I did. And you said yes! And then your best friend called. It was perfect timing. And you excitedly told her all about what just happened. So we walked back and we were officially a couple! I was so happy I almost couldnt sleep. But then you came to me the very next day and told me you felt like it was a mistake. And to just stay friends. I was so sad, but I knew it might have been fast. So I was okay and accepting. I was okay just staying friends because I held onto a hope that at some point we would come together when the time was right. This may have been the first time I considered myself enamored by you. It was the irrational attraction to you that made me say I was okay being friends. And to my surprise, you came to me only a few weeks later and asked to cuddle with me. I was \*so\* hesitant. But you insisted. In your crop top and jean shorts. And you were the little spoon. I was so embarrassed when I got an erection, but you said you were flattered. I was speechless and in love. And over the next few weeks, we slept together. And you progressively got more sexual even though we couldnt date. You gave me a great birthday present and by that point you were already reeling me in. How could I get away from you? We had so many intellectual similarities, political agreements, philosophical discussions, and emotional openness to each other. It was falling together perfect for us. It was this quick attraction we both couldnt ignore. But at one point I was upset. I was feeling empty in my heart and I didnt want you to just be a friends with benefits. And you noticed. You asked me what was wrong and I said, I just feel like Im missing something in my life. You angrily put me off saying you didnt want to date. I was hurt again by you, but held onto this irrational hope. And so, by the end of the month, we began dating officially. Finally, I began to feel fulfilled... but well get to that later. \*I dont think going moment by moment is important anymore - we had a lot of very special moments I remember fondly - but these are the moments where I would call my love for you nigh irrational. \* Anyways, a couple weeks later you broke how with me. But you cried and cried about it that day. On the next day, you came to me and told me about the fuck-faced Siberian who coerced you into kissing him. I felt that, as the situation was described plus what I was able to ascertain of that child, he preyed on a weakness I knew you had. So I forgave you. And by the end of the day, after you were crying all day, you talked to me and we got started again. I felt we were on stronger footing than we ever were. Maybe this was yet another moment when I should have let you go, but instead was so taken by you that I wouldnt leave. And again. Near the end of this year, you almost broke up with me. You were doubting about this summer. You were at one of your lows. And it was something going on that I couldnt remedy. But I was hurting too. We walked that downtown park and we barely talked. It was awful. But finally, we moved past it. We were able to see where the other was struggling. We moved past. But was me trying to work with your own fickle nature and understand your struggle also another moment of irrational love? But over the rest of the year and summer we grew together emotionally. That one night I was in San Francisco, we talked all night about how we felt we were so ready to see each other and how we had grown together emotionally. Your birthday was a week away, and I was about to drive 6 hours to see you. We spent 5 days together, living in a hotel room just like when we were dorming on the same floor. But what really got me was when you rushed into my arms the moment you saw me. Maybe my irrational love for you wasnt so irrational or at least not one-way. \*How we could go from that to breaking-up not five days later I will never know.\* And that's why I know what I need to say now. I devoted myself to you. I loved you so very much - maybe too much. But I didn't smother you in it; I gave you all the space you asked for and then some. \*6:51 pm:\* At this point I can't figure out how to word what I need to say. But here goes the best I can: I can't let you go because you fulfilled me in a way that no one else could Over the time we spent together, you showed me a way to value myself like I never had been able to before. I was the happiest I've ever been. You were closer to me than the closest friends I've remained with for \*nearly a decade\*. I have always been a cold and calculated individual; but when I interacted with you, I felt like a warmer, spontaneous person. And I loved it. You were in a niche in my soul that felt carved out for you. Those talks of seeing a future didn't fall on deaf ears. You are the only person I've ever met that I could see that. And you know that with the cold, calculated, introverted, pessimistic personality, I am very picky with who I am with. So for you to have that effect on me made me very vulnerable to you. But, regardless of how submissive I was to you - see my power paradox post if you're confused - I now will take the stance I need to: When you realize the mistake you've made, I won't just fall into your arms the way I want to - and believe me I desperately want to. I feel so undervalued and lied to. I feel used and neglected. I feel that I was overlooked. I feel you were impulsive, but won't reconsider. So if you truly mean that you 'can see a future together', then you need to show me again that you are committed to me. That you meant it when you said you loved me. Because at this point, I'm waking up sick because I feel neglected, but despite that neglect I want you still. Because even if the love I was shown was a a web of lies, I loved living in that web of lies. I felt so amazing. You felt so amazing. I really saw a future. As Bryan Adams song \*If you love a woman\* says, I could see our unborn children in your eyes - remember Olivia? Maybe I was naive and overly committed to you - deluding myself to believing you to be potentially my soul mate. You, even in all this pain you caused me, will be unforgettable: No one can replace your smile. No one can replace your voice when you sang. No one can replace the sound of your heartbeat when I lay my head on your breast. No one can replace the way you held me when you wanted to be the big spoon. No one can replace the way you wrote poetry. No one can replace the adventurousness that you had. No one can replace the analytical way you approached things. No one can replace the vulnerability you showed me. No one can replace the hair I ran my hands through. No one can replace the name 'kitten.' No one can replace your enthusiasm to try debate with me as your coach. No one can replace the warmth of your hug. No one can replace your little quirks, like how you'd play with your glasses sometimes. No one can replace your love of reading obscure academic literature for fun. No one can replace your enthusiasm for trying and learning some the things I was into. No one can replace the way you always had gum in your mouth - even when you were eating a meal, drinking a drink, sleeping, or literally anything. No one can replace the way you talked about how special I made you feel. No one can replace you. I hope that I leave a lasting impression on your life - something to remind you of how much I really did love you while we were together. I hope debate works out - I told that girl you were 'jealous about' to make sure to help you out, since I won't be able to anymore. I hope you figure out what you're going to major in - Business, PPL, English, or something else since you're so adventurous and unsure. I hope you enjoy the woman you have become with my help - something you always said you were grateful for. Soon, we will meet every Monday for a club I joined because of you. Soon, we will run into each other at the gym you got me into. Soon, we will pass by each other in the dinning hall that we planned so many lunch dates for - to compensate for no longer living next to each other. Soon, we will be drinking coffee at the depot or eating at the floor of the residential center you will live in. Soon, I may become a ghost to you. You blocked me from all your social media and texting. I don't even know if you even will talk to me in person like you said you would. I know me getting drunk and putting you through an emotional rollercoaster was wrong, but thats just a taste of the turmoil I've felt because of you. The break-up was so messy. Everyday, I question if there was something I could have done to avoid this. If there was a way for me to take back anything I said while angry about the break up or my perceived ignoring of my love letter to you. If we ever get back to talking to rebuild a friendship like you wanted, just know that my romantic feelings will be there. My desire to have you again. And maybe I'm sick because I don't want to be friends with you. And that's one of the most painful possibilities that is quite possibly realistic. I felt so neglected coming out of such a messy break up that maybe my body is fighting against my heart - my irrational love of you pushing through the destroyed friendship you left me with. Everyone I've asked for advice thinks that there is nothing special enough about someone to be like this - that you shouldn't be worth my time. That you have burnt a bridge with me and I'm desperately clinging to the last log that built it. I loved you kitten. And I know that the log you cling to is that you wanted a platonic love to still exist. You cried the first time I used love in the past tense. But I always told you that love, for me to say it to someone, requires reciprocity. In the moments of weakness for you and the some time since the break up, I believed in the reciprocity when it faltered. But now, after writing this, I realized that i had an irrational devotion to you. I called it love because you gave so much to me in return and it helped me become the man I am today. But now I question if any of what you did was real. \*Did you really love me?\* Forever yours - even when I'm 64, \[Paul\]"

But contrary to what my arrogance created me to be, I submitted myself to you. It was such a refreshing and authentic feeling to submissively and vulnerably love you the way I did. It was a way of giving myself to you in a way I could never give myself to anyone else. I deified you. You were the royalty who married the peasant. You were the untouchable goddess whom I wanted to sit with in heaven. Contrary to all the power I seek to maintain in my everyday life, I gave up myself to you. But now it feels like I lacked enough power to grasp you as you walked away. I could give anything to have those last few moments back. Those rage filled comments that drove us apart that morning. Those drunk and jealous texts that caused you to shut me out for good. Those cold hearted looks into your crying eyes when you told me you had to do this.

But now I question if any of what you did was real. *Did you really love me?* Forever yours - even when I'm 64, \[Paul\] P.S. *I hope I didn't forget anything baby. There was so much to say and remember, but so little mental stability to get it all out the right way. Ultimately, whatever is said in person should be valued. But this is still a piece of my failing mind.*"

I made a few mistakes in the original, so I am fixing those errors. And, of course, I'm going to add more content too. Sorry to anyone (like 2 people) who reads this twice as a result. Also, I am putting times because I would have sent these each as individual letters, but decided to make it all one. It's still really long - sorry - and it still may have a multitude of errors and/or logical/narrative holes - sorry again.* *9:51am:* I woke up this morning, and my mind was all a blur. You see, even after the moment we broke up, even after you cut me off from your life until you can see me face-to-face, I hadn't had a serious physical response until today. I spend this morning, leaning over a toilet at 5am, dry-heaving the dinner I didn't eat last night. Why? I swear I spent half of the morning sifting through my thoughts, even posting about it on reddit. But it just occurred to me, at 11:43 am, that I have an internal turmoil, not external (i.e. you), that is causing me this pain. But now I have to go to the gym, so I'll leave this post as a draft for later. *2:32 pm:* Maybe it's not just internal (?). I have written to you, read your reddit, reread your notes in my phone, rereread your messages to me, and there are moments when I feel at ease - I have this feeling that the woman I came to love might actually come back to me. But you won't, will you. And I think the rational side of me knows this. I guess that defines an internal struggle then, right? My irrational side of me feels like you're just a conversation away from running into my arms, while my rational side feels like you're already so far gone, that there is no bridge left for us. Perhaps these two extremes are trying to find equilibrium and I am still searching for it. And I don't think I'm going to figure it out soon. You leave the photos of us on your social media. You still have a status of being in a relationship. I think that hurts too. That you haven't actually just moved on, even though you say you have. But now I have to go and take my sister to her gymnastics class... Maybe I'll go to the music store nearby and get a case for all my records. *1:12 pm:* I'm in the music store. I'm sick because this is where I bought your birthday present. How could I have been so stupid and overlook that? At least they have a vinyl case. *2:59 pm:* Well, I'm finally done packing. Your shirt you gave me to wear over this summer to remember when we slept together and cuddled was the most heartbreaking thing to fold and put away. I haven't worn it since we broke up. I think I'm going to spend the next hour composing my thoughts like I told the one guy on reddit on my *offmychest* post. *5:34 pm:* It's time for this letter to you. I think it's going to be the best way to formulate my thoughts and it may finally be that cathartic experience I need. I know you follow this subreddit and you know my username. I don't know if you will see this before I see you in person. If you don't, I think I'll tell you to read it. \[Martha\] My Dear, I think I know why I hurt so much, and why my stomach felt inside out this morning. My love for you is irrational - and not in the sense that all love is roughly irrational. I have this unending drive to keep you in my life. And I managed to figure out why. Of all the hook-ups I've had, all the 'girlfriends' before you, all the rejected girls who asked me out, all the female friends I have, all the girls I've crushed on, you were the only one who made me happy in a way I've never felt before. From the moment I heard you laugh in the dorm lounge the day we met, I knew you were someone special. You talked so eloquently. You had this crude humor sort of quirk mixed in. You genuinely seemed interested in getting to develop and emotionally intimate relationship with people. You were gorgeous too. And all that together really turned me on. That really got me eager to get to know you. To get to know who \[Martha Eleanor Rigby\] really was. So I ran back to my room; I got the interesting and conversationally relevant debate file out; I focused on only you. And when you looked at me that night - you know, the one where we stayed up to 7:41am - I felt so special. You called me cute. You dug your head into the couch but swept off my feet. This queen that I happened to be living next to was into me too. I got butterflies like I've never had before. I remember touching your cheek that night (morning) and going off to my room. I was overjoyed. But the other guys in the dorm were eyeing you, but only for your physical beauty. I knew I had to act fast, but not be too fast. So one day, I took you to that sub place. Every girl in the hall really though I was taking you on an official date. The girls who lived next door to you were telling me what to wear, before they even knew where we were going. So we went and ate a delicious sub at their closing time. And as we walked back to the dorm, you told me you wanted to just walk and talk. Score! But you were feeling a little sick, so we sat down. And we talked for an hour about the nature of dating. How you werent ready for a relationship and didnt know if you wanted to date in college. But suddenly you leaned in for a kiss. And I hesitated. I pulled away. And I remember coming up with a lie to preserve that friendship stage you wanted to have before dating. But we kissed anyways afterwards. But you didnt want to date still? We walked somewhere else on campus and then u asked me to ask you a question. Was this it? Was I supposed to ask you out here? So I did. And you said yes! And then your best friend called. It was perfect timing. And you excitedly told her all about what just happened. So we walked back and we were officially a couple! I was so happy I almost couldnt sleep. But then you came to me the very next day and told me you felt like it was a mistake. And to just stay friends. I was so sad, but I knew it might have been fast. So I was okay and accepting. I was okay just staying friends because I held onto a hope that at some point we would come together when the time was right. This may have been the first time I considered myself enamored by you. It was the irrational attraction to you that made me say I was okay being friends. And to my surprise, you came to me only a few weeks later and asked to cuddle with me. I was *so* hesitant. But you insisted. In your crop top and jean shorts. And you were the little spoon. I was so embarrassed when I got an erection, but you said you were flattered. I was speechless and in love. And over the next few weeks, we slept together. And you progressively got more sexual even though we couldnt date. You gave me a great birthday present and by that point you were already reeling me in. How could I get away from you? We had so many intellectual similarities, political agreements, philosophical discussions, and emotional openness to each other. It was falling together perfect for us. It was this quick attraction we both couldnt ignore. But at one point I was upset. I was feeling empty in my heart and I didnt want you to just be a friends with benefits. And you noticed. You asked me what was wrong and I said, I just feel like Im missing something in my life. You angrily put me off saying you didnt want to date. I was hurt again by you, but held onto this irrational hope. And so, by the end of the month, we began dating officially. Finally, I began to feel fulfilled... but well get to that later. *I dont think going moment by moment is important anymore - we had a lot of very special moments I remember fondly - but these are the moments where I would call my love for you nigh irrational.* Anyways, a couple weeks later you broke up with me. But you cried and cried about it that day. On the next day, you came to me and told me about the fuck-faced Siberian who coerced you into kissing him. I felt that, as the situation was described plus what I was able to ascertain of that child, he preyed on a weakness I knew you had. So I forgave you. And by the end of the day, after you were crying all day, you talked to me and we got started again. I felt we were on stronger footing than we ever were. Maybe this was yet another moment when I should have let you go, but instead was so taken by you that I wouldnt leave. And again. Near the end of this year, you almost broke up with me. You were doubting about this summer. You were at one of your lows. And it was something going on that I couldnt remedy. But I was hurting too. We walked that downtown park and we barely talked. It was awful. But finally, we moved past it. We were able to see where the other was struggling. We moved past. But was me trying to work with your own fickle nature and understand your struggle also another moment of irrational love? But over the rest of the year and summer we grew together emotionally. That one night I was in San Francisco, we talked all night about how we felt we were so ready to see each other and how we had grown together emotionally. Your birthday was a week away, and I was about to drive 6 hours to see you. We spent 5 days together, living in a hotel room just like when we were dorming on the same floor. But what really got me was when you rushed into my arms the moment you saw me. Maybe my irrational love for you wasnt so irrational or at least not one-way. *How we could go from that to breaking-up not five days later I will never know.* *6:51 pm:* At this point I can't figure out how to word what I need to say. But here goes the best I can: I'm so confused. I devoted myself to you. I loved you so very much - maybe too much. But I didn't smother you in it; I gave you all the space you asked for and then some. I find myself willing to do anything for you. I find myself willing to forgive any pain you've caused me - and you know I'm someone who holds a grudge. Why? Why am I so hopelessly devoted to you? Why have you impacted me in a way where I am at a point where I would give most anything to you? My closest friends were surprised to learn what I've waited for you for. What I've been patient with you with - both physically and emotionally. They'd rather see me be a hedonist than to totally find myself attracted to you. To an outsider, you are just some girl on the walk of life. To me, you were someone I saw in my future. I can't let you go because you fulfilled me in a way that no one else could. Over the time we spent together, you showed me a way to value myself like I never had been able to before. I was the happiest I've ever been. You were closer to me than the closest friends I've remained with for *nearly a decade*. I have always been a cold and calculated individual; but when I interacted with you, I felt like a warmer, spontaneous person. And I loved it. You were in a niche in my soul that felt carved out for you. Those talks of seeing a future didn't fall on deaf ears. You are the only person I've ever met that I could see that. And you know that with the cold, calculated, introverted, pessimistic personality, I am very picky with who I am with. So for you to have that effect on me made me very vulnerable to you. I don't think you ever really noticed. Then again, I don't think you'd believe that it happened this way.I had a strong ego. I was pretty arrogant. I 'intimidated' you (in your words). My actions felt calculated to you. But you're wrong. We loved the dom/sub aspect of our intellectual, as well as our sexual life. I seemed to fit the dominant role in most of what I did in my life. But contrary to what my arrogance created me to be, I submitted myself to you. It was such a refreshing and authentic feeling to submissively and vulnerably love you the way I did. It was a way of giving myself to you in a way I could never give myself to anyone else. I deified you. You were the royalty who married the peasant. You were the untouchable goddess whom I wanted to sit with in heaven. Contrary to all the power I seek to maintain in my everyday life, I gave up myself to you. But now it feels like I lacked enough power to grasp you as you walked away. I could give anything to have those last few moments back. Those rage filled comments that drove us apart that morning. Those drunk and jealous texts that caused you to shut me out for good. Those cold hearted looks into your crying eyes when you told me you had to be single, and explore yourself. But regardless, I know this probably needs to be said: When you realize the mistake you've made, I won't just fall into your arms the way I want to - and believe me I desperately want to. I feel so undervalued and lied to. I feel used and neglected. I feel that I was overlooked. I feel you were impulsive, but won't reconsider. And this feeling is hard to shake and hard to explain. There were moments and phrases that tipped me off to being just a tool for your own self growth, making my emotional attachment to you feel like it was all a lie. But you aren't a liar. But when I really look back on our time, there are moments that stand out to me as authentic. What you said when you were getting close with that work friend. What you said when your new debate friend asked you about our relationship. How you told me about how you talked about me to your friends. How you actually were okay with saying 'I love you' regularly, which prompted me to say it more frequently to you too. How you looked me dee in the eyes and said you wanted to lose your virginity to me and couldn't imagine it with anyone else. Even small moments, like saying I love you at just the right time. It was such an emotionally impactful moment. Irreplaceable moments. So if you truly mean that you 'can see a future together', then you need to show me again that you are committed to me. That you meant it when you said you loved me. Because at this point, I'm waking up sick because I feel neglected, but despite that neglect I want you still. Because even if the love I was shown was a a web of lies, I loved living in that web of lies. I felt so amazing. You felt so amazing. I really saw a future. As Bryan Adams song *If you love a woman* says, I could see our unborn children in your eyes - remember Olivia? As naive as this may sound, I know - or rather knew - who you are and what you want. There were parts of \[Martha Elenor Rigby\] that were only shown because of how close we were. And I was giving you everything you asked for. You had so much, and I'd give more if you needed. And we were so open and honest. To have this happen is uncharacteristic of who you are. Why give it up? Hold on until you are certain that you don't want it. Don't haphazardly and preemptively burn down this house we built together, just because you don't know if there is something else out there. I know that the future is uncertain. I know both you and I will never really know what was meant to be. I know its hard to take a leap of faith. But that's life. In everyday life, you will need to take leaps of faith. You will need to work through stress and hardships. Life isn't perfect. But you also don't need to cause yourself some sort of suffering because you are unsure. Maybe I was naive and overly committed to you - deluding myself to believing you to be potentially my soul mate. No matter where we go from here, even with the stance I took just now, I know I will falter - I will forget this requisite I have of you and submit myself time and time again. If you decide to let me back into your life when we talk in person, know that for the coming days, weeks, months, even year(s), I will have moments where all I'll want is you to have me back. That with a snap of your finger I would fall into your arms, or you into mine. I think that if we talk in person, and I feel there is a moment where you realize that you held something valuable within your hands, I'd forget it all and we could start again. But I don't think that's going to happen. But I would if it did. Again, my irrational side. You, even in all this pain you caused me, will be unforgettable. You were that once in a lifetime girl: No one can replace your smile. No one can replace your voice when you sang. No one can replace the sound of your heartbeat when I lay my head on your breast. No one can replace the way you held me when you wanted to be the big spoon. No one can replace the way you wrote poetry. No one can replace the adventurousness that you had. No one can replace the analytical way you approached things. No one can replace the vulnerability you showed me. No one can replace the hair I ran my hands through. No one can replace the name 'kitten.' No one can replace your enthusiasm to try debate with me as your coach. No one can replace the warmth of your hug. No one can replace your little quirks, like how you'd play with your glasses sometimes. No one can replace your love of reading obscure academic literature for fun. No one can replace your enthusiasm for trying and learning some the things I was into. No one can replace your wrist that wears that bracelet. No one can replace the way you always had gum in your mouth - even when you were eating a meal, drinking a drink, sleeping, or literally anything. No one can replace your enthusiasm for exercise. No one can replace the walks to CVS. No one can replace drinking chai tea lattes and eating cake at TGM. No one can replace the shoes you made me for Christmas (something I'll always cherish). No one can replace the way you talked about how special I made you feel. No one can replace you. *10:12 pm:* I still have no grounding for why this decision was made - it seems with every argument, every letter, every text, every post, every action, its a new reason... Or at least everything is explained differently. But now that you've made this decision, I hope that I left a lasting impression on your life in the end - something to remind you of how much I really did love you while we were together. I hope debate works out - I told that Florida girl you were 'jealous about' to make sure to help you out, since I won't be able to anymore (I might even tell my frat brother to look after you too). I hope you figure out what you're going to major in - Business, PPL, English, or something else since you're so adventurous and try things based off of your friends interests. I hope you enjoy the woman you have become with my help - something you always said you were grateful for. Soon, we will meet every Monday for a club I joined because of you. Soon, we will run into each other at the gym you got me into. Soon, we will pass by each other in the dinning hall that we planned so many lunch dates for - to compensate for no longer living next to each other. Soon, we will be drinking coffee at the depot or eating at the floor of the residential center you will live in. Soon, I may become a ghost to you. You blocked me from all your social media and texting. I don't even know if you even will talk to me in person like you said you would. I know me getting drunk and putting you through an emotional rollercoaster was wrong, but thats just a taste of the turmoil I've felt because of you. The break-up was so messy. Everyday, I question if there was something I could have done to avoid this. If there was a way for me to take back anything I said while angry about the break up or my perceived ignoring of my love letter to you. If we ever get back to talking to rebuild a friendship like you wanted, just know that my romantic feelings will be there. My desire to have you again. Maybe we can go back to those in between months when we met. Those friends with benefits/open relationship we seemed to be constructing when you didn't want to date. That possibility was built around our mutual attraction for one another. And maybe I can't be friends with you anymore. And that's one of the most painful possibilities that isn't unrealistic. I felt so neglected coming out of such a messy break up that maybe my body is fighting against my heart - my irrational love of you pushing through the destroyed friendship you left me with. Everyone I've asked for advice thinks that there is nothing special enough about someone to be like this - that you shouldn't be worth my time. That you have burnt a bridge with me and I'm desperately clinging to the last log that built it. And I tell them they're wrong. Should I? Is it worth it for me to write these 4000+ words to you? I love(d) you kitten. And I know that the log you cling to is that you wanted a platonic love to still exist. You cried the first time I used love in the past tense. But I always told you that love, for me to say it to someone, requires reciprocity. In the moments of weakness for you and the some time since the break up, I believed in the reciprocity when it faltered. But now, after writing this, I realized that i had an irrational devotion to you. I called it love because you gave so much to me in return and it helped me become the man I am today. But now I have question if any of what you did was real. *Did you really love me?* Forever yours - even when I'm 64, \[Paul\] P.S. *I hope I didn't forget anything baby. There was so much to say and remember, but so little mental stability to get it all out the right way. Ultimately, whatever is said in person should be used as a filter for this post, If you ever read it. But this is still a piece of my failing mind and broken heart.*"

Over the time we spent together, you showed me a way to value myself like I never had been able to before. I was the happiest I've ever been. You were closer to me than the closest friends I've remained with for *nearly a decade*. I have always been a cold and calculated individual; but when I interacted with you, I felt like a warmer, spontaneous person. And I loved it. You were in a niche in my soul that felt carved out for you. Those talks of seeing a future didn't fall on deaf ears. You are the only person I've ever met that I could see that. And you know that with the cold, calculated, introverted, pessimistic personality, I am very picky with who I am with. So for you to have that effect on me made me very vulnerable to you. I don't think you ever really noticed. Then again, I don't think you'd believe that it happened this way.I had a strong ego. I was pretty arrogant. I 'intimidated' you (in your words). My actions felt calculated to you. But you're wrong. We loved the dom/sub aspect of our intellectual, as well as our sexual life. I seemed to fit the dominant role in most of what I did in my life. But contrary to what my arrogance created me to be, I submitted myself to you. It was such a refreshing and authentic feeling to submissively and vulnerably love you the way I did. It was a way of giving myself to you in a way I could never give myself to anyone else. I deified you. You were the royalty who married the peasant. You were the untouchable goddess whom I wanted to sit with in heaven. Contrary to all the power I seek to maintain in my everyday life, I gave up myself to you. But now it feels like I lacked enough power to grasp you as you walked away. I could give anything to have those last few moments back. Those rage filled comments that drove us apart that morning. Those drunk and jealous texts that caused you to shut me out for good. Those cold hearted looks into your crying eyes when you told me you had to be single, and explore yourself. But regardless, I know this probably needs to be said: When you realize the mistake you've made, I won't just fall into your arms the way I want to - and believe me I desperately want to. I feel so undervalued and lied to. I feel used and neglected. I feel that I was overlooked. I feel you were impulsive, but won't reconsider. And this feeling is hard to shake and hard to explain. There were moments and phrases that tipped me off to being just a tool for your own self growth, making my emotional attachment to you feel like it was all a lie. But you aren't a liar. But when I really look back on our time, there are moments that stand out to me as authentic. What you said when you were getting close with that work friend. What you said when your new debate friend asked you about our relationship. How you told me about how you talked about me to your friends. How you actually were okay with saying 'I love you' regularly, which prompted me to say it more frequently to you too. How you looked me dee in the eyes and said you wanted to lose your virginity to me and couldn't imagine it with anyone else. Even small moments, like saying I love you at just the right time. It was such an emotionally impactful moment. Irreplaceable moments. So if you truly mean that you 'can see a future together', then you need to show me again that you are committed to me. That you meant it when you said you loved me. Because at this point, I'm waking up sick because I feel neglected, but despite that neglect I want you still. Because even if the love I was shown was a a web of lies, I loved living in that web of lies. I felt so amazing. You felt so amazing. I really saw a future. As Bryan Adams song *If you love a woman* says, I could see our unborn children in your eyes - remember Olivia? As naive as this may sound, I know - or rather knew - who you are and what you want. There were parts of \[Martha Elenor Rigby\] that were only shown because of how close we were. And I was giving you everything you asked for. You had so much, and I'd give more if you needed. And we were so open and honest. To have this happen is uncharacteristic of who you are. Why give it up? Hold on until you are certain that you don't want it. Don't haphazardly and preemptively burn down this house we built together, just because you don't know if there is something else out there. I know that the future is uncertain. I know both you and I will never really know what was meant to be. I know its hard to take a leap of faith. But that's life. In everyday life, you will need to take leaps of faith. You will need to work through stress and hardships. Life isn't perfect. But you also don't need to cause yourself some sort of suffering because you are unsure. Maybe I was naive and overly committed to you - deluding myself to believing you to be potentially my soul mate. No matter where we go from here, even with the stance I took just now, I know I will falter - I will forget this requisite I have of you and submit myself time and time again. If you decide to let me back into your life when we talk in person, know that for the coming days, weeks, months, even year(s), I will have moments where all I'll want is you to have me back. That with a snap of your finger I would fall into your arms, or you into mine. I think that if we talk in person, and I feel there is a moment where you realize that you held something valuable within your hands, I'd forget it all and we could start again. But I don't think that's going to happen. But I would if it did. Again, my irrational side. You, even in all this pain you caused me, will be unforgettable. You were that once in a lifetime girl: No one can replace your smile. No one can replace your voice when you sang. No one can replace the sound of your heartbeat when I lay my head on your breast. No one can replace the way you held me when you wanted to be the big spoon. No one can replace the way you wrote poetry. No one can replace the adventurousness that you had. No one can replace the analytical way you approached things. No one can replace the vulnerability you showed me. No one can replace the hair I ran my hands through. No one can replace the name 'kitten.' No one can replace your enthusiasm to try debate with me as your coach. No one can replace the warmth of your hug. No one can replace your little quirks, like how you'd play with your glasses sometimes. No one can replace your love of reading obscure academic literature for fun. No one can replace your enthusiasm for trying and learning some the things I was into. No one can replace your wrist that wears that bracelet. No one can replace the way you always had gum in your mouth - even when you were eating a meal, drinking a drink, sleeping, or literally anything. No one can replace your enthusiasm for exercise. No one can replace the walks to CVS. No one can replace drinking chai tea lattes and eating cake at TGM. No one can replace the shoes you made me for Christmas (something I'll always cherish). No one can replace the way you talked about how special I made you feel. No one can replace you. *10:12 pm:* I still have no grounding for why this decision was made - it seems with every argument, every letter, every text, every post, every action, its a new reason... Or at least everything is explained differently. But now that you've made this decision, I hope that I left a lasting impression on your life in the end - something to remind you of how much I really did love you while we were together. I hope debate works out - I told that Florida girl you were 'jealous about' to make sure to help you out, since I won't be able to anymore (I might even tell my frat brother to look after you too). I hope you figure out what you're going to major in - Business, PPL, English, or something else since you're so adventurous and try things based off of your friends interests. I hope you enjoy the woman you have become with my help - something you always said you were grateful for. Soon, we will meet every Monday for a club I joined because of you. Soon, we will run into each other at the gym you got me into. Soon, we will pass by each other in the dinning hall that we planned so many lunch dates for - to compensate for no longer living next to each other. Soon, we will be drinking coffee at the depot or eating at the floor of the residential center you will live in. Soon, I may become a ghost to you. You blocked me from all your social media and texting. I don't even know if you even will talk to me in person like you said you would. I know me getting drunk and putting you through an emotional rollercoaster was wrong, but thats just a taste of the turmoil I've felt because of you. The break-up was so messy. Everyday, I question if there was something I could have done to avoid this. If there was a way for me to take back anything I said while angry about the break up or my perceived ignoring of my love letter to you. If we ever get back to talking to rebuild a friendship like you wanted, just know that my romantic feelings will be there. My desire to have you again. Maybe we can go back to those in between months when we met. Those friends with benefits/open relationship we seemed to be constructing when you didn't want to date. That possibility was built around our mutual attraction for one another. And maybe I can't be friends with you anymore. And that's one of the most painful possibilities that isn't unrealistic. I felt so neglected coming out of such a messy break up that maybe my body is fighting against my heart - my irrational love of you pushing through the destroyed friendship you left me with. Everyone I've asked for advice thinks that there is nothing special enough about someone to be like this - that you shouldn't be worth my time. That you have burnt a bridge with me and I'm desperately clinging to the last log that built it. And I tell them they're wrong. Should I? Is it worth it for me to write these 4000+ words to you? *12:12am:* I'm still up, and I'm about to get on a plane to go back to the college we both attend, and see you again. I guess this is the last thing I have to say to close this: I love(d) you kitten. And I know that the log you cling to is that you wanted a platonic love to still exist. You cried the first time I used love in the past tense. But I always told you that love, for me to say it to someone, requires reciprocity. In the moments of weakness for you and the some time since the break up, I believed in the reciprocity when it faltered. But now, after writing this, I realized that i had an irrational devotion to you. I called it love because you gave so much to me in return and it helped me become the man I am today. But now I have question if any of what you did was real. *Did you really love me?* Forever yours - even when I'm 64, \[Paul\] P.S. *I hope I didn't forget anything baby. There was so much to say and remember, but so little mental stability to get it all out the right way. Ultimately, whatever is said in person should be used as a filter for this post, If you ever read it. But this is still a piece of my failing mind and broken heart.*"
368,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,To my friend,3,cuq53t,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/cuq53t/to_my_friend/,2019-08-24 16:50:55,"To my dear friend, I'm sincerely sorry for what has happened between us. I think of us as two battered feral cats who continuously mistrust and fight each other, as we have many times before. I don't know how much of our fighting was with each other though or just with ourselves. We projected our internal demons onto one another, I am certain. We each played punching bag for the other. That's healing, sure, but when we remember that there's a person on the other side of it we feel remorse. Were we doomed from the beginning because of that? How did we end up assuming that role in each other's lives? And why did we choose one another to confide in? Thinking about it makes me cry, because I know for a fact if we had met one another before we were both abused and hurt, that there would be something amazing there. And there is something of worth in there still, I know there is, but it's more hidden and protected. It's a struggle on both sides to allow the vulnerability required to love. I don't believe that we would be here if there was no love. I don't think either of us would have been in such pain if there was no love. I want you to know that my suicide attempt was not your fault. It was a combination of many things and yes, it broke my heart when you left, but it wasn't your absence that led me to that option. I'm sorry if I ever made you feel directly responsible for the act itself. That is not the case. If you ever felt guilt, I don't want you to feel it anymore. I am the only one I can hold accountable for that choice. You hurt me and I hurt you. I don't know how two people can be so compatible in every way but still have such difficulty understanding each other. I assume most of it is distrust and suspicion on both sides. I wonder if we had been in each other's day to day lives if that would have even been an issue. I don't think it would have been. That's why I was always trying to pull this out into the open. You know that one night where we were, proved that it was a simple thing when we were together. It was easy. It was incredible. I don't know why you withdrew after. I don't know why that night didn't topple over a chain of dominoes like I wanted it to. I seriously thought it would. I'm too naive and idealistic for my own good. I meant every word I said about the things I love about you and who you are. I never lied about any of it. I don't want to rehash them because you've got tuem memorized by now, I'm sure. I just want you to know I meant it. I'm sorry for the insulting things I said to you when I was angry. Anger is an emotion I don't experience very often but when I do feel it it takes over my entire being and it's out of my control. It's not an excuse, but still. I hope you'll forgive me for the nastiness. I hate that kind of behavior. I look back on some of the things I said and I'm disgusted with myself. It doesn't even sound like me. I worry that I'm becoming someone I don't recognize anymore. I don't like it. I feel gross and wrong whenever I mistreat you. Hurting you hurts me. It really does, especially when all I want is to make you happy. It's counterintuitive to be mean to you. I want you to know I'll be okay if you leave. I'm not going to hurt myself anymore or try to kill myself. I like the medications I'm on because they're helping me and I like going to therapy. I'm still very lonely without you but I'll be okay. I don't want you to worry about me. I still worry about you every single day. It's a scary thing to not know what you're up to or how you're doing. If something were to ever happen to you, I wouldn't know and vice versa. That's anxiety inducing for me. That's why your ""breaks"" freaked me out. I was just so damn worried about you. I didn't give a shit about your response time, I just wanted to know that you were okay. You could have sent me a single word and I would've been able to sigh with relief. I don't know, I'm sorry that you felt like I was smothering you or that I didn't respect your space. I'm not great at that. When everyone you love leaves you unexpectedly, you tend to break down over that kind of a thing. I know I was needy and I'm sorry. I honestly just cared for you, enjoyed talking to you, and wanted a friend. You made me feel better. You just got me and the things I valued and enjoyed. You understood me better than most do. You listened. You were patient and tolerant. You were a good friend to me. I enjoyed being a friend to you too. I liked getting to know you, being there for you, sharing interests and making jokes. I like how you forced me back into writing without even realizing it. Talking to you made me remember who I was before all the bullshit I had forced myself into. And I'm talking about the ""me"" when I was younger. When I said talking to you was ""perpetual nostalgia"", that's what I meant exactly. I felt like a kid again. It was a pure thing we shared. I hope you felt that way too. I don't know what's happened here, if it truly is all in my head (oh god, if so, I need some serious professional help) or if there's been some sort of ongoing attempt at figuring something out. I don't know what the decision is. I have told you over and over that I want you in my life but you haven't been too receptive to the idea, at least in the way you've responded to me. I don't know where that leaves us. I never wanted to let you go. When I said those words to you over the phone that night, I said them with the thought that you were a permanent fixture in my life. I didn't think either of us were going anywhere. When I said those words to you, I never expected you to say them back to me. I said them because I wanted you to know how dedicated I was to you and to what we had together. It wasn't about some rash decision to run away or elope or whatever. It was about letting you know how important you were to me and how crucial you had become in my life. I know I should regret saying it, but I don't. I meant what I said. I stand by it still. There are three options from where I'm sitting (and I'm sitting in a very clueless, ignorant place so please humor me): The first option is that we stay friends. We go back to what we were doing before because it worked a majority of the time and when it was good, it was the best. We take this time and this process as a lesson in humility on both ends and we learn to better care for each other. We learn conflict resolution, communication, respect, and patience with each other. We can learn to trust. The second option is that we stay friends with the possibility of more. We know we can't dive into the deep end of a relationship considering all of the circumstances, but we continue our friendship with small doses of what could be. Baby steps. Easing into things. Trying out to see what works. No pressure. Meeting up. We could work out specifics of how you'd like it to go and I'd be flexible with you. I would be forever understanding of whatever you needed. The third option, and probably my least favorite one, is that we go our separate ways entirely. I know that what we had/have together is special and that throwing it away like that would be hard for me. I care about you. I want you in my life. I have always wanted you around. I would never go through anything like this for anyone less deserving. It hurts to imagine a life without you in it. My heart breaks at the thought of never being able to speak to you again. Will we be the kind of people who look each other up on social media ten years from now and reflect on the what ifs? It sounds awful. I have lost so many people I care about in my life and I never wanted you to be one of them. I didn't know what we were or what we were to become, all I knew is that I wanted you there. I still want you there. I still miss you and talking to you. I still have so many things I want to ask you about or mention to you. I'm afraid that in all this time apart we are getting further away from ""catching up"" and leaning more towards ""no returning from this."" That thought alone makes me sob. I thought that you would come back eventually after we healed and that things might start back up where we left off. And now I'm realizing that it's not that simple after what we've been through and I'm worried that we're too far gone. I feel like every day we don't speak that someone is dragging me away by my feet. I'm fighting as hard as I can but I'm not winning. Time moves forward no matter how hard I fight. I'm crying and I don't even care that I am. I don't care about this sub or reddit or any of the pain we caused each other. I just care about you. If you think that we're no good for each other and that we should let go, then I'll do it for you. But if there's a shot in hell to still care about me enough to want to try anything again, I hope you'll do it. Either way please promise me you'll reach out to me one last time in a way that's sincere and not out of anger. If you want to say goodbye just let it be a heartfelt one and I won't fight you on it. Just no more hatred or resentment, okay? Please? Just no more. I miss you and I'm sorry. -Taylor"
369,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,I think I want to fuck you?,7,cvk3iw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/cvk3iw/i_think_i_want_to_fuck_you/,2019-08-26 16:05:36,"First of all, thanks for having me over. I always enjoy our conversations. Getting drunk and talking about our problems was just what I needed, honestly. For a couple weeks, I actually forgot who I am. She brought out child-like excitement, vulnerability, and my ""goofiness."" With that came a lot of insecurity when things went south. I lost any jovial nature I had and felt like I needed to closet myself off from the world yet again. I tied my prerogatives to be vulnerable and happy to her; she left, those prerogatives left. Something like that. When you asked if I ever feel rage, I held back, but I think you could see through it. I've felt a lot of rage for the last ten years. I often think it's all I have. I feel it because I can't be a real person. Other people get in the way and make things so confusing. I wish life was more than just a stupid power struggle. Occasionally, when the right people come along, it is more than that. It's refreshing for someone to not only be doubtful about relationships but, also, to avoid them. You're not weird about it either. It's not like you just hook up to rack a body count or something. You don't give it much thought. Do I like this person? Yes? Let's spend time together and maybe have some fun. Simple. That's just who you are: a genuine free spirit, a free thinker. It's enticing. It's hot. We can talk about sex, people we're attracted to, books we've been reading, people we knew, whatever. It flows effortlessly, and there's no performance art involved. If she brought out my vulnerability, you bring out my strength. Months back, you and I would collaborate on a project all day and I'd go home to her to cry about my self-doubt. What a weird way to live. Now that it's over, I have to confess something. I'm attracted to you. I don't know if I should say it because, frankly, I don't know if you feel the same towards me. Sometimes I sense you do, but who knows? I don't want to fuck up all the hard work we've put in. OK, I really want to fuck you. Someone described you as a ""lioness"" to me and, yeah, that's true. You're so independent, so hard-working, so unconcerned with the flock. God, it's so hot. I burn up just thinking about the way you put these privileged, unquestioning pieces of shit on the grill every day. I've always wound up with immature girls who need me to be their shelter. Tell them they're pretty, make them feel loved constantly, be the perfect boyfriend. I'm sick of it. You don't need that. You don't need me at all, which is beautiful. You only need yourself, the insane confidence you have, and a mission to chip away at. For just a few moments, I want to tame you. I want to know what getting head from you is like, and I want to enjoy each other. I'll be the king of my hill and you can be the queen of yours. We'll find the common ground and go our separate ways until we meet again. Would you ever consider that? I'm thinking maybe I should try. Anyways, see you tomorrow. Stay you."
370,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,The answer to your letter from forever ago,2,cw5jyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/cw5jyc/the_answer_to_your_letter_from_forever_ago/,2019-08-28 00:54:22,"Can you still say that my love for you isn't true or real when I've given you so many things I give no one else? After all of the pain and suffering, I still care for you and want to be with you. I know you say that my love is fake, idealistic, naive, overly simple, and dramatic. That it's a pretend fairy tale found in a book. But tell me, has our situation been like that at all? Or has it been pure sweat, blood, and tears? Love is work. It's grueling work. It's not supposed to be easy and effortless. I'd be suspicious if it was. It's conflict resolution. It's agreements. It's flexibility and understanding. It's vulnerability, sure, but it's trusting that vulnerability is placed in good hands. It's caring about someone so much that you're willing to make exceptions and to compromise. It's sacrificing your needs knowing that someone else is sacrificing some of their own in return. To give up something in exchange for something greater. Giving up pieces of yourself to combine with someone else's. It's creating something from scratch with the faith that it will work out. You take that risk because of someone else. You say I've glossed over reality and placed you upon a pedestal. It's not true. I have seen all of the bad. I've seen the dark, the twisted, the hurt, and the cruel. And I accept them as a part of you. When I say I love you I mean I love ALL of you. Every part. Love is not saying, ""You are 100% perfect and you don't ever do anything wrong. I don't expect you to either"". Love is ""I know for certain you will fuck up and hurt me. I'm sure to the same. But I care about you enough to work through it with you because I want to be with you. The good I see in you and the good times we have will always overshadow the bad."" You act as if I said I love you on a whim. As if I didn't ponder it for months, question it, talk to others about it. It wasn't something I said lightly. I have only said it to three men total, including you. Do you know how insulting your reaction was? It was the most vulnerable thing I could have done. I handed my heart over to you without expectation and you acted as if it were a cheap and tawdry gift that I casually thrust at you. As if it were so easy for me that it must be a lie. I had to work up the courage for it and even then it didn't go the way I wanted it because you wouldn't give me a chance to do it properly. So no, I don't think our relationship has been ideal in any way. It's not been a fairy tale. It hasn't been a romantic comedy. It's been difficult but at least it's been real and honest from the get go. I keep showing up and being vulnerable because I love you and because I choose to give those parts of myself to you and you alone. You don't have to love me back, but please respect my feelings. It's not easy for me. None of this is easy. It's the worst possible scenario for two individuals who care for each other. And yet we're still here! It's not through obsession limerance or mental illness or lust or desperation or anything else that can be used to label it. It's because we care about each other!! Tell me I'm wrong. You know it's true! You ask me to tell you what those fights were about. Why did they get so heated and passionate? Because we cared. Because we knew the value and potential of what we shared together. Because to feel it slip away in any form made both of us reel in panic. Because there were intense feelings on both sides. It wasn't over nothing, those fights. It was over one simple premise on both sides: please don't leave me because I care about you. That's it! That's what it boils down to. The push and pull dynamic was more of a game of ""you can't leave me if I leave first."" And neither of us wants to be abandoned or left. We wanted each other! As friends or more... Does it matter at this point? I needed you! I still need you. And it's not unhealthy, it's that I love you and care about you and I want you in my life. You are a goddamn joy to be around and being with you when you're nice is unlike anything I've ever experienced. Why do you have to tell me it's all bullshit?! Why do you have to reduce it to labels and rationalize it all away? Can't you just appreciate us for us?"

You werent meant for me. As great as you were, I have to realize that being with you would not have been the best for me. You were great, you really were. We were so compatible. From our words, our actions, our interests, we were so in sync. Being with you was easy, and fun, and light. But at the same time, being with you had exposed so much of my vulnerability, so much Id never allowed myself to feel. You opened that side of me. You opened the side of me that trusted myself enough to be able to open up to the thought of ever having a family. Of ever trusting someone wholeheartedly enough that I could spend the rest of my life with them. But I know that I wouldnt have been able to spend the rest of my life with you, despite everything good youve given me. I need someone who makes me feel like Im the only one they look at. That makes others stop in awe and say, Have you seen the way he looks at her? Ill look forward to it when it happens. And I hope the same happiness finds itself in you."
372,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,An attempt to reassure my love,1,cwdd3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/cwdd3e/an_attempt_to_reassure_my_love/,2019-08-28 10:44:41," Hey you, Im sorry it took me a bit to respond. Work has been kind of hectic lately and Im trying to juggle a lot. I wanted to take the time to give you a response you deserve rather than some half-assed letter that I typed in two seconds. I just want to make a couple of things clear to you before I start this letter: The first is I cannot speak on your behalf. I can only speculate the feelings you have towards me and the situation at hand but that is **ONLY** speculation. I have zero hard evidence except for what Ive gathered here in the past few months and who knows how much of it is accurate (or was even you to begin with). I hope you will allow me to make a mistake here or there. I have no authority to state your feelings but I have to assume some of them in order to write this. Again, I think I know but I may be completely wrong. This whole thing could be in my head (I sure as hell hope not.) Im choosing to believe youre out there somewhere and that the things Im about to say are things you have requested to hear. That these are the questions you want to be answered. This letter is only a guess. The second thing Id like to say before I dive in is please dont be upset with me over what I have to discuss. Im giving it my best here and I hope that youll be patient and understanding when it comes to my response. I have **NO INTENTION WHATSOEVER** of hurting you in this letter. I am hoping it can bring peace to your mind and help alleviate concerns you may have going forward. If you receive any pain from this letter, please know that it was not intended to be that way at all. So please, please, please, re-read this letter one hundred times before you conclude how you feel. Mull it over. Sleep on it. But dont have a knee-jerk reaction that leads to unexpected anger or a downvote contest. Im trying so hard. Im surrendering here. Im begging you. This comes from the heart. Lastly, I hope this letter can start the *process* of resolution. I hope that you are seeing it as that as well and that is why you requested it. It doesnt have to be the final straw but I do want you to see it as the potential beginning of something new. Think of this letter as me laying all of my cards on the table in front of you. Completely vulnerable, open, honest, and at your disposal. Please dont hurt me in response. Think about what I have to say and start determining how youd like us to proceed from here. I am so desperately hoping you will have the same feelings and ideas as me, but again, I cannot speak for you. I can only tell you my feelings, my perspective, my thoughts, and my offers. You are more than welcome to disagree with them but I hope you will do so in a civil and thoughtful manner. Id like for us to be in the habit of being respectful of each other even when we do disagree. With all of that being said, heres what I have to say: **I could never leave you or break your heart.** Heres why. When I said you were my dream guy, I meant it. You are everything I have ever hoped for, imagined, wanted in a man. I said before that our relationship wasnt a fairy tale and thats true, but Ill be damned if meeting you wasnt some supernatural act for me. Its like you walked straight out of a fantasy. I love every single thing about you. All the good and the bad. Its why I fought (and am still fighting) so incredibly hard for you. I know you dont like terms like soulmate and the one, but just know that you are so rare and precious to me. I have never had a connection to *anyone in my entire life* like I have to you. I swear. And when I say connection, I mean it in all ways: mental, emotional, physical, etc. Your entire being pulls me in. It calls out to me and it always has. Im so drawn to you. Having you in my life as a lover or even just as a friend would make me so happy because I know how special you are both as a person and to me. If by some chance I could ever call you mine and romantically be with you, I would die I would be so ecstatic. I never thought my wish would ever come true. I thought it was too good to be true; that you and your existence was just too good to be true. And its not. Its real. You are there existing in the world and it drives me insane to know that I am not next to you right now. Im getting away from the point here which is that I would never let you go. If I had you, I would *never* put our relationship at risk. I would do every single thing in my power to keep you safe, happy, and comfortable. I would shower you with as much love and affection as you could handle. My time with you would be so valuable that there would be no substitute. You are my man. And I dont say that to show possessive ownership, I say that to make you understand that with you in my life there could never be another. You would be it for me unless you decided you were done with me. But I want to emphasize to you that I could never leave you. I havent left you, have I? Ive come back running every time with full force, desperately reaching for you after being away for mere moments. That would only increase with your physical presence, Im sure. But no, I would never leave you. I would never want to lose you. It would crush me. **I never want to hurt you.** Believe me when I say this to you: it physically makes me ill to hurt you. It feels me with such shame and regret because I want nothing more than your happiness. Its all I care about. I never want to be responsible for your pain. I want to be the opposite. I want to take away your pain and your worries. I want to be there to comfort you and to bring solutions to the problems you have. I want to be your shoulder to lean on, your ear to listen, your partner, your friend. I want to kiss you and hold you and let you know just how wonderful you are. I apologize for how I have hurt you in the past and I regret what happened deeply. I said before that we will hurt each other again, and Im sure we will, but I will always apologize to you for it. I will always want to compromise and better understand how I can prevent hurting you in the future. I dont want to hurt you. I want to love you. I want to help you in any way I can and I want to be there for you when you are hurt. I want to be the person you rely on to help with the pain, not the person directly responsible for it. You may have to help me better understand your feelings and your emotions though. I can only guess them half of the time and for me to help you or be an adequate resource for you, you will have to open up to me. I wont force you to, I wont make you uncomfortable, but I will always encourage you to be open and honest with me. This mutual vulnerability we have with each other is special and I do not take it for granted, but you should see it as something to help with healing and airing your pain versus seeing it as something to hide or feel shameful for. **We have to trust each other.** This is easier said than done, I know. The trust has to go both ways for this to work. Thats how a partnership goes. If we care about each other there must be trust there. Trust is what allows us to be open and honest. Trust is what keeps us admitting the things we keep from others. Its what gives us the ability to look each other in the eyes and be our most vulnerable with one another. We have both been burnt several times in the past and so our trust is hard-won. Its an issue for both of us and an issue Im certain will flare up now and then. All I ask of you is that we work on it together. If we can communicate honestly and openly, there will always be trust on my end. I know that I have shown distrust of you in the past and I am sorry. Im sure you understand what its like to have that small voice in the back of your head telling you that everything is a lie, that you should be suspicious and wary. I didnt mean to be a possessive bitch and I was. I felt threatened by another woman. And I know it was ridiculous and absurd, but all I saw it as was this chick is about to steal the man I love away from me and Im about to get ghosted. I panicked. I had a meltdown of what-ifs and images flashing in front of my eyes of you and another woman. It was all triggered my head because of something so fucking stupid. Thats how bad my trust issues are. I have been cheated on numerous times, ghosted, left without explanation. I know the same things have happened to you. Im not making excuses for either of us, Im just saying that trust issues are bound to arise again. When they do, I hope we can sit down and have a heart-to-heart like we did that one night after my dumbass exploded at you. Im so sorry about that. I made myself look like an idiot and I hurt you in the process. It was a fucking mess. I just didnt want to lose you. I have severe abandonment issues and attachment problems and to have even the slightest hint you were leaving was enough to send me into a fit. Im working on it but its still there. I hope you can be patient with me and work with me on that. I just need your reassurance to let me know you care and that youre there and youll always come back. **I dont mind your past.** I want to make this clear to you: I do not care about what youve done or all of the skeletons still lingering in your closet. Im getting the idea you have withheld a lot from me because you think youll upset me or Ill look at you differently as a result of your confessions. No matter what you say to me, I will accept you and love you as you are. I swear to you. Nothing you can tell me will shock me or change my perception of you. The act of you revealing the truth to me will be so liberating because its what Ive been seeking this entire time weve been together. I want to know the dark parts. Ive encouraged you to reveal them to me as Ive revealed mine to you. Its time to do it. You can trust me to take any secrets of yours to the grave. I am a loyal person and my loyalties belong to you. But this confiding and vulnerability thing has to go both ways. If you want my heart, you have to start giving me yours. If you are willing to give me the answers to the hundreds (if not thousands) of questions I have, I will be willing to do the same for you. But again, you have to be willing. I cant force the truth out of you. I cant beg for it or play twenty questions or hot and cold with you. Get drunk or high if you want, but let it spill. You will feel much better to have it off of your shoulders and I will feel much better knowing theres nothing hidden between us anymore. I love you. Did I mention that? I do. **I dont mind your present.** I shouldnt even have to state this because Ive said it on a loop, but I dont give a single shit about your current situation. If you ever have the desire to change things (and when I say you, I mean you) I will give you 100% of my time and energy to help you achieve that. But you have to want to change it. I can help you figure out where to go, what to do. I can provide you with resources and ideas. But **you have to want it.** I cant do it for you and I cant single-handedly change everything on my own. If you dont want to change, I will be fine with it, but you have to understand that Im not going to change either. I want to continue to grow in my own ways. I never want you to feel resentment towards me for that. I want to continue my education, I want to travel, learn, expand. I will love you every step of the way, but I dont want you to hate me for that part of my personality. I hope that you can accept and love me for me, knowing that thats just a part of who I am and it comes with the territory. If you want to stay there, I will be happy to work my life into yours, but if by any chance youre sick of it and you want differently, prepare for me to help you completely change everything. **I want a future with you.** This should be fairly obvious by now, but I want a future with you. The only thing I want is commitment. What does commitment mean to me? It means a dedicated agreement between you and I that we are in this together as a team. That we are loyal, honest, and faithful with one another. We have open communication and we are respectful. We dont have to put a label on it if you dont want to. We dont have to rush anything. I am prepared to go at whatever pace you decide if you should ever want a romantic relationship with me. It is up to you to determine the conditions of how it should go. You know that if you asked me, Id be there tomorrow. You know that Im willing to do just about anything to make it work with you. Understand that I am flexible and I will work with you on how you think it should go. I dont want to talk about the future past the next five years. That is for future us to worry about. I want to focus on the upcoming decisions we want to make about our lives separately and together. I dont want to discuss marriage or any of that shit. I want us to take small steps together and feel things out. I want you to be comfortable and Ill do whatever you need for that to happen as long as I get to call you mine. *You have to decide what you want from me though.* I cant decide for you or Id already be there next to you. If you want to be friends, lets be friends and move forward. If you want to be romantic, lets dive in and take the chance, because deep down you know I would work my ass off for you and us. I wouldnt let us go without a hell of a showdown. Consider this entire scenario and youll know what I mean. Were too stubborn to go down that easily. Were fighters. We dont give in to that shit. **I will work with you.** This is my promise to you. I will work on everything with you. I will try to be as accommodating and understanding to your needs as I can be. I will be flexible to your requests and I will try to adjust my behavior accordingly, as long as you are willing to do the same for me. If there is an issue between us, I will try to resolve it without getting upset. We have notoriously had a bad habit of poor communication between the two of us and Id love for us to get to the point where that disappears completely. I think being on the same page and trusting one another will help tremendously, but you also HAVE TO BE WILLING TO COMPROMISE! I will be willing, but you have to be as well. It takes two people to reach an agreement; it has to be a mutual thing between the two of us. You cant shut me out, you cant ghost me or disappear. You can say, Please I need space. Or Please I need time. But you cant just walk away into the darkness without a word. There is a way to disagree that doesnt have to escalate to the point of name-calling. We both have resorted to that when our feelings have been hurt and I dont want it to get to that point again. Its damaging and there is no need for it. We care about one another and that means respecting each others differences of opinion. I will always listen to your opinions without getting emotional (provided it is said respectfully) and I hope you will try to do the same. I dont care if we have to make up some safety word when things are escalating to an unhealthy level, but I wont let it get heated in that manner ever again. Its not constructive and Im sure you agree with me. We have to work together to better communicate though. It has to come from both sides. I know our relationship will be grueling and hard work sometimes, but I am willing to do it for you. Id walk through hell for you or with you. I want this and Im willing to do whatever it takes. **Promises.** I promise you that I will always have your best interest at heart. I promise that all I want is for you to be happy and healthy. I promise I will do everything in my power to help you achieve the things you want in your life. I promise that you can trust me. I promise that I will always be willing to compromise and work with you. I promise that I will never break your heart. I promise I will never cheat on you. I promise that I will treat you the way you have always deserved to be treated- with love, appreciation, and respect. I promise I will try not to smother you and I will allow you your space. I promise Ill try to better control my emotions. I promise that I will love you more than you could ever imagine. **I promise you that I am ALL IN.** **The rest is up to you.** You know where I stand now and you know what I have to offer. I cant go into specific, concrete plans because Im not even sure how you feel about it. I hope that this gave you some insight into how things would be and that it cleared up any questions you had. I cant answer every question because I cant see the future. Just know that no matter what happens, I am here for you. Id like to be there by your side, both metaphorically and literally, but that is your decision to make. Whatever decision you end up making, I will support it. I want you to be happy, whether that is with me or without me. You are a good man and I love you dearly. I hope you will consider what Ive said to you before you make up your mind, but please, when you make a decision make sure its the one youre prepared to stick with. Even if its to say, I do, but. It doesnt have to be black and white or crystal clear. Just tell me your feelings for me and the situation as they are, okay? I just want you to know that I am prepared to give you everything. You already have my heart, but you will have my entirety. I want to be with you as your partner, as your girlfriend, as whatever you want to label it. I will take friendship if it is offered instead, but I will always prefer the alternative. I am insanely attracted to you in every way imaginable and it would be fairly difficult to break that along with the romantic feelings. I could find a way if need be, Im sure, but it would suck. I care about you so much. I miss you terribly. I am so excited at the thought theres even a possibility that the thing I wanted most for years may, in fact, come true. If not, I understand, but fuck me, I would pass out at the thought. I dont know if I could even handle that amount of happiness. I hope you reach out. I understand if you dont, but I hope you do. I hope you do. I dont want any more confusion or anything else left to chance or the possibility of a stranger adding their own words to the mix. Lets respect each other enough to continue this back in reality. Its time to take a risk, right? Im willing to jump if you are. Love, Me xx"

There's going to be a lot of ups and downs in life, that's inevitable. You're going to feel overwhelmed a lot of the time, like you can't cope, that if things get worse than that's it, you're at the end of your rope. You're going to find yourself with that rope around your neck. But you're gonna be ok. Despite all else, you are loved. Even if you don't feel like it. Even if your aren't loved you have love inside of you. So much love to give the world, but try to save a little for yourself. You have a light inside of you, a passion, an intelligence, a spirit and a drive. Use that to help yourself. Use it to help others. Use it to keep fighting against the demons inside of you. Don't feed into it or them. Fight them. This is not you, the anxiety and depression are two forces against you, not a part of you. You are who you are because of where you have been. It will make you stronger, more empathetic and more vulnerable. But in that vulnerability we find our truest selves; be yourself."

I struggle with talking about emotions. I have some sort of block that keeps me from seriously speaking what I feel. I am too afraid, I think. I either end up joking or I turn the conversation to something hypertechnical and analytical or I get awkward and silent and closed off and clam up. I can write my emotions but we both know that written exchanges didnt work well for us. Too much got lost without nonverbal cues. Maybe someday I will get the chance to sing my emotions to you. I find it easier to make and hold eye contact and to relax and feel while singing. Maybe I will sing to you, either alone or as part of a group, and I will lock eyes with you and let those emotions flow from me to you on a current of music and you will feel the complex tangle of intensity and pain and delight and caring and sadness and regret and other things I cant even name and you will finally understand how I feel. I wonder how you will respond. Will it be too much? Will you hold eye contact and take it in or will you look away and try not to listen? Will you look back and send your own emotional message on the musical waves? Will I see any of my feelings reflected in your eyes? Is that why you wont let me sing with you anymore, why you cant let me sing with you? Are you afraid of the openness and vulnerability that would be there if we make eye contact during a song? Are you afraid of what you would see? Are you afraid of seeing too much of the hurt of seeing hate or indifference? Or are you afraid of what I would see on YOUR face? You dont have to be afraid, I promise. We can handle it. Just trust me."

Like you are unhealthy for me. I care about how you are. Recieving and giving that is important. Communicating is important. I'm not your drinking buddy and I don't want to only communicate when your drunk. You would like to cut my ties with people I love and whom love me more than you will ever know. You won't win a social war with them so drop it. I wasn't lying when I said I had people in my life that care. You get jealous and hateful, yet you don't give a fuck and I mean nothing to you? You can set boundaries, be honest, and communicate those things. Little effort is needed and I swear being vulnerable in doing so will not be the end of the world. You only reach out when your drunk, on your time, have to lie about why, and make social problems on top of it because you can't just emote or express your needs. Rumours and negativity don't count as healthy communication. That's actually worse on you than me..... and will push me away completely at some point. It will also legitimately cause you problems with others as you seem to involve them. I'm not having these kinds conversations about you. You gaslight and like to say it's because I talk to people about you. Yes I do. Im honest about my life with a clutch of people whom are healthy, communicate, and we are vulnerable with one another. They love and I love in kind. It's not the world but it is a small handful and the amount of empathy, genuine caring, and vulnerability would wreck you I think. Life's not all about winning and manipulation. It's losing and having people that will not over judge you for it but tell you what you need to hear. They have been there. They take your shit when your a dick because your overwhelmed, but there at your worst and accept your apology. They revel in you wins and help you pick up the losses. Not just drunk talk but will give a hand in the real world. These are my people. Be one or don't. I love you but you have to accept it and I can't force it. That will take effort from you. Just small steps, grand gestures are not required. Also That's not ""romantic dating"". That's just relationship building and friendship. I know, you thought I was alone in the world. Unconnected and vulnerable in a different way. Sorry but not sorry.... love is something I respect, desire, work on, and have. Also self love, so I'm done making any effort for the now and will walk away. You know where to find me though and how to reach out when you wanna sit crooked and talk straight."

On the intimacy of knowing. While I like to think of myself as a generally good person, I sometimes wonder if that can even be true when I spend so much of my time trying to get you to open up to me. I am great at keeping them. Its not that I want to see the darkness inside you and expose it to the light; I just want to know Im trusted, that Im special enough to see it. (And isnt that sad? Im so broken and desperate for approval that Ill bare my own soul in the hopes that its enough for just one person to tell me Im worthy.) They call me brave for it. Its bullshit. Im not whole. Im not brave. Im just faking it in the hopes that one day Ill finally feel... whatever it is Im trying to feel. You even told me that, once. You said that I have a special combination of confidence and vulnerability that makes me particularly alluring. Broken, yet pieced together with my own glue of positivity and introspection. It was intoxicating, you said, because it was so rare. But it didnt matter, what you said. I wasnt enough, was I? All those late nights filled with honesty and transparency were grains of sand on the vast beach of your memory. Or, perhaps, maybe I was too much. Maybe I didnt imagine it all. I could never tell if I was a friend or a distraction. But maybe my grains of sand werent as small as I thought, maybe they whipped up into a frenzy and maybe, maybe, they were starting to blind you to the beach itself. Id never met someone who felt like my mirror and I was desperate to have a piece of you so I could pull it out and admire the reflection, to bask in the feeling of seeing and being seen. I didnt want all of you. I didnt really even want a part of you. All I wanted was to hear just one of your secrets. Isnt it funny how I learned that your biggest secret was me? I miss you. But I hope you never think of me again."

I dont look forward and I only look back. My self esteem has always been on an all time low. But then there was George. George walked into my life and I didn't know it at the time what he would mean to me later on in life. I remember he would always so Hi to me in passing but I was in my own world. It took a year for me to reciprocate and say something to him. It was a new england Fall day, I saw him as I was walking home and purposely I sped up to him. I said Hi to him and it was like I was meeting him for the first time. We discovered we lived close by and we just clicked. Then we clicked again when I was out with friends and I saw him with his dog. I wanted to see his new place and also didn't want to spend the rest of my night at the bars with strangers. I invited myself up for tea and there was no furniture so we sat on the ground. I remember we talked until the good morning light shined through his window. It became a thing, him and me. We spent so much time together even when we were apart we still obsessively checked in on each other. I fell in love with him. We were never in love because we weren't together. But I loved him and he couldnt say the same. And we continued our questionable friendship. We'd sleep in each others arms and hugged each other like lovers do. Like all good things, our lives began to change. We were moving on and time wasnt on our side. We stayed in touch but it was not the same. I never got to thank him for all those nights he invited me over to his furnitureless apartment where he'd listen to me talk about all the thoughts consuming my mind. Then we'd fall asleep while watching a movie and that's what life felt like with him. He made feel like the starring lady and he was my white knight. Together I felt like anything was achievable. I realize I took it all for granted and I thought I could thrive without his influence because I panicked when I felt the weight of him as an anchor and me becoming dependent on him. Really, I was too immature to realize that's what total vulnerability. I've lost count of how many years have past by since we last talked to each other. Email doesnt count especially considering our last exchanges. But really, I think I dont want to admit how many years have gone by without admitting my worst mistake, walking away from him. I never took my own advice: when you have a good thing going than hold on to it. I understand why after all these years, he's still on my mind and believe I've tried to live and let go but to quote Love, Rosie: Your (his) friendship has brought glorious technicolor to my life, its been there even in the darkest of times and I am the luckiest person alive for that gift. I hope I didnt take it for granted, I think maybe I did. Because sometimes you dont see that the best thing thats ever happened to you is sitting there, right under your nose. But its fine, too. Because Ive realized that no matter where you are or what youre doing or who youre with I will always, honestly, truly, completely love you. I know life isnt a movie and I know I missed my shot. I accept it and I like to think that I did him a favor by him not being able to see who I am today. And who I am today is nothing what I imagined myself to be like or what I had told him in the past. Possibly that's why I hold on to him because I felt like I was my best self with him. Simply, Selfish Sally"
380,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Toxic femininity,0,caw1yx,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/caw1yx/toxic_femininity/,2019-07-09 14:38:56,"K Yeah I said it, toxic femininity. A lot of hullabaloo has been given toward the notion of toxic masculinity . A trait that you often accuse me of having and perpetuating. I couldnt agree more. I grew up thinking it was wrong to cry and to show vulnerability. So much so, that Im awkward when I do display those types of emotions. Guilty as charged. I subconsciously frown on my fellow males that fail to display the same testosterone fueled fire that feels innately masculine. Check. Not arguing that I have room to grow in that area....But as I continue to drag my knuckles onward, I propose that women are guilty of toxic femininity....you especially. Allow me to explain. I think a lot of women are raised to define themselves by the man they attain. That their own self worth comes second to that of powerful men. That their personalities are derivative of a finer human being in man. I submit that you are guilty of this. You float along in your career and on your development, following an ideal you think defines your success by being his plus one. You read and think and absorb as if to say me too....and not the harassed variety of me too....the lame kind where you are copying his aura. No doubt his aura is strong and bright....but you underestimate yourself and devalue yourself to the point where you think the light under him is more than you could ever attain independently. Youve created your own artificial boundary. Its almost as sad as me longing to be with you. Im hooked on you, even if youre only a shade of who you could be. Ive seen the real you. The real limitless you and its amazing. I hope you dont turn into this docile lame version of you that thinks being Robin to his Batman is ok. I might as well get into bar fights and really tap into my male lameness. Anyhow, I still miss you. C"

Hm. I have this playlist. Problem never showed it to you. I was terrible at showing you things. It'd make me anxious, nervous. Vulnerability is the hardest thing, y'know? The hardest. But anyway. This playlist with all these songs that... are you. Every one reminds me of you. They used to make me smile so much. It's bittersweet now. I often think, when I'm listening to them... if I made them into a mixtape and sent it to you, would some things make sense? The words and feelings that I've always struggled to say myself. Would something make sense? Silly thought, isn't it? If you're lost you can look and you will find me, time after time... Always wanted to be the one catching you, darling. Never meant to be the one pushing you down."
382,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Something you should hear.,4,cbtssd,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/cbtssd/something_you_should_hear/,2019-07-11 19:46:50,"Hey you... Believe it or not, I have been doing well recently. Things obviously have not been the same since you have been out of the picture. Before you were out of the picture, well, we both knew that I had absolutely no earthly idea what life and love would look like without you. But now that youre out of the picture, things have taken quite the turn. And they sure as hell are for the better. I want you to stay out of the fucking picture for gods sake. I came across a letter that you wrote me for my nineteenth birthday the other day. The way you described me as someone that loves so much, and that when Im in a room every person around me could feel that love and light. I think I found those words at just the right time. And no, not because I was wishing you would come back and say that shit to me again. But maybe, just maybe because that shit is actually true. We all know you just wanted to feed me petty bullshit for the hopes that one day you would actually believe it. Because you knew I believed it the second the words rolled off your tongue. And who are we kidding? You could never love a girl like me. So messy and all over the place, feelings so intense it makes you wanna shell up and hide. I understand now Charles... there was never room in your heart for a girl like me, never any room in your mind. Even when you wanted there to be. Maybe even if that want was only for a mere second. You knew you could never truly love me, you could never truly want me the way that I loved and wanted you. You knew that from day one. But no, you insisted to keep looping me around and playing with my heart, and my mind and all of my feelings that I feel so intensely. You knew how fragile I was... hell, you know how fragile I am. And you know what gets to me... and you made sure to pick up on that from the beginning. And, you know what? Take me out of your loops. Do you not see the monster we have so easily created? It can be gone. It was leaving. But no, you insist to keep it creeping up. Especially when I least expect it... shocker. You will find your self running in circles of messes like this one. In no way is this a beautiful mess, but its the mess we created together. And In order to clean any of these broken ass pieces up you have got to start with yourself. Do not worry about my broken pieces. For once I have got my pieces finding their ways back together. As much as you would like to tear me down and keep breaking me as much as you like to think I broke you, think back to when things all began. I was a vulnerable soul who fell in love and you took that and put it in your pocket. Not remembering that a boy like you could never, ever, love a girl like me. You knew it from the start. You even said it yourself. It was my mistake for not running so goddamn fast the first second I ever heard those words coming from your mouth. But it was also my mistake for wanting it back and it was your mistake for roping it back in. So when you begin to think that I shred and tore you, think back to the way that you tore me..that we tore eachother. Start by being able understand that there arent two sides to the story. We were both fucked up, you can name shit and I can name shit too... the end line is that its over. Forever. It will be a distant memory one day but not if you keep trying to creep up in childish, foolish ways. like oh...lets start by naming something like this. We finally get space. The space we have been longing for but too afraid to actually reach. We had time. And during my time, I have used it god damn wisely and you seem to still be stuck in a sad and repetitive pit of unease with yourself. And you, you sir, know exactly where you just went wrong. Dont try to play your cards wild. Because you must keep in mind this is everything that you have been asking for. I am finally gone. You have been begging for this space from me. Dont you dare try to loop back in again, in any wayshapeform you can to try to make me hurt by so selfishly trying to use my friends as a tactic. You took so many people away from me and Im sure you would say the same about me. Let me be in peace. Allow my own space for growth. Just as I am doing for you. You know you do not wanna be with my friends, and especially her. You hate her, you have always hated her. Or what, is it that you have always hated me? So everyone correlating with me, you hate? But when I am gone.. you want to reconcile? Hmm.. sounds like something you would say to make it sound more levelheaded in that twisted little mind of yours. I still know you. I knew you so well. You want so badly to fit in, you want so badly for things to fall in place and for once in your goddamned life to feel like you finally can sit in a place of comfort and peace.. or must I say, loathe? And I should remind you, because you can not seem to remind yourself. The first place that starts all of this clean up is within. Not with me, not with my friends. With yourself. Get up for once and do things you actually like instead of running around the people you claim to like following what they to do fill the void inside. You have said it yourself, your life has been so good... you dont know why youre so sad. You just do not want to feel lonely anymore. I get that, plenty of people get that. But maybe stop searching inside of other peoples hobbies for a fill of the loneliness and look inside of yourself. You always blamed me that you never get to do anything you love, and I am finally gone. You need to do those things. You need to create peace with the fact that both of us of course, did not want things to workout the way they did. But what a long, strange, fucked up trip its been. I love you. But, it is not quite the same type of love anymore. (whatever that was.) It is a distant type of love. Sort of like where, I hope you are able to pick up your pieces and find yourself happy and finally make yourself whole. But, also where you have some bad days in there to remind you that things can get bumpy, but they do not have to stay bumpy. Open yourself up and learn where your heart is. Oh.. and when you meet the next girl. Try to remember that vulnerability is beautiful and that love can be beautiful. but it is not always going to be easy. please try for her. Do not fool her into thinking both feet are in when in reality only one foot is in, halfway. Wishing you the best from afar."

You will be hestitant and unsteady at first, viewing my body as an undiscovered foreign land with which you have no map nor compass to navigate, but your unabated desire to win the war will propel you forward nonetheless. You will feel unprepared and wary of the journey, but will be determined to forge a new path ahead, certain of the rewards awaiting and tempting you. You will shake as you reach for me, unsure of where to begin, and your breath will hitch as you take the first steps into an unknown world. You will explore the softness of my skin, traveling cautiously along my curves, and I will coyly pretend to resist. Your lips will discover the delicate spot between my neck and my shoulder, and I will falter slightly, unaccustomed to the invasion taking place. A strange intruder in my homeland. You will trace the Latin phrases that ink my ribcage, unsure of the meanings and unable to translate. I will not reveal them to you. You will delicately linger over my inner thighs, prodding for spots of weakness, and draining me of my obstinance. The sounds I make in response will be new and different, but not unwelcome. A native tongue you will grow to learn. And as you finally breach the part of me that is least familiar to you, the center of my vulnerability, the core of my need, I will start to yield, consumed and undone by your touch. My borders will fall, my barriers will lift, my defenses will retreat, and the battle will be rightfully won. I will lose all control and surrender my treasured sovereignty to you, shamefully, but willingly. I will plead half-hearted whispers of mercy in your ear, an offer of a peace treaty that will be ignored and dismissed. I will become a prisoner of delirious ectasy, a mindless servant to your movements inside of me. I will cease to function or respond to anything except for the euphoria you will provide. Your confidence will grow and the savage, primal instincts embedded in you will eventually take over. It is then that you will stake your territory. It is then that you will claim me for your own under your tyrranous and callous rule. And own me you will. For I am, and have always been, yours to conquer. xx"

Why were years of a relationship wasted on something that was never going to work? I dislike vulnerability. I disliked opening up. I dislike intimacy. I did it all, and in the end my heart was still broken. My bitter and petty heart cannot understand what is yet to come. I feel lost, alone, and angry. Why did someone rob so much of my life just to hurt me? I hate that love is such a risk. I thought he was my forever. He isnt."

I was too. I danced too much and drinked a little bit more than I was supposed to. I ended up losing track of time. I went yesterday with two male friends, you noticed one of them as you told me after. He went a little bit far on his drinks and I accompanied him to pee because I thought that perhaps he could fall and hurt himself. Then I saw you again, but I confused you with a girl, I'm pretty sure that it was because of your long hair, it's beautiful by the way. It fits you well. Anyhow, you weren't okay. I saw you throwing up but I thought you were with your friends, they were many by your side, you were fine. When I came back, you were alone and my heart was filled with a mixture of pain, will to care and fear. I didn't know you that time, you might think that somehow I was trying to take advantage on how you were. But I dediced that I wouldn't care to any of this. You were needing help, right? It was my duty as a nice human being to help you, at least I would do my best for you to be okay. That was when I went and talked to you. Geez. You were throwing up so much that I was scared. I could see your eyes wandering around trying to find a balance in the middle of that heap of alcohol you swallowed. You asked for help and I said I was there to help you. You said that your friend disappeared and you couln't find him, you said that you thought that he might have left. You were right and I was trying not to believe that your friend would've done something like that. During our short conversation there, really short because you often stopped me or yourself to throw up. You gave me your name, your adress and your phone. One of my friends were really scared to see how vulnerable you were and that you might be robbed if we let you like that. I agreed and offered to call a uber for you, that you promptly accepted. I lifted you up and carried you to the car. My two friends were to high to even help me to that and I had to carry you by myself. It wasn't easy, you know? I asked you and you told me that you weigh 70 kilos and are six feet tall. I carried you with my humble 47 kilos and five feet tall. I need to agree with my friends that was a pretty funny scene. I put you in the car and you hugged me really strong, thanking me for my generosity but I didn't really care. I would certainly do it again. You got home and I verified through the app, at least you were safe at home and not in the streets. I wished the story would finish here, I really did, because if I'm writing this today it's because of that message you send me in the morning and the bunch of messages that we exchange during the day. You were really thankful for what I did to you, even though I was only ""doing my job"" I thought it was really nice of you coming to talk to me in the next day. You treated me pretty fine and I could get the chance to know how funny and kind you are. You seemed a nice guy and today you still seem. Even though I wanted not to care about this, I ended up caring. Because I opened a part of myself that wasn't open for some years. My vulnerability. You weren't the only person who was vulnerable there, I was too, it was just in different aspects. I find myself really having a hard time to open to people and I see myself often putting my expectations on myself really low, I often caught myself saying to people how I don't worth shit when it comes to relationships, how people deserve better than me, how they should get away from me in the first chance they have. But I opened up pretty fine with you today, right? We got along really well and I didn't found it hard or unpleasant for me to speak 10 hours straight with someone I barely know. For that, my whole self is thanking you for touching my soul this way. We don't know each other but you gave me hope to realise that there's still good things on me. You gave me hope that someday I will be totally able to open to someone, it doesn't matter if is going to be a friend, a partner or a SO, but someday I will be able to look at me and see that my traumas have left my body, just like you got rid of yours by throwing up. I'm really glad I met you and mostly, I'm really glad that I helped you. Z, you really are a nice person and a nice guy, with a beautiful long hair and spectacular eyes. Hope you can find your limits in the next party. Anyway thank you. Hope we can keep in touch. With love, Nat."

Let go of the anxiety that follows you like a fowl stench. I can never tell if it is entwined in my bones or simply an illness you carry that I am most susceptible. The only notion in which I am positive is that when you are near, when your voice touches my ears, when your form fills my eyes, I am jaded. I am transported to a box, a smallness of self, a sense of less than. I would rather death itself steal my breath than breathe you in one last time. Let go of the fear stitched and bow-tied at my chest. I recognize this fear as the skin I wear, stretching over my bones; a poison in my veins that aches in my stomach. This mold had already festered within my heart from a lost childhood, but you were the moisture that fed the growth; every doubt of love I ever had came true in our time together. I wore a veil of ignorance, it always matched so well with my gown of indifference. With my sight clearing of a desperation for love, I grow weary of closeness. I cannot be fixed by another anymore than I desire to fix others. Let go of the worry that weighs upon my back. I used to think so much of you before myself; I let go of myself and my desires to satisfy what you needed. I am free of that. I no longer wish to carry the burden of your love. Your love does not satisfy what I need and I have chosen to love myself instead. I have been taught to protect others before myself and I refuse to continue on that path. How you feel is not more important than how I feel and I will no longer put you above myself. What others think and feel will not come before what I think and feel. I free myself of outward judgement. Letting go of you releases the person I became with you. I reject the pain you carried into me. I reject the hurt and insecurity you projected at me. I reject you from my sanctuary as you are a villain to my serenity. I take responsibility for my trespasses on your freedoms. I regret colluding in such toxicity. The reality I lived felt like a dark forest; barren trees ripped the soil of the earth as they greedily reached toward the sky. My heart lie as the soil, my needy desire to be validated manifested in those spindly branches, and you were the sky... ever unreachable. A nightmare does not serve justice upon the internal purgatory I had condemned myself to as I accepted behaviors that slaughtered my self-worth. I will not be a slave to fear of abandonment again. I have stood beside myself, no matter the odds. I have accepted myself for the treacherous, wholesome being I am and I take myself by the hand in an immortal pact of protection. I wish the same onto you. Our memories are soiled in my mind. In vulnerability, there is not one without the other; without happiness, you cannot have sadness. Without trust, I cannot have love. What destroyed me the most was not who, not how, not even why. When, when is the mistress that tempted my mind to leap. From start to finish, there were always lies. To let someone see so much of me, believing they were showing the same, only to watch that faith spoil like rotten fruit from the truth spilling from your lips disgraced even the loveliest of moments. What we shared could not be called love, though I see how we mistook the abuses we suffered and inflicted as passion. I do not hate you. I wish no ill will upon you. Instead, I hope the best for you and encourage you to heal the wounds within yourself. You have left a gaping hole that I will fill with compassion and patience. My only desire is to resolve my anguish and leave it in the past where it belongs. I let go to be free. I am free."

I miss everything about you. Even when we fought I wouldnt have done it with anyone else. I miss your smile, your goofiness, the way your farts would stink up the room. I miss the part of you that you wouldnt show to anyone else, your vulnerability, your self-doubt, how you stressed over every little thing, I miss holding you and calling you baby and just being in your presence. You have such a great soul and even though we are not together anymore I couldnt think of even being with another person the way I was with you. Youre my other half. You fit so perfectly inside my heart. I dont think Ill ever be able to forget how much of an impact you had on my life. I try to push these thoughts away like it doesnt matter, like its time to move on. But I know myself. It will take years to get over you. You were everything I was searching for and more. I understand now that me as I am was not enough for you. That I left too much room for doubt and worry in our relationship. I understand now that as lost as I felt, you were even more so. You need constant reassurance, love, and stability. I couldnt provide the stability. Not as I am. I hope to meet you again some day I really do. Its selfish of me to say but I want to make you regret letting me go. I just wish the amount of love I felt for you, you could have felt for me. But you were already guarded, too afraid. We rushed this. We moved way too fast. That was my fault. I just finally saw what I had been searching for and I couldnt wait any longer for it. I love you. But its time for me to let you go. This is goodbye my love."

Life is really difficult, and most people in this world aren't really who they make themselves out to be. The world feels dangerous and cruel, and sometimes it feels like you might not be strong enough, or wise enough, or just enough to make it through on your own. If you're feeling like you don't know how to do life alone, you're not alone. So many of us are learning too, and it's an almost universally an ungraceful process. You will fuck up, and make stupid choices, and you will wonder why you're not better. You will wonder why you drink too much, or smoke too much, or do whatever too much. You will tell yourself that you are a mess, that you need a crutch and it's too much. But THAT'S OK. You're hurting and this is new, be kind to yourself. Let yourself make mistakes, be a mess, whatever it takes. Because that's the only way to grow, to move on, and to build the tools you need to be someone who doesn't need someone else to be OK. Forgive yourself for not being perfect all the time, you're learning something new. Maybe you have never been alone before, or maybe you have but it was a long time ago and you don't know how to do you. In any case, learning any skill takes work, and everyone makes mistakes. Love yourself, learn from your mistakes, and trust that there is a better, stronger, wiser future you down the road no matter how long it takes. Let others in your life love you too. I promise, ""the people that mind don't matter and the people that matter don't mind"". It's true, some people that matter might act like they mind. But they are just worried about you, they don't understand what you're going through. The ones that matter though, will still stand by you. Try to be patient with them too, it's not easy watch someone you love go through something tough when you feel like there's nothing you can do. With regards to the new. Many people will let you down when you need them the most, or abuse your trust and vulnerability by being kind until it's no longer convenient to be. You're already hurting, and it's easy to close yourself off to the possibility that there are people in this world who will understand what you need without making you feel needy. Who will love you, no matter how broken you might be. It takes a LONG time, but eventually, if you believe, people will come along that restore your faith in humanity. Maybe they aren't a life partner. Maybe they are people you meet on a trip you take alone. Maybe they are the door staff that checks IDs at the bar down the corner from where you live. Maybe they are your officemate, or your new roommate or your little sister's assistant that checks on you. If you let yourself, there are so many people in this world that genuinely will care for you when you are in need, in all sorts of ways. And they will be the bricks that help you put your life together piece by piece, until eventually, you can look at your life and say, ""this is what I built, this is ME, and I am happy."""

It was one of the toughest decisions I've made in a long while because we both know I'm hopelessly in love with you. My fingers grazing the screen and ultimately choosing our fate was met with intense anguish and sorrow. Instant crocodile tears welled up in my eyes and threatened to unglue my long, faux lashes. Those damn eyelashes you would joke about. In the end, I was the one who became unglued. I fell too hard, cared too much, and hurt myself in the process. Being the eternal optimist that I can be, I always held onto a tiny glimmer of hope that you would come around even for just a little bit of time. And we could be happy together. Life isn't a fairytale, however, and it sure as hell isn't fair. You can't help who you love or don't, just as I can't help my emotional vulnerability and sensitivity. I'm so sorry if I hurt you the last time we talked, as that was not my intention. Self preservation finally kicked in, albeit pretty late in the game. Unknowingly (or knowingly) you hurt me this past month. A deeper connection and friendship is all that I wanted from a person I held in such high regard. But you wouldn't let me in emotionally, and any chance to spend real quality time together was turned down. I didn't know the last time would be it for us, but I could sense it. You hustled me out of there with lightning speed, which made me feel so disgusting and cheap. What if I told you that very night I hauled myself and all the kids to the store just to buy you a small token of my love, something stupid to brighten your day. Nothing. I received nothing, not even a simple thank you from you. I felt so fucking stupid and still do. I guess I thought I could win you over just by being me, but I was never good enough for you. Maybe I'm not the most attractive or fit (currently working on this weakness), but I'm the most fiercely loyal in love and friendship. I would have had your back, but I wasn't going to force my way into your heart. I grew tired of putting myself out there in the cold when I deserved to be inside doing what I do best: loving and supporting. I really don't know where life will lead either of us, but I'm sorry our journey together will end here. I'll miss the hell out of you and wish I was stronger person than I am. I'll continue to pray for you and wish you well because I do believe you are a great person with a good heart...there was just no room for me in it. I hope you find whatever and whomever you're looking for. Much love. Goodbye."

Things are different now. I know now. **I know.** I know you have it in you to hurt me as much as you did, devastating. Our connection, nevertheless great, is tainted until proven otherwise.

Without knowing anything about me, you started a conversation. You were having a hard day and my heart ached for you. The truth is that even though I couldn't admit it - I understood your pain because it was once my pain too. And that kind of pain - the pain of loss and the devastation that comes from love that should have never hurt - it's unforgettable. In that moment of raw vulnerability, you saw me and I saw you. Except you didn't see the pieces that I'm struggling to put back together. You saw me as a whole, and you told me that you saw someone who you want to befriend. You told me that I was someone you were grateful for having met. You told me that you didn't see the darkness within me - only light. Your words were simple and pure, and each word meant the world to me. Months later, you would tell me that you love me, and for the first time in my life, I would believe it. After years of feeling like a living corpse, I would finally feel alive. Today, I can say that I am worthy of the kindness of strangers. I am worthy of the warmth of a lover. I am worthy of the giddy excitement that comes from experiencing something truly good for the very first time. I hope you can too. Oh and by the way, I love you too. \- E"

Ive witnessed what this has done to several people. Ive also drained such emotions into letters of my own. Id scrawl out the emotional potency in hopes that releasing my thoughts would help them diminish. At first, it helped. It really did. I was hurt. I felt as if I had been reduced to nothing. So I let myself go. I let myself say all the things that I knew Id never let you hear. Most of the things I wrote were immediately taken down because the vulnerability of it all was terrifying. I didnt want you to find anything, but that wasnt exactly how things went. I dont mind all that much, though. The truth of it all is that I should have been upfront with you about my emotions, anyways. Im guilty of black and white thinking, too. It seems as if there isnt really an objectively right or an objectively wrong path. These options are only just decisions. And decisions affect people and the world both positively and negatively, regardless of what choice is made. At least, this seems to ring true for the most part. Sometimes one decision is certainly wrong in comparison to the other, but I cant tell you this. Im just afraid. Im worried about you, and I dont want this to eat you away. This is hurting you, and Im concerned that one path in particular will rip you to shreds. However, Ill help you through whatever path you venture down because I care about you immensely and because you make life so much better. Ill cut the sappy shit, but sometimes a little bit of wholesome is necessary to communicate how much you mean. I cant just spew incoherent nonsense all the time. Shits and giggles aside, I seriously want what is best for you, but I cant make these choices for you. Know that I will stick around. As far as Im concerned, this is a promise. Im sorry. Im sorry for all the grief that my emotions and my unsent letters brought you. Im sorry about the other unsent letters, too. It is so much easier to just feel things without involving other people sometimes, but this hasnt been healthy. Its not that I can control or change your current situation, but I wish I could. Youre a wonderful person, and you deserve to be legitimately content. You deserve the boundless happiness that Ive only ever read about in those awful teen romance books that I secretly enjoy. Ew. I disgust myself. Theres a lot going on. Dont worry too much about me, alright? We can think about things a little bit down the road, but youve got a lot on your plate right now. You need to sort out the present, and even this will take time. Both the near and far future, respectively, are drenched in spookiness. I know that there is so much that I havent experienced. I know that there is so much that I dont know. This doesnt prevent me from understanding what youre feeling, though. Please know that I will listen. Please know that I will do all in my power to help you. Please know that Ive put my emotions aside in this situation because I respect you and because I actually care about you. Im done with these letters. While most of them are gone, that doesnt change the fact that they were once discovered. I dont know how to tell you this, but I want to. Not only am I afraid of hurting you, but Im afraid that I hurt her. Im afraid that Ive hurt myself by so frequently putting my feelings out there. I was so incredibly dumb, and I still am. I just wont be making the same mistakes. If theres anything you need to know, you can always ask. Have the certainty that I will be entirely honest with you, because that is the truth. Katie"

The fire and butterflies all at once I thought I was done with crushes and admiration. But it was my first year in college and I felt that this was something new. You were the one that pursued me and tried so hard to break my shell; admittedly I was not only shy but awkward as well. You were wild, couldnt be tamed or held down but you lifted me out of dark place and little did I know, I did the same for you. 3 months later and I couldve sworn that I found love and that you were it, but convinced myself I was naive and it was too soon. But nobody had me as swoon as this before. 2 months later I also found out how it truly felt to have allowed myself to be vulnerable just to have my heart crushed. I wallowed in self-pity and hate and depression just desperately trying to find remnants of myself that were still filled with joy. Found myself not enjoying the company of others but I tried so hard to believe I did. Half a year later our paths are fully connected once again, close friends with benefits was all we were. I wanted you in my life as more than a friend, but kept up with this on and off for another year. Fell into a couple dark pits along the way, losing myself to have you only halfway. Somehow just to end up with each other again, this time around in a relationship where I thought to be secure. 3 months in and you said I love you, as tears were streaming down my face as I talked about how I believe in God but felt that he has never shown me a sign. I dont believe you telling me this for the first time was Gods sign, but thats another story. But I told you that I love you too and that Ive always loved you. If my hazy memory doesnt fail me, you asked me when did I know or since when. And I told you Ive known since I met you. Ive loved you for the past 3 years and its been full of joy, my happiest moments, first moments, vulnerability, pain, and patience. Maybe the universe brought me back to my person, maybe not. But I sure hope this is it."

Its like having an organ excised. The odds of you reading this are negligible; and in the event you do, I expect no response. But I need you to know, that I know precisely what it is I have lost. Something unlike I have ever experienced, with someone unlike I have ever met. Im not so nave, to think that it would have been sunshine and roses all the time. But I think it would have been very, very good. I regret profoundly depriving us both of that. And I regret that I learned so little about you. And I regret that when you chose to be vulnerable, I betrayed that vulnerability. I regret my terrible choices and unexamined decisions. Every bad thing thats happened the past year, I wished you were beside me; and every good thing I wanted to share with you. I am sorry. I am embarrassed. I am ashamed. Ill never know if I broke your heart. Suspect that I did. Hope that I didnt. And this is worth nothing, I know  because I did, I was not done unto, I am responsible for my current condition but I damn sure broke my own."

She will never leave you. She will stay friends with you until you come back to her. She will always stand by your side even when you fuck her over again. Its only a matter of time before it happens again because you will never feel fire in your soul with anyone else so youll always be searching. At first its great....the adrenaline rush you get with a new one, but in time you will be disappointed and move on to the next like you always do. Youll always want me but will always be too scared to do anything about it. I can shatter your heart into a billion pieces and you dont like the vulnerability and uncertainty with me. You would rather be in control. You would rather be the one to call the shots. Thats fine...cause Im calling this one. Dont find me again. Dont pathetically stand by and make me feel guilty about having have a life with someone else when you yourself refuse to say fuck it and fight for the one girl you never got over. Forget me as if I didnt exist and Ill do the same because we did it so well the first time.... *So heres to this lifetime of purgatory hell of our sick distorted love.* -The one you always loved and and the one that never was. -AND the one who could never really hate you."
398,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,I'm still here,3,cl1mkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/cl1mkm/im_still_here/,2019-08-02 19:02:10,"It's been what, almost a year since the last contact between us? Some days I find myself missing you. Missing the good times with the laughter, private jokes and love. There was a lot of that. Especially at the start. Things were so damn perfect, we shared everything. No other person on this planet knows me like you do. You became everything to me. That's what made it so much harder when the laughter stopped. When your words of understanding and support became words of disgust and hate. That's why I truly beloved every hate filled thing you said to me. You convinced me that I would be better off dead. That everyone around me would be so much happier without my presence. You alienated me from everyone I love and who loves me. They were confused and hurt which only concreted in my head that you were right. All I did was hurt people and I'd be better off dead. When you hit me that first time I genuinely thought it was my fault. As the beatings (there's really no other word for what you did to me that that, is there?) became a daily thing, you had me utterly convinced that it was my fault. That I deserved every punch, every hate filled scream. Every threat to kill me. How could you do that to me? I loved you, you told me you loved me too. You spent so much time and effort breaking me piece by piece. I know it was because you couldn't deal with the emotional and mental pain you felt, but why did you have to take every secret, insecurity an vulnerability I trusted you with and use them against me? How am I ever meant to trust anyone fully again? How will I ever be truly happy again? I am so emotionally exhausted, but I feel like I'm not allowed to be because of all of the things you've said. Because I deserved it, truly deserved it in your eyes and even my own. I want to forgive you, I really really do. I want to be able to let go. To finally move on with my life. How do I do that when everything reminds me of you? I can't walk through a grocery store without getting flashbacks to that day. You know the one I mean. What I desperately want to know, what I need to know, is why me? Did you pick me because I was an easy target? I must have been, because you chose me. You spent so much time and effort prying every single deep, dark, and shameful thing about me out. You told me you cared, you just wanted to help. Then, when you had everything, when you knew all of me, you turned. I was there for you, if you called I ran, how many countless nights did we spend together while you had a crisis? Even though I knew what would happen, I still came running to heel. I nearly dropped out of college. I never got to go to my graduation. I barely talk to anyone from that time because they just serve as a painful reminder of you. I am a mess of a person, but God dammit I am still here. I stood up and said enough. Even though I kept so much of the hatred you taught me to have for myself, I am still f*cking here. I am working so hard to improve. To feel better. To be better. But I am enough. I am good just the way I am. I am kind, I care, I try to help. You didn't take that from me, you didn't make me lose sight of what I know to be right. You wanted to break me so that you weren't the only shattered thing, and you almost did. That night with the pills, all of the times I stood on that railway bridge feeling nothing but acceptance of what was to come. There was always some part of me that said no. That said things could get better, that they WILL get better. You didn't break me, and I feel sorry for you. You will always be this person. This person who tries so hard to break people and bring them down to make yourself feel bigger. I will continue to work hard, to fight every day for what I know I can be. Because I'm still here, and I am stronger than you will ever know, I am good enough, I am strong enough. I love every flaw, every insecurity and every other part of myself, because they show me that, despite it all, I'm still f*cjing here."
399,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,To My Ex-Roommate,3,clnmzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/clnmzv/to_my_exroommate/,2019-08-04 06:46:27,"To you- We met after I responded to your ad in the paper (I know, Im aging us here). You were looking for a roommate to split the rent with at an apartment in the city. It was perfect timing I was also looking for a cheap place to stay and I just happened to come across your ad first before I had even begun properly looking. I always thought was strangely convenient. Had your post been in the prior weeks paper or the week after, I would have never seen it. It would have been easy for us to remain strangers. I like to think it was lifes way of steering me back in the right direction. I was incredibly lucky. I never took that for granted. It happened in April. It was frigid and bleak out so I asked you to meet me for coffee at that crowded little caf a couple of blocks from our place. I dont even think you liked coffee, looking back on it now, but you graciously agreed to it. I remember my first impression of you like it was yesterday. I noticed you were very intelligent and well-read, just in the manner in which you spoke to me. I have met many men in my lifetime but none that could carry on a conversation as well as you could. You had a depth to you that others had lacked and when you spoke to me you made direct eye-contact. You were fully present with meaningful ideas and observations. You didnt mumble, turn away, or give one-word responses to my questions. You didnt ask any prying questions in return, the kind with hidden or alternative intent. You didnt ask if I had a love interest and you didnt seem to care about my appearance. You just wanted to have a discussion and you were there, ready and willing. I respected you and trusted you immediately. We spent that entire afternoon chatting as you watched me down five cups of coffee. We got along very well. We shared a lot of interests and hobbies, we had similar tastes in almost everything, and we both enjoyed making each other laugh. The back and forth we developed was instantaneous. I dont know how many people in the world have that specific type of tte--tte, but I feel like that was a unique feature we shared. We developed a sense of rapport very quickly without actually knowing each other. And as the dark set in for the night, you told me that you had enjoyed our talk and that you would see me again tomorrow, just as a close friend would. You nodded at me and you casually walked away. There was never a formal agreement that we were going to be roommates. It felt like an unspoken pact we were making together. I think we both just assumed after that introductory meeting that we would continue onward. So, we did. Our new apartment was barren, damaged, and decrepit. We had prepared ourselves for it, considering the low cost of rent and the years of neglect the aged building had experienced, but we saw its potential even still. We got to work scrubbing out the stains of prior tenants who had left their marks before us. We bleached the surfaces, dusted the cobwebs from the nooks and crannies, and tried our best to polish the warped hardwood flooring. I spent hours cleaning the discolored tile in the bathroom with a toothbrush while you tried to unclog the kitchen sink. We even repainted the walls, although we could never completely cover the persistent watermarks that lingered. We tried our best to start with a clean slate, knowing that this would be the place we would inhabit regularly. We knew it would take work but we were excited nonetheless. After all of the initial formalities were finished, we set about making our place feel more lived in. We filled our small living room with our collections of books, records, and VHS tapes. We pinned up our numerous shared movie posters (which ended up being our wallpaper after a while) and I hung sheer, colored tapestries in front of the windows. We scoured local thrift stores for cheap furniture and settled on a 1970s, orange velvet couch and chair. We had an equally garish lime green/ yellow shag rug that always smelt like mildew. Our Chinese lanterns and kitchen table came from the street where they had been abandoned for trash. Our meager 12 TV with built-in VCR sat atop stacked milk crates that I draped a patterned blanket over. You placed your paints and easel in the corner next to the Juliet balcony and I had a small writing desk in the opposite corner that was always littered with school papers and textbooks. We each had a private bedroom that we could retreat to if need be (and we often did). It was a bizarre spot we created, thats for sure. It was mismatched, outlandish, and gaudy, but it was our place that we built together. It was our home. The first few months together were casual and easy. You were a starving artist doing freelance work and working at a convenience store on the side, and I was a law school student who lived off waitressing tips. We didnt spend a lot of time together in the early days because we were both busy, but when we did come back together, it was if we had never been apart. We suffered from insomnia so we spent late nights sharing a bowl, some bargain boxed wine, and watching the tackiest b-movies we could find. You always had your quippy, witty comments that made me wheeze with laughter. I remember being in tears over some of the things you said, clutching my stomach and rolling on the couch. You were so funny. That was one of my favorite things about you. I wasnt nearly as funny as you, but you always laughed along to show you appreciated my attempts. That was one of your many, subtle kindnesses. We got even closer as time went on. I looked forward to coming home every night to you, shedding my work clothes and putting on a t-shirt, grabbing a beer, and venting about my shitty day at work or school. You vented as well. We commiserated over our uncertain futures and about not being good enough at what we did. I think we both felt like loners, shunned failures, and factory rejects and we bonded over that. We were strictly platonic of course, but that didnt stop me from absent-mindedly running my fingers through your hair or along the nape of your neck while we listened to music together. You would, in turn, offer to rub my aching feet after I stood on them all day, but only if I was wearing my dog-patterned socks or my glow in the dark t-rex socks that you thought were cute. It wasnt always perfect. We had several ugly fights as people who live in close quarters tend to do. I would cry and slam my bedroom door in your face, locking it behind me. You would yell and storm out without telling me where you were going, disappearing for days. We never did get our security deposit back because you punched a hole in your bedroom wall. I expressed my pain through tears and you through anger. We had periods where we would ignore each other completely. We always made up in the end though. I would make that homemade macaroni and cheese recipe you liked, served in that misshapen red bowl that I made for you in my pottery class, and you would begrudgingly accept it. You would make a joke that you knew was sure to make me smile and I would forget what I was even upset about to begin with. I cant remember there being many actual apologies made between us but we had an understanding of when to move forward without them. We cared about each other enough to put our issues aside and continue with the good times. Not everyone can do that. We also shared our traumas. We traded stories of abuse, mistreatment, failures, and let downs. We discussed those who hurt us, those we could never forgive, and those we had lost. Sometimes I would wake up screaming from nightmares about my past, shaking uncontrollably and overcome with anxiety. I would sneak into your room, nudging you awake and asking if I could sleep in your bed. Just this once, I would promise, but we both knew that was a lie. You would never respond, you would only wordlessly lift your blanket, allowing me to slide in next to you. We never did anything sexual it wasnt about that. It was about the comfort of being there beside you, feeling your warmth, hearing your breathing, and knowing I was safe for the night. I had the deepest sleep whenever I was able to be next to you. I felt so secure with you there. You were my protector in so many ways. Then there were your dark days as I called them. The days where you wouldnt leave your room at all. I would worry about you, knocking on your door to check-in, but you wouldnt respond. I would ask if you wanted cereal or if you wanted to watch TV, but there would be silence in return. I would sit alone in the quiet living room, fidgeting with my hands, impatient and concerned. Of course, I knew you were just in the next room and I could hear movement now and then, but I was still uneasy. I wanted to make sure you were okay. Then, after a time, you would reappear suddenly as if nothing had happened. I would feel such relief that I never asked what had occurred. This was a routine we developed. I was okay with your process, even though I had a hard time understanding it. I made you promise you would always reappear and you did. Once I had that reassurance, I was okay letting you do your own thing. We continued to fill our apartment with warmth, laughter, music, art, books, philosophy, spirituality, movies, and memories. We celebrated birthdays and holidays. We got drunk and made fools of ourselves. We were both homebodies who never went out unless we were forced to, with the exception of the local used bookstore, the karaoke bar, the movie theater, and the Chinese restaurant we got our takeout from (I apologize for the amount of Chinese food you had to consume while living with me). We were so close we often said the same things at the same time. We would finish each others sentences. We knew each others behavior and how each of us would react if we said or did something. We knew each others strengths and weaknesses. We knew each other so well after such a short amount of time. We developed a sort of code that only the other could decipher. It was easy and effortless being with you. It was like breathing. It was second nature. It was habit. It felt good and it felt right. My feelings about you began to change as we continued living together. When you smiled at me, I would linger a little too long on your face. You were so good looking. Before I would wash our laundry at the laundromat, I would bury my face in your shirt, inhaling your smell while strangers looked on with raised brows. When I showed you my grades, I became too eager for your reaction. When you showed me your paintings, I fawned a little too hard and asked for more, always wanting more. And when you shared your bed with me on those frequent anxious nights of mine, I had to resist every urge to press my body tightly against yours, wrapping my arms around you. I knew I was falling in love with you and I did not want to. I did not want to ruin what we had together the one positive and reliable thing I had in my bleak world. I fought my feelings. I tried to distance myself from you by spending more time away from our apartment, taking extra shifts, and studying at the library instead of at home. I think you mustve noticed because you would question where I had been whenever I finally came home. There she is, you would say. I think you were worried that I was dating someone on the side without telling you or that I was thinking of moving out when in reality, I wanted you so desperately it was killing me. One of the last nights we were together, we had one of the deepest talks weve ever had. There was no music or TV on in the background like there wouldve been typically, it was just you and I facing each other on our couch. You were telling me stories about your old friends from high school, excitedly and hurriedly, and I was there listening and admiring you, reveling in every second of it. I thought about everything we had ever talked about, all of the confessions and the words shared. I thought about all of our good times and our bad times, all of the memories we had created together. I thought about our connection and the circumstances. And I thought about you and about what an amazing, one-of-a-kind person you were. How I could see us doing this forever and how content it would make me to spend the rest of my days with you in our place. That spot we created together that brought me so much joy and comfort where I had none otherwise. I loved you not just because of who you were and the things you did for me, but because you were the partner who helped me build meaningful things worth keeping. You became home for me. Eventually, we went to our separate rooms for the night, but the ideas that began to formulate in my head kept me from getting any sleep. I knew that I had to tell you. It couldnt go on like that, with me drooling over you and my urges getting more intense as time went on. It wouldnt have worked, you know. It wouldnt have been fair for either of us if I lied and pretended there was nothing there. I didnt want to hide anything from you because our closeness was developed from our honesty and vulnerability. It wouldve gone against what we stood for together. So, I chose to tell you the next day. I cannot say if I regret it or not, but it triggered a painful chain of events that still hurt to think about. When I said it to you, you were angry. You yelled at me and started trashing the apartment. You were furious. I cant ever remember a time you were that mad and I was caught off guard. I couldnt understand it and all I could do was watch in shock as you tore down our place around us. I tried to calm you down but you werent having it. I was scared. I tried to defend myself against some of the insults you said but you were persistent. I lashed out in return. I made the mistake, out of hurt and anger, of telling you to get out forever. To leave and never come back. To get lost. That you were an asshole. That you were a cruel man. So, understandably, you left. You packed a bag, grabbed your keys, and you slammed the front door so hard on your way out that our little TV fell on the floor and broke. You disappeared just like that. If you only knew how hard I cried that night if you can even call it crying. I screamed and I wailed to the point of bursting blood vessels around my eyes. It went on for hours. I lost track of time. The next few days all blended together as I went on a bender. I called out of work and skipped class. I got wasted and I took pills. I did other unhealthy things that I shouldnt have. I threw myself around like a rag doll when you were gone. You came back a week later with multiple boxes and I desperately pleaded for you to stay, telling you how sorry I was on a loop. You wouldnt speak to me or even look at me. You just began to pack. Its like I wasnt even there and you left again. Movers came and took your bed and other furniture away the next day. I remember seeing the dust outlines in your bedroom and the hole in your wall, but that was it. Thats all I had left of you. The remaining days I had in our apartment were very quiet and hopeless. Without your voice, laughter, and all of your stuff filling the place, it felt empty and pointless. I was stunned at how quickly I went from almost having all of you to having none of you at all. I laid on our couch in misery. I didnt eat. I didnt sleep. I didnt do anything except for drink, hurt myself, and berate myself for what happened. I blamed myself for everything. I missed you so much. When I tried to communicate with you, I only received silence in return. I felt like you had died and I was grieving your loss. It put me in a deep depression. I was lonely and I was scared of being alone. I did not want to be alone without you. When I drifted to sleep during the day, nightmares would force me awake, but you were no longer there to comfort me and take me in. I became paranoid, convinced that shadows in the apartment were intruders trying to harm me. I told myself you had found another woman and were probably living with her, that you two were laughing about me somewhere. That you would fall in love with her and get married and I would find out in passing. I believed I would never hear from you or see you in person ever again. That all of the meaningful things I had held onto for comfort and safety had disappeared along with you. That I would never feel that intense connection with anyone else. The day came where I had to move out of our once shared apartment. They raised the rent and I could no longer afford to live their alone. I didnt want to leave. I felt like I was abandoning my home and all of the good times we shared there together, but I knew you were never coming back. I had to give it up and I had to let it go. It was an excruciating process for me. I had to put another ad in the paper looking for another roommate when I didnt want another one. I wanted you back. I knew that no other roommate would compare. I knew that I could not replace you. Believe me when I tell you that I never wanted to and that I never have, even after all of this time apart. I think I know why you left and I dont blame you. It was just too much for you. All of it. You were overwhelmed, confused, and disoriented from the things I said. You mightve been resentful of me for ruining what we had together and for destroying a good thing. I had become too much of a responsibility, liability, and burden for you and you already had so much to personally deal with. When I told you I loved you, you probably felt like I was putting all of my expectation onto you and you cant stand that. You dont want to hurt anyone, you dont want to have any potential of letting anyone down, and the easiest way of doing that is to leave and remove yourself from the equation. Disappointing others is one of our mutual fears and I think it was that fear that sparked your anger that night. I know that it hurt you just as much as it hurt me when you left. I know that you suffered in your own way. I know that you felt the guilt that I did and the remorse that I did as well. I think that you missed me too. I think you felt the loss just the same and you knew just as well as I did that it was a special thing we had together. That the apartment we had, despite its flaws, was a wonderful apartment. I want you to know that even after everything and all of the time we spent apart, that I still love you. I cant say what type of love it is for certain. At times it feels familial and other times it feels romantic, but there is some form of love there. I have been through hell and back with you and for you time and again, but its the love I have for you that allows me to return with ease. I do love you. I am so sorry for everything weve had to endure and the length of which we have had to endure it. I wish I could erase those negative words; those insults we slung at each other out of pain, and that I could change what happened. I cant though. All I can do is apologize and also forgive you for what happened. We were both responsible and we each had a hand in it. I miss you so much. You have no idea how often I think about you or all of the things Ive been keeping track of to tell you if I were to ever speak to you again. I cant beg you for any more chances together and I dont even know what a new start would like for us. How do you come back from that? How do you come back from this specific type of ridiculousness here? Ive been trying to come up with solutions but I fail to come up with anything plausible. It would be easier for me to determine if and how we could move forward if I knew for certain how you felt, but Im still in the dark on that. Maybe you are too. I truly have no idea what you want. I just wanted you to know that Im still here, fighting the good fight, holding onto what we had and the potential future of what we might have together. I dont know what it looks like but, on my end, that door has never shut. I am still wholeheartedly myself doing what I was doing before, just lonelier and at a lower volume than in the past. I still carry that pain of your absence with me like a necklace around my neck. It wont leave me. I hope if you ever read this, youll consider reaching out to me in the future, even if you do want to say goodbye for good. I would welcome you back with open arms of course, but I understand that you may not want that and I respect your decision. Just please dont let everything we had together end on that note. If you are to leave me forever, please make it a proper ending. Love, Me"
400,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,to the friends i never made,2,cltiej,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/cltiej/to_the_friends_i_never_made/,2019-08-04 16:59:22,"theres no way to explain how much ive fallen in love with your personalities in the such little time we had together. sometimes i create such strong bonds with people in my head without even having a full conversation with them (you two, in this instance) on the last night we gathered in our groups, we had a conversation that i wish wouldve happened much much sooner. we opened up a bit about each other and just talked for about 10 minutes outside until we were told to go back in. admittedly, both of you casually talking about your crazy, same-sex exs came as a shock to me. i felt like we had bonded, but i always fail to realize that vulnerability is a two way street. when the conversation was cut short, i could slowly feel the peak of our friendship decline from there. we went back inside, and my end of the conversation slowly died down as both of you sat next to each other and only looked at me a couple more times that night. you two are some of the many people i let slip away due to my lack of social expertise. theres a good chance neither of you even like me; theres a good chance you think im copying you guys or being weird cause i have a crush on one of you. id like to say i dont care, but i really do. it hurts a lot not knowing what you think of me, all the while remembering the face of slight confusion and annoyance you both gave me towards the end while i gave my goodbyes all the while, i wish you both extremely good lives. the group you two became friends with looked much more fun than i could have ever been, and i hope you all stay in touch and meet each other again some day. im sorry for following one of your instagrams even when you said you didnt want people to know about it. even though its a small action that shouldnt matter, i have a sneaking suspicion that solidified my weird-acquaintance status. to sum my thoughts up, im sad to have not gotten closer with you two, and that our only real (late) conversation was cut short after 10 minutes. although i immensely regret not putting myself out there more and just sticking with the people near me for my small group, im glad to have met you two. you embody the types of people i want in my life and helped me realize that theres more of those out there. id like to imagine us as friends in one of the infinite dimensions theres a good chance ill never speak to you two ever again, so all i really have to say is... godspeed."
401,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,I'm Sorry,13,cn1dcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/cn1dcl/im_sorry/,2019-08-07 14:52:36,"To A: When you indicated back then that you wanted a chance to get to know me better, I just had a hard time believing that someone can show that kind of interest in me. I mean, why would they? I'm a pretty boring person living a quiet and ordinary life. I honestly didn't know what you saw in me. I still don't have the slightest idea. I was just terrified. Just terrified of the fact that you - or anyone else, for that matter - saw me in that way. I panicked and tensed up. I realized through this whole situation that my default reaction in cases like these is to push people away, to run as fast as I can in the other direction. I find it hard to open up, to learn to trust other people to love me, if that makes sense. I've decided to try therapy to address this - I scheduled my first appointment yesterday. I feel like I'm taking a step in the right direction, and I'm not ashamed at all for seeking outside guidance to make sense of all the thoughts racing through my head. I just hope I come out of this process in one piece. I'm scared that this new experience will fundamentally change who I am as a person. I'm nervous that I won't recognize myself anymore after all of this is done. But I'll learn the best I can to adapt to this new version of me. I'll learn how to love myself so that I can figure out how to love other people more fully. I hope I'll finally find the courage to listen to my heart for once instead of my brain, and embrace everything that life has to offer. I love and adore you for showing vulnerability, and for going after what your heart wants. I only hope that I can somehow learn to open up and be able to do the same. Maybe that's why I feel drawn to you - I love and admire you for being so playful and open with what you're feeling in a world where it seems like everyone has their guard up all the time and are only looking after themselves. If I'm going on a trip to hell to face my inner demons - and I'm not sure that they sell tickets down there for the return trip - I don't think I want to drag someone along with me on that ride. That's the truth behind why I disappeared. Not because I moved on or was playing games with you this whole time, but because you deserve better. You deserve to be happy. You deserve someone who can be there for you 100%, not the me right now. And who am I kidding, I'm just terrified that you'll change your mind if you get to know the real me. Honestly, I can be a little too much to handle sometimes. I know you hate me for leaving so abruptly without any explanation, you have every right to be. And I can understand why you find it all so frustrating. To send me signal after signal indicating that you're interested in me, only to see me reach out a little but then pull back again like a wave, for months on end. I'm just so fucking scared of reaching out and letting things unfold naturally, I end up half-assing it and become a creepy lurker. I know, it was a pathetic and immature thing to do. My heart is filled with guilt and anguish, I don't know if I can forgive myself for hurting you. We come from different worlds, our paths were never meant to cross in the first place. But somehow, for some reason, they did. I love you, too. Even if we don't really know each other at all. I'm sorry I'm too much of a damn coward to tell you all of this directly, but I had to get this off my chest somehow. \-M"
402,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,The vulnerability of your beautiful soul,38,bywdql,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/bywdql/the_vulnerability_of_your_beautiful_soul/,2019-06-10 20:50:17,"Z, I title this ""Z"" because you were the last one to catch my gaze. In an instant of looking into your eyes I knew. It's tough to quantify into words but I'll give it a shot. I saw a familiar pain deep inside your soul: loneliness. People don't believe that a beauty such as yourself could ever be lonely. Oh how naive the average person could be. I saw in your your eyes a loneliness that rivals my own. A petite empath that has experienced her uneven share of wrongs perpetrated by those closest to her. Therefore, I want to point out the connection we both felt was unintentional, and with my eyes I promised you that I'm not looking to hurt you. There existed a gravitational pull that kept each other in each other's orbit; but, I sensed your vulnerability and kept my distance. I too, am vulnerable. I easily fall in love and my love is not fleeting. Maybe I kept my distance to protect you, most likely, I did it for self preservation. However, I think about you quite often. I think that if you and I were to have coffee, we would look into each other's eyes and rest there. You seem to extract the remaining trust and belief I have in people - albeit a small remnant. For reasons unexplained, I wanted to care for you like a big brother would for his sister. Due to your vulnerability, I couldn't... Any time alone and we would've fell for each other, I know you know this. I would've made you laugh, and subsequently, cry. I want you to get healthy first without me. I made the mistake in the past and anchoring someone and it never seems to work. The cycle of codependency is never broken when a relationship starts in that fashion. I'm glad I got to meet you, and thank you for trusting me instantly. In turn, I will keep rooting for you at a distance without a word said. I want to end with this: you are internally and externally beautiful ""Z"". Many people will want to capture your beauty and use it to benefit themselves. Be strong, be courageous, and most importantly be yourself. Your style and grace will attract the right people to you eventually and you can finally unleash the powerful love that lives inside you: A volcano of love so powerful that it would overwhelm 99% of men.

You made contact first. We messaged back and forth for three days. The banter, the conversation, the similarity...and in one package, you now are everything I wished for. The eyes are dark, the body is soft and curvy, the assertiveness is inspiring, the confidence is long overdue, the sexual hunger is real and like mine. You do not waste time on anything. You have ambition, you see bullshit a mile away, you don't take any shit from anyone. You are driven, beautiful, funny, warm and real. Your touch is sincere and genuine. You cook, you bake, you keep your big house clean, you build things, you look after people, you have a large family and more friends and you gave me a shot. We met twice, each time, your touch was unlike anyone else's touch, real genuine affection. You don't pretend or act, not pretentious, no fake airs or wanna-be's about you. You took your lumps in life, learned from them, and enjoy talking about your past, the people, the hurt, the disappointments. You talk a lot like me, about your past like me, and you balance the bad with the good you experienced with those people, just like I do. You remember the good and not good and share each side. You admit to fucking up. You don't overdo your appearance. Nothing is excess or over the top. You drink responsibly, eat well, and best of all, you don't tell me what you think I should hear. You stand up for your values and beliefs, and still expose your vulnerability. You don't pretend to be someone or something you're not. I admire that the most. We may be together a week, a month, a year, maybe just a summer romance. But in the end, we both will be better for it. You need me in your life right now. I need you in my life right now. We will learn, grow, have fun, explore, and probably part as friends when things run their course. You are too much for me, I am not enough for you. But right now, this moment in time, we need each other for reasons to be discovered. Thank you for finding me."

406,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Love?,4,c0fwz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/c0fwz2/love/,2019-06-14 14:38:49,"I still dont know if I am capable of love. But when I blurted out I loved you it surprised even me. ((L O V E)) - this daunting, life-changing idea to me. Not a declaration of I enjoy your company and you make me feel worthwhile, but a confession of vulnerability and something inexplicably deeper. Saying I love you is so easy to some. I dont know why I put particular weight on it, why I scoff at my girlfriends saying theyre in love with a dude they (IMO) barely know. I hate that Im so self righteous in my pickiness with that word, loving easily seems to be more joyous and careless than my cynical over-analysis of what I can deem love. But I know that when I said it, it wasnt because I felt I needed you to be complete, it wasnt because I wanted to own you and latch on in order to reap all the self-validation and benefits that a good partner can give ME, it wasnt because I expected you to say it back and we live happily ever after. I love? you because I want the best for you. Sometimes I think/know that isnt me. But I want to be better, be someone Im proud of... So I can feel that my tentative, terrifying idea of loving you isnt a waste of your time and that I can be just as rewarding in your life as you have been in mine. The idea of loving someone when Im unable to love myself goes against my code and any advice Ive given my friends looking for fulfillment by being someones something. Yet somehow the word love seems most apt. Its confusing and makes me feel like a stupid child watching too many rom coms and reading too many fairytales. But we arent a 2D, shallow pit of feel good sentiments and destiny-bound soulmates. We arent grand gestures and we dont have picture-perfect circumstances that fit us together like puzzle pieces looking for their single match. Were raw. Were just two people who randomly found each other and despite our differences it all comes so easily. An unlikely pair who shouldve started parting ways after the initial excitement and butterflies went away, but somehow we are still something. Still simmering happily away together just being two very different people with very different lives and backgrounds, and when we take those weekly hangout nights to just be us together- its unexpectedly pure. Existing together is refreshingly comfortable and natural. We dont overanalyze every word we say or see resentment in calm silences. We occasionally spend hours on opposite sides of the bed, you dealing with work situations and me nose-deep in a book; but our mutual connection is made clear when we can lay together separate in our own mental worlds and unconsciously one always physically reaches out to just be touching the other somehow. Your foot curled against my calf, my hand gently resting on your side, both of us just comfortable with the simple satisfaction of how silences are never awkward or forced but somehow sweet and peaceful and filled with this mutual understanding that we dont feel any pressure to be each others focus or entertainment in that moment. Two souls intertwined without expectation, existing together with unspoken agreement that even mundane, menial tasks or time fillers are somehow better when together. I dont understand it. I dont understand what ((LOVE)) is to an average person. I reject the idea of love as a biological tool by the universe to inspire humanity to keep churning out babies, as a tool to give myself self-worth by being someones everything, as a tool to better my chances at thriving in this world with anothers resources and experience at my request. This love to me is simple recognition that you are a good soul, a good man, and a selfless desire to see you happy and fulfilled in this fleeting life- with or without me. I want to be, and believe that I can be, your rock in the storm. Your partner in crime. Your shoulder to cry on. Your echo and megaphone to absurdly hard laughter at the stupidest things. Your ear to rant to and possibly receive unapologetic insight to other perspectives or explanations of varying viewpoints as I see them. I like how I dont have to see you with rose colored glasses and heighten your ego with superficial compliments and assurance that youre always right. I imagine you think the same of me. We can challenge each other and be honest in our differing thoughts and it doesnt drive a rift between us but rather expands understanding and allows us to see and accept that people just think and feel differently and thats okay. Neither of us want a Yes Man, a blind follower who twists themselves to try and fit the person they think you want them to be. We dont want our partner to be someone we chose because they will faithfully praise us even when we may be wrong. Im rambling. Im sorry. I do that. YOU, the inspiration for this novella of jumbled up thoughts I never wanted to dump on you, really will never read this, and to any other reader whos made it this far- I commend you! I could write a novel of just these same sappy ramblings and personal analysis of romantic love. I can recognize my own narcassicism in thinking this is an interesting insight of thoughts, but I am stuck in a strange loop of self-hatred and self-praise of being not like other girls . Its weird to absolutely despise yourself but still feel some superiority over your peers just because you dont have a Pinterest board dedicated to your dream wedding day, dress, and shiny diamond ring. Introspective enough to see Im still just an average bitch who thinks shes somehow better due to some dismissals of traditional views, yet still happy of that fact. Aaaand selfishly talking about myself in an unsent letter to the man whos unwittingly carved a permanent spot in my heart, no matter what the future looks like for us. I really do want the absolute best for you, and never wish to hold you back. Ive literally told you that before. Ill be okay without you. Youll be okay without me. But man, what if? What if this is it? This is something. And Im so ecstatically terrified to see what a few more years with you will be. Either way, lets continue our pursuits of happiness. Lets better ourselves and keep fighting for what we deserve rather than sink into sullen, empty complacency of good enough, I guess. Apathy and general numbness in our existence isnt an option. And maybe, just maybe, fighting this battle for purpose and contentment wont have to be as two separate individuals, but as a team who can not only just weather the storm together but mutually build a beautiful life for us that seemed impossible for just one lone person to achieve. Differing strengths and weaknesses that equilibrate into an absolute power unit of a couple that carves out a slice of happiness in our world exponentially greater than what you or I could have achieved alone. :)"

408,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,We are not breaking up,6,c1vc8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/c1vc8v/we_are_not_breaking_up/,2019-06-18 10:20:34,"We are not breaking up. Before you get defensive and shut down, hear me out. I know youre going through a lot and life has gotten tough. Youre overworked, worried about your family, worried about me, spending more money because Im not there to help, I get it. I think youre super strong for trying to handle everything. I know your default answers are Im fine and I dont need anyone but I know thats not true. I think youre overwhelmed with feelings and emotions, and its not something recent, its something Im sure youve had since before I met you. Youve always been reluctant to accept nice things, skeptical of the favors I do for you, rude and mean when youre stressed and you take it out on the wrong people. You know you do too much and its not appreciated, and you might say that you dont need appreciation, but youre human, of course you need it. We all do. Heres what I see from an outside perspective: You give too much at work because thats how you value yourself as a person, based on how much you do, the lifestyle you can afford, and how supportive you are to the people you love. I struggled with depression and anxiety really badly and you kept trying to fix me. You always saw something great in me, and you appreciated me, but I could tell it hurt you not being able to solve my problems, and because you couldnt, you thought it would be better to step away and focus on something you actually can improve, like work. At work you know that if you put in the effort, things will go well, its not the same with people and that can be frustrating. When I left things were somewhat rocky. I felt tired of never feeling like I was doing enough, like no matter how sweet and nice I wanted to be, you would still be cold and distant and angry. I want to believe that it was because you felt overwhelmed at work, you wanted to be alone and I was pushy trying to feel like you appreciated me when all you wanted was to breathe. Miscommunication and not knowing how to express our points of view made us see each other as enemies rather than partners. So when you finally had time and the house to yourself you felt free, no need to act nice or friendly if you were tired and moody, you could just shut down and play video games and not worry about all the emotions you felt. But then Id call and I was stressed and tired and worried and crying, you knew you wanted to help, to fix things, but you couldnt, and its overwhelming to not be able to help the people you love. Of course, you missed me and wanted me around, you needed back scratches and mashed potatoes, even if it made you feel needy for wanting those things, thats what you lacked when I left. You also dont want to be materialistic and use me for what I offer you, but you knew you would have loved to have that to feel stronger with everything that was going. You miss me and its annoying. Being sad and angry does nothing when you need to be productive when theres so much going on, when Im not going back, and bills keep coming in. Crying at night on the phone with me wont solve anything and itll only distract you from doing the work you need to keep the money coming and paying bills and helping me. You think that if you cut me off from your life you will feel free and happy, but do you? Since I met you youve always been about work work work. You hardly ever stop to relax and enjoy your life. So yes, breaking up is easy. It hurts, but well move on and well find someone else later on. But thats not how it should be. You wouldnt quit your job just because things are rough, you wouldnt abandon your car because it needs maintenance. Relationships need maintenance too, all of them. Lets face the challenges, do our inner work, have the difficult conversations, your feelings are safe with me. I know youre not always the strong man you show at work and I love you for that. I love your vulnerability and the chances youve given me to be the strong one for you when you simply want to be held. You want to pretend youre fine, strong, independent, hide away from your emotions, but to help you I need you to stop pretending. I know youre not always strong and fine, and I want to help. Youre scared, lonely, sad, tired, Im sure a million other things, not all the time, I know, but it happens at times, and thats okay. All of that is what makes you human, and it means youre doing the best with what you have. You want to do everything by yourself but you dont have to, and I wont be like everyone else who simply believes you when you push them away and leaves you to handle everything on your own. Im tough too, I can handle whatever you go through. Maybe youre scared that Ill be overwhelmed too, that Ill see you differently once you open up, but how can I when I think youre the most wonderful man I have ever met? Maybe youre scared that accepting my help means youll have an extra problem, but thats not the case and you know it. You know Im strong to take care of myself and Ill do that. I love you too much to leave you, especially because you never left me when I needed you. You were strong for me Ill be strong for you, thats what partners do. So be mad, shut down, get angry, Im not going anywhere. Take space, go out, do whatever you need to do to feel ready, but once you are and want to accept my help and my love, Ill be here."

This whole time, I have been upset because my feelings were hurt. The whole entire time, I have wanted to apologize. Ive kept myself above the surface. Fearing of letting myself sink deeper and finding that my feelings are stronger than I have been willing to admit. The whole time that you have been gone- I have been so caught up in my own grief, that I didnt consider your feelings as much as my own. You hide behind the walls you build. These walls that are so strong, it almost makes it believable that youre cold inside. Oh, but you know that I know better. I saw the vulnerability that you tried to cover up. I didnt force it from you, you dont work like that. You showed me for merely being myself. You were my friend. Ohgah, it was so easy to talk to you for hours. Never wanting to end the conversation and sleep. Every second I gave to you, all of that time, I wanted you to have it. There is no other way I wouldve rather spent it. We may no longer speak, but your friendship meant so much to me. I wouldve fought for our friendship if it meant keeping you in my life. I want you to know that I am sorry. Im sorry about the way things went down.. I wish so much that none of this caused you grief. I wish even more to know that youre okay and if you are doing all of the things on your mile long to-do list. You made my heart happy, if even for just a moment. You are worth every second. I know that you dont feel this way most of the time.. but you are. You are capable of so many things. Even just looking at you, I know the possibilities are endless. Over the fence, Milk."
410,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Something from the other day,0,c3j1sv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/c3j1sv/something_from_the_other_day/,2019-06-22 10:48:29,"I don't know if you're still informed of everything that is discussed in the car or around a phone, but perhaps you noticed something on Wednesday if you are. I could be wrong but I don't see this as being yet another setup (as so many have been) as I just the met the dude the day before in rehab and you couldn't have orchestrated this that quickly, unless it was in pre-planning. &amp;#x200B; Background, for those not privy to the realtime. So me and a dude leave rehab, we eventually wind up picking up the girl that is pregnant with his child. I know that addiction and children come with judgement from people probably with no experience in social work or addiction, but I hope you'll reserve judging this person as scum for doing as much. From what I can tell she's just lost but has a good heart. And, as is typical of two active addicts in a relationship goes, distrust and greediness develops. The more selfish (probably the dude) will grow resentful that he isn't as capable of acquiring and maintaining his habit as the female is. Make no mistake that by no means is what they have to engage in easy, and I can only imagine it is degrading. Anyhow, you know the drill. Knowing that she had money he tried to play on her kindness and take what he didn't need as I already got him situated. Well it's obvious any care for her he had, if ever, had been replaced by his care for the drug. He lied, then he talked to her like a damn dog when everything she was saying I already knew was true. Why? Because I've lived it. Because I recognized the past playing out before my very eyes. He's telling her how she's a selfish bitch, after he already is manipulating from the jump. He clearly cares little for the baby she's carrying as he would just leave her without warning and she's got to be atleast 6 months along. He told me to just leave her ass but I wouldn't do it, I'm not going to leave a pregnant woman out in 90\*F heat to fend for herself just because he wants to punish her standing up for herself and stating how she feels. How do I know? I've lived it. Maybe it's like the eye see's but it can't see itself? because it always seems so much easier to identify what's unfolding when it's others than it is myself. Arguing continues for most of the ride. Where she asks him if he cares about anyone other than himself. If he cares about her at all or only came to see her because he thought she could do something for him. He proceeded to tell her that he never asks her that when he gives her the same (I can almost bet that he lies about that, I'm sure he fucks her over at every turn). I so badly want to interject but I never know if it's the right thing. I know when someone is worked up they are unlikely to listen anyways and I don't have any kind of skills or read knowledge on deescalating conflict (clearly). I try to make little remarks, when he isn't with her like I said ""I'm not going to leave her here dude she's preganant and it's hot as fuck out"". So he does the right thing and gets her to get in the car, no escalation or anything. I don't think it would have done any good, but I wish I had told him that if he has any moral fiber in him at all he will regret the way he is treating her later. That I can understand where he is coming from, maybe the shit I've gone through can shed some light? In the end I don't end up saying anything, but when I go to drop them off he starts making threats about how he's going to hit her if she doesn't stfu. I can tell she doesn't want to stay nor do I really feel comfortable leaving her there. She sits in the car for a bit and continues to stall. After he says he's going to make her walk and she can fuck off I wait for him to leave and tell her that I'll give her a ride back out where she was. I mean it's right next to my neighborhood and I was going that way anyway, so it wasn't even a question of out of the way. I think she's trying to find a way to exit without him escalating, so when she asks if I can throw down on cigs I gladly say yes. When she tries to tell him that, he gets pissed and starts the shit I knew would result. ""You aren't leaving with him, no fucking way"". I wish I had just left when he was in the house and wouldn't notice. I wish I didn't feel like a coward for not doing what I know was the right thing. &amp;#x200B; I tried to reach out in a indirect way the next day. I didn't want to just message someone I met the day before and say ""Are you okay? I didn't like leaving you in that situation yesterday and I'm sorry I'm not stronger in my convictions"" because that seems weird and it also could strike up another fight. I only had her number but I figured maybe she would reply. But when I finally got a response it was him so I didn't want to bring it up. I wish showing concern and vulnerability to care didn't feel so difficult for me. I can't rescue her, hell I can't save myself. But she was cute and seemed sweet, but it's not the reason I made the attempt. At the very least she would know that I was worried about if she was ok and that not everyone is cold."
411,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,To the doctor who sexually abused me as a child [TW: GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE],89,c4i88j,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/c4i88j/to_the_doctor_who_sexually_abused_me_as_a_child/,2019-06-24 14:30:23,"It took me years to finally admit to myself that I was a victim. It took years for me to realise what you did was wrong. It took years to begin my healing process, and this is yet another piece of my recovery. My vulnerability presented in writing this letter is not a sign of weakness, but strength. It is strength that I gave myself after continuing to breathe through you holding me by my neck and telling me to be a good girl. It is the courage I took from the ground you buried it in when you called me a fat little pig. It is the confidence that I grew and cultivated when I finally let my boyfriend touch me without recoiling like his hands were fire against my skin. I might be just as vulnerable as the day I was molested and defiled and deflowered and anything else it could be called without saying that damned word that makes me sick once it exits my throat, but with my vulnerability I have created something from this carcass I call my body. I created me. There are things I still can't handle, and things I may never be able to control. I developed dissociative identity disorder amidst the constant abuse, with you and my pedophilic grandmother (who will likely get another letter entirely) constantly damaging my small and frail body. I developed an eating disorder because I couldn't consider myself anything besides a pathetic little piggy- which is what you called me. I lost an entire part of myself within my childhood. My memories are all obscured behind your indescribable cruelty and lust, all thrown upon a six-year-old, barely able to read, just learning how to trust others. I can't stand to look at my doctors, I break down if I'm told to lay down on the hospital bed. Gloved fingers touching my skin make me shiver and rock back and forth in a fruitless attempt to remind myself that those caring and compassionate people aren't you, and I sob when my boyfriend tries to trail his hand up my thighs- attempting to be intimate and loving, but only making me feel like that same empty child I was. The walk-in clinic you worked in was shut down a few years after my trauma, and I have no idea if you were ever brought to justice or if you're even still alive. I can only pray that you're rotting in the ground, getting as close as possible to feeling what I felt when you killed me. I will never remember anything more than the way you looked at me, smiling, but not happily. Dead, cold eyes obscured by square-rimmed glasses. Rough, decomposing hands beneath the latex exterior. Your yellow-toothed grin will be with me every time I shut my eyes, and I hate you more for that than anything you could've ever done for me. Your body could rot down to it's core, but your memory is untouchable. I hope you're in the deepest most vile level of hell, and that you feel just as fucking empty as I do when I have to tell my therapist what you did to me, reliving all of the pain again and again amidst the prescriptions. I'll at least give you the courtesy of an update on my condition; you never did follow up on my appointment all those years ago. I just got top surgery, and am happily living as the man I was meant to be, almost two years on HRT. I have a boyfriend who loves me more than anything, a recently fully-recovered eating disorder, and a life worth living despite you. In short, I'm happy- be it out of spite or otherwise. Oh, P.S.- Fuck you. I never said that outright, did I? Well, hopefully you got the idea anyways."

My instinct said you were a player but I ignored it. I mean,come on,someone who could stay up whole night to talk to me when he had college the next day couldnt be a player,right? I loved how youd always be so confident, I loved how youd talk to me as if I am the most interesting person on this planet. I still remember that night,3AM when you opened up to me,raw. I asked you about your biggest insecurity, half-expecting you to dissuade the topic but you didnt. You told me. I guess it was in that moment when I fell for you,totally. When you showed me your vulnerability. I apologized for intruding. Its okay, I wanted you to know thats what you said. I asked you if we both loved each other why werent we in relationship? You told you werent healed from your past relationship but you were sure about me,so I gave you time. What I didnt know was, she came into your life;someone to fill your physical needs, while you had me there for the emotional needs. I was afraid of anything physical. You didnt know it,but you had your suspicions on my horrendous past;I was sexually abused by my cousin. I remember how badly my heart ached when I received those screenshots of your texts with her. And I felt so stupid, you talked like that to every girl. She wont know Ill deny I love her very very much but she doesnt get physical Even now it all echoes inside my head. It all made sense why you dragged your past whenever I asked why we werent in a relationship. It took me a long time to realize you were a miserable person. Someone who couldnt commit. You were a coward who lived off my energy. Someone who needed a person like me to support &amp; commit to you when you couldnt do the same. You were everything toxic which shone like gold. But now, I have learnt to let go."

Around the lake, sitting on benches, staring out at the uneven skyline. Lots of daydreaming. Im sure there were ghost following me. Sometimes when I step outside I feel as if Im stepping out into the great theater. The theater of madness, of magical spirits, foul creatures, lovers carved by happiness, addicts carved by dangerous trinkets, some illuminated by education, some surrendering to culture, theres the smell of Christmas trees, madman mystics on the corner selling Jesus for a hand-job, theres an elusive brightness to the air that wish I could capture. I want to steal it and put it in my pocket. Theres a silent violence to the suffering I see around me. Eternity is a moment, for us, it last long enough to smile and say hello and then its gone. Theres a vacancy I see in some people. Mummified in designer clothing, their spirituality is in jewellery and fancy watches. Ive never owned a watch, I never have wore one. I dont want to know the time. I dont want to be confined inside the boundaries of concepts created to keep us constantly aware of how little of it we actually have. I dont want to be boxed inside having to constantly be somewhere or do something because of a certain time. What time is it? Its right now. Here. In this moment you are alive. You are only alive in moments. Time is decay. It is the rotting corpse of civilization. The present is dying, decaying into memories, slowly moving forward into a corpse. The earth will be here long after me. Someone will walk over my bones. I imagine the smell of burials is the smell of earth. One day these cathedrals will fall. Brick by brick they will melt back into land. The billboards will turn silver and white with rot. The streets will crack as the weeds and trees consume all. The insects will no longer have any light at night to hide from the monsters that hunt them in the darkness. Humans will be put in capsules created by technology. They will live in infinite simulated worlds. They will grow fat with proteins and liquid drugs being pumped into their bodies. The machines will whisper that they love them, the people will whisper back that they love the machines. The new human will find themselves looking at dreamless sunrises over an ocean that is not real. They will melt in time. Spider webs will surround them inside their machines. Human intimacy will be lost to televised seminars. They will be immortal but they will not be human. Soon nature and the oceans would take over. The capsules will fall to the bottom of the sea. A thousand years, a million years, the new evolved life will find them. They will open these metal tombs, the men and women will open their eyes, they will shriek like vampires in the sun, they will melt into dreams brought to you by Disney and Coca-Cola. And no one will ever understand any of it. These are my strange thoughts when I walk. I also thought about love. The acceptance in that idea. What is this ghost that lives inside of us? Why does it linger in the belly? We are captured, we are guided by these haunting shadows that live within us. I think there must be a tiny pianist playing some magical instrument inside my ribs. I see the ghost of people walking as I do. They are always ready to file in line. They never complain. That must be the ghost of Mozart. Now a withered old man with arthritis bending into his hands. And that one there, that must be Shakespeare, an overweight balding man wondering what type of sugar snack defines him. They are everywhere. The ghost of musicians and writers. The young twirling their fingers on each others chest in the park. They have the eyes of dead philosophers. The one jogging, with earbuds in her ear, she was once a poet that looked for the mystery in human love and belonging. She now runs and thinks about television shows and why her last date hasnt called her back. I think how beautiful they were all at one time. Full of wonder and hope and the promise of love danced inside them like ballerinas. But time, time is decaying them. The spirit is lost. The ghost that haunt them are faded memories from unremembered dreams. They are dead. We are dead. I am dead. We are just ghost. This thought should depress me but it doesnt. It feels me with emotion, warmth, it makes me feel alive, I am strangely unaffected by any of it. That should scare me but it doesnt. And so, Miss D, my ladybug wanderer, my magical adventurer, these were the thoughts as I walked yesterday. I think both of our movements are in the words for now. I enjoy reading about your days. Your nights. The way you stand up to the picture fanatics. Procrastination. I know him well. We are good friends. Staring at the ceiling. We should do that one day. You whisper to me the worlds you see and Ill whisper to you the worlds I see. We can write terrible poetry on each others arms and legs. We can both close our eyes and see how long it takes for the other person to open theres. The winner gets a kiss. The loser losses a kiss. At the end of our games, well count how many kisses one has compared to the other. We then go outside. We toss the kisses into the air. We give them to the entire world. Suddenly peoples eyes light up. The depression inside of them scurries away. The ghost disintegrate. Everyone burst into dancing. We may have lost our kisses, D, but its okay. We can create more. Thats what caterpillars and ladybugs do. Love is a terrible and beautiful mistress. Sharing your vulnerabilities to the wrong person can be devastating. We seem to superficially connect with someone and jump right into the intimacy of sex. Once the body fulfills its idea of love you are left feeling empty. Theres no flow of words left, no connection, but people lie to themselves. They use the bedroom as a way to fulfill a desire and a need to feel human even though it is never really satisfying. The resentment and bitterness comes to them. They will never know their lovers, not in the abstract way they wont, theyll continue on fulfilling their self-imposed prophecies of never feeling connected. Its hard to find a true intimacy out there. Even people married for years become tied to routines and habits. Its no longer an intimacy more than it is a feeling of companionship. I think thats why so many sleep with other people when in relationships. They have convinced themselves that sex is intimacy. Once the intimacy of sex starts to settle down they think they have to find that rush of blood that tightens those spaces between their legs to feel loved again, to feel a connection. They keep old lovers around for the companionship, something recognizable to them, but find intimacy with other partners. Do people really know each other? Or do they only know the shallow trivial of one? It seems very selfish and self-interested to me. We are going about everything backwards. Because of distance, we have to connect and find intimacy in other ways. Think of the connections we have, the way we think alike, the way we talk and share with one another. Theres intimacy in that, theres a vulnerability in the things we share with one another. With that sort of mind connection, what would it feel like to entangle our bodies knowing how well we have gotten to know each other. We dance long before our bodies have had a chance to catch up. We have a connection and an intimacy that doesnt belong to the body. You asked me why I think any of this is dangerous. I dont mean dangerous in a negative way. I mean dangerous in a way that I didnt really think this was possible. Dangerous in a way that this is unexplored worlds for me. Usually, I feel I know what to expect from people and how I expect to react in those situations. But with you, I feel completely blind, I feel like Im reaching out in the darkness, trying to make my way forward, never really knowing where any of this is going to end, but enjoying the idea that this is something Ive never experienced before. I had given up thinking everything was about sex and property with people. That lovers were lost to being items and trophies and objects to be fucked or desired. All of this, everything we share, the little moments of intimacy I share with you here proves me wrong. That not all is lost. Theres a vulnerability in that for me. That vulnerability feels dangerous. But dangerous in a beautiful way. Not something to run from but something to embrace and comfort and see where it eventually leads me. Maybe it leads me somewhere where we both are. Maybe it turns into something beautifully realized. Maybe its just a dream. And I dont mind that, if its a dream, then its our dream. Oh, I think we all change. Even if its in subtle ways. No one is the person they were a few years ago. I hope theres change for me. I feel like Im learning something everyday. I struggle with my demons. Sometimes they win. Sometimes I do. One day, Im going to leave this swampland behind. I know that. Ive always known that. Once these book are finished maybe I can get a little money. Enough to finally escape the erection of the east. Nothing ties me down here. Im only here from a mixture of bad decisions and situations. Sometimes I feel talking with you has changed me a bit. Like the romantic is winning the war over the nihilist. But that darkness will never go away. Not really it wont. I dont mind that. I like the darkness sometimes. Its comfort is cold but it gives me great insight into worlds I wouldnt have known existed without it. Theres always the balance. The light needs the darkness just as much as the darkness needs the light. You seem very active in your movements. I dont smile all that much. I suppose it is more of a grin. Im very laid back. I sit back, quietly anticipating, Im a watcher. I interact as little as possible. I prefer the thoughts and the ghost in those thoughts than the company of most. I ask questions so I dont have to share much about myself. Sometimes I feel like I dont actually participate in the life around me. I sort of just blend in and walk like some ghost full of thoughts. Constantly aware, always alone. I want you to know - how I feel about all this electricity, this beautiful blending of mind and thoughts and dancing ghost means something to me. You talk about how I have let loose something inside you but you have set me free from my own spells. I am spellbound by the person you are. Your words are little lakes I swim inside. I twirl you around me and let you perfume my body with yours. If I have touched your mind, its because you have touched mine. I want to know what it would feel like to touch you with my hands. To glide myself across you. To melt inside. We talked about this before. The losing a part of yourself when you give yourself to someone. Maybe thats true. But it could also be true that the cycle of life and death gives and creates just as it takes. That part we lose when we give ourselves to one another - maybe it creates something new inside of us. When a flower dies, it explodes into not one seed but many. That death inside of us as we melt into one another is an explosion that creates a thousand new lifeforms willing to embrace the new universe that is now created from the old. Those are my thoughts anyway. Your darkly ghost, \-b"

Thank you for your honesty. It has been my greatest hope that through passionate, patient, and loving discourse we could come to an understanding about who we are and where we wanted to go in our lives. So anyway, here's the scoop: I don't give a fuck how anyone judges me. Including you. I did not come here for pity, or sympathy. I did not come here looking for a pat on the back for my actions, or I would've taken one of your posts where you painted me white and ran. What you have failed to see is that I am here for the same thing you are, and so been unable to comprehend my intent. Did you know that we share the same core drive? I'll make it clear it for you: Truth = Knowledge = Power Love is a choice. This is the most significant moment in my entire life and I have never felt God's presence more in the universe. I couldn't love you any stronger as a human being than I do at this moment. That is how I repay your honesty. Thank you for this, the realist conversation I will ever have with another human being. You are GLOWING. Personal philosophies and ethics laid bare. You are the most valuable galactic fireball I've ever come across and I drink this side of you I've never known. I couldn't love you any stronger as a human being than I do at this moment. That is how I repay your honesty. Because I found out what your desperation had cost you. You are now one of them, unwittingly, because you bought the lie. Fuck their schools, fuck their yachts, fuck their directors, fuck their pursuit of that which takes at the cost of harm. Your desperation to self-actualizing taken to the degree of discardment due to your mental illness will lead you to dying alone when the day comes that you need help and you have cast all allies aside. These systems are leading to the collective anxious death of society. Of art. Of love. People like them support those objects modifying our emotions, because it makes us easier to control. Those in power will forever attempt to contain it at all costs. Those without will try and take. Yin and Yang, Taylor. Alpha to my Omega. Anyway, this aside, let me get to the main point. This isn't you. Let me help you. You are in the state you're in because of malicious people like this who've taken advantage of your vulnerability. The've drugged you and are using your body and mind to damage yourself and society and you're scared. I've got my cowboy boots and my cape on. Send a DM green light I'd know and location, quickly delete it and I will come get you right the fuck now."

The part that I finally get is that in your gallant attempt to be honest with your feelings, you hurt me over and over. I dont think that was your intention- you might have even been trying to spare me. But you chose to crush me and my hope rather than simply walk away. You had a choice and you chose yourself. You chose to divorce your care and concern for the vulnerability being shown you and simply get what you could. You remind me of your stories of free things your ex-wife would go after. God I thought that was weird. I also thought it was weird that you were also into taking stuff wherever the opportunity arose. I suppose that was a glaring clue I overlooked. You embarrassed yourself without even knowing. Youre really quite an odd duck. Im sorry that I never got the chance to tell you what I really thought about you. But damn, why were you so cute to me? And what on earth did I find attractive?!?! Your silly giggle? Your lower canines? Your slightly bowed legs? Your mostly gone hair? The really bad hair dye? Damn. What was I? Drunk?

You never had to question it because you believed me the first time around. You wanted to convince yourself it wasn't true, right? Is that why you sent me away? Is that why you tried to make sure I wouldn't come back? I will always come back. I told you my heart was yours and it is. You are the sole owner and your name is crudely etched into it. I told you I was dedicated to you and I am. I told you I'd do anything and I would. I can't keep trying to convince you of those facts. I know the man who said those hurtful things was just fearful and hurt himself. I know that he didn't mean them because I know the person he is on the inside. I suspect that's why he didn't want to share certain activities, because that part would be exposed at the surface and he couldn't have that. It was too difficult to be in that state all of the time. Far too taxing and uncomfortable. But that one night that he let his guard time completely made me understand everything I needed to know about him. Total, unabashed vulnerability for the first time. It was beautiful and I cherish that memory. That's who I see him as still. You can't expect me to use my intuition on this one, especially after you made me doubt it for so long. I had completely given up on my gut instincts because you made me feel like they were wrong. Hell, you told me they were wrong so often that I had no faith left in anything. I still doubt the truths. You know that I can't reach out after what you said about my actions because this would surely reinforce that theory you preached to me and that word you used to describe me. But you also can't come into my house unannounced, kick your feet up, and pretend like you're not there. As if you could fool me. As if you could ever fool me. If you want me, in any sense of the word, you have to tell me. You have to do your part this time. Tell me. Please tell me. You know how I'll respond already. You have to give to me this time.

You seemed closed off from everyone, but every now and then you would do or say something that almost resembled reaching out. I tried to give you opportunities to open up, but you never did. And thats okay, I told you I would miss you, and you told me you would miss me in your own guarded way, or maybe you were just being nice. You made an impact on me and Im glad to have met you.

Don't give me that trite trope about circumstances. I've heard it dozens of times. Why? Because it doesn't hold water, and back to the flame you come. You might want to prefer your safe little circumstances, but I don't think it's what you actually want, deep down. Yet you sabotage, because safe feels like home, even if the window frame is slightly wonky, the carpet is drab, and the paint is so very vanilla. You misinterpret things I say, pick fights, decide the sky is falling when it's actually a beautiful sunny day and things couldn't be better. You can lie to me all you want. I'll see right through it. But don't lie to yourself. Don't keep living your safe little life that ticks all the boxes that someone once told you will make you happy. Fuck that person and fuck that list. Listen to your heart, your dreams; feel the life in every cell of your body that is yearning for something different, something more than carpet that has indents because the furniture hasn't been moved around in years. This isn't about me, or us; we might not cross paths again. It's about you allowing yourself to experience happiness, freedom, and joy, before it's too late. Choose happiness."

I dont want to seem like I'm carelessly apologizing over and over again. i think I had a lot of instability in my life 6 months ago that only recently settled. that isnt an excuse - my actions shouldnt be waved off, they're still bad, but I wasnt in a good place to juggle my family issues and school issues and because of that i let everything crumble around me without looking at where the debris fell. controlling my emotions is not my strong suit, nor is resisting the urge to react with them. I mean, vulnerability in general is not what I would call common in my life, and I dont know to handle delicacy sometimes (if my loudness isnt an immediate indicator of that). for as much as I pride myself on my writing I dont have the magic words that can instantly mend problems like these (not that anyone does). theres a million more things I can add but I dont think many matter. im certainly not a fast, to-the-point writer. what matters is that I'm sorry. I dont want things to be like this. I never did. it pains me to not have you know that. I dont want to see you around as a relic of the past. I want you to be my present, my future.

I've evaluated loss, blame, winded my way through beginnings and ends, pointed my finger, released my anger, wallowed in self pity and searched for solutions. Beauty in the imperfections. Contemplated choices, evaluated capabilities, longevity, satisfaction of those involved. Determined my whole self causes pain because the focus is not on what we have but what we don't. And then I let it all go. I won't fight it any longer the answer is quite clear. give what is needed even if it's not all and within that understanding is honesty to reality.

The anger, the doubt of what has been built....I see the beauty in the imperfections. All the wrongs are not so wrong but reactions to the imbalance. I appreciate the capabilities even if they are not wholly satisfying. You pushed me to this by your presence in my thoughts and the uncontrollable response you elicit. It's motivation within itself to find the answers, to figure it out, because it's a drug that's pull is so strong it could and would have completely derailed me. I always come back to you. Search for you. If you only knew how I've looked for you in moments I'm not even aware of. I don't leap without full understanding. I sacrifice to a fault. I adapt to others but with you. I don't lay down and abide. I look for the solution to keep it going. It's so strange to me but also so fulfilling. You have been so satisfying on so many levels. A fuel within the body and mind that is electrifying and literally takes my breath away. I've denied myself, waiting for you in my dreams. Realizing you've been patiently waiting for me to understand. You probably thought you jumped the gun, that I wasn't ready. And you're right, you usually are. But for you, I'd spend weeks searching for solutions. I know I said I hate obsession but with you it's all I want. Every wall I've put up, you've torn down and I fucking love it. I think you exposed yourself, showed your vulnerability wanting me to connected the lines. Isn't it so amazing though to know that you captivated my mind but also my body- separately. Can you imagine if I wasn't scared, suspicious, too scared to sound crazy, eyes wide open execution? You drive me fucking crazy. But I can wait :) O but one thing you were wrong about, which scares me in itself. No guilt, no remorse, didn't even bat an eye. Truth."

Every time the conversation gets started you vanish. You never wanna talk. All you do is sit there and make me feel like Im a bother. I asked you to let me know the college entry results. You said ""if I feel like it"". How considerate. After every time I say something that reveals my truest feelings you just say ""same"". We havent seen eachother in 6 months and now that YOU finally have time youre too lazy to find an excuse for us to meet. Ive been ""trying to understand and give you time"" for so long but Ive been hitting walls for too long. You make me hurt. But you also mean so much. I hate that it will have to end like this. I had such high hopes. Finally someone i connected to. But at least I can stand proud knowing it was not me. It was not me who didnt respond for days. It wasnt me who doesnt share the bare minimum. Its not me who avoids all forms of vulnerability. Its not me who pushes people away. You did this, but I will end it. Thanks for the few instances of pure joy I guess. And fuck you for the almost daily avoidance and coldness. Yours sincerely"

That Im rarely the one who starts conversations, and never says I love you first. Im sorry that Im not energetic &amp; lovely, and dont have much to say. I get burned out easily from socialising which is why its been a day or two since our last conversation. Our calls can be awkward too, since we dont have a lot in common. You like games, i detest them. I like music and psychological theories, you dont seem to show as much interest. But the one thing that we share, which baffles me the most, is this enormous amount of love that we have for each other. I dont understand why, after just one day, we were suddenly best friends. Our connection was enough to begin healing the cracks in me that the other guy left. Thank you and I love you. Im sorry that I hate hugs and affection, and that Im scared of vulnerability &amp; openness. That I hide behind my hair &amp; act nervous &amp; clumsy on video. I know I told you that I dont want to be in a relationship, but thats a lie. The fact is I do want a relationship with someone, i just really and truly hate myself. I feel uncomfortable with both my interior &amp; my exterior, and I dont want to be with someone at this point in time because I want to love myself first. Well, thats maybe 20% of it anyway. The other reasons are: -Im scared of being rejected &amp; feel inferior to other girls -Im scared that Im too ugly or overweight -Im immature -Im shy and also very introverted When I asked you why you were talking to me when there are prettier, less weird people out there that you had more in common with, you said that yes, you *could* talk to people who were indeed prettier &amp; smarter, but you didnt know why you werent. I was just wholesome and precious and me. That kind of hurt and i dont know why. Maybe Im just childish, but my insecurities were further deepened when u said that. Especially when you mentioned smarter - I didnt say anything about my intelligence. Now Im insecure about that too. Im also not naturally wholesome, and I feel fake when Im being affectionate with you sometimes although when I say I love you, I do mean it. When you told me you had a small crush on me, I pushed you away, telling you it was going to be a mistake for you. Im sorry for freaking out, I know it wasnt an ideal reaction and it mustve taken you a great deal of bravery to tell me. Im sure I told you but when people get too close, I run away. I ghost them &amp; look for more people to fill the void. Always platonic, with strict boundaries. This is also the same with you. I cannot develop feelings for anyone anymore, not after the last guy. In the process, Ive broken a few hearts. I dont know what it is, maybe theres something wrong with me, maybe I have yet to meet the right one, but if I hurt you at all then Im sorry. From, H"
425,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Missing You and Reflecting,0,c9kudc,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/c9kudc/missing_you_and_reflecting/,2019-07-06 06:32:55,"Steven, I am pretty sure what we had was real. It was real for me. I think it was real for you. It felt real. I miss it and you so much, Steven. I enjoyed our deep connection so much and it was so unique. Do you remember when you brought it up in the kitchen one day, that you felt our connection was deeper and more intimate and satisfying than others youd had? It was because of young trauma. I agree, but I also think its because were a lot alike in ways that have nothing to do with that, and because we are both multi faceted. It makes me sad that we never learned until too late that the level of vulnerability that comes with has a weightier side that needs special care and tending to avoid the kind of dramatic negative feedback loops we created when our wounded inner children would take charge. They dont want to listen, and will scream to be heard even at the expense of the other person. I think of us often and want it back, but I dont know if it can happen. At times I think too much has happened and too much has changed. I think your lie and how you handled over such a long period of time was just too much. I think you going back so soon (weeks after we broke up? immediately?) to yet a different ex, Jessica, who had poor boundaries and is unhealthy is too much. I think you projecting all the things you did to me even long after the fact was just too much. I have some abandonment issues and that was what happened in November - the fight that put a crack between us. I was already feeling a little insecure - youd seemed a little more separate from me in September and October, and wed had a couple small interactions that you said never happened, which was the start of you gaslighting me. I dont think it was your intent to fuck with my head but thats what happens when you try to deny something that happened, or get someone to believe something that isnt true. I think you were trying to avoid something with me and unfortunately your method to do that amounts to gaslighting. Maybe you dont remember the interactions, but just your unwillingness to even acknowledge the possibility that these interactions happenedyour adamant refusalwas a cautionary flag for me. I felt shut down, invalidated, and like what I needed wasnt important. And we couldnt even talk about my feelings because the things that happened.didnt happen according to you. I found the photo of Kate with your tattoo in sept (?) and realized I didnt know much about her or your exes and it became important. I looked her up and found her Strava post from April that was clearly about you. Clearly to me, anyway. I was afraid to asksee above incidents where Id been shut down. Plus I had my own fears from past experiences. And I realized that youd been really open with me in the beginning about certain things in your past but that had stopped at some point. And then I read your texts when the opportunity presented itself. I didnt plan to or ever set out to do it. It was there, I was scared, and I let my better judgement slip. I tried to give you the benefit of the doubt after reading but something about the situation bothered me and it took a while to sort out. I hadnt put all the pieces together yet about your earlier strange behavior, and Kate was clearly someone who had really terrible boundaries and still assumed the affair path was an option for you two. It was really troubling for me. I questioned how healthy you were if you were willing to maintain a connection with this person in any way. Healthy people dont typically maintain relationships at all with toxic people, and there are good reasons for that. Still, I wanted to believe the best about you and really tried to give you the benefit of the doubt. The earlier pattern of denial and gaslighting showed up later too with the whole Kate conversation, and got worse. It seemed every time Id bring up something around that subject on or after Jan 6 youd get super upset and find some way to argue about something else, and then the thing I brought up would fall to the side and never get resolved. Whether you intended it or not, or were conscious of it or not, it was deflection and distraction. And it worked for the most part. You accuse me of deflection but Ive never tried to avoid talking about something important you brought up. The deflection you accuse me of is my attempt to steer a conversation back toward what Id initiated at first. No conversation can resolve when two people are trying to talk about different things. There were many times though when I set aside my needs that I had brought up first, and instead addressed what youd bring up only moments after Id initiated the conversation. It was always an argument from you but I tried to listen and address it. In these conversations I felt the same patterns from earlier: avoidance of something, and a stubborn attempt (conscious or not) to invalidate me and stop the conversation I had set out to have. And in these conversations I felt that everything I said would be taken in the worst possible light. Thats an impossible position. On a side note it is really alarming to me that as I analyze all of this I see more and more projection from you onto me. I hope youre able to see that at some point. I dont say this to avoid blame or fault - I certainly did MANY things wrong, but not most of the things youve accused me of. Anyway, It felt like you were trying to make the conversations impossible and shut them down any way you could. The end result is that I ended up feeling sad and upset that you were just not giving me the benefit of the doubt ON TOP of the other things I had been sad and upset about when I initiated the conversation. I mean, you did some validating of what I was saying, but it always felt like an attempt in service of a goal you had to prove a point about the thing you were arguing about (distracting/deflecting with). The reality is that I was trying to get you to be transparent with me about Kate, the situation, yalls history, your feelings and thoughts. I needed transparency from you and Id been clear about that for a year. Id asked you in the summer about exes and if any were messaging you. You said no, but looked so caught. I gave you the benefit of the doubt. So I just told you that if something weird happened with an ex we should talk about that. And that was before I found Kates photo with your tattoo. And you accuse me of gaslighting. Looking over our conversations I can understand that youd feel jerked around and manipulated, but it was never my intent to do these things. Not once did I try to deny something that happened, avoid talking to you about anything, or try to bend your reality into something I knew wasnt accurate. I did communicate really, really poorly for a long time and I take responsibility for that. My behavior during these conversations where you felt jerked around are when I was struggling with the impacts of having been gaslighted and confused, as well as dealing with ptsd flashbacks from my earlier experiences along similar lines. I was emotionally distraught for a long time (it started in Sept) and it got worse as time went on. My feelings would be sudden, overwhelming, erratic, nonsensical (at the time) and I felt jerked around by them too. It was fucking horrible, for both of us. This was really fucked up behavior and not normal for me. But taken in context of the situation the behavior is a normal response to being gaslit and having ones reality turned upside down. I know that feeling and the confusion and its awful. I empathize with you feeling that way - I dont wish that on anyone. There is a difference between dealing with the erratic emotions and confusion of having ones reality turned upside down, and attempting to shut down, avoid, invalidate someone or try to distort reality. I have never done any of the latter to you. I do not feel the same applies from you to me. In fact I see multiple clear instances of gaslighting and other things riddled through our interactions from you to me. Im not asking for an apology. Just that you try to recognize it to yourself and not do it anymore. No one deserves that. You said in one of your emails that you didnt know what I wanted, or that maybe what you gave wasnt enough, or right, or maybe were not a good fit. Some of these may be true but I am challenged to believe that you dont know what I wanted when I made it really clear from the start: transparency. Honesty. You gave me many amazing things and I felt so loved. It still means so much to me. But the fact is that hiding, secrecy, and denial will destroy even the best relationship. No relationship can survive a lack of transparency. I know Im hypocritical when I say much of this stuff, but the fact remains that I did voluntarily come clean with you about the one thing I did and lied about for a few months. I told you everything without you having to ask, and offered complete openness if you needed anything from me. I did not get this same respect from you. You had over a year from the initial lie in April of 2018 to just say Hey, so theres this person. This thing happened. I wanted to honor your need for transparency so Im telling you. or something like that. And really Id have been so happy if youd have done that. That is literally all youd have had to do is talk to me about things that are hard - hard for you, for me, for us. That is the only thing I was ever looking for. That is where the really infinite positive and really rewarding connection between two people begins - in sharing hard things. That is what I wanted with you. I feel sad that we did not make it to that point. We started, but it didnt come to fruition. You said that our conversations make you feel like a little boy proving he didnt do something wrong. I dont think that feeling is coming from me. I understand you feel that I made you feel like you are talking to your father sometimes in our arguments - that is when Im dealing with the erratic feelings brought on by your choices, and my resulting ptsd.that Id told you how we could avoid. However I think youre confusing the feelings ofshame? guilt?..that came up from you lying and knowing the situation with Kate was weird and not wanting to share it with me but knowing you should have with similar feelings youd have from your childhood in situations where you felt you had to lie. I am not an unsafe person. I didnt behave positively all the time but had you been transparent like Id asked Id have been floored and greeted it with softness. But then your little boy feelings compounded when you kept lying and then started gaslighting, etc to keep the original lie intact. The problem with saying you felt like little boy with me is that you lied to me long before anything ever got tense between us. The first time that I know about was in April on the morning of brunch with Kate - you told me you were just done with meetings when really you were just done having brunch with Kate. I know the timing works because she posted about you on Strava that morning - yes, I looked her up. And later the same day when we were at Red Star Taco across from Silence Heart Nest and sharing about our days you didnt mention her at all, and I think you know you should have. If you had it would have been a blip and wed have moved on. Anyway, when I confronted you in February about Kate and told you Id read the texts I felt like I was talking to a little boy trying to hide that hed raided the cookie jar - you had crumbs on your hands and were trying to figure out how much youd have to say and how much you could avoid sharing in order to stay out of trouble. It was really hard. I empathized with you and didnt want to put you in a difficult position but I also knew that this thing was driving us apart and that open communication about it was the only possible route to salvaging our relationship. I know I communicated poorly so many times but this was always my end goal: to salvage our relationship. And that meant having that hard conversation. It did not go well. I see now that I should have left it. It takes two willing people to have those kinds of conversations and I was forcing you. The only other option I had at that point was to pack my things and leave. I wasnt ready to give up on you - like you I am an eternal optimist. To my own detriment sometimes. I want to end by saying that I feel terrible about all the times Ive lashed out at you. Its my abandonment stuff raging and my erratic feelings left over from the past several months (it takes a long time to heal from gaslighting and other manipulative tactics, even if theyre not super aggressive or consciously done). Some of this is from your treatment of me and some isnt. Every time we interact though there is something else: youre with another ex from years ago so shortly after we parted and she also has poor boundaries like Kate. Yes I have a thing about exes but you also seemed consistently dodgy when Id ask about them, and you did have a couple others from years ago with unhealthy boundaries who kept coming into the present - Kate, of course, and then Amy using all your airline miles (that was just not okay). Its one thing if theyre in the pastbut they werent. They were very much in the here and now and trying to take space in an area that was supposed to be ours. And yes, Im an ex. But Im the most recent one. And pretty recent at that. Im not hanging around a year or five years after youve dumped me and trying to get you to warm up to me over text, coffee, or using the excuse of seeing your kids as leverage to stay in contact with you and keep from going no contact while youre in other relationships, and hitting on you even though youre in a relationship. Beyond the exes there is the projection of your own stuff onto me. Ive done a lot wrong but Ive owned most of it and apologized. You still havent owned the gaslighting and deflection - I really dont know if you even see it or youre just doing more of the avoidance tactic thing you do. Its so meta. If I try to push you to acknowledge something so we can talk about it it turns into a really weird argument about perception and is so mind boggling and exhausting. Its just not worth it. As amazing as you are and as we were together, this just makes it not worth it. Im so sorry that it took me so long to figure that out. I hope that you can change these thingsat least for yourself. As long as youre gaslighting, maintain connections with unhealthy exes and keep toxic relationships alive in any way I just cannot be part of your life in any way. I am sorry for the ugly way I cut contact with you recently, but I really feel I have to protect myself from you and what seem to be more and more consistently poor choices. They are further poking sticks at the wounds Im trying to heal and I dont know how to not rage at you for it yet. I need time and space. Healing from this kind of stuff takes a long time. I will ask that at some point you revisit our conversations in your head or actually read them - however you wish - through my perspective: someone who loved you, who wanted nothing more than to open up communication and reach that ultimate level of sharing and intimacy with you and feel the happiness wed felt in earlier days flourish into something even deeper and immutable. I did a lot of things wrong but my intent was always to build a strong and lasting connection with you so we could keep sharing our adventures in every way. I do wish you well and hope you take care of yourself. CS"

So disrespectful towards you in some undetermined way. To be honest, sometimes when I was with you it felt like we were adventurers on an aimless quest, mud on our boots and hunger in our bellies. The false dichotomy between the two versions of you just drives me mad, still. Like a strange sort of Peppers Ghost, your image in that room is just a reflection of someone I thought I knew. The thing is, I dont know you at all any more. We are strangers, just the way you wanted it. Its safer for you that way. So I suppose this letter is more of a perception of that mirage, the burning afterimage. I know thats why you did this and I still struggle with why. Do not attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity. Ive been stuck with this one: are you just emotionally dumb like you said, and you attributed malice to me rather than stupidity? Or is there some fundamental manipulative element at work here on your end that lashed out against my stupidity and carelessness, without any word to grasp hold of? You said it. You compartmentalize, you were the control freak. You lost control of the situation and you scuppered it out of fear. Why do I keep blaming myself then? Skepticism creeps in and were back at square one. Its insanity. Im a fighter god damn it, give me something real to fight for. I still dont understand why you would do the most selfish thing. The thing you hated most, you did to me - and I realized that I should seriously revise my dossier on you, at least until we addressed the elephant in the room. But then you killed the elephant and acted like I did it, pinning every bad thing on me. Now I cant trust you at all, but I know you dont care because youre safe, and here I am standing in the rain of doubts. You dont need to trust anyone...thats safe. So after all of that vulnerability and apparently raw vision - it was all an exhibition to stroke your ego, to make you feel wanted when you were having an identity crisis. I guess you prefer attention from more powerful and more charismatic people that have a stronger sense of what they want. I suppose youll probably pump and dump a poor chump a few more times before doing something like this again. Theres no shame in that, to be honest. Theyre in a better situation to deal with it than I was because they are stronger. Im sorry I reminded you of yourself, and thats why it just makes me sad to know youll find yourself here again. Did you realize I was communicating solidarity with getting better from this condition? The crossroads you found yourself at before, it just circles back to the things you ignore. The things that laid you low and made you miserable. The things that made you feel fundamentally unwanted. The part that troubles me is the veneer of kindness and calm. The mask you put on, as if you were a caring and joyous, when your view of the world is this: That everyone is selfish, everyone is concerned about themselves, except you and your carefully trimmed friends. Youre special and nobody understands how you feel. If they dont understand the reality of the world, you shut them down without explanation. Pure cynicism hidden behind pleasantries, a cynicism you blindly accepted as a deity and lord of human interaction. It makes me wonder if anyone has ever counted all 84000 problems and called someone like us out on their bullshit, like I should have immediately called out this and nipped it in the bud. That small bit of combat might have saved our friendship. I dont have any more time to regret like I have for these past 8 months. I dont have time to convince you that people are mysterious, people are contradictory and there are no real absolutes. You do not realize the true depth of people. There arent two settings - shallow and deep. Now I realize, I should have pushed that opinion harder, fight for what I believe, even if its risky. At least appearing strong would have gotten that image across to you."

I hope thats alright  its the only way I can get my emotions across. Dear, I feel your hot breath on my neck as you sit on my lap, your long blonde hair falling down your back in waves. I can barely see your eyes  your bangs tend to hide them a lot  but I see them, twinkling in the peaceful shadow that has formed between us as we face away from the light of my living room window. Youve only been here for an hour, but time runs as fast as a jackrabbit when Im near you. I chuckle  my hand is on your waist and my lips are tracing soft lines upon your jaw, and Im trying my best to keep my head at an angle where you cant see my face. My big nose. My lips, which have been bitten and bloodied in the panicky moments of the night. The bumps that cover my face, only to get worse within the next few months due to the hormones. The way my mouth moves when I talk. The sad gaze that I get when youre not watching, because Im always afraid. Im afraid that if you see my face this time  just one more time  youll change your mind and let go of my hand just like that other guy that you talk about a lot. After a while my kisses stop. Not because I dont want to kiss you anymore  Id kiss you for an eternity if you allowed me to  but because I think youve drifted off to sleep. Your breath has gotten just the slightest bit heavier. Im tired as well, and I might just fall asleep with you, but in this moment my mind is too occupied with you. Youre my little elven girl. My wifey. I love your eyes that change color, I love how soft your skin is  how you giggle and laugh when I tickle you or say something silly. How you scrunch up your nose and close your eyes when I compliment you. Even the way you stand is cute, loose and lean, perfect. Youre competitive and stubborn, focused and sometimes arrogant, but in the cutest way. I love all your little flaws and I always will. Im just afraid of you. Im afraid youll leave me one day and never come back. Im afraid of going to the other school without you. I know youll be there next year, and I know Ill see you almost every weekend, but Ill miss seeing you in the hallways when you think Im not looking. Ill miss seeing you at your locker and every morning in bus hall as you rush in and stare at me until class starts, hehe. I have an irrational fear of abandonment and it grows stronger everyday. I want you here forever and the possibility that you could ever leave me leaves me paralyzed in terror. I want to grow old with you. I want to hold your hand through all the issues and the transitions. I want to help you with your first shot of estrogen and I want you to be there when I get my first shot of testosterone  I cant believe that, in the beginning, you were too afraid to tell me you were trans when you knew I was trans as well. You silly girl. I love you so much and always will, no matter what happens. Ill hold you hand tight through all the bumps in the road and kiss your forehead in reassurance whenever I feel that you want it or need it. Ill be there to pick up the pieces if you fall apart one night  my brother, before he passed, used to call Krystal his puzzle piece. I suppose youre the same for me. I just hope you dont leave me. I want to memorize how the dip in your waist feels, and the feeling of you biting my lip when I kiss you. I want to stroke your hair as you nuzzle up next to me and cry into the crook of your neck and tell you how much I adore you. I want to sit under that tree where many special things have happened and just sit there and talk. I want to do so many things with you. I hate this life, but knowing that I might not get to do all the things I want to do with you someday? That makes me wish for immortality. Im glad Ive gotten you into Mccafferty. Youve gotten me into TDG and a little bit into Slipknot, as well as Tonight Alive. I dont know why, but I love anything that you love. Its just a pull, I guess. I want to know all your little hobbies and interests one day...I know I hold back these things as well, but Im trying. Ive never really opened up to anybody before and I know I say sorry pretty much every five minutes or so but please forgive me for that  Im just afraid, again. Of you, of myself, of everything that has to do with intimacy and vulnerability. Even though vulnerability is probably the most beautiful thing in the world besides you. Youve left your handprints on my heart and I know what it means to love. I know what it means to feel truly afraid, too, but in the most bittersweet way possible. I have so much more Id like to say, but honestly, Im too scared to say it all. Its exactly six AM and my mind is buzzing with thoughts of you and me. My little bride. - very sincerely, Muffin"

You should have been in therapy, but you bounce around, using people, specifically your girlfriends, as your grief process then labeling them as crazy when things don't work out. I wonder which age inappropriate or otherwise unsuspecting girl is in your bed right now. Before I met you, I was happy enough to function alone -- a state which took years of crafting. I had balance, fitness, goals and a good job. You ripped all of it from me. You took places that I loved and ruined all the memories for me. I lost almost 100k last year due to you and you sat so coldly and dismissed my feelings for you. You made me feel bad for showing you affection. Why. You always invited negativity. Why. I should have taken more revenge than I did (the truth is a mighty blade when you're a full of shit person -- why did you want her to have a good opinion of you anyway since she allegedly ripped your heart out?), but I tried to move forward after my one transgression. But it hurt. It still does. I acted out of anger. Which I actively try not to do. I did here. And even now I could end certain aspects of your career. You ended certain aspects of mine. The only thing that stops me is my morality, but your arrogance doesn't allow you to be honest, except in situations where you're backed against a wall. Should I follow eye for an eye justice when that isn't a productive path. The altruistic part of me doesn't want you to feel pain. The angry part of me is livid on how you manipulate language, ""lets have a productive conversation"" when you never had any intention of being honest. Until I just told you out right that I knew (lol you literally ran away from me when I said I knew), you blatantly denied it and repeatedly called me insane. Productive conversations occur between equals. When both people come from states of receptiveness and vulnerability. I didn't need to know everything, but I outright asked and you lied. It especially hurt when you acted like I was stalking you. Not my process dude. Yes, I missed you. And you probably missed me, which explained why you were on my biking trails after we broke up. But if you remember, ""it's so healthy"" that I didn't text you every 5 min. Can't help but laugh. Maybe you needed someone more dramatic? When will you just enjoy your time? Who ever asked you to change? Where is your morality. You whine mercilessly about what she did to you yet you had no issue doing it to me nor do you have any issue participating in wrecking marriages. I guess I knew inheritently early on that you were fucked. I tried to go slow despite your unhealthy attachment style and when I finally had real feelings for you, you fucked me over. I made choices to prioritize you and I keep paying for them. I'm not sure I regret them. I don't want to think about you anymore, but I lost so much of my life because of you. You won't, but you could choose to not live in a negative procress. You could choose strength and straightforwardness over lying. I get to walk through life knowing that you're out there and you don't want me. In all your flaws, I loved you. I fell in love with you on slow mornings where I had to go to my job and you slept in. I fell in love with you for you exceptionally odd mechanisms. All your weird projects. All your intelligence. Your weirdly specific way to do everything. You opened my world to certain music cultures which I can't appreciate on your level, but I try to. Occasionally, I just needed you to hold me. I understand you're more passive and went through a process. But I moved far from home. I took on a lot. I'm often lonely. I don't need much. But sometimes. I wanted a hug. Or for you to understand that offering your given stability when I had none was nice. Why do you think I always packed up? I never felt welcome. Did you ever feel anything for me? I never want to change you. I never asked to change you. I asked was I significant enough to meet people. You are my person. And you broke my heart. Sorry Reddit. Just needed write."

I know i lied and it was the worst thing to say but i was just hurt and it should have never came out of mgy mouth. Expressing myself to other people has always been hard. Because i learned early on no one cared about what i had to say, when i was being abused and i finally spoke up my own mother shrugged me off and my best friend laughed in my face. I remember she chuckled at the part when i told her i lost my virginity at 8. Any other time i tried opening up people would just turn it around and use it against me. And i just stopped saying anything. And i know it no excuse when someone is physically telling me to talk but there is so much vulnerability in all that space and it scares me. Im scared i will make someone angry or upset or just hate me entirely but my silence is doing just the thing i try to avoid. I know you don't trust me and i don't blame you but I'll do anything to fight for you, even if i have to pack up and move back home and live in a box just to be near you.

The first thing asked back was ""what do you hope to get out of talking""? I feel like I'm on an upward trajectory. Yesterday was shit, other days were okay, but in general... I feel good about where we are. Or, I've come to accept where we are, and live peacefully in the choice. The things you did to willingly and subconsciously hurt me, I see and understand... I don't feel resentment, anger, or deep pain anymore, just a tinge of sadness and a hell of a lot of empathy. I'm stuck on the hurtful things I did to you, both consciously without fully admitting, and subconsciously but now see. I want to tell you how sorry I am, and I want to thank you for the ways you actually have helped me. I already know you are like me, and you think along such similar lines... so I know it would have meaning to you, to hear it from me. (I also want to tell you about the meeting I had and get your advice, want to talk shop on this year and the expansion of the project, want to ask all about your summer and D and S, want to let you know all the things I'm thinking about you and me and us... but those are all things beyond brass tacks, and until I know we are both ready to move beyond the emptiness... it would be wrong, wouldn't it. Or unhelpful, whether it's wrong or right.) ""So you want closure, basically."" I don't think it's closure, exactly, because closure means done, shut, time to move on. Closure means getting answers from you, and I have no questions I need to ask or things I have to hear from you (plenty I would like deeply to know... but nothing necessary). You should know that you aren't left behind or tossed aside... that you're someone loveable and worthy of love in your life... that despite the things you do that you regret, you are still good, and wonderful, and beautiful. You are worthy of being thanked deeply, and you deserve apology for the things you've suffered. I don't know where you stand on all of these, since you've gone back and forth between extreme vulnerability and extreme self-aggrandizing, both in objective truth. You care so deeply for yourself, and care so little for yourself. You've made me a better person, Sterling. I want you to know it."

Youve made me add another anxiety onto the myriad of others as I graduate in a week. Im not sure I want to go into academia when people can drop you at the drop of a hat, where you can turn on someone under the guise of professionalism.

This is hard for me to write. All I want you to do is to say you're sorry, that you're not mentally well enough to handle being a mature adult. I want you recognize what you did to me was hurtful and cruel. I want you to tell me you're sorry for making me feel like I wasn't good enough, even though I was more than good enough. I miss your hugs, I miss your kisses, I miss your laugh. I miss your crazy voices/impressions you did and when you would talk to the cats and give them ""tours"" of high places on your shoulders. I miss your cute text messages telling me you missed me in the middle of the day, when I just saw you 3 hours prior and will see you again after work. I miss being your person. The person you relied on for partnership, a shoulder to cry on, and a listening ear. I miss cooking for you. I miss sleeping with you every night. I miss your forehead kisses and the silly things you'd whisper in my ears. I miss the way you'd always grab my hand when we walked places. I miss when you'd push me out of my comfort zone into new things that I was afraid of, but I knew it would be okay because you were there with me. I was protected from the unknown. I don't know what happened, when you changed your mind about me. I never changed my mind about you, ever. Even after you shattered my heart on the pavement and walked over it, blindly. I knew I would love you forever. You made me feel love, that will not be forgotten. Our individual problems became our together problems. I thought we could take on the world, because it was just you and me. I was proud of you, for being the person you were, even though you didn't see or understand that on any level. You were the person I'd been searching for my entire life. I thought you were my future husband, I thought I'd found you. Unfortunately, I was very wrong. It's still hard for me to write those words, because I don't necessarily believe them, but I have to. It's time to move forward. It's been 3 months today when you decided to end things. I still have very vivid dreams of you, horrible nightmares of you leaving me. I wake up feeling as if I was going through it all over again, so angry and mourning you as if you'd died. Missing you so much and hating you at the same time. I didn't deserve any of this. I also want to thank you for making me become the person that I was so afraid of. I relied on having you in my life forever too much. I shouldn't have. You taught me that you can't rely on people the way you think you can. Things change, people leave, people lie. I will not make that mistake ever again. Things are getting better. I can genuinely say that I'm happy. I'm on my own and I'm doing well. I miss you, of course. But also, I'm great without you. I am not yet thriving, but I will be soon. Knowing that you're out in the world somewhere needing to handle things on your own, I'm counting on the universe to give to you exactly what you deserve. I don't wish anything bad to happen to you but I also don't wish happiness for you. I hope you get out of life what you put into it, whatever that may be. I've accepted the unanswered questions. I've accepted the answers I was given. These things don't matter anyway. What matters is that you wanted out, that's it. That is enough for me to let you go and not look back. I don't wonder what you're doing or who you're with. I truly do not want to know. If at some point you'd like to reach out to me, please don't. You'll never get me back. Never. I don't deserve to be back in your life, for any reason whatsoever. As hard as it's going to be for me to say no, I will. I will say no through my tears, shaking voice, and screams in my head. I will protect myself from you at every cost. At the end of the day, I'm the person I have to live with, and she deserves better."

I hate how much you lied to me and all of the empty promises that you were barely even listening to when you said them. I hate how controlling you tried to be with me. I hate how much you gaslit me. I hate how much PTSD you rose in me every single day...and how that always escalated farther when you couldnt even own your shit or talk about anything. Everytime I tried to leave, you begged me through fake sobs and bullshit promises to stay. Guilt trips, sexual assault, gaslighting, reciprocal altruism; you practically forced me to stay caged in your misery. You only tried to kick me out when I had hope in my eyes, spirit in my soul, and I stopped listening to your commands and degradation. Then you met someone more permanently vulnerable than I am, and I fear for her. I wish i could warn her without sounding like a wicked ex-girlfriend. Some people, like the ex girlfriend before me, nearly broke while trying to get rid of you. Your own family doesnt like to be around you. You latch on to everyone's vulnerability and wont let go until you can manipulate it and use it to control them. After that big, final fight and the way your recollection sits... Ive made my peace with your insanity. I did not hit you that night. I stopped myself short on both swings because I knew that, even though you were 3 inches from my face - literally begggging me to hit you - youd immediately call the cops. If i had hit you, youd still be feeling it - TRUST ME. Do you remember the one fight we had where you asked me for my moms number? So she could come and force me to leave? Youre past your mid twenties, its time to leave preschool. When we met, I was still in mourning. I was starting to pick up the pieces from that and turn them into something positive. Being with you reminded me of everything ive been through before i met you, before the grief of loss set in. It reminded me that having someone to prove wrong is one of the best motivators for getting my shit together. So, thank you, G. It was...an experience. One that i learned a lot from. I cared so much about your unhappiness that I let it consume me too. I hope you get the actual help you need. Otherwise, youre in for a long and winding, lonely road.

You have no trust in yourself, so how do you ever expect to have it for someone else? Nobody is perfect, and you learned to learn from your mistakes long ago. So what the hell are you doing? Why are you being such a dumbass? You have to believe in yourself! Believe in the person who you know you can be! You let yourself get far too emotionally invested in others. That will ALWAYS end in turmoil. People must earn your vulnerability, and when they take it for granted or abuse it, have a goddamn backbone and stand the fuck up for yourself! Only you can live your life. It won't be lived staying in your bed and wondering about others. You won't meet new people and go on new adventures when you're too busy crying over what could have been. Whether you're around the toxic people or you're completely alone, you know what is right and what is wrong. You know what you deserve and the effort your dreams require to be made a reality. Nobody is going to stop their life for you, they never have. So don't you dare stop yours. You're a priceless individual with so much to offer. The people in your life are so lucky to have you, and if they don't recognize that, they will. You know she doesn't have long left. You better cherish her while she's here. You will spend the rest of your life being the man she helped make you, you know. She is your best friend and biggest fan, and she always has been. She saved you when you couldn't fight for yourself, and she never stopped fighting. Remember when you thought she was going to die, and that paralyzing fear that coursed through your veins? Yeah, you do. Don't have the regrets you had at that point. Don't let her memory be something that haunts you, but something you'll celebrate. If you won't do it for yourself, do it for her. She deserves to see her dreams come true doesn't she? If people try to hold you back, or devalue your efforts and time, move on. You act so afraid of being abandoned, but why? You've overcame it your whole life and proven that you're fucking amazing with or without them! You need to wake up and recognize your worth. Fight for the people that deserve to be fought for, and forget about the rest. Fuck the people who offer nothing more than cruelty and madness. They are just jealous of what you have and they will never be half of the man you are. You know beyond a shadow of a doubt that he loves you and wants what's best for you. You know he's not perfect, no matter how hard you try to make him. But you know he's worth so much more than he knows. You promised him you'd never abandon him, so you better keep your fucking promise! He didn't abandon you! He's always stood by you, even when it hurt him. Be the person that he believes in, and be the best friend that you know he deserves. The toxic people in his life will fade, just like the ones in yours. He has earned his place and you only disrespect his effort by hiding things from him. You're not protecting him, you are hurting him. That's why you don't feel worthy. So make it right. Show him everything, and if he leaves then know that you'll be okay. But you know he won't leave, not if he hasn't already. He's earned your trust, so fucking give it to him. Keep your head up and keep moving forward. Give your life to the people who deserve your time. Forgive the ones who you feel wronged you. Be the person you know you can be. Be the man she helped make you. -Me"

I am so confused as to why you came over to my house under the pretense of talking about everything that happened only to tell me you were done. What did you think I could possibly say to you once you told me that? There's nothing left to say. By the end of your rambling monologue about all the times you weren't honest with me I had no idea what you expected. If nothing I felt, thought, or desired meant enough to you then, why should I bother to make the effort to explain it now? So I didn't. I just said okay. Except I do have something to say, all you did was remove my ability to say it to you. My throat feels tight when I try to swallow the tears and disappointment because what good are they going to do me out in the world? You chose to silence me by not giving me your truth and the option to speak to it and for myself while you were still in my life. And then you judged and sentenced me for it. In the end you chose for both of us. You had no right to choose for me. And I'm disappointed because I thought you of all people would know better. How do I move past that? How do I move past someone I cared for taking all of the affection I offered them and tossing it to the ground and then casually stepping over it and out of my life? Clearly I'm still trying to figure that out. I don't know yet and I think that's okay. It just means I cared as much as I told you I did despite the numerous examples you've now laid out for me trying to prove the contrary. I think you expected me to apologize. Except what I saw you lay out was that I failed to read your mind and act on it. And I don't know how to be sorry for that. You chose dishonestly and I don't know how to be sorry for that either. But then again from what I heard, neither do you. I'm miss a version of you. I miss him so much it hurts sometimes. The version that made up most of my memories until it was broken that night. I'm going to miss that dear friend who never existed, but who still somehow walked out of my door with you for the last time. I have no doubt you've securely wrapped up your feelings and shoved them away with some nice explanation but the truth is we both lost something that day."

As you're sleeping, dreaming of distant lands, only to be forgotten when you awake, I think about how wonderfully sacred it is that you have trusted me with your most valuable possession, your soul. There's such a gentleness and vulnerability about you, I want to take care of you, if not forever, then for a little while. In a world where insecurity teems and doubts reside, I wonder if these obstacles are not all in our imagination? We think of events as linear, and quantify people into geographies and demographics.

I thought a letter would be easier for you to process on your own time. I knew you struggled with understanding and sharing your feelings...that maybe sharing on your own terms based on private reflection would make it more simple, that just maybe, you would envision the magic we could have created. But i developed a false sense of security. I thought i was doing enough...that you just shared your heart differently - through your service and touch. Now I feel lost. I looked at our life as one that we built together. In reality, you were molding ME to fit into a space that will never be filled by another person. It can only be filled with self-acceptance and love and vulnerability, and only if you let it. The last few days I have felt like a hollowed-out version of myself. Im trying to rediscover how to navigate the world without the guidance of your hands. But I still feel so unexpectedly empty. I know it will get better - it always does. I have freshened the edges of this wound, which will heal with time and self-care and honesty. Flashes of the memories we shared come and go without warning: red light kisses, naked breakfasts, dryer-warmed quilts, sweet embraces, stick shift fiascos, healing injured birds, concerts and dinner dates, Target runs, furniture assembly, uncoordinated dancing, waking up in your arms, your salt-and-peppper highlights, dog-sitting, your prickly jawline, the glorious feeling when your lips touched mine - when your skin touched mine, the power I felt standing next to you. I chose you, but you couldnt promise a love that you had never witnessed or experienced. And so I had to choose myself in the end. I deserve to be desired and pursued, and you deserve to experience love even when it scares you. We spend so much of our lives searching for the perfect partner, instead of growing to be that person for someone else. I just want you to be happy with the woman with whom you choose to spend your life, but dont forget that she deserves to be loved and pursued and appreciated without reservations. Dont put her up on a pedestal, but dont be overly critical either. we are all human and have to learn to love despite our differences. Let her get to know every aspect of yourself, even the dark parts that you are hesitant to share. It will be worth it in the end. I will always love you and cherish the lessons you taught me and the moments we shared. You are kind, patient, level-headed, supportive, dedicated, warm, and refreshingly authentic.

Your mom burst into tears, and from that day on, your dad called me son when nobody else was around. Then, I spent 3 weeks driving thousands of miles to hand-mine our birthstones for a ring. I found the gem cutters, and had the design and facrication process lined up. I put my heart and soul into that ring. And that was my problem... I put my heart and soul into loving you and caring for you, to the point where you didn't have to love me back. So you didn't. For an outspoken proponent of unconditional love, you don't seem to care for it when you request and receive it in real life. As it happened, either your dad or your friend I swore to secrecy broke their promise and told you about my ring plan, presumably to keep you from backing out. But you backed out anyway. And when you were ending things, I asked you if you'd heard about my plan, and you shook your head yes, but said you didn't want to talk about it. You coward. You fucking coward. Not only did you not love me unconditionally, you used my feelings to manipulate me. I didn't see it at the time because on principle, I gave you the benefit of the doubt, assuming you were acting in good faith. I deeply regret how stupid that was. The day you called me and asked if I could pick up your prescriptions, I thought sure. It's on my way home from work. You sent it to me and to my surprise, it was a staggeringly-powerful pair of high-dose anti-anxiety and tranquilizing meds. So I called and asked what the situation was, and you said you were just feeling stressed, so you went to the psychiatrist and they prescribed them to you same-day. Based on the information you gave me, that didn't add up at all, because these are the most intense drugs mental health professionals can prescribe. The side effects list is _wild._ I suggested you get a second opinion, because this was a life-changing prescription, and you snapped at me because I wasn't fully supporting you. I pride myself in separating my personal life from work, and always being strong around my coworkers (especially since we were in a conservative area) but I pulled my boss into his boss's office and just bawled my eyes out. Between sobs, I told them what the situation was, and asked to be excused for the day. That was humiliating, but that's how things are sometimes. I came home, we talked it through, I researched through your insurance and gave you a list of suggestions where you or we could go to get seen for a second opinion. You turned them down. Then, a WEEK later, I don't recall if it was you or your other friend, told me that you were immediately prescribed those because you were horribly suicidal that day. Now *that* made perfect sense. What _didn't_ make sense is why you would hide that from me and blast me for trying my best to help. I focus hard on, and know I do a great job at, being calm and nonjudgmental so you can bring hard truths to me. But you didn't. Not only didn't you, but you used it as armament. In your band's next music video (which was awkwardly all about how shitty I am) you said (paraphrasing) ""you said these meds would mess me up"". And that's one of the moments when it hit me. You need to warp reality for it to be comfortable enough for you to swallow. When I was with my dad the day after I watched that video, I brought him up to speed on us. It shocked me because hearing the words come out of my mouth for the first time, it became clear I was describing habitual gaslighting. That's the word for what you do. You gaslight. You are manipulative and your are a liar. You took advantage of my love and my consistently-spotty memory to train me into believing that my reality wasn't real. I bought it because I loved and trusted you. There was the better half of a year where I regularly questioned my senses and sanity. I thought something was physically wrong with my brain, like a tumor or clot. My self-confidence was subterranean. The night after talking to my dad, my mom, dad, and I watched the movie Gaslight together. They're conservative, so I thought it would help demystify the vulnerability I felt. And it did help. They were supportive and understanding, and we all cried talking about it that night. They listened to me recounting detailed examples, which broke their heart to hear. But they heard me and felt my words. Fast forward to now, and I'm a year into my new life I've made for myself. I landed my dream job, making way more money than I know what to do with. My friends all appreciate me for my oddities, and I connect with my coworkers. My hobbies outside of work are engaging and satisfying. I trust my mental faculties again, because my judgment is consistently validated by the success of my work here. I've been on dates, and even gotten into bed, but unfortunately I lock up. I apologize, and have to stave off the urge to cry. Your inability to reciprocate physical intimacy in our last year together wasn't something I will fault you for. It sucks, though, that it trained a deep subconscious response in me to fully suppress my sexual urges when I'm with someone I want to share myself with. If I would've given up and let you go, I could've avoided that effect. But that's not what I chose. I think I can work my way through the sex thing slowly when I find the right person. I'm in no hurry, because for what it's worth, I've become uncannily content being by myself. This was a long letter, largely a detailed recounting of events. But I had to write them out, because I need reality to be seen as reality. I would love to talk about all our good times, the times that made us who we are now. The happiest days of my life. But I won't send you this letter in real life, because you would use it as a weapon. And who can blame you - you're an artist. It would evoke an emotional response. You couldn't _not_ write about how this would make you feel if I sent it. Coupled with your version of reality, it just couldn't end well. I'm not strong enough to walk into it again. Maybe one day. But not today. Get help if you haven't. I loved you, S."

That is the hardest part about letting this whole thing go. I have tried the version where you were just a manipulative user and I was a sorry sap who just kept giving in. The version where you never cared. But then, I think of the things you told me. Deep, personal, even painful things. I think of the sadness in your eyes when we first met. I think of the gentleness and sweetness you showed many times- and the vulnerability as well. I think of how you liked to hear me say that I missed you, and how you told me you had felt things. It makes that version of truth so very hard to understand. None of that ""fluff"" and kindness and stuff and bearing your soul- was necessary, nor requested. You just offered it- spontaneously.... I don't get it. On the other hand, if you cared, even a bit, you would have been a better person towards me. You wouldn't have taken me for granted. You wouldn't have promised more than you ever could deliver. You also wouldn't have picked the very deepest types of hurts to inflict towards someone, who had shared what those hurts could be. You knew what I went through- and why I was where I was at...how could anyone but a monster turn around and do the same thing to me again, when I was seeking refuge? Do I settle on a middle ground...where flaws and hurts and history has molded us into being people who psychologically and mentally sometimes, we abuse the ones that we do care about- because that was how we were raised? That we accept that abuse over and over...because when we were children, our abusers were are parents and we don't know any better? See that is where I keep finding myself...with you. That you and I occupy an orbit, or a place in space and time, along with many, many others...others who had crappy childhoods, dysfunctional parents, and experienced and felt things no child should ever experience...that in addition to those rings of shared experience, we were quirky, a bit naughty, and a bit devious as well, or deviant. It is a very full place in deed, it is however a place where one may never encounter another member of that place unless there is another thread, another connection. We just happened to have those other connections... All I know is that there is a void in my life where you used to be. I don't know if it will ever be filled, and honestly, I don't think I could bear to search to fill it again with someone like you. I think the cost to me would be too high. At least that is what I feel today. VenusM"

Hear your feelings. If you didnt cut me out and ignore me. I know I hurt you, and I know I suck. A lot what went wrong was my fault. I saw you lurking on my story even though you unfollowed me, I wish youd just talk to me. At the very least we could remain friends, you are important to me. I should have told you from the beginning that I sucked at communication and expressing my feelings. I never wanted to talk about my feelings or burden you with my desires because you were always working so hard. You had only one day off every week and part of your job was socializing; thats a lot of emotional labor-I didnt want to make you do any more of that. I should have told you how happy you made me, and how I hoped I made you feel the same. I wish I was more vulnerable and asked you if I could give you my heart. I was never ever trying to toy with you. I tried to be as sincere and as little of a burden to you as possible. Truthfully I wanted to serve my heart to you on a fucking platter and I wanted so badly to risk everything for the chance to fall in love with you. I knew it was a matter of time until I did. Instead, I meekly asked if it was ok to develop a crush on you. Fuck fear and fuck trauma. Im so tired of it costing me. I appreciated your presence so much in my life that I wanted to do everything I could to make things easy for you. I knew you worked all the time. The last thing I wanted was for you to be worried about texting me or feeling like you would disappoint me for not getting back to me sooner. But of course the way I communicated that to you came off like I wasnt fond of hearing from you at all or that you were talking to me too much. I noticed you started to put distance between us then. I should have explained myself further, and I could have asked you how you felt. I also wish that I had held you tighter the night you were vulnerable with me and your voice cracked when you spoke about close losses youve experienced in your life. Instead I froze, going through a million scenarios in my head to try to comfort you while all I could muster was silence, and a weak attempt at holding you gently. I wish I had asked you about it more, told you how much I cared, and told you how I wanted to hear your every thought. To support you the best that I could. It kills me that you stifled your feelings. But all Ive ever experienced from love was abuse so instead I just kept all of this to myself. Afraid to be a burden but afraid to be vulnerable. Truth be told I wanted to spend more time with you than I was. I loved waking up next to your drowsy self-you were the most adorable human. I loved your sleepy eyes in the morning. I wish I had worshiped your body more; told you how much I loved your strong masculine chest, back, and soft torso. I adored your body exactly as it was. There was nothing I disliked about you. You were an angel. I should have set my heart in flames for you. But hell Im also annoyed because not only did I suck at communicating, but so did you. I told you vaguely of my trauma, you also could have told me how you felt instead. When and how I hurt you vs backing off. Your feelings mattered to me and they still do. You taught me a hard lesson I needed to learn and because of you Ill be sure to radicalize my vulnerability. If you ever decide to give us a second try, Ill give you my heart and soul. Im ok with being swallowed whole by you and only you. I never got to make you tacos, show you the new lingerie I bought because of you, or go to that old theatre in town with you. I wanted to explore more of the area we were both from together and see the things that made you happy growing up. I wanted to watch all the anime with you and hear more of your stories of your country. Maybe kick your ass at some video games or have a sass competition together. Ill always have a soft spot for you, &lt;\3, MR"
448,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Connection,6,buxg4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/buxg4q/connection/,2019-05-31 05:33:20,"I had to read a bunch of police reports about a child fatality today. Over the years Ive read the reports and files for so many tragedies, so many people suffering horrible brutal losses. People can experience such awful intense pain both accidentally and at the hands of other people. And, every time I review these tragedies, my heart hurts for the people involved and the losses they suffered and the world we live in. And it makes me so grateful for the people who are a part of my life, flawed and imperfect though they may be. It makes me long for and value human connection wherever I can find it. It makes me value laughter and love and time with people I care about so highly. And it makes me keenly feel the connections Ive lost. I miss you, A. I wish you were still in my life. I valued you and the friendship we had. I miss the connection. Even if it wasnt long or intense, it was a valuable connection. It meant a lot to me. I watched a video recently from Brene Brown where she explains the difference between empathy and sympathy. She notes that empathy is a hard choice to make because, it requires you to connect with the other person and, to connect, you have to identify with something in yourself that knows the pain the other person is suffering. Sympathy is peering down into the hole and saying, aww, thats too bad and then trying to offer a silver lining. While empathy is crawling into the hole with the person and listening and giving them a hug. She points out that what you say or do isnt going to fix the other persons pain. It is the connection that you offer, the act of saying I know how hard this must be and Im here for you, you arent alone that provides comfort. And, ultimately, the connection that is forged benefits you both. You were going through some stuff and I climbed into the hole with you and listened and offered support. I shared some of my stuff with you and you did the same. In our shared empathy, we forged a connection. Even though it wasnt long lasting, it had value. Thats why I dont understand how you could sever the connection so easily. I know you have empathy. I know you felt empathy. I saw it. I dont think I imagined it. So, how did you so easily go from being in the hole with me sharing a connection to looking down from the surface saying aww, too bad, have a nice life! I really dont understand people who push others away, who choose to sever all connection with someone on a whim, who consider friendships and relationships to be disposable. I understand the need to do that in the face of truly abusive behavior. But, most people these days arent cutting people off because of abuse and I certainly wasnt abusive to you. They are doing it because they cant be bothered to accommodate and work with the little imperfections they find in the people they interact with. Rather than communicate about boundaries and compromise, they throw the whole relationship away. If someone is odd or or has an annoying laugh or an anxious communication style or tells boring stories or likes Star Trek or doesnt smile enough or tries too hard or shows vulnerability or openly expresses that they care, they are deemed to be too much work and are discarded in the name of protecting oneself and putting oneself first. Cut ties, block them, and move on has become standard and accepted advice for any annoyance or conflict. When did selfishness and intolerance masked as self care become the mantra of the day?"

Theres attraction and occasional flirtation followed by months of not seeing each other. Lots of push and pull. More recently Ive been waiting for an opportunity to really talk with you, maybe exchange numbers and start getting to know each other better. But so far this has not happened. Unfortunately, our circumstances are such that moving toward each other right now would be self-destructive, self-immolating even. For both of us. We work together and you, I sense, are not in a stable place. I wont do anything to impugn or jeapordize either of our careers or reputations, and I wont lose my integrity. I am writing you this unsent letter, which will remain unsent, because I need to let this go for now. If a real connection develops between us I will welcome it, but right now I am lost in my fantasies of you, and that isnt a good place for me to be in. We met last year and this energy between us didnt exist at that time. But between then and now, something changed in both of us. My marriage ran into very serious, unexpected trouble  that is what happened for me. I have no idea whats happening for you. From the outside looking in it seems like youre doing some questioning. Once, when I was separated from my spouse, I spotted you and engaged you in conversation. It wasnt flirtatious, particularly, but there was an energy between us that wasnt there previously. I noticed it, and Im positive you did too. Over the next few times we saw each other, you made a point to touch me, to be physically close to me. You seemed, and seem, really nervous around me. To this point you havent really talked to me, and I think its because youre so nervous. Youre willing to approach me and make physical contact, touch my arm and my shoulder, but not to speak with me. Ive tried to initiate conversation with you and youve mumbled a one or two word reply, looking extremely anxious the entire time. You have a cute habit of playing with your hair when youre anxious. It makes you very endearing to me. Other times you pretend not to see me and totally blow me off. We work together so its weird like that. I also sense that you struggle with your feelings  perhaps specifically, these feelings in the general sense  and also, that you are emotionally intense and blow hot and cold. The intermittent reinforcement from you has me excited, confused and titillated. I dont know what you want, but I think you are intrigued and interested in me. I think you like me, mostly because of how tongue tied and flustered you become when were close, and I really, really like you too. At the very least, I am attracted to you  so attracted to you that it takes me over body and soul occasionally. I feel tenderness for you, intense lust, great curiosity, and protectiveness. All the precursors of love if we had the opportunity to nurture it. You touch me deep inside my heart. You exude a vulnerability that I respond to very strongly. Some of it is probably because you bear more than a passing resemblance to my most recent ex, the woman I was with for eleven years and considered my wife, even though same sex marriage wasnt legal back then and once things did loosen up and marriage/civil union was a possibility, the relationship was starting to fall apart. I met the woman to whom I am now married very quickly after it ended. I am both very happy and very unhappy in my marriage and you are my escape from it. Thats not fair to either of us and isnt the foundation for pursuing a deeper connection. I adore you. But I recognize that these feelings are a mixture of projection and infatuation, since I dont know you at all and you cannot have these types of feelings, legitimately, for someone you dont know. I want you to know these things: \- I am very interested in getting to know you as a human \- I am open to whatever is in store for us (including platonic friendship) \- I enjoy my attraction to you very much but I wont continue to use it as an excuse for avoiding things in my life which trouble me \- I hope that we become closer  whether platonic or otherwise"

Youre a light, radiating a clever complexity and a candid charm; carefree but calculated. Youre a light, and Im a spastic moth, continually drawn in only to bounce right off and spiral away somewhere - and still, I want you. But youre also the dark; an unknown entity.

Those words continue to protect me from vulnerability. Without those words from a poem or excerpt that I no longer remember, I wouldnt have gotten over my fear of future hardships and the thought of death. So go ahead, use them in your song. Use them without knowing the meaning behind them. Use them without understanding how I passionately I feel about never being turned into what what you made me. You hurt me tonight. Or maybe I hurt myself. Either way, your eyes were locked with mine the entire song. You didnt scan the crowd or ignore my general direction like you usually do. I thought that maybe, after months of being awkward, we were finally going to get past it all. Im not even going to lie about the fact that I moved to a spot across the room to confirm my suspensions.

You have a no-nonsense approach to parenting. There are no extraneous hugs or overly sentimental affirmations of affection, you quietly watch, and prod people on to do their best. You advise and bring logic and rationale to a situation. I want to say I admire you, and I also understand why you are skeptical of my relationship with your son. On the surface, it does seem to raise questions, perhaps from a cursory glance it appears rather foreboding or suspicious, as if a bad ending would be inevitable. To be fair, I think if I were in your position, I would think the same. I would advise caution, and perhaps not to get in too over my head, and to leave it at a distance, a fantasy or daydream, something to think about to give motivation towards, but nothing that should be acted upon. And considering your son's past history of relationships, you would probably be correct in your assumption. He's had so many relationships that ended up in heartbreak and disappointment, that it's only natural that you would be concerned. Then there are the external features, the age difference, the cultural differences, the differences in experiences. I'm certain if I were to examine this relationship in terms of these features, I would probably come to the same conclusion. However, I sometimes think that extraordinary things can occur from seemingly ordinary events and that what I feel for your son is not anything I've ever experienced before. I'd like to say that I think your son is wonderfully brilliant and although he's perfectly capable of making his own decisions, that I would never want to take him away from you. I only want to add to his life. I don't want to create a burden or cause unnecessary pain. I understand the predicament you are in, and I understand your reservations. I want to add to his life and I think we can create beautiful work together, to be each other's confidantes, allies and to support each other. He has everything to lose, and I have nothing to lose, but I don't actually want him to lose anything, or endanger his future in any way. I hope I will have a part in creating his lasting legacy. I don't want anything aside from spending time with him. Your son has been psychologically beaten down for so long, but he has so much to give to the world. He still has so much to do. You have shaped who he is, the man who he is now, and you will always be the most important woman in his life. I know you have always put duty to your children above all else. You've made so many sacrifices. I wonder if you recall a time that you were in love, if perhaps you should've acted when you didn't and stayed silent? I wonder if there was someone whose friendship and care you had wanted above all else? I understand you are practical and that you might view passions as a luxury when there's so much to be done elsewhere. I think though, passion is a great motivator for change. The worst we can suffer from is apathy. I know it is in your nature to remain strong and not show any vulnerability and your son has taken after you in that regard. I hope you will understand that what seems at a cursory glance does not entail this particular situation. I only want to love him."

I didn't do it for me, I just couldn't see a possibility of you being happy with me, I was on depression medication for years, you were with me when I got put on them. This is just as way for me to vent how everything felt, because I never had the courage to tell you, there wasn't a snowball's chance I was going to let you see an opening in my armor, I had to be strong for you and me. After you cheated I was absolutely crushed, and I tried to forgive you; to continue life attempting to believe it didn't happen, find ways to validate your explanations, anything.. and I just couldn't. It kept me up at night, every time you didn't pick up the phone, every time you were out with a friend, I couldn't trust you and it ate away at me inside. Then I mistreated you because I didn't have the nerve to end it until I did, I turned into an envious distrusting jerk. When you asked me about it I told you ""if it happens again, it happens.. there's nothing I can do about it, I'm not going to think about it."" I think that was the moment I admitted to you that I wasn't afraid to lose you, but in all reality I was just trying to show that I wasn't vulnerable,. I had transformed you into a predator in my mind, you would pounce on any sign of vulnerability I had and tear me to pieces through whatever make believe mischievous acts my imagination could concoct. We met for lunch, I found out you had gotten engaged, 6 months no less after we had broken up. You asked me for relationship advice with your current fiance, and at the time I didn't understand what that meant sub textually, but years later I recognized that it meant, when it came to love.. you felt comfortable asking me for advice, like you knew I was genuine and genuinely loved you and wanted the best for you, and I shrugged it off like such an asshole. I just walked ahead of you thinking "" The nerve of her, coming to me for relationship advice"" I didn't show any emotion about you being engaged but it absolutely crushed me. We were together for somewhere around 6 years, I just thought that because you didn't mourn as long as me I didn't matter as much to you. Truth be told, I didn't recognize how unhealthy it seems to jump from guy to guy, relationship to relationship, never truly being happy with being alone is until later in life. When we talked you asked if I thought about you, and I told you ""no, it's like you're dead to me, I know of you but I don't think of you or wonder about you, no emotional attachment at all"" What a crock of bullshit that was. It's been somewhere around 5 years, and I still dream about you. When I do I have bad days and I'm upset until the next day. The dreams are always sad, and as many dreams as I have I always remember the ones with you in them. Some friends came forward to me about how things were from their perspective after the breakup, they told me about how.. you and I were so close, and they were all loyal to me.. that you asked to hang out with them after we broke up and they all said they avoided you, and from the bottom of my heart.. I've never felt so horrible. You adopted my family, and when we ended things not a single person sided with you or even tried to make you feel better. Everyone knew you cheated and all of the horrible things, but no one knew the asshole I became after it happened. You didn't deserve any of it. I ended it the day I decided that it wasn't fair to you, or me being as unhappy as we were. To this day I doubt you'd ever understand that the person helping me through it all wasn't a romantic interest. She was a bit older than I am, and we haven't talked in years.. but she helped me understand that you and I were both at fault and not good for each other no matter how badly you or I wanted it. We were kids, and neither of us knew better. You weren't right, and I definitely wasn't right. I'd like to think since then I've matured emotionally, I look at things differently, and although it ended badly.. I don't blame you, and I definitely don't hate you. I hope you have the happiest fucking life, from the bottom of my heart. I still think about you, and I still dream about you. I was thinking of the little things, about how.. I'd forgotten your birthday finally in hopes that I've moved on, and then I saw someone on facebook that looked like you but a different last name and had assumed you had gotten married, that affected me more than I care to admit. I don't know if I'll ever get you off my mind, but it has been almost 5 years. I hope you move out of my head soon."

There was never a beginning or end to the story. Just an observation you made repeatedly, as your eyes drifted to the vacant kitchen. I didnt push the subject, but I couldnt help but wonder what, if anything, prompted that moment. Its been four years since Mom called to confirm what we had all suspected for a while. Still, I wasnt prepared for the way dementia sounds to say out loud. It wasnt just harmful plaque aimlessly floating around in a pool of gray matter  it sought to possess you. To change you. To mark you permanently. Those days you now vaguely remember, those days where we used to have fun, those are the days I cant stop thinking about. In those days, you were a grandmother who bought me books, fed me too many snacks, and would sit down with me to do crossword puzzles together. This kindness and sensitivity was a special characteristic you only shared with your grandchildren, though. For the most part, you were a tough iron woman who didnt take anyones shit. You were strong to an almost intimidating level, but only out of your fierce love for the things that mattered. And thats why your sudden change has hit so hard. When I look into your brown crescent-shaped eyesMY brown crescent-shaped eyesI see a vulnerability I never had before. Fragility where there once was so much power. Accepting your radical change has been as hard to swallow as what inevitably comes next. Maybe I cant control what you remember, but I know that as the yesterdays disappear, I need to try to be there for the nows. It might not be much, and it might not stick, but it hopefully means something, even if for brief, fleeting moments We used to have fun, but we still can, too."

It's like you're looking deep into me, peering into my soul and seeing all of my vulnerability. Those moments are normally followed by your tender voice telling me you like me so much. I know we haven't had the relationship talk, so I shouldn't have made the assumption. But something deep within me genuinely feels as though when you stare at me so intently with those eyes that you love me. I've felt love from you for awhile now, enough so that for the first time I didn't have any doubts that someone could feel that for me. I didn't bring up the conversation the way I thought I would. Actually, I didn't really bring it up at all. I just said we would need to talk about it soon. Knowing that bringing it up stressed you out a little bit immediately made me realize that it is completely possible that you don't love me, and that you could potentially never feel the same way. Maybe you do just want our lableless nonsense to continue on until it just doesn't anymore, and I've taken things too far. Maybe I've been projecting my own feelings on to you. Maybe this is the first time I've been in something healthy, and I mistook all of the kindness and safety I felt from you as something it is not. I know that you genuinely care for me, and have no doubt that you like me so much. You would never hurt me. But maybe I don't light your fire. You hugged me tightly when we said goodbye, as anxious tears escaped because even talking about eventually needing to talk sparks anxiety in me. You asked me not to over think it the moment you left, you told me whatever is going on in my head I'm not alone in feeling it. Reminded me it's okay to talk about my needs. But you knew the moment you left it was going to be over thought. I guess the over thinking is one thing I know for sure stems from the chemical imbalance. I'm wondering if it's also to blame for taking something I was sure of, and turning into something I doubted so quickly. I wish emotions weren't terrifying. I keep reminding myself that if when we eventually talk, it doesn't have the best outcome. That it's okay. Not everyone I'll ever love is going to love me back. That's not either of our faults. If this were to end here, I would be heartbroken. I would miss you terribly, and deeply. But it would also have been an important mark on my life where I learned something that I needed to know. This experiance would have taught me how I deserve to be treated. Knowing how you treat me, and how this feels. I don't think I could ever settle for being treated with anything less than the kindness and respect you've shown me I deserve. You've unknowingly taught me what I should expect from partners. I know that chances are the next time I see you we'll be back to our usual, and this will have all been in my head. But what if that's not the case? I only hope that if it does end I have the words to tell you what you've taught me. But I really really hope the next time I see you I'll be able to laugh at my over thinking as we get back into our silly little routines."

I may entrust you so much in you, dont be overwhelmed let me know if its too much. Ill be clingy some moments, I can give you space just I hope you let me know. I may be ready to jump the gun and do so many things with you, my brain likes to confuse infatuation with love, enjoy it my darling. I try and learn your interest, so I can understand you better. I may buy you things, I only do this as giving is one of my forms of appreciation for you. I may curate to your needs in the bedroom and put your pleasure over mine, I never want to make you seem unsatisfied. But, I cry most of the time, my home life is stressful, I wont cling on to you as my saviour as I learned a long time ago never trust one person. I may never believe your empty promises as Ive learned to never get hopes up. I tend to overthink quite often as I may just leave in the dust, so you dont leave me because Im scared. Im not being scared of being alone, Im scared Ill have to prepare for the expiration date of you. Someone long ago once told me that I shouldnt mourn a friendship that hasnt been dead, I keep that in mind when Im ready to leave you. I put your needs before mine, so for you to never feel the weight of my emotional vulnerability. I never want you to think that you have to watch over me, you dont I just need support sometimes. This is my life, living with this diagnosis. I wish I could tell you that my diagnosis would explain everything about me but everyone thinks were manipulative monsters. Were not, this mainly stemmed from childhood trauma, Im trying to rewire my brain into not believing in the irrational side of me. Its hard and Im keeping my distance because I really like you, but you dont need me in your life. Its hurts me to know that Im alone now and its worse when I know that I chose it, dont make the same mistake as me I tried to tell myself to not do this but I did chose it. I hope this was an explanation of me leaving, I do miss you and I know youre a phone call away but its for your best"

You had a white hat on, it was raining and I drove by you. Shortly after, you came into my life and since then, my life has been transformed. I couldnt imagine youd want to be with me. I also couldnt imagine I could handle dating someone who looks the way you do. You are tall and handsome and have beautiful and kind blue eyes. You are always impeccably put together but approachable and sweet. You notice and befriend the outcasts and find humor in the silliness of the insane behavior we human beings inevitably display. You are strongly drawn to the blessing of those unbreakable bonds we find and form in family and speak with reverence about your sisters, brother and parents. I was drawn to you immediately. I would be lying if I said it wasnt your appearance, it undoubtedly played a role. However, it was your kindness, your giggle, your intellect, your integrity, your steadfast endeavor towards a peaceful mind, the endearing nature you offered to all, your curiosity, your willingness to believe in possibility, your optimism and your journey that catalyzed the rebellion in my heart against the fear inside my mind. You told me you loved me quickly and first. That night, you appeared distressed and afraid and confirmed you were both. I desperately, at my core, want to be loved and accepted. As a result, I have always said I love you first in a relationship because I want to hear it back. With you, I never would have because I would have been afraid of scaring you away. I was always so afraid youd wake up and realize you could have any woman you wanted and come to your senses. Eventually, I believed maybe you did know that and I was the only woman you wanted. The circumstances of our relationship all pointed to a destructive end, yet with time, I truly believed we were two people who were supposed to share a life together. Soul mates we said - and it felt like we meant it. We both indulge in thought patterns that lead us to believe we are lacking and what was really special about us was the instinctual and aggressive nature with which we built each other up. Unfortunately, we both spent a tragically excessive portion of our lives perfecting the art of protecting ourselves from certain experiences. We deemed ourselves masons early in our lives and constructed impenetrable walls designed to shelter us from things we deemed too painful. The thing about walls though is that they eliminate the path through. The safety we secured in the shelters we built became prisons where the freedom found in the through was not possible. To love is to be vulnerable and vulnerability means going through despite the potential for failure and pain. So, here I am - master playwright in the genre of self fulfilling prophecy - artfully (and predictably) playing the role I know so well while you revel in the marvel of the effectiveness of self preservation strategies you execute with learned precision. Foolish pride in our orange wardrobe is all that remains of that powerful connection we shared. The love we shared, however, fractured the foundation of my self imposed prison and THROUGH the cracks, there is light. With light, I found the sterling silver lining of a violent storm in the colorful miracle of the rainbow. The future will be colorful and bright for me and for you if we have the courage to brave the storm."

I have written this carefully in my mind a hundred times, but now that the words are in black and white, I am losing it and I want to start over again. The point is I don't really know what to start with. I am not even sure if I will ever send this to you. It feels like I'm trying to scrape off old chewing gum from a school table with a toothpick. &amp;#x200B; When I think back to the moments with you, I think back to a lot of laughter. Sometimes i look up in all the unknown cities where I have been recently with the thought that you would have appreciated the small details in the buildings. &amp;#x200B; I rattle, what I want to give you is my regret. Your intentions and your words were soft, while I counter-projected the cold and ugly of myself onto you. That was sincerely not fair and therefore my regret. &amp;#x200B; I admit, you were right. It was actually not a moment for me to start dating, let alone have the idea that I was capable of sharing myself with someone. There have been so many moments when I could tell what was hidden in me, but at that moment i chose to push it as far away as possible, including you. &amp;#x200B; At a certain point you asked me about the people who came back in my life. I actually remember that conversation quite well. Even though I really gave you only a small detail of what has not been relevant for years, but that one thing that I thought I was strong enough to do was just rolled over me again by the arrival of those people. &amp;#x200B; A new round, new opportunities, new words but still the same feeling. &amp;#x200B; Those 3 hours every night were really not good for me at all, especially when I was constantly analyzing how things could have turned out differently and constantly trying to play a new scenario for what I had lost. Years ago I once had a beautiful flower growing in me and I had to say goodbye because i was too young. The people who came back did not really interest me much because the content of their words were not valuable, but it did bring me back to a sense of despair and sadness because I associate those people with that time and the person I was then. Normally I do not attach myself so much to people and to a period in which they occurred but this was precious, this was still sadness and how innocent the contact was it would always be about the past. I didn't have the space and I didn't want to give it. It has gone as it should have been and now that I am thinking clearly again, I know that it was not logical to let myself be carried away by what I illustrated in my head. &amp;#x200B; Those people are just a vague reminder of what I used to be, it was myself that triggered it. &amp;#x200B; Something that I had consciously made a rational choice for became an emotional boat trip at once and sorry that I let you get carried into my childish behavior, my blunt words were not meant for you at all. They are not cold emotions that I am writing now and it is not a flurry of how they illustrate it in comic books, BOEM, BAM, WAAA! This is my piece of vulnerability that I did not dare to share with you but now I want to tell you honestly what actually went through my mind. I also don't expect you to respond to this, but now that I can put myself back in what it might have been for others, I don't mind sharing it with you. &amp;#x200B; It's pretty strange how things went, despite everything I don't regret having met a person like you. &amp;#x200B; It was nice to hear from you again but also quite confusing because I still can't put my finger on it if you were serious about us, maybe it's better if I don't know. At least you have something to laugh with your friends about another crazy girl and secretly I am quite happy that I can be such a silly person. &amp;#x200B; The card I sent you was an invitation to smile again, to share music, to get new ideas, even if it would be as friends or as two new strangers meeting for the first time. I Like to listen to you about how you are doing and whether you have already come up with new melodies. &amp;#x200B; But what I hope most is that you feel good and are happy wherever you are. That you can come up with new beautiful stories before bedtime, you no longer suffer from headaches, and you give yourself the chance to read the words of your best friend. &amp;#x200B; I hope you find the person you can kiss in words and talk endlessly about the new recipes you've discovered and don't have the urge to walk away. Thanks for your love, your jokes, your songs, the playlist you made, the book you gave me and even all those invitations to fight. (one of your silly jokes) &amp;#x200B; X"

I love how vulnerable you are with me, and that makes me hate myself because I cant be vulnerable with you. I dont know why. I certainly dont judge you and I just dont know if you would judge me. This thought makes me sad. It makes me sad about how the one person I truly care most about cant see how I feel, or at least, I cant show them how I feel. But I dont even know how I feel. I dont know how I feel about you. I know I love you. I just dont know how much I love you. Vulnerability. Its showing your weakest side to someone. But what can you do when you just cant show them the weakest side of you. The battles you fight is what makes the strongest part of you. How can you show someone who you truly are without showing them the weakest part of you, without showing them your scars or even helping them understand them? Hell, I barley understand them. You know what Im most afraid of? Im most afraid of getting attached. Im most afraid of finding an easing comfort in your smile, finding a comfort in hugging you and hearing your heartbeat as I lay my head on your chest.

All throughout my life people have left me. So many of my friends drifted away from me whenever they met someone who was better than me. I was always fine with that. Thats just a part of life. I never tried to fight that - if someone wanted to leave, I didnt put up a fight. Maybe because I didnt really care about them all that much. But I remember, way back when we were just friends, when I felt like you were the one drifting out of my life - I felt so much anxiety and pain. Id genuinely never liked or cared about someone as much as I did you. I didnt realise that I cared so much about you until I felt like you were slipping away. I didnt really understand why I felt so strongly about it at first. And when I finally started to have an inkling, I vehemently denied it to myself. I still have the notes to prove that period of denial existed. But then one night while I was lying in bed, I just admitted it - I liked you so much more than a friend should. It was terrifying because I never thought that youd ever want to be with me. I wanted to keep it a secret from you, but I couldnt help how I felt. So one night, the courage finally came to me. I was dodging around it at first, but trying to give you hints about my own feelings, as well as trying to get you to reveal anything at all about your own. It took awhile, but it all finally came out in the end. Even now, I still have those messages saved. Im embarrassed to admit that reading through them still gives me butterflies, even to this day (they are now extremely painful, guilty butterflies). Despite the fact it made me so happy that we were together, it was around this time that my mental health took a plunge that Im still trying to work through. It was slow at first, but then just gradually got worse and worse. I didnt want to talk to you about how I felt; I didnt want to admit that I was weak, nor did I want to worry you. In the end, I finally told you, and you were so supportive of me. You are so lovely. You are so kind and understanding, and Ive never deserved you. I didnt get the help I needed for so long. I shared all of these horrible feelings with you. I put this huge burden on you and only you. I worried you so much, you were terrified Id do something stupid. I could never see how much it was affecting you. Im sorry that I worried you. Im sorry that I made you feel all this pressure to make me happy. It was never your duty to make me better. I will always be a mess, no relationship will fix that. You couldnt help with my depression, but even still you were a huge light in my life. Despite all the pain I felt, the days when I would see you were bliss. I had worries, I had insecurities, I had irrational thoughts - but they would finally quieten down when we were together. I was oftentimes so at peace with you. Its just a shame that my peace came at the cost of your own mental health. I have so many problems with intimacy, with my mental health, with vulnerability - with everything. It always made me feel like a broken human being. But you made that okay. You made it okay to be broken. I had all these flaws, but you loved me despite them. Despite all the stress I put you under, you were so kind and patient with me, and I genuinely cannot thank you enough. I really dont know where Id be today without your support. Im sorry that I made you feel like you couldnt share your own thoughts and problems with me. Im so frustrated and angry that you didnt, but I have to accept that it was my own actions that mustve made you feel that way. You felt as though sharing these things wouldnt make a difference in our relationship, and even though I believe that is untrue, I know that I made you feel like that was reality. These thoughts dont come from nowhere. All I really want is to help you like youve helped me. When we first broke up, all I dreamt about was you comforting me and taking back your words, talking about how you didnt mean what you said and that you made a mistake. But now, all Im dreaming about is me supporting you. Ive had so many dreams where Ive needed to help you in some way - they plague me. Its like my brains trying to make up for me not doing that in real life. What I want to do right now is thank you. Youve stuck with me through my darkest days, and even if you couldnt always be there physically, you were always a comfort when we messaged each other. Youve put up with so much bullshit for me. I really cant blame you for wanting to leave. I cant hold that against you. Thank you for being a beautiful human being. I love you so much. I honestly dont know how Ill ever get over you. Thank you for supporting me for the last four years. What you have done for me is so idiotically selfless, and I dont think that Ill ever meet someone as amazing as you again in my lifetime. Youre one of a kind. Thank you for being there."

All you ever did was lie to me and manipulate me and use me to feel good about yourself. That isnt how you treat someone who you care about or have any respect for, especially not a friend. Youve told our friends that you miss me but I dont believe it. You just miss having someone naive enough to believe in you. You never cared about me. You just needed a constant source of attention and validation; someone who saw you how you wanted to be seen. You are the biggest phony I have ever known. You act so self righteous, yet you are the biggest offender of the transgressions you ridicule others for. The good man you pretend to be is all an illusion. That man would have wanted to make things right, but you tucked your tail and walked away like the coward that I now know you are. As soon as you realized that I was no longer going to play along with whatever this was, you discarded me. You left me alone to piece together your lies and bizarre behavior. My value to you was equal to my compliance. Maybe you were just hoping that I would never figure out who you really are and what sick game you were playing. I honestly think that the only reason that you pretended to feel guilty and said that you miss me is because youve burned bridges and ruined relationships with other people. Its obvious that you're grasping at straws here, and its honestly pretty insulting. If I was half as important to you as you once pretended that I was; if you valued our relationship at all, then you wouldve had something to say months ago. One honest conversation would have all but solved everything and you couldnt even show up for that. You invested so much time and energy into smothering me and controlling me in ways that I never asked for, but you were never interested in open communication or any type of actual healthy relationship. Im honestly really glad that you didn't bother because that gave me the time and space to heal, and to build real, healthy relationships with good and honest people. Relationships based on mutual respect, and honest communication; two things you could never sustain. My connections with other people have shown me that even the good days with you were bad. You are an all-consuming bottomless pit; ravenous for admiration and approval, with no consideration for those you drain the life from. You constantly lie and use exaggerated gestures to confuse people with your charade. You want to believe that youre this generous and honorable man but your benevolence is all a display. Your over the top grand gestures are unsolicited and always come at a price. You are so obsessed with being perceived as the good guy that you play the white knight in shining armor just to get your validation when you have no actual regard for those that you manipulate. You are always on the hunt for new people to convince, chasing opportunities to play your role. But, you take no initiative to maintain the relationships you already have. You go to great lengths to live in drama and novelty instead of putting in the effort it requires to have anything tangible or worthwhile. I suspect that most of your relationships and friendships go this way and that's why you cant keep people in your life. You have to keep everyone at an arm's length in order to maintain your mask of lies. Your charade is a cheap imitation of love and intimacy, and it ultimately leaves you unfulfilled and unsatisfied. And that is your tragedy. Your desperate need for love, true acceptance, and genuine human connection will always be thwarted by your insatiable desire to be deceitful. I can see that the disconnect is slowly killing you. You are empty and lifeless; for that I pity you. At this point, I truly believe that you are incapable of having honest and meaningful relationships. You choose to play the same games over and over again with ALL of the people in your life, knowing all the while that it will never fill the void. Its a sickness. You are a predator; the way you go after vulnerable people who you force dependence on, so that they feel like they cant speak up or leave. You twist the narrative of every situation to somehow always play either the hero or the victim without realizing that youve been the villain all along. Our entire relationship was just a sick game of how bizarre you could make things and how much bullshit you could sell me before I would finally speak up. You spent months pushing boundaries, gaslighting me, and creating double standards just to see how far I would let you push me. You made me feel crazy for holding you to the same standards that you pretended to hold yourself to. But, you always had an explanation or excuse that you sold so confidently no matter how nonsensical it was. You proved time and time again with your actions that you have no real morals or integrity, and you never actually did. I played along for as long as I did, not because I was desperate to keep you around, but because you are so moody and unstable that I was honestly afraid of what you were capable of. You berate anyone who speaks out against you. Youve lied about serious, horrible things just to get sympathy and attention; faking vulnerability to create a false sense of trust and intimacy. Then you made everything a tumultuous whirlwind of intensity and confusion because you realized that no intelligent or logical person would fall for any of your bullshit if they were in their right mind. Your behavior was outlandish; from making grand gestures, big declarations and promises one moment and then treating me like an afterthought the next. You did everything you could to make this as confusing and miserable for me as possible because you got off on the attention and thinking that you had power over someone else. You feed off of the reactions of other people. You loved making things so muddled and uncomfortable that I doubted if it was even my place to question what was going on. You got off on watching me squirm. Youre so manipulative that you had me apologizing to you for pointing out your abuse. And wasnt I just the perfect victim? I made this so easy for you by giving you the benefit of the doubt time and time again, because I always want to believe the best in the people that I care about and I find it nearly impossible to give up on those I love. You knew I was too unsure of myself to ask what the fuck is going on here? The second I FINALLY spoke up, you were nowhere to be found. You would rather run away and abandon me in the mess that you created, than even entertain the idea of being honest for once in your life. But I get it now. You cant afford to be honest with yourself, let alone me. I know you well enough to know that you arent smart enough to be some master manipulator. All of this demented behavior comes from the fact that deep down you know that you are insignificant and powerless. Its childish, desperate, and honestly hard to watch. I cannot say this enough times...You need professional help. Im sorry that something must have happened to you that was traumatic enough to cost you your humanity. You sacrificed your ability to have authentic connections with others and even with yourself all in the name of protecting yourself from being hurt. But anyone can see that you are hurting every day. You hurt so much that you have to project your pain onto other people. Who put you down so badly that now you have to inflict abuse on others just to feel relevant? Even after all of this, I dont hate you. I forgave you a long time ago because I dont want to carry around any resentment or bitterness because of you. This relationship was incredibly toxic and going no contact with you for the last several months is a decision I will always stand by. I really do hope that you grow as a person and make some changes because youre currently headed down a dark and lonely path; ultimately you have no one to blame but yourself. But I dont know if there is anything I or anyone else could do to get through to you. You have lied so often, and for so long that the real authentic you ceases to exist. I don't even know if anything is alive behind that mask. I get to close this chapter and move on with my life. But you are forever trapped in the mess youve made and the messes you will continue to make. This is your whole book. There is nothing you can do to fix things between us or make it up to me (not that you would even try). I no longer need you to respect me enough to be honest with me about what I am to you, because I respect myself enough to never subject myself to you and your toxicity ever again. Im not even going to give you this letter because I know that anything I say will fall on deaf ears. You refuse to hear anything that contradicts your narrative. You would most likely find some way to deny everything, twist my words, or lie about what I said, if you dont lie about having read this letter at all. Youll try to write me off as just being bitter that you didnt want to be with me, when thats never what this was about. Im sure it never even occurred to you that maybe I had MY reasons for not wanting to be with YOU. But, that doesnt mean I didn't have love for you. You will never admit what you did, hold yourself accountable, or care enough to be sorry. Even your apologies are disingenuous. You fake remorse and quickly steer the conversation away from anything that even gets close to the truth. I know that I scare you; and that you can never face me, because nothing terrifies you more than having the truth of yourself revealed to you. I know that you would try to spin this as me being obsessed with you or something, and you would love to believe that. But my real, honest truth is that it took a lot of time, and a lot of head and heart work to process what you did to me. It took me months of replaying everything that happened to finally piece together all of your lies and abuse. I got the answers and closure I needed, no thanks to you. Now that I know what hides behind the curtain, it is so clear to me. I dont know how I ever saw you as anything else. I just want you to know that I know who you really are and that you didnt get away with anything. No matter how often you play the victim, no matter how much effort you put into your good guy persona, deep down you and I both know that you are a fraud."

It helps others open up and trust. Trust requires vulnerability and risk. Could you fail? Yep. Could you lose? Yep. Could you get hurt? Yep. Thats ok. We are all human. Always will be. Im exhausted of living in fear. Im not going to let that hold me back. Fail. Fail epically. Fail faster. Lean, grow, change, adapt. Rest when you are tired. Eat when you are hungry. Drink to celebrate. Dance in living room or in the halls of the office. challenge the status quo (while respecting others)! The best teams trust each without fear. They feel included, accepted, loved, seen for who they are, flawed and fabulous! that is what enables them to be creative; to innovate. Its the fear of failure that holds us back. Fail epically, fail daily. But listen to each other stories of heartache and happiness, learn from each other, see each other, fight for each other, support one another, lift others up! Go make someones day. Trust me, it will bring you joy and put a smile on face even through the darkest of your days. Be courageous to be yourself, to think for yourself, to push back against the system. Own yer damn weird! Keep it quirky. Its ok to you. Its ok to be me. We thrive when we are not criticized, put down, shunned, abused. We thrive when we accept and give love. We thrive when we are accepted for who we are, when we are embraced, when we are included. Everyone should have the courage and ability to live their truth without fear of harassment, judgement, slavery, or, imprisonment! Sure, the world doesnt owe me a thing. But I deeply believe we have to be the change we want to see. It starts with planting that one seed. Of love. Of hope. Of acceptance. Of quirky weird fun. The ability to say no, the ability to push back, and to fight for the injustices in the world. we have to have the courage to fight for our rights. And our right to party. Dont let your voice be silent. Use your words, your actions, your time, your energy, your resources in pursuit of: - causes you believe in - things you love - spreading joy, magic, love, support, and acceptance to others! -peace out! All ya need is the courage to own &amp; rock 100% you!"

I hope that it isn't written all over my face like most emotions are. I don't want to interfere with our current friendship but I hope I played it casually enough for her to not dislike me. I am no homewrecker and I have mad appreciation for other females but she isn't kind to you..(at least not in public or maybe I am hypersensitive idk.) She corrected your every word and you seemed reasonably unphased by it. Maybe that's what love is.. Rose colored glasses that we never take off. It reminded me of how harsh I was to my ex when I was going through a stressful time and unknowingly projected but if that is your all's dynamic then I respect that. Everyone has their quirks but I have an inkling that you don't respond well to that sort of thing. Regardless, I just came here to anonymously say that you are a gentle soul and your energy calms me. I know we aren't close but that is both rare and rewarding for me. You deserve someone who inspires you and makes you harness your potential and I know you have more good in you than you would like to reveal. Maybe you had a heartbreak that you only partially repaired from or maybe the world hasn't been as kind as your secretly soft heart would have desired but you are strong and driven and interesting. If you wrote an autobiography, I would read it because it would be fucking hilarious and real. You aren't as hardened and jaded as you seem but it works well for you as a facade. I feel that because everything I am is a defense mechanism. Every joke, sarcastic one liner and awkward grin is a distraction from my biggest fear which is vulnerability. I may never know that side of you but I hope that someone does. I would like to know the you that you keep to yourself. I will never reveal myself but I am glad to have met you even if I thought we would hate each other. Maybe in another dimension we could get to know eachother better but timing is wrong even if it doesn't exist. Oh whale. :)"

It's like a piece of you - or my perception of you - is stuck in my head. It's a comfort to think about how you would feel about things, what advice you would give. Sometimes, I make you crueler than you ever were to punish myself. I feel like you would rejoice in my suffering, in knowing that I feel like life is flaying off one chunk of my happiness at a time and it's starting to look like brisket at the end of the night. &amp;#x200B; Sometimes, kinder; my head in your lap like it never was in real life, your long fingers stroking my hair and telling sweet lies like *It's going to be alright, schatz.* I imagine you missing me and wanting to hear my apologies and despairing of any kind of disdain on my part. &amp;#x200B; How did I ever think you didn't love me? It was clear from the start. The first time I googled *schatz* and saw the sweetness in it, how I could never manage a reliable pet name for you. It was never your fault and I tried and tried to make that clear. I could've decided to overcome my upbringing at any time, worked past the forced detachment and the fear and the preference for anything over vulnerability. I tried at times but fuck, it's so tiring, Ginsy. It's so tiring to pretend I don't think someone's bothered by me or secretly despising me or - these are just excuses, packaged in ugly paper. &amp;#x200B; I don't connect with people well. It takes a lot. The closest I've got - closer than fighting or fucking - was song. The feeling you get when you hit the right note and nothing else in the entire world matters because of what you can do. The feeling of a thunderstorm inside you and it's finally out because that belting note is the thunder and vibrato lightning. Performing with others is the closest I ever got to feeling how I did with you. We never got to sing together, liebe and now I suspect we never will. I should've when we had the chance but we never really did, did we? Someone might walk in the door at any minute and the noise would offend them. The closest I got was singing along to the tracks you sent me, crying along to them at times. &amp;#x200B; You probably think I got into that school out East. I didn't. They told me to go to community college for a year and then they'd allow me in, but it's not worth it. I'm already too old, I think, and it's so expensive. I can hardly handle my current life, much less one with a full class schedule on top of it. I had another possibility but the grant money is all used and I couldn't afford to work and study. You're likely getting grad school acceptance letters now and part of me wants nothing more than to e-mail you and beg you to apply near me. Foolish of me and selfish, but that's me. &amp;#x200B; If I could, I'd pack a few of my things and move to you. Take nothing but my laptop, my records, and the sleeping bag you were so charmed by (such a childish thing, but a precious one). I'd sleep on a hundred ramshackle floors in a hundred shit cities if it meant you'd be by my side. But that's not possible. I have a life here, even if it's rotting and half ruined. I've got an impressive amount of debts to pay. I've got medication to take that I won't be able to afford soon. Besides, there's a million reasons why even living next door wouldn't be enough. There's still the matter of your living situation and I doubt anything less than a fortune from me would be enough to get you out of it. &amp;#x200B; So I stay here and read letters every few days. I like to think I'll find one from you here one day. Sometimes, I imagine that the particularly mean ones are from you. Ones calling out narcissists and selfish women. I check where you used to write, that account is still deleted. I don't check Tumblr anymore. The last time in January sent me so far down that I nearly suffocated under the weight of your memory. You still wrote about the same things, about our things, and I wondered how? I couldn't, I can't. The mere mention of something we shared and I'm gone and here you are still writing and going on and being tumblr's darling. There were a few posts, peppered in, about *a friend* and how you wish things could be *discussed* but it'd have to be in person and Ginsy, that's just not going to happen. I have two settings: completely withdrawn and flippant or, worse in my book, as open as a relief in a dam. It's more like being hit with the spray from a firehose than being hit by sweet emotionalism, I promise you that. &amp;#x200B; I don't look anymore and I refuse to ask anyone about you and I refuse to cyber stalk you like a creep and I refuse to do anything but to gaze mournfully at my computer and wonder why I had to ruin everything beyond the fact that it's second nature to me. I did it to my own life and then I did it to the best thing that ever happened to me and I'm glad I stopped before it transferred to you like some sexually transmitted fungus. I miss you and I love you and I wish I knew how to fix this. &amp;#x200B; \-Vita"

Just look at all your progress from a year ago. You told me back then that you werent happy and I was the one that made you so. Time to retract that statement. As youve found your happy on your own. I havent been a contributing factor for sometime. Thats the way this life goes. I hope you know Im so damn proud of you and the people closest to you are very lucky to have you. I found you in this life and if our souls are blessed enough for another go, I think Ill find you again. Maybe then everything will be in place for us to share an intimate relationship. Ill let that thought comfort me even if there isnt a way to prove where we go when our eyes close for their final time. We never made the time to speak what was on our minds. Although we both tried in our own ways we never did in the way the other needed. I know you dont need these words so I leave them here. Maybe someone else will read it and find a way to clear the air with their intended. I hope it encourages someone to try before its too late. Theres no sense in opening your wounds that have healed so beautifully. It would be selfish of me. Please dont hesitate or keep your distance from me. Im close to finding my happy like you. I have no motives to disrupt what youve got going. I always have and will want whats best for you. Ill always support you at whatever distance you keep me. The cracks in my heart are healing. For now you are the love of my life and maybe someday someone else will ignite the same magic in me. If I ever get that chance, I vow to myself Ill approach it bravely. I wont let too much time pass and Ill make them aware of the gift they are. Ill always regret not giving you my honesty when it all began and you opened up and laid your heart in front of me. That was a lesson I hadnt learned yet. Thank you for teaching me. If only someone had taught me its ok to have vulnerability in matters of the heart prior to our meeting. I love you and I never got to tell you. You taught me what love truly means. Im excited to see what the rest of my life will bring. This is my promissory note to let love and not fear lead me with the next person that enchants my mind and heart so exquisitely. -The Apparition of you &amp; me &lt;3"

I dont even know if I have words to explain how detached I am from everything and everyone. All I wanted was a reason why everything changed. Why you no longer cared. I wasnt even worth the honesty to you. You became everything you promised you wouldnt. We were best friends at one time, at work and outside of work. I never intended to let things progress to what they did, but you never tried to stop it either. The feelings you claimed you had, and the deepness of our connection was a fucked up way to keep me around for roughly 7 months. I have never felt so used, in all ways, in my life. This is the third greatest loss in my life, except you are still alive. I think that pain is worse. I havent let myself grieve. I dont know if I am mentally stable for that yet. I dont remember the last time I truly felt rage towards someone. You may think I ghosted you 2 months ago, but I had to save myself because I knew I lost my best friend. I kept asking what happened, and instead of the truth, I was met with an excuse. You painted your self to be so amazing. You used my depression, anxiety, PTSD, and my love for you to benefit yourself. I am glad I am no longer vindictive. I know your TRUE colors. I only wish you weren't my friend then I could hurt you in the end. I dont want revenge though. I am sure there are others that do. So break yourself against my stones, And spit your pity in my soul. You never needed any help, You sold me out to save yourself. The one thing that hurts more than anything is, you knew what your friendship meant to me above whatever else we had going on. You promised you would always be my friend. You know the struggles I have and your encouragement helped me through. I shared my deepest, darkest, traumas with you. How can you just start treating someone so differently without an explanation? How can you become so cold and cynical without a cause? I know how much of a handful I was and still am. I know I caused stress and frustration. I never deserved to be abandoned though. I will say my anxiety has never been as bad as it is now. I hardly leave the house. I avoid things and places in hoping not to see you.  I wont listen to your shame, you ran away, youre all the same. My heart has become numb. I will say I have feelings of anger, betrayal, and worthlessness because of you. Those are the only emotions I feel daily. When I think of you and cry, it is never because of sadness or missing you. You should have never said I love you, I miss you, and all the other lies you made so believable. I hate that shared such personal things with you. I actually loved you. I was in love with you. You claimed you were too. Now I know love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again. I am good at pretending for people who dont truly know me like you. They think I am okay, happy, and stable. Except for him. He is picking up the pieces that should have never been broken. I should have never allowed you to happen. He has forgiven me for what we had outside of mine and his relationship. I hope you are repairing your relationship as well. I bet she still doesnt know and I am sure you are still doing the same things in and out of the workplace. Free spirit my ass. You are the master manipulator and sociopath. It took the death of hope to let you go, for me to realize that. It crushed me in ways you cant imagine. I was so fucking stupid. I would have taken a bullet for you and you know that. I never imagined someone like you would want someone like me. My vulnerability allowed you to do as you please and keep me on the leash. You knew I wasnt going anywhere. Can't you see that I'm sick of this? Chances are you're oblivious, To how I feel. Sitting on your throne, And I'm sure that I'm not alone. You always use to say you had no soul. I always tried to lift you up and I placed you on a pedestal. That was my mistake. You took every good emotion that I was starting to feel about life and myself and made my heart too dark to care. When he contacted you after my suicide attempt, you were there to visit. We were still actively seeing each other at that time. He wasnt aware we were more than friends. That was when you were still in love with me. My attempt had nothing to do with you, but you already know that. I wanted to reiterate it anyway. You called daily to check in at the psych hospital. You also told my business that was never yours to tell. You werent strong enough for me to be close to you at work during that time. You couldnt let your secret be exposed. Damn are you good. I never in a million years would have thought this is how it ended or this is who you would become. I had so so so much love, respect, and adoration for you. I felt it in my core that you were my Twin Flame. You were such a fucked up life lesson. I didn't think that you'd sell me out. Now I know what you're all about. You might feel in control of things, But you're not holding all the strings. Tell me, please! Who the fuck did you want me to be? Was it something that I couldn't see? Never knew this would be so political. And, please! I'm still wearing this miserable skin, And it's starting to tear from within. But it's obvious that doesn't bother you. The bad outweighs the good. One day I wont be detached and numb. I wont be so angry. I will just be, and life will be good. I will never think of you with fondness or longing though. You will remain the source of the caged rage in my heart. I use to be love struck, now Im just fucked up. Pull up my sleeves, and see the pattern of my cuts. Im not bitter, just on the verge of hate consuming me. Fuck you and the clique you claim, -Chels"

I'm proud of myself for working out that day, but my pecs looked like man boobs next to your broad, firm muscles. I'm almost sure you are straight, and weren't interested in me like I was definitely interested in you, but that ""almost"" keeps bugging me. It has bugged me about once a month for this whole year. The reason this letter even matters is that I have a wonderful amazing boyfriend with whom I am so happy. But I feel like I never tried to date guys like you because I've never looked like you. I've always been out of your league. But why did you talk to me? Why did you ask me when I'd be done with my set? If I had said ""5 minutes"" would you have waited and showered next to me in the locker room? Would you have seen my naked body with pleasure or with quiet satisfaction in your superiority? I'm coming to understand the enduring satisfaction that comes from a romantic relationship based on love and selflessness. But when I watch porn it's always of men that have bodies that look like yours. I would say it doesn't matter, that porn is fantasy, and that even if you were gay you wouldn't be interested. But you talked to me. You wanted to know when I'd be done...WHY? So I could spot you as you transitioned from cardio to lifting? It doesn't make sense in my brain. The chance that I'll ever see you again or even recognize you if I did are very, very low. I don't live there any more, and it was a college town and you'll probably leave too. But I think I'm going to decide that it doesn't matter why you talked to me. What matters is that my boyfriend is kind and loving and supportive. He is patient and enduring and thoughtful. He is passionate and loves doing things to me that make me gasp and moan. He loves it when I touch him and kiss him and penetrate him. We have been so vulnerable together that I don't want anyone else to share that vulnerability. It's precious and special and I want to protect it. Hopefully if you asked me today a similar question that your motives wouldn't matter to me. And I'll just be grateful that I won't have to find out. Even though you're the only guy that hot who's ever made me ask why, I know someday there might be another. But that day probably won't be today. And it probably won't be tomorrow. When it comes around maybe I'll be married to the only man who's ever loved me, and I'll be satisfied."

I'm sorry that bullshit and life got in the way. I want you to know that the day you looked at me and told me you were falling in love with me was and still is one of the most precious moments of my life.

Amongst all the tattoos and the beard, beyond your tough exterior I saw you in a real moment of vulnerability and it made me love you even more for being comfortable enough with me to let down your guard. I want to thank you for everything you did for me with a cheerful attitude. You showed me what real love is. You showed me even more for being being there for me when my ex was beating me every day even though I didn't have the courage to leave him yet because he had me believing that he was the best I could do. That without him, I would die alone. You didn't have to involve yourself but you did. I wish we had never broken up because I've never gotten over you and I've never stopped loving you. Even when I moved on, I've always felt the sting of regret that our relationship wasn't able to blossom into everything I know it could've been. I wish I could've had the chance to be to you the good woman I was to that ungrateful bastard. You're much more deserving. I remember the night I told you I had finally left him and the only you wanted to know is if I was ok and safe. You offered your support to me when once again you didn't have to. That just showed even more what an unselfish person you are. I said some things I wish I hadn't when I felt like you were rejecting me. You kept saying you wanted to hang out with me but could never seem to find the time. I know you were working a lot but I've always heard we make time for the things that are important to us so I thought maybe you were lying to me and getting my hopes up and I was angry because I'd had months of being mistreated and I took it out on you and for that I'm truly sorry. You didn't deserve that. I hope you're doing well and were finally able to buy your house so you can rest a little and have a life instead of working 24/7. I can only hope you understand that I haven't been myself for the last year and a half so I have admittedly acted out of character. Again I'm sorry. Maybe if I'm ever in Riverside again for longer than a few hours and you have a break from delivering, it would be nice if we could grab a drink and just catch up. I'll leave it up to you sweetie. I would love the chance to hug you one more time and tell you face to face that I'm truly sorry for the way things turned out and that I'll always be grateful that our paths crossed in this life. You let me experience what love really is. Well I'll close this now but I want you to know that I think of you often and fondly. Take care."

Nothing was going our way and every plan we had fell apart. We wanted to take a drive after you got a new exhaust installed in your car. It took longer than expected, but was fine because I got to spend time with you and share memes on reddit together. Then it happened. The installation was done and you got to hear what your car sounded like. It wasnt what you expected it to be. It was worse. The sound was completely off and too quiet for your liking. Every minute spent driving, you got angrier and angrier to where you started beating yourself up over it and taking it out on your car and yourself. You hit the steering wheel multiple times and bit your hand, but I stopped you before you drew blood. Im very emotionally sensitive to things like this and I was crying by this point. Ive never seen you this angry before and it hurt me to watch you beat yourself up over a mistake that can be fixed. I understand you spent hundreds of dollars to get a beautiful sounding car and it turned out different than expected, but its not permanent. Once you noticed I was crying, your attitude changed completely. You were worried about me and tried to get me to smile. Cracked a few jokes and it worked. I stopped crying, but I could tell the car was still bothering you. We stopped at a restaurant because we hadnt eaten a thing before leaving your place. You were still upset, but it wasnt too bad now. During our meal, you were on your phone constantly looking for solutions and texting your brother about it. It was upsetting me because I just wanted us to have a good time together and forget our troubles for just 40 minutes. We went back to your place afterwards instead of going for that drive like we planned earlier. You were in a much better mood since you had food in your stomach, but I was feeling disappointed that our plans didnt happen. You were feeling frisky and started to initiate some sexy time and I was starting to feel better because of it. You started to go in, but you went just a tad too fast and it hurt me. I told you to stop to give me a moment to let the pain pass, but I guess with all the emotions of the day, it got the best of me and I started crying again. You started getting worried and blaming yourself for hurting me. I tried reassuring you and spilling my emotions out to you. Trying my hardest to reassure you that it wasnt your fault why I was crying. Once I did, you started crying. I asked you why and your response broke me. You said that you were tired of fucking things up and that for the past few weeks you just wanted to die. You cried and hugged me so tightly when you confessed to me. I didnt want to let you go. I cried with you and I kept whispering its okay over and over. In those moments, all I wanted to do was keep you close to me and make you feel better in any way. That one moment of vulnerability that you showed made me love you more and I realized something. I realized that I dont just love you, but that I need you in my life. If you were to leave me in any way, I dont know what I would do. Im truly in love with you and I want to spend my whole life together with you sharing many more moments like this so we can grow together as a couple and overcome anything. "

And because I believe (perhaps foolishly) that I can truly read everything about a person from their eyes, without even listening to their words, it both thrills and frustrates me beyond belief that I still haven't been able to read yours fully. I get flashes of vulnerability, miliseconds of joy, maybe a glimpse, a mere blink of affection - then it's gone. I wonder how expressive my eyes are to others. To you. I'm afraid I give myself away with them. "

You held me close and whispered you need to stop being afraid. This phrase proved that you actually felt the rigid pain in my heart escape beneath the crisp bed sheets intertwined between our tangled legs. Youre soft lips treated me to a pure and genuine kiss. My body became stiff as My thoughts fled to intense fears of abandonment. Crippling anxiety reminded me of why I keep my lips guarded during times of vulnerability. Softly you asked why are you so afraid to kiss me? My insides begged to flee the situation. I could feel that Youve experienced pain, and weve both been broken. Haphazardly, I closed my eyes and embraced all of your selfless offerings. You entered me, And I allowed you to take all of me.

I came over yesterday needing your touch, your mouth, your closeness. I wanted your body. I needed your soul. I could ask for the first and did. The second? That sort of vulnerability burns like starfire. No matter. You knew. Somehow you knew. You gave me your touch. Your hands tracing my torso, caressing me. Your gentle yet urgent mouth against mine. But you stopped. You sat me on the couch. You answered every question I couldn't ask. You gently embraced that raw vulnerability and brought it to the collective that is us, pressed it to our collective heart, and sighed, ""This"". I relaxed, opened to you, and found my lungs again. Thank you for not being the truth my twisted head tried to paint. Friday will be so very sweet and I am counting the minutes. xoxo"

This is a letter to my rapist. explaining the entire story and how I feel about it now, five years later. ***Contents include rape and incest which may be considered NSFW*** To my cousin, You are 2 years older than me. You are the son my fathers sister, making you my blood related first cousin. We have the same last name. You were the oldest of the first three original grand babies. The three of us were cousins of one and other, your mother birthed you first, and you had an absent father. She is the oldest of their generation. Her step sister birthed our middle cousin the next year. My father, your mothers half brother, and my mother conceived me the year following. Our parents were blood related siblings, naturally we were expected to play together, and we did frequently. From the youngest age that I can recall, I was forced to hang out with you, to stay the night at your house while growing up, while I was growing into womanhood. As children we were almost inseparable. I looked up to you because of the way you carried yourself. Your confident exterior made it easy to follow you, and I did anything you wanted me to do. You were the leader, we always played your games, followed your rules, we slept over at your house. It was always your call and thats just how it was. You had an absent father, which I believe gave you a superiority complex as well as other behavioral issues at a very ripe young age that carried strongly into your adolescence. At a distinct point in our childhood, our uncles step daughter from his first marriage told me that she had been touched inappropriately by our middle cousin, who separated you and I from age. When she told me this information, I told the rest of the family and it caused a chaotic and nearly violent chain reaction for several years to follow. The family divided, some believed the victim and some believed Middle Cousin didnt commit the alleged assault. The victim pressed charges, and MC was sentenced a year or two in a juvenile detention center and the victim was to attend private school. The two were never allowed to cross paths at family parties, and soon after our family stopped getting together completely. The majority of the family may have stopped getting together but our parents kept in contact. We were in high school around the same time. When my interest in drugs and alcohol began to arise, you were capable of supplying it for me. I was 14. Your basement was your sanctuary. Your mom was prescribed heavy pain medications due to numerous surgeries and would almost always fall asleep in the living room with the tv on too loud. We had the freedom to do whatever we wanted, we could scour the fridge for food, stay up late. We played Rockband with the tvs volume maxed out all the time and your mother never woke up. A car couldve exploded outside and she wouldnt have flinched. You kept alcohol in the locker style cabinets in the basement. Do you remember how youd basically peer pressure me into it? Youd make me feel like I had to drink to hang out with you, in order to be cool. To be on the same tier level as you, I needed to be under the influence of whatever you provided. My upbringing was difficult because of being younger. You were able to do things before I could. Drive, go to concerts, get a job. Whenever it was my turn to achieve a milestone, I would feel second-best next to you. It felt as if you had already accomplished everything. It always had such a negative effect on my self esteem and my entire personality. I guess thats why I would go along with accepting your drinks. I kept trying to hang out with you even though it didnt feel right. I thought that if I endured all the dumb things you would do, teasing, mocking or making me drink, you would eventually treat me as the little sibling I wanted to be. There was a time where we had been drinking and playing video games. I had glanced over at you after a game had ended and you started poking me. At that age I was immature, whenever anyone touched me I would let out a very unattractive screech. You thought it was hilarious, or perhaps you thought it was cute, so you attempted tickling me. Only it wasnt tickling, really. More like digging your fingers into a persons sides deep enough to make them panic/laugh/scream and squirm at the tip of your fingers. It is a common, manipulative strategy that some people use in order to engage in physical contact that they otherwise wouldnt receive. Newsflash: It hurts like hell, and it is technically non-consensual, but no one generally enjoys being tickled. You tickled me until you were able to get on top of me. You were much stronger than me so you knew I couldnt get out of it. Any self defense training I had learned from you, and was useless when Im in the middle of struggling to breathe. You wanted to show me how to properly give oral to help me later in life. It was a skill that I needed to have if I ever wanted someone to love me, right? Tilt my head back, lay my tongue flat, and then expect a half erect chub to be jammed into my mouth, sound about right? Once it was over, youd ejaculate wherever you pleased and then ignore me for the rest of the evening. If you said anything more to me it would be to shut the fuck up and keep drinking. On a separate occasion but within a year or so of that incident, you made out with my best friend at a family party. You coerced her to do more than she wanted to do as well, but she had drank some of your vodka too, so that meant she was fair game....right? I regret bringing her to the family party, full well knowing you were going to be there. You were becoming a sexual deviant, and I just didnt want to be alone with you anymore. Thankfully she is still my best friend to this day, so you didnt manage to take that away from me, despite your efforts. I tried calling you out on these events. Do you remember the excuse you used? You said you wanted to become a massage therapist, and you needed someone to practice on. This is how you got what you desired. Youd always start out so innocently, by rubbing my shoulders and my neck. You would say I felt very tense and stressed, and to just relax because you can take care of it, But you always made an excuse to reach around to my chest, because you knew that you could. If I said no, you would guilt trip me, mock me and press on verbally and physically until I stopped refusing enough to let you get what you wanted. Then once you had my breasts in your hands, youd tell me my heart beat was quickening because I liked it, and then youd gaslight me again. It made me feel like I was the one in the wrong. That I was the one who was really into it and that Im the disgusting reason this is happening. You made me out to be the one who wanted it because it seemed as if I accepted it. I believed it was my fault and that I was the corrupt and morally wrong one. So it continued. One summer I met a boy at your HS graduation party. We clicked instantly and actually dated for three years. You condoned the relationship, you knew my boyfriend on a personal level, and yet you still tried to fuck with me. You were getting away with it so why would you stop now? You knew you werent going to get caught, I was weak minded and I had so little to no faith in our family. Some people believed our female cousin beyond reasonable doubt, based on the specific details she gave of the incident. Not a single person imagined you would cause the same problems. Nobody ever asked questions. They never thought to think about the way you would look at me or the way I would look away from you. Because of the division and hardship our family suffered from the allegations made against Middle Cousin, I felt as if I could never crush their imagination of who their beloved son/nephew was, who you really are. I didnt want my family to also look to me to blame. You insisted that upon me, it was enough to consistently hear it from you, I didnt need my own parents and siblings in on it too. At the time of the relationship, my boyfriend lived a few blocks away from you. I would sleep over at your house in order to spend time with him, because we lived several miles away and attended separate schools. Whenever Id stay over youd come up to me while Id be sleeping and youd shove your genitals in my face. If Id refuse, youd push on until I stopped resisting enough for you to get what you wanted like always. After a while I stopped refusing, Id just lay there and wish I was dead while you got what you wanted. When that boyfriend graduated HS he moved across the country for college, we broke up on my 19th birthday. (It is unrelated to the entire story, however I recognize this detail seems harsh. My birthday is at the very end of summer and my boyfriend had to catch a flight to the new school the next day, so we had to say our goodbyes on my birthday). We had just ended things, and I needed a ride home. I called you. I was unable to drive or buy alcohol at the time so I asked you to buy me a bottle of wine and take me home so I could sit and cry like a normal teenager. Instead you told me youd take me out to a hookah bar to relax and drink in a social setting where there would be no questions asked. Sounds super illegal, and it definitely was. I recognize that I shouldve known better. I was 19, and I may have been heartbroken, but you took advantage of my vulnerability in so many ways on this day. This was the last time you fucked with me. We went to the hookah bar. You walked to the back. I followed you. For a brief moment I could only see a few feet in front of me before you told me to get back. There was a long counter made of wood that was extremely dirty and beat up. I saw multiple bottles of alcohol. I watched the manager you introduced me to do a line of what I thought to be cocaine. I didnt get a decent look, nor did I know what coke looked like irl at the time. You took a small Gatorade bottle from their fridge and you mixed something into it. You brought it out to me and told me this was my drink. ONLY my drink. I was notably confused by your words but I figured you meant you made it especially strong for my birthday. I sipped on it for a while. It was the smaller Gatorade bottle so it didnt hold much. It was the grape flavor and it tasted like it had vodka in it. This is a mixed drink I was familiar with already, so I didnt think it tasted any different than usual. A few of your friends came by. One of them tried to take a swig from my bottle, and you nearly leapt from your chair to stop them, and you exclaimed Thats hers! They looked at you confused, but you didnt explain yourself. They didnt question it. That is my very last vivid memory of being inside the hookah bar. I cant remember anything else because its replaced with your unforgiving actions that followed. I started to drift in and out of consciousness at the lounge so you had to carry me out. You physically put me in the passenger seat of your car as I was unable to do it by myself. I remember only being able to look out the window because of the way my body was positioned. I was facing the window, my lower back was closer to the drivers seat. You had easy access to me while driving. All I was able to do was watch the street lights consistently change in color and size as my eyes struggled to retain focus. It felt like we had been driving for a very long time. I imagine now that you had to have been extremely intoxicated and had to take your time with the drive. But I also believe you purposely lied to me about the location of the hookah lounge so I didnt invite anyone else along. Later in life, as I obtained a drivers license and gained more awareness of the surrounding neighborhoods I found out that we had been only a few blocks away from my own house that night. You couldve easily just dropped me off. But instead.... you drove to your house, roughly a half hour away. And the entire time you were groping me, and telling me what you were going to do once we got there. All that was on my mind was, why did the street lights look so much different to me than they did when I drank at other occasions? I couldnt figure out why I was unable to move my body, why I had been unable to walk myself to the car? Why couldnt I move my face from the window? How I couldnt comprehend more than one thought at a time.... I could only stare at the passing streetlights. Once we were inside your house, you pushed me onto the nearby couch. I landed face down. My eyes were open but I couldnt see much of anything. There was a light on but my eyesight was dimming and growing fuzzy very quickly. I couldnt speak. I hadnt been able to stay a single word since the hookah lounge. Not that youd let me anyway; your hands had been around my face and neck the entire time. I couldnt speak. I couldnt tell you that I wasnt wet for you like you were accusing me of. I was sweating profusely. I couldnt tell you that I was feeling very tired, or that I felt like I was more than just drunk. Prior to this night my experience with drugs and alcohol was very limited, I had regularly smoked marijuana, but at the time I hadnt tried any other substance. The thought of you spiking my drink had crossed my mind but I didnt know much about it, let alone the thought of how to fight the fatigue I was falling under. You started another one of your massages, but this time you didnt spend too much time near my breasts. You ran your hands along my lower back. You whispered something in my ear but I didnt hear it, I became fixated on being able to feel your spit collecting on the back of my neck. You pulled down my leggings to massage my behind. You put your fingers inside me. You moved my entire body along with your hand, convinced that it was some how enjoyable for me. You made so many noises, you grunted, you snarled, you sounded like an animal preying on its dinner. You said so many nasty, derogatory things that I know wouldve hurt me in the moment but my brain has thankfully repressed it. You were so pleased with yourself. You had told me earlier in the evening that you had been going through a dry spell for about a year, meaning no one wanted you. So you were using me to finally get your rocks off. You were ecstatic. I just laid there, my eyes were open, but I saw nothing. I felt absolutely nothing. You initiated intercourse by inserting yourself into me. I laid there. You finished inside me. You left me slumped into the couch with a blanket over me. There was seamen and blood in my underwear the next morning. This was the last time you ever laid a hand on me, because after a few years of battling depression, anxiety and PTSD, I found the strength to go to someone. After therapy, one of our mutual friends came to me to ask questions. He was the only person to ever ask me if anything happened with you. He gave me the courage to move forward with my healing process. (Dave, if you ever come across this, I need you to know that youre a true friend and I have always felt like I owe you for helping me at that point in my life.) After Dave came to my rescue, more people came to ask questions. I told everyone that I thought should know. And you know what? Nothing happened. Nothing helpful anyway. I waited too long for any legal repercussion that couldve occurred. You werent shunned out of the family like our middle cousin was, but youll find that youll never be in the same room with myself or my younger sisters ever again. That was the way our family decided to acknowledge it, by subtracting the women from the equation rather than solving it or at the very least, acknowledging the root of the abusive behavior. To my knowledge not a single member of the family has said something to your face regarding this situation, and most of them havent bothered to ask me exactly what happened. Nobody knows the true full story. Had I gone to the authorities the minute I woke up at your house, perhaps youd be in prison, but most likely not. Regardless, I didnt, and still dont want to put that kind of stress on your mother or the rest of our family. While they do know, some of them, your mother included, are still in denial because their perfect baby boy could never harm anyone. It has been five years since the night at the hookah bar. I can finally say that I am happy. Im engaged, I have a fantastic job that I enjoy, and Im about to move into a house with the love of my life. But I hope you know that  You will never meet my children. You will not be at my wedding. You will never truly know or understand the turmoil you caused me for two decades of my life. I will forever be reminded of you when I engage in intercourse. I will always regret that I have let a sexual offender get away with rape and assault countless times. I will forever scrub my memory over and over and over again in hopes to forget the shit youve done. But I am now forced to carry this burden with me for the rest of my life. I feel extremely guilty when I tell other women to talk to me or another person when their going through similar situations because I was unable to help myself. How could I possibly help another? How can I preach to anyone when the majority of the times you took advantage, I didnt have the strength or courage to even say the word no? How can I become a factor in the solution rather than another statistic, a victim whos still part of the underlying problem? Fuck you for apologizing recently. You dont know and you will never know what you should really be apologizing for. "

Time away from you has let me see that it wasn't just anger and my inability to forgive you for the two major things that you did and said that caused issues in the relationship. It was that you hurt me and I couldn't trust you because I didn't want to get hurt again. I wasn't pushing you away because I was done using you, according to you. Everytime I brought up the issues, you would disappoint me with how you didn't learn or take responsibility. You didn't change. I couldn't trust you so I was skeptical and couldn't let myself be completely vulnerable with you. You were dishonest with me and yourself, and we didn't communicate openly or handle issues effectively and instead just brushed things under the rug so they were unresolved. I kept you at a distance because how could I invest more into a relationship when I hadn't healed? How could I fall in love in the truest sense when I had my guard up because I was scared of you hurting and disappointing me again somehow? How could my heart be whole with you when you broke it in large and small ways? And in your own way you didn't trust me, either, because of things I said and did. We both betrayed each other somehow. I'm no saint, but there was no coming back from what you did to me. You knew this deep down, hence the blaming, backpedaling, and lies that didn't add up, but you loved me and didn't want to lose me. Somehow you thought doing nice things would wipe your slate clean but they couldn't. Not with something that messed up. I'm not just healing from breaking up with you. I'm healing from your transgressions and I couldnt do that with you continuing to be in my life in any way. Cutting you off was necessary for my own well-being, self-respect, and self-preservation. I wanted to love you with everything. I wish I could forget how you are capable of the kind of behavior that hurt me and ruined this. That part of you isn't all of you but it's still YOU. I can't separate that from you like it's some kind of independent entity and I can't forgive it and reconcile it with the good man I saw in you. When I say that I wish this never happened and that I never met you, it's because we were meant for each other. I wish I never met you because I wouldn't know about a connection like this. We were end game... But you poisoned this and it was too broken to fix. I ended up losing my love (possibly THE love) and my best friend, along with everything I held dearly about love and intimacy. I might not feel a connection like this ever again, but I'd rather have a good enough connection and feel respected, loved, and safe than have a great connection with someone who scarred me to the point that I couldn't let myself love them.

487,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,To M.,6,b7x21w,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/b7x21w/to_m/,2019-04-01 15:01:53,"Its been a little over 6 months since we technically broke up, but it's been about 3 months since we both started to actually move on. Going on and off throughout sept-dec stalled our process of both moving on from each other. We were each other's first real, mature relationship as young adults. We had difficulties separating. I was your first kiss, first sex, first relationship, first time you felt these feelings towards another girl. You were my second. But you sure were my first relationship where I felt this strongly for someone. You were my first where I could hold a guy close to me and not be thousands of miles away. You were the first guy I was able to meet up with regularly to grab breakfast, lunch, dinner. The first guy where I could sleep beside nearly every night and not wish you were physically beside me..because you already were. You made my last year in university absolutely the best year. And I wish we could go back so we could see each other regularly again. &amp;#x200B; We broke up that fall due to distance and our personality differences came out over the summer after I graduated. You thought you could handle the distance well. I knew I could, my first relationship was 90% long distance. I wasn't sure if you actually could, but I took your word for it. I visited you once during the beginning of the summer. Then our problems escalated the following month after my visit. You suggested we break up...you said the distance was getting difficult because you couldn't see me face-to-face. You couldn't hold me, you couldn't express your affection well over the internet. You couldn't make me feel loved like you did throughout the school year when we were together. I was afraid of this. Out of sight, out of mind. It hurt. I felt insignificant and it was slowly draining me as the summer progressed. Except, I endured it. I figured because this was your first time experiencing a relationship, you just didn't know how to cope. You didn't know how to handle things. I gave you many passes, but I was hurting more and more each time. And when you brought up the idea of a break up, I cried. However, we were both weak. You messaged me a few hours later and took it back. That's when I visited you again last minute. I felt like we needed to see each other face-to-face again for this to be fixed. To remind ourselves how much we do care for each other. So I did. And all was well during the visit. We were happy, cuddling every chance we could get until I had to fly back home. &amp;#x200B; A week after the visit, we skyped. We were on webcam and you seemed more quiet than usual. I asked what was wrong, you said nothing. Eventually, I said I love you. You didn't say it back. You smiled at me, then went back to looking at your computer. It hurt. It was the distance again. It was only a week since we saw each other, and the distance was already affecting you. I wanted to cry. Really? Were your feelings for me easily forgotten when I'm not there? I felt insignificant again. A stabbing feeling in my chest. &amp;#x200B; That month we kept going on and off with our relationship. The uncertainty. We avoided talking about it, and simply acted ignorant to our situation and interacted with each other the way we wanted to. We acted affectionate. We avoided bringing up the topic of what we were, because technically we were broken up. But we didn't want to stop acting cute to each other. If we brought up the topic, then we'd both have to stop acting affectionate towards each other. And we didn't want to stop. Eventually you returned to university to finish up your last year. That September was difficult. I couldn't help but cry and miss you terribly. I was mad at you. I got irritated at you. The sadness and pain I felt from us no longer being together, I was taking it out on you. Whenever you didn't respond to my texts, I got upset. You were never the best in communication over text, but I was still upset. I felt even more like like crap when you didn't respond because you were involved in a small car accident and got rear-ended. I felt terrible for getting mad at you, for sending you a chain of texts that night and saying shitty things, telling you to return the sweaters I gave you. But you forgave me. You accepted my apology so easily after realizing your situation that day. You weren't spiteful, you weren't upset afterwards. Any other guy would've freaked at me for being so selfish and thinking of myself that night, but you were level-headed and patient with me. You always were when I felt I didn't deserve it. And I miss it terribly. &amp;#x200B; At the end of September, you suggested we cut contact completely. It was getting increasingly difficult for the both of us, especially with you being swamped with work at school and me starting an internship. But I didn't want to cut contact. We were in a skype call that night. After hearing you say we should cut contact, we were both in silence. I didn't say anything immediately. I just looked at you on my screen, then eventually agreed. You just kept looking at me and nodded in response. I just kept staring at you, and eventually I started to cry. Memories of us being together the previous year poured in and I just kept crying and crying. The thought of us no longer being in contact stung so bad. It just hit me all in the face and I probably looked so hideous, silently crying on the other side. But then I saw tears stream down your face as well. It was the first time I ever saw you cry. It was the first time I ever saw genuine sadness from you. And it just intensified my pain. I was led to believe I was insignificant to you the past few months until that moment, and it just hurt 10x more after seeing you cry. For the next hour you just sat there watching me cry without saying a word. It felt like the longest but also shortest hour. But, of course it'd all be in vain as we were both weak. We continued contact just a week after that and agreed to remain friends. &amp;#x200B; Throughout Oct-Dec I would text you once or twice a week. I couldn't just leave you alone no matter how much I wanted to. I missed you and I was making it quite obvious. I kept telling myself I should just leave you alone, you had school to prioritize and focus on. The last thing you needed was an ex to message you. And knowing how much you wanted to move on, you prioritized my messages less and less. Some were simply gone with no response. I tried to not take it personally. I always told myself you were terrible with texting. If a text didn't *need* a response, you wouldn't give one. And that's exactly how you treated my texts too. It sucks. When you gradually notice how you become less and less of a priority/importance in someone's life. I kept telling myself to just stop texting you. That way, I wouldn't have to increasingly get hurt each time I don't receive a text back. I would get stuck in this cycle of being upset at you when you didn't respond, and I would convince myself I was ready to move on. But then you would send me a text and I would get sucked right back in. &amp;#x200B; This lasted until the holidays, and unknowingly, I was seeking rebound as well. I ended up befriending a guy, and me being incredibly stupid, flew to a city to spend a few days with him. You knew about this trip, and you would always poke fun of us being a couple. I hated it, because I was in denial. And I was still hung up on you. If I only knew in hindsight what I was getting myself into, I would've stopped myself. At the beginning of the year, we had a skype call. It lasted about an hour. We were being affectionate again. Calling each other our pet names, talking to each other as if we never broke up. It's become so automatic for you to talk to me like this, you would always initiate it first. And I didn't want to tell you to stop. I liked it, and I missed it. Nothing was amiss during the conversation. Knowing my trip with my friend was coming up, I asked if you could tell me that you didn't want me to visit you right after at university. You told me you couldn't tell me that. And we left it at that. You told me jokingly that you love me, and to have a safe trip. And we said goodnight. &amp;#x200B; But then a couple of days later, you ghosted me. I texted you why did you delete me off of skype, I was extremely upset. You responded that you really want to move on from the relationship and that this friendship was not helping. I was angry, the fact that you didn't even bother to talk to me about it first. And how you had the opportunity to bring it up during our phone call a couple of days prior instead of deceiving me and leading me to believe everything was alright between us. I felt like my feelings were disregarded completely, the lack of consideration. You apologized that this decision was abrupt, but if I ever need to contact you, you preferred an e-mail. I felt insulted. I was reduced to an e-mail. Really? I told you to have a good life, and that I wouldn't forget your decision on wanting to ghost me. But I just cried the next few days until my trip. I felt like your decision on wanting to end communication this way just threw away everything we've been through, as if nothing meant to you. That I wasn't even worth discussing this with before going through with it. &amp;#x200B; I went on my trip with my friend the following days, and I regret it so fucking much. I was in emotional pain throughout the whole trip. I missed you. All I could think about was you, how you were starting your first week of second semester. I wanted you here with me, not him. He took advantage of my vulnerability, and he kissed me. I cried when it happened. I fucking missed the intimacy I had with you. And I displaced it through him. We slept together. And I fucking hate myself for it. All I could think about was you when we slept together, when he kissed me. I felt disgusted that it was him, that he was fully aware of you and me. He was there throughout the fall, knowing I would break down over you and directly witnessed me breaking down over you. I fucking cried every time we slept together during the trip, when he kissed me because I was in so much pain missing you. Yet he still continued, I was in not the right mindset, and I kept convincing myself I wanted it since it already happened. &amp;#x200B; After the trip happened, that friend and I stopped talking shortly after. He developed feelings for me, while I did not. I felt absolutely disgusted of what happened, how I slept with someone who I was never committed to. I've always vowed to myself I'd only sleep with those that I am in a relationship with. And I broke it. I was even more upset at myself because it was with someone I didn't even find attractive at all after snapping out of it. I realized how much he took advantage of me, and have so much regret. The trip didn't have to happen at all. But I was desperately seeking someone to fill the void after you left. After I cut contact with that friend, I was trying everything to cope with the pain I still felt earlier that month when you left. I decided to reach out via text if I could at least get some closure. At that point I accepted the break up, but I just wanted some answers of how you went from talking to me affectionately over the phone to wanting to ghost me 2 days after. You never responded. I reached out again a week later as my second attempt to receive closure, I was fucking hurting at this point. And again, you ignored me. I felt even more hurt than before. I tried empathizing and understanding your decision to ghost me. It was no coincidence that you chose to do this right before my trip with my friend. There were signs you were jealous. I assumed you did not want to be around during the trip or after, which I accepted. But it pained me even more how you ignored my 2 pleas for closure. That was just plain cruel at that point. &amp;#x200B; I decided I had no choice to just move on. I figured time will heal over time, even if I never got my closure. I'd give myself closure over time. I told myself I don't need to be dependent on someone else to receive it. I swallowed it all and buried the pain. &amp;#x200B; The next month I felt jaded. I felt as if my energy was drained, my mood was easily irritable. I soon developed a fear of growing close with someone, especially when others would flirt with me. I wanted to keep it superficial. I wanted to keep it as shallow as possible, afraid I would just get hurt again. That I would feel betrayed again, that their affection for me would only be temporary and I would be thrown away sooner or later like how you made me feel. I didn't want to go through something like that again. At some point, I did start feeling better and began to heal. Or so I thought. I made myself believe I was getting better. I wasn't crying nearly every night anymore, wishing you'd message me and apologize for ghosting me. I thought I'd be keep my chin up and move on. I don't need a guy like that in my life. But, the pain just ended up festering within me. It got worse and worse. Some nights I bursted out crying. The pain was so great I felt like I was choking and suffocating. I fucking missed you. I wanted to hate you for abandoning me, for making me feel like absolute trash. But I couldn't help but still care for you and want to see you again. I would fall asleep and wake up the next morning fine, and just brushed off having an episode. But each time I would break down over you, it never felt like it was getting better each time. It felt like it was getting increasingly worse. I would get easily triggered reading stories of others sleeping with other people and have immense regret afterwards. It reminded me of what I did, and potentially hurting you in the process although we were no longer in contact at that point. But I still cared about the possibility of hurting you. If I indirectly have hurt you enough where it pushed you to want nothing to do with me. Having these emotional break downs over you made me realize time was not healing at all. I did not want this to be a continuous cycle where I would just be triggered and cry over you in the future. I wanted to genuinely move on from you, but for me, it felt impossible because of the way you ended communication with me. &amp;#x200B; I decided to reach out to you through email. I decided to swallow my pride and actually email you like you said I could. I wrote a long email, detailing the emotional pain I was going through since you ended contact. I teared in the process of writing it. So much sadness, so much anger, so much pain written out for the first time to you. It was the first time I was expressing my emotional pain I was dealing with and writing it to express to you. I didn't give any details about the trip, because I felt it was better if you didn't know. I imagine you wouldn't want to know anyway. I just wanted you to know what I was going through and how much impact your decision of ghosting me had on me. You probably didn't think much of it on your end, but it had huge consequences on my end. I also asked one favor from you, and that was to tell me to never contact you ever again. I needed to hear it from you so I could finally cut ties within my own mind of you and officially start moving on. I sent the email, and I felt terrible anxiety. But immediately after, I felt like a ton of weight was released from my shoulders. My feelings and emotional pain were finally poured out. And whether you replied to my email or not, at least you were fully-aware of what I was going through. And that's all that mattered to me. &amp;#x200B; Two hours later, you texted me. I was shaking. I did not expect you to text me at all. I honestly expected you to email me back and do what I asked of you, which was to tell me to never contact you again. I also wouldn't have been surprised if you didn't respond at all. I was shaking so much, it's been the longest since we've been in contact ever since we met. I was scared to read what your text said. It almost felt like PTSD. I had a hard time breathing, my heart was racing, and I was trembling. I read your text, and you said you read my email and wanted to call me. I wanted to avoid it. I responded ""if you want to call to tell me to never contact you again, I prefer if you did it over text"". And you responded ""I think it's better if we call"". I was stalling as much as I could. Eventually I took the call. You asked if I preferred skype or regular phone call. Considering I stopped using skype ever since you deleted me, I took the regular phone call. I didn't want to end up being deleted again down the road if we re-added each other on there. &amp;#x200B; I heard your voice and I wanted to cry. It felt so long since I last heard your voice. The first few minutes were awkward, I could tell. I was barely talking, my tone was down, I was tired. You eventually started talking about the email I sent. How you felt like we weren't on the same page with the situation, and explained why you decided to cut contact with me so abruptly months before. The entire phone call lasted around 2 hours. Funny how whenever we say we want to talk on the phone for a little, it ends up being more than an hour. You told me you felt like you were suffocating throughout the fall, especially with me texting you here and there. You had a lot of of things on your mind that were stressing you, and told me you were jealous of the trip I had planned with my friend. You thought, how did I move on so fast? And you were in no position to stop me. Although I really wish you had. You told me you didn't want to know any of the details of the trip, so I didn't tell you. But I did tell you how insignificant the trip was, how that friend and I stopped talking shortly after the trip. And I could tell, you felt relieved and happy hearing that. You made me light up inside when I heard you start talking to me affectionately 10 minutes into the phone call. I teased you, saying you were talking in that childish tone again, and you responded by telling me it only comes out when talking to me. I still don't know if that's a good or bad thing at this point. You told me that our time together means a lot to you, that it was a significant part of your life. You told me out of the 6 years you've been in university, your 5th was and is still the most memorable because you met me. I wanted to cry. We ended the phone call where you still want to move on from our relationship, and how communication would be inconsistent until you graduate in May. You wanted to keep contact to a minimum, maybe every 2 months or at least until after you graduate. I was a bit sad hearing that, but I thought it was for the best as well. We both need to focus on our own priorities. I agreed, and you wished me luck on my upcoming job interview. &amp;#x200B; After that phone call and being on friendly terms with you again, I felt extremely relieved. I felt that I was moving on a lot faster than the previous months, and I was no longer stagnant with moving on from our relationship. I wasn't having emotional break downs anymore or having vivid dreams either of us at night. I felt reaching out to you ended up being a good decision, or else we'd both carry on having misunderstandings of one another. A week and a half later, I woke up to a text from you. I was surprised, considering how you wanted no contact for another couple of months. You told me good morning, and hoped my interview went well. We had a brief conversation that afternoon over text, and it reminded me of when we were together again. You called me by my pet name. Funny how several months ago I'd feel extremely happy, but hearing it now, I can't tell what I'm feeling. I'm happy that you think positively of me, but it also makes me feel sad as I've already accepted that the chances of being together again are slim to none. We both are going separate ways in the future with our careers. You have a full-time job waiting for you this fall in a new city. I am still looking for a full-time job and plan on going back to graduate school in the future for better job outlooks while aiming to stay near my hometown to save money. Distance was the biggest hurdle in our relationship, and many of our problems had stemmed from the distance. Distance is something that will be between us for the next foreseeable future as I see it, which is why I've accepted that we'd more than likely will not be together again. But I'd be lying if I said I was completely closed off to the idea if the opportunity was there in the future. &amp;#x200B; It's been nearly a month since we got back into contact. It wasn't until last night I had a moment of vulnerability thinking of us. I missed you. Every other day this past month, the thought of you didn't trigger me once. In fact, I had nothing but fond memories of us and appreciation that we happened. I was grateful I met you and that we got to spend time together. But for some reason last night I had this lump in my throat at the thought of you. I tried swallowing it, but I ended up crying instead. &amp;#x200B; I miss you. I miss your cute face. I miss your adorable smile. I miss how your face lights up when you're happy. I miss your large brown eyes, long eyelashes, your soft skin. I miss your scent. I miss how you always smelled so fucking good, how the smell of you would instantly relax me and make me fall asleep. I miss whenever you drove to my place back during college after a long day of working on projects, you'd immediately jump into bed with me and scrunch your face right up onto mine where our noses would touch. I miss when you exhaled and felt so relaxed finally laying down next to me. I miss when you took my legs in between yours and squished them. I miss how your body would always be a little too hot, and you'd let go of my legs to air out yours. I miss how you'd always want a cuddle session before falling asleep. I miss how you'd always talk about hypothetical scenarios of us in the future if we lived together. When we could finally be together permanently and have everything settled. I miss all of it. &amp;#x200B; You were and still are the perfect combination of cute mixed with a bit of masculinity. I love how I could baby you yet still know you knew how to take care of things yourself. I miss pampering you and you coming to me to ask how to put lotion on your face. I miss when we showered together and scrubbed each others' backs. But I know all of this will never happen again. I don't think you'd want it as much as me now. You've always been level-headed, career-oriented. Once you realize there isn't a solution to a situation, you stop chasing it. You are more head than heart, while I'm more heart than head. I know this will stop hurting as more time goes by. But I just wanted to tell you all of this, even though I know you most likely will never read this or know it's about you. I don't understand how people can break up with their first loves, and move on to marry another man or woman in the future, and still have memories of their first loves pop up in their minds here and there for the rest of their years. The idea is so bizarre to me, but I know it's just life. That I'll also experience the same thing as everyone else. Life moves on. People move on. &amp;#x200B; I do hope one day you'll get to read this. What went on through my mind throughout our entire break up process. I'll always care about you even though you are far from perfect for me and I am far from perfect for you. It's the little things about you that are perfect to me that I know no one else will be able to replicate. I know you're only a text away now, but I feel we will eventually drift apart as does everyone else. But if you ever think of me just cause in the future, if you ever want to organize a meet-up in the future, I definitely won't turn it down. I'd love to see you again. &amp;#x200B; \-E &amp;#x200B;"

I still love you. And I hate you for it. I was so in love with you. I still am. Even though the abuse was so intense I didn't realize you were raping me, I love you. I can't breathe when I see your name on my screen, but I love you. You told me I'd never understand the sick-and-twisted, rose-colored shade of Stockholm Syndrome being in an abusive relationship creates, but I do. You showed me. You showed me kindness, gentleness, a vulnerability I had never let myself have with anyone else. I just didn't know it'd go so wrong. I didn't know you could make me feel so loved, but make me feel so unwanted. Hated, even. I didn't know. And I hate that you were my first attempt at being in love. First loves are meant to be bittersweet, gentle and fierce in the same breath. It's like that with you, but it hurts so badly. Yet, I still have your clothes, I still reach for you in my dreams, I still listen to the music you sent me in the early morning, just before dawn. I still love you."
489,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,On Love and Jealousy,11,b8cfb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/b8cfb7/on_love_and_jealousy/,2019-04-02 12:14:17,"Do you remember when we were looking through catalogues of photographs, and we came across a vintage photo of Lucille Ball &amp; Deborah Messing and you said, ""She is beautiful."" It was a black and white photo, of her standing behind the sunset, standing with her legs apart, hands on her hips with her face slightly upturned, a look of dominance on her face. Instead of jealousy, I became curious. I wanted to know more about the past women in your life. There was something about it that captured your imagination. Perhaps it brought out childhood memories, your first love, your first kiss, nostalgic memories of when you had lost your virginity, but it was a picture that you liked enough that you would store it in your list of beautiful people. And then there are women I think are beautiful, like Holliday Grainger or Gemma Atherton, whom you don't hold the same kind of fixation. There are men that we agree are beautiful, like Michael Fassbender, who has a kind of je ne sais quoi, elusive mystery surrounding his aura. So when I said a certain man I thought was ""hot"", you immediately recoiled. It bothered you, I think perhaps it made you jealous. You became quiet. You started to think, ""What's he got that I haven't got?"" Darling, I want you to know that it is only natural that there will be some people each of us find hot. Our species is filled with beautiful people. Just because I find someone hot does it mean that I will go off and fall in love with someone else. Love doesn't work that way. Certainly, an initial spark is necessary for the rest of the journey, but I don't think love is something that one doesn't choose willingly. I was set on a course destination towards you. It was you and everything about you that hold my heart and my soul. Obviously I don't look at all the women you find beautiful and compare myself to them. In fact, I appreciate their beauty, but beauty isn't what makes one stay. Beauty alone can't make someone fall in love. My father taught me at a young age that a woman who is desirable cannot focus on her looks alone. We do need to take care of ourselves, but it can't be the sole focus of what we think attracts people towards us. It's the same story of when you told me that when you were young, you knew two twin brothers, one who had no problem attracting women, while the other one struggled, and you realized that it wasn't about looks at all. We live in an era of social media, and we're used to the two dimensional medium in which we see people from the point of view of the camera lens. People rate people based on how desirable the photograph is, not who the person is. I'm fairly certain I can take anyone and capture that person in such a way to make everyone pine for her or him. There is a kind of lighting that is necessary that suggests intimacy, the right color schematics, the suggestion of something without revealing too much, the angle of the face, the slight flaw that accentuates a fragile kind of beauty. The truth is no one likes the perfectly proportioned person whose face could be easily imitated by an AI program that specializes in beauty. No one wants that perfect blow up doll with the perfect features and the perfect one liners. People will, and always will be, attracted to their own flaws. To me, you are more than a two-dimensional photograph. Your features complement the depth of experiences you've had, and at the end of the day, I want to look into your eyes and hear your voice and feel your hands on me. ""Love is the time and space where I give myself the right to be extraordinary."" - Julia Kristeva I am extraordinary with you because I am who I am with you, without filters. It is your vulnerability that first drew me to you. I had to know the man behind all the walls you put up. Please don't build them up again, just as we have found each other. "

Yes, I still think of you from time to time. I wonder if you are still searching for that perfect solution to a limited problem, finding it, and then tossing the solution away and back to square one in a few months. Maybe you like suffering, or maybe you like playing martyr. Maybe you have a sabotage fetish. Baby I have to be honest....your cycling from ardent attention to then ghosting got to be so.....tiresome. It took away that little shine you used to have to you that I saw. It emasculated you because it made you appear... cowardly. It de-feminized me because it made me feel like I had bigger balls then you. I stuck it out for too long because deep down I truly liked you. But then even that wasn't enough, so I had to cut bait. It wasn't easy, but something I just had to do. It is hard because I have some really awesome memories of you being that tough, stoic, in control, dude that cracked a smile and a burst of tenderness despite himself. It wasn't ever your display of vulnerability that made you less appealing, nor me feel less womanly. In fact, it only added to it. But being vulnerable is far different from being afraid.

I starved myself because you didn't allow me to eat the meals my mom cooked me, I wore shitty clothes that were falling apart because you didn't allow me to wear anything else, I couldn't talk to anyone but you and you forced me to spend every fucking second talking to you, you forced me to write you 2000 word essays on why I loved you within a couple hours because you were so fucking insecure even though you made it very clear how much you wanted to fuck the girl that was our 'friend' I guess, you took away any type of recreational activity I had. I spent countless nights crying and barely ever got any sleep. I was no longer my own person I just did what you told me to do. I became a husk of the person I once was. More than once you threatened to kill yourself if I didn't do what you wanted me to do. You ruined my mental health completely. I didn't even have that great of a mental health to start with, that's the thing you used against me. I trusted you. I shared so many things with you only for you to use my trust and vulnerability against me. You knew about my past how damaged I was. And the only thing you did was damage me more. You even made me believe that it was all my fault, you almost drove me to suicide so many times and to this day I still struggle with heavy suicidal tendencies. And after all of that after the breakup you painted me as the abusive one. Because you just always have to be the victim don't you? I was almost convinced I was the abusive one that's how much you fucked me up. You broke every part of me a thousand times over, I hope you rot in hell for what you did."
492,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,That guy who left his pocket knife at my place,2,b9m9in,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/b9m9in/that_guy_who_left_his_pocket_knife_at_my_place/,2019-04-05 14:27:10," So, to be fair I'm really only writing this because I'm in my feelings. Maybe a little crossfaded, too much going on in my head right now. I need to get it out, but quite honestly I don't want to talk to you or really connect with you in any way. I just want to get this all out of my head and into somewhere, some space where even if you don't read it somebody else will and will maybe understand. I just know, it really fucking sucked being around you at some points and then suddenly it was the greatest thing. Thing is, because it sucked so much being around you especially towards the end I'm not sure you'll be able to even comprehend or empathize with why I felt the way I felt. I have a heavy feeling you won't care. Which is totally fine, up to you. Whatever, y'know? It's not my job or my place to make sure people care about my feelings, it's just I know that at some point I should probably stop spiraling emotionally and allowing men like you to leave me bereft of the ability to feel intimacy and openness to be that way with other people. It's not fair that you pulled that out of me and took those pieces with you. I needed them for myself. I needed to be able to appreciate and care for myself and you selfishly took that because nobody else was giving you that kind of attention. But I fucking did, like a damn idiot because I was so naive and trusted you to take care of that side of me. I think you forgot you had that, and took me for granted and didn't think twice about then trying to come onto my friend in front of me. No, no, no, fuck that- I wasn't jealous you twat. And fuck you especially for even thinking that was the problem at ALL. I wasn't jealous, I was HURT. For what reason would I have to be jealous? For what? Because some dude that I slept with was hitting on my friend? I expected as much, but I already know that not only do my friends love me more than they care about your feelings/needs/wants but that they already didn't like you after what you did the FIRST time you ignorant bag of fermented shit. You wanna know why you were even allowed over in the first place? Because I thought I was in the right state of mind to face you after you cut me out because you ""needed space"" ((oh I have some words for that too)) and because my friend felt like she could be civil with you. WHICH SHE WAS. But you took her being nice as her flirting when I know her 1000 better than you and I know when she's flirting with someone- trust me, you ain't it. So I didn't have a reason to be jealous, because I already knew there was absolutely nothing there in the first place. I was hurt. Definitely hurt, but not even because you were flirting with my friend. I was hurt that someone I trusted enough to allow into my life and headspace went ahead and would go as far as to physically try to pry the blankets off my friend when you made the comment about wanting to see her nipples. Yeah sure whatever you stopped once we both told you that wasn't happening, the point I'm trying to make is that you did it AT ALL is what made the both of us feel uncomfortable. Quite frankly, you triggered me. Trying to say you weren't being aggressive when you clearly were just tells me you don't think you did anything wrong. But you know what? Who are you to say you didn't cross the line? And then bringing up what happened with your wife? I felt terrible for you when you told me about that. I felt so, so, so fucking bad for you and hurt, and I wanted to at least help you heal. I know what it's like to be raped, but throwing that in my face when it has nothing to do with me and everything to do with the fact that you were predatory that night was manipulative. If anyone would know what it's like to suddenly be preyed upon between the two of us it would be me, and that night, you made both me and my friend feel like we were trapped and being picked out. Thanks, you really brought back some good memories. I wish I understood your brain, just a little so I can finally have the closure in figuring out what the hell I meant to you. I'm not saying that I thought I meant anything, I just didn't fucking understand why you would even keep me around if you didn't like me. I didn't care if you didn't like me, but if you didn't what was your point in going out of your way to insert yourself into my life the way that you did? What fuck buddy just stops by at like 2 a.m. to bring his sick counterpart soup? Or why would you invite me over all those times, not do anything, and then ask me to leave? That's how I saw you in my head, as a piece of dick who also happened to be my friend- but it was that I felt particularly safe and cared for around you that really fucked me over because I trusted you. I told you things that happened to me because I figured it was safe to tell you, but honestly because of this I don't feel safe knowing that someone else knows what happened to me. You said things that made me think you liked me, and went out of your way to make sure I was taken care of in some way. I don't understand why someone would go so far out of their way for another person they don't fucking care about. What pisses me off is that I cared. I cared enough to continuously reach out even though you gave no fucks and just continued to yo-yo in and out of existence. You stopped talking to me, and stopped seeing me entirely for a while and came back with a lousy ""It's not your fault. I do need a lot of space."" As if that somehow erases things and makes it all good between the two of us. Ese, it didn't. It just made it harder for me to comprehend your whole motive, when really it wasn't supposed to be that deep. Acting as if I was being overdramatic or overreacting to something totally reasonable, fuck you. You could have fucking told me either face to face or over text, you didn't have to absolutely ghost me. I live right across the street from you, asshole you could manage a fucking message. Whatever, this doesn't matter. I'm keeping your pocket knife. You once said I must be a fearful person because I make sure to chain and lock my door, and you're unfortunately right. I am a very, very fearful person. And I was so hurt once I felt the same fear around you, when I truly didn't want to. You held me close, and forced intimacy between us when those sort of feelings should have never been toyed with or involved at all. What you did really wasn't a big deal, and typing this out I kind of feel ridiculous for because it's already been maybe two weeks and this is a whole fucking lot for some guy who was barely in my life for two months. But it triggered that same fear and vulnerability in me and I felt guilty for days because I put my friend in a position where she was vulnerable to you and I never wanted that to happen. So, I'm keeping your stupid knife. Sincerely, Rucbarbird  "

I had a really bad week so far, and even when we don't talk much I told you that I was feeling sad, we stayed for a while to talk, it was easier to talk since I was stoned, so I just did. You had class and I told you I just didn't want to get home, you proposed me to wait for a while and we should go and do something, I was so out of it but I was happy you asked that. As I told you, I thought several times about leaving, but I'm glad I didn't. We stayed for a few hours and walked around, you have no idea how much you helped. I was so nervous. We started talking about existential but motivational things, which I love, I'm glad I found someone to talk about those things with. I said I wanted to be vulnerable, that it was one of my biggest fears, and that I would really like to be myself, we talked about how vulnerability is about being open to being loved but being hurt as well, about expecting something from someone and just be open about it. You asked me what is it that I expect of you, and I responded that I wanted you to accept me as I am, you said that you absolutely would. Even when I was so nervous around you, I was so happy, I was happy that our talk was better than expected. You reminded me that I can be myself, you reminded me that I do deserve love and I deserve to fight through whatever I'm going right now, and no matter what I'm going through, I can always do better, and even if I fall a 100 times I can still keep going. So thank you for letting me be vulnerable with you, I can't wait to see you more and talk to you more :)"

No, I'm not proud. That was my worst moment. I'm sorry for hurting you, it was the worst way imaginable to end things. It was never my intention to hurt you but I was hurt and I wasn't thinking. My snap judgment was toxic and I'll always regret that. It was a reaction based on reason, ironically executed nonetheless. That reaction was built on months of broken trust and unanswered questions. On a persistent gut feeling that you were getting a power trip by giving breadcrumbs and keeping me interested. Your actions could easily put me on the ""emotionally detached asshole"" list too but I'm not going to go. I'm not scared of talking, asking, and being honest because I know that is required of someone for trust to exist in the first place. You never spoke your mind, avoided answering important questions, pushed my boundaries, tried to manipulate our conversations, destroyed our plans and then tried to soothe the pain you caused by killing me with empty fantasies of what we could have had right now or in the future. The last straw was when you admit you intentionally wasted my time by playing hard to get. It showed me how little empathy you had considering you thought there was nothing wrong with controlling and manipulating your partner. The person that had to find ways to patiently push and pull you out to vulnerability. I waited for you because I trusted your pure reasons. I thought you didn't hold such a toxic underlying motive. I started to dislike you when I realized you were that okay with gaming our relationship. I wanted you without the games. The good, the bad, the ugly, everything. I wanted you and you were too scared. And don't counter by telling me I had no idea who you ""really"" were. I did. I saw the real you shine through and I loved all those moments. It takes one to know one - I used to be the biggest emotionally detached asshole before I met you. I'm fucking sorry I did this when you were vulnerable. I was vulnerable too, and when you said that you killed me (as I write this I realize right now that was the first time I felt so vulnerable with anyone). I don't know if you were intentionally ruining it or just that oblivious. I ruined it because I got scared. Fucking ironic. I'm not trying to guilt you for not respecting my vulnerability but I'd still want to let you know. In that last moment I realized you never saw us as equals. You wanted to break my pride to build yours. You still wanted control. Over me, over our relationship. Why? (did I not convince you I like you by giving you so much of my time?) That's when and why I called it quits. You hurt me by holding me at arms length. I wonder if that ending encapsulated the months of pain I held in that moment."

I can sit here and blame myself for staying for so long or for ignoring all the signs, but that really doesnt matter. What does matter is that its not my fault. I might have been weak and dumb, but Id rather be that than anything you are. Youre made of empty promises. You watched me get teared down to the ground after my first relationship. You watched me almost die from it. You watched me plead with the universe about *why* this had to happen to *me*. You watched me crawl from where I was, nails in the dirt, to build myself back up again. You made yourself the helping hand that got me back on my feet  all knowing that youd be the one to kick me back down again. You used every bit of vulnerability I showed you to your advantage. You told me you could never cheat on anyone, not after what your ex put you through. You told me we felt the same way about love... sex. You knew that because of my past trauma I needed to wholeheartedly trust someone to share those parts of myself with them, so you told me that you were a virgin and that wed lose it to each other. I thank God every day that your filthy hands never even got to touch me. You had the audacity to tell me that *I* wasnt who you thought I was... You constantly called me immature. Im a 22-year-old whos been living on her own for the past four years. Ive been paying my own bills, and Im about to graduate from a top university. Ive spent the last year building myself into a strong and confident woman. Youre a 26-year-old *man-child* with no education, no job, and no concrete plans for the future. You still talk to your friends like youre a 14-year-old boy in a locker room. You lie like a toddler, and you dont even have enough control over your own impulses to keep your tiny dick in your pants. I wont even bother mentioning your *past* discretions. I had my faults in the beginning of our relationship, sure... but youre not gonna get me to blame myself for this. The gaslighting stops now. You constantly called me crazy, paranoid and insecure and made me question my own memory, intuition and sanity all to deflect from how crazy, paranoid and insecure *you* were. I remember the first time I asked about her. You insisted it was nothing. I continued asking from time to time over the past 6 months, but once again you told me I didnt know what I was talking about. Turns out shes been visiting you, sleeping with you, and you told everyone she was your girlfriend. I guess thats what nothing looks like these days. Even in the times that I tried to break free from our relationship and the abuse you would still go out of your way to come back and contact me so we could get back together. If shes so much better than me then why bother? Maybe because youre greedy and pathetic. You gave up long ago and were too cowardly to tell me the truth even after every chance I gave you. You didnt even say sorry when I confronted you. Not once. Your actions have always spoke far louder than your words, and I should have loved myself enough to listen. I wont make that mistake again. The way you spoke about not only me but women in general brings me to the point of physical disgust, and I cant believe I ever even called someone like that a friend let alone a lover. As someone who you used to call your best friend and the love of your life, I hope you get some serious help soon. I wasnt gonna wait around for you. She wont wait around for you. Life isnt gonna wait around for you and neither is the cancer. "

There is always someone better.. and they will be younger and more youthful in spirit, which is so much more attractive than my old, weathered spirit. After being cheated on, used, lied to, raped, manipulated, and abandoned I dont know how I ever manage to muster up the strength to try again. I try to tell myself you are not all the same, that youre not knocking at my hearts door with evil intentions. But the devil never comes with his horns, baring his bright red skin. He comes dressed up as everything youve ever wanted. I have many men who clamor for my attention, but every time I choose to open up..before I know it, they are gone. My heart, my vulnerability, my naked face and bare soul is never quite enough. They come and go, and I have been alone for so long. Alone is okay, but it gets lonely. I wish someone could just stay, for once, and love me for me. I think now this is a fairytale. Without love, what is life? I have so much to give, and they say they want it. But once they get it, they rip it up and throw the pieces at my feet. What am I to do but pick up each piece, clean off the dirt, and patch my heart back together. Years and years later, its pretty scarred up. Its not so nice to look at anymore. My hope is gone. Maybe my tired heart and I will just have to be enough, all on our own for the rest of our days together. My heart is the best company I could ever ask for, but god she gets lonely, Every rip and tear, we have endured together. To the men Ive lost, I hope you find the sparkling, shiny heart you seek, I really do. "
502,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Dear M:1.,1,aopuqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/aopuqy/dear_m1/,2019-02-09 17:32:29,"Dear M, There's a few times late at night after one of our ""rough days"" where I'll lay in bed and listen to the sound of your breaths from far behind me and think about writing these. Not to show you, just to get my feelings out in some sort of outlet because you don't listen to me most of the time and when you do you're super dismissive and quick to blame me for whatever is happening, deflecting the blame off yourself at whatever cost and making me feel worse. So tonight I decided to start writing these. Whether or not you'll find them, I don't care. You probably won't either. I'm hurting. It started off small but it's grown so much. I want to kill myself. I want to cut myself. I want to starve myself. I want to do everything in my power to physically inflict pain on my body on the outside that I feel on the inside. But I won't because I know how hurt you would be. And though you can't say the same, I hate to see you in pain. I hate to inflict pain on you. Even when I feel uncontrollably angry I take a deep breath and stop myself from lashing out at you because I don't want to hurt someone I love this much. Earlier tonight I wanted to kick and scream and punch a hole in your wall and beat the shit out of you all while screaming everything negative you've ever said to me at you. Instead I laid my head on your pillow and breathed. Even when you hit my leg every time you died in your game. I kept all my rage quietly inside me even though just minutes before you choked me and pulled my hair and hurt me and when I asked why you said it was because I was a ""handful."" Later when you apologized (I guess you could call it that? But it was really just you not saying sorry and putting the blame on me instead, like you always do) you told me it was because I was being edgy, because I'm 17. As far as I recall you called me a handful because you shoved me down and tickled me even though you know I hate it, even though I begged you to stop, and then I was scared you would do it again afterwards and didn't want to touch you or vice versa. That makes me an edgy handful I guess. M, I am so patient. I am so incredibly patient with you. But it took everything I had not to tell you all the reasons you are far more of a 'handful' than me. Yes, I cry. I'm emotional. I have frequent breakdowns. But who causes those breakdowns? Who calls me worthless and useless and chubby? Who hits me, squeezes my head between his knees, chokes me, slaps me, stands on my chest, pulls my hair, kicks me? Who makes me feel ugly and unloved, then makes me feel like no one else would ever love me? It's you, M. Countless nights I have reassured you that you aren't the cause of my breakdowns or my cuts or my suicidal thoughts because even though you hurt me in every way humanly possible I cannot find it in me to tell you a truth that would hurt your feelings. I am patient. I sit on your bed for countless hours, while you waste away in front of your ps4. Because that's the only time you'll spend with me. Because dates with me are a waste of time. Going out and doing something with me, watching a movie, eating a nice dinner, looking at stars, holding my hand and walking pointlessly through a neighborhood, this is much less important than doing the same thing over and over in your video game in the hopes that this time you'll get that god roll gun. I sit quietly on your sheets that havent been washed in god knows how long and I am told, and conditioned to believe, that I am not worth spending time with. I am not worth spending money on. I am not worth the effort of making me happy even though I spend every waking moment, every last ounce of my energy trying to make you happy. I am patient. I let you use me as your punching bag. I look into your eyes while you physically hurt me and I try not to make a sound to urge you on or make you feel powerful but it hurts. So I whimper or yelp and I get hurt more. The reasons I get hurt vary. Maybe I did something like delete your porn, or try to get a little attention while you play your game. Maybe I laughed for too long and couldn't stop. Maybe I didn't want to have sex with you. I'll cry afterwards and you might apologize. But even in your apology you'll tell me it's my fault. I shouldn't have been so annoying. I should have been quieter. I should have known my place. A lot of times I find myself believing you and trying to plan out how to avoid getting hurt in the future. But it is not my fault that you are impulsive and fueled by rage. It is not my fault. I have changed so much for you. I'm growing my hair out. I'm investing in cute, girly clothes. I'm watching anime to relate to you more. Anything I can do to get your attention and love and keep you with me. You told me I needed to lose my chub and I starved myself for a month. When I tried to wear makeup because it's fun and I like doing it you told me I looked like a whore. I havent worn makeup since. Your cum tastes nasty but I swallow it because you want a cumslut. I bought a buttplug even though I despise anal because you love anal and want me to be an anal whore. I try everything. I listen to you. I internalize what you say and try to improve off of it. But when I speak out, which i rarely do, about something, it falls on deaf ears. If I'm telling you something, if I'm exposing myself emotionally and being vulnerable about it, it's because I am seriously bothered by it. I will never criticize you when I dont need to because it will make you angry and defensive, and you will quickly deflect it back onto me. So if I tell you something it's because it is threatening our relationship. M, I hate everything about myself. When I look into the mirror I want to cry and vomit. I have considered committing suicide because of my appearance several times. I very slightly opened up to you about this because your overuse of porn makes me feel not good enough to get you off, and naturally my brain told me its because I'm ugly. You haven't changed a bit since our several conversations about it. You havent put any effort into acknowledging my vulnerability. I'm beginning to think I'm wasting my time on you. I'm beginning to think that even though I love you more than you can comprehend, I might need to bring this thing to an end. M, I'm tired. But that won't stop me from cutting tonight. And every single one will be your fault. Love, C"

You've already experienced so much pain, trauma and suffering, don't you think you deserve some sort of break?As you continue forward several months post-graduation, you'll meet someone you believe to be the love of your life. You fall hopelessly, desperately in love with this individual just to have your heart and soul drained away with every sweet word you whisper, and every hour you give of your precious time. While you wither away on his couch, choking on the stench of marijuana and cat piss, you should think about all the potential friends you could be making, going to events at your school, and becoming involved.Love is fucking blind.Months further down the road into a new year, the butterflies still linger but towards summer, something changes and your heart begins to feel heavy. Those butterflies no longer seem as excited. When his lips touch yours you hope possibly the magic comes back, but only does it appear after breathing smoke deep, and choking down the hardest liquor. You sit at work for hours, hungover, exhausted, tired of being treated so poor. You think it will get better, you genuinely believe so.But then one night it all seemed to snap.Bitch. All you do is complain.While he sits on the couch, smokes, misses work every other day and uses various substances to cope you work away, crying yourself to sleep at night hoping it will get better.Because you love him.Do you?He tells you everything you enjoy is lame or stupid. So you quit listening to some of your favorite bands, and watch less of what you enjoy. He makes fun of your favorite band, he doesn't bother to read a single thing that you write. He thinks reading is boring and mistakes your ambition as pushing yourself too far.But what the fuck does he know about ambition to begin with?He's insulted your mother, doesn't bother to educate himself on issues you're passionate about, has an attitude and temper that takes you back to nights in your youth where you hid for hours in your room.But you stay because you love him and it will get better.Until one night you both drink too much and smoke until your legs are jello. So you sleep. You wake up what seems to be minutes later with him between your legs. You try to tell him to stop but your words come out a mumble. You let him continue because your words can't escape your dry lips but eventually slides out the word-""Stop.""He looks at you, irritated mid-thrust. But he stops, angry at you for stopping his round of pleasure. You fall asleep shaking, your eyes wide and sober.This was the first night you considered leaving.There were many nights following this one you considered it again and again because you knew this relationship was going no where and he was only tearing you layer by layer until there was nothing left of yourself.But there was always the chance things could get better. There was always the chance that this could be your only chance at happily ever after.So you stayed.You stayed as you witnessed him rotting from the inside and out, and you could feel yourself falling into the same trap and your very being sucked away as you tried to help him get his own life back on track while your own withered.But then came sunshine through the storm clouds.You escaped for a week on a school trip, no contact with him, or anyone from home, and you became so much happier, making new friends, and actually doing things you enjoyed, sober.. However, you came back, and it all fell apart once more.Endless nights of crying only leading to your lips on another's, someone who was just as torn and broken as you.So comes the text, where your former love asks you; ""are you even happy""""No""-- so it ended (Or so you thought)You knew it would never work with the boy whose lips who were like sweet poison, so you cut him off too. For the months that follow you were in a tug of war between what you thought to be right versus what you wanted.What did you want?You aren't even sure if this real life anymore- how times have changed. Your hair turned as black as your fingers in this bitter cold winter, and you thought the only thing to right this situation was to go back to him.While in your state of vulnerability and being stuck in mental purgatory, immature alcoholic boys try to tell you how to live your life, calling you the slut just to ask you five minutes later to suck their dick.Pathetic.So you end up back with the boy who assaulted you, broke you down to your worst form in years. You feel nothing but disgust with yourself as his fingers touch your skin and he kisses the nape of your neck.You want to recoil, run now.Rather than spending countless nights crying yourself to sleep you sob your sins away on his couch. He tells you to forget it all because he can't even remember any of it because he was so fucking high.He forgave you for breaking his trust, kissing another while sworn to him, so why couldn't you just leave it all in the past?Because the minute you stepped back into his house the memories came flooding back- none of them good. The times you waited for him to finish taking a rip just so you could leave to somewhere, the night he ruined you seeing your favorite band live for the first time because he didn't want to drive because he wanted to get every more high. The night he broke your trust, taking advantage of everything you gave him.But how fucking dare you not be able to forgive him, because all you are is the fucking slut who fell for another. How dare you.Now, months after this has all happened you'll sit in your room, writing about all this over and over until the pain numbs itself and goes away. You're content because you think you've met someone with as much ambition as you, trouble is they're possibly just as fucked up as you as well.But you're willing to wait, patient.Healing, loving, comes with time."

I pulled into his drive way for the hundredth time, but it always felt like the first. Those butterflies never left me alone. Hearing ""Red Red Wine"" from the front door was my cue that he's getting ready and made sure the door was unlocked for me. I take off my shoes and walk down his cold hallway. His heater was broken, but he didn't care to fix it. He lived in his bedroom when he was home. I think he was too lonely to live in a big house by himself. He divorced a year prior and left everything the same. At first I thought it was sad, but I later learned he just didn't really care anymore. The music gets louder as I come up to the bathroom. We smiled at each other and I turned the opposite direction to go in his room. I jump on his massive cloud of a bed and melt. Seriously, what dude spends 50 dollars on ONE pillow case? I lay there and watch him get ready. Towel around his waist, singing to his lame reggae music, leaning in to the mirror to make sure he trims the right mustache hair. Seeing him get ready with hearts in my eyes.. I KNOW I KNOW, I'm such a cliche. I couldn't help it, I was so into him. So, what happened you ask? Well, I messed things up. I would make him feel (on purpose) that I didn't need him. Since we were never ""exclusive"", I let it be known that he wasn't the only option. I over did it with the ""independent woman"" thing and he eventually didn't want anything to do with me, (rightfully so). To make matters worse, as soon as he dumped me, I hit on his best friend... who didn't take the bait. *CRINGE* When I say I've messed up, I've messed up. He was the only one I talked to, the only one I talked about, the only one I was wanting, but for some STUPID reason - I didn't let him know that. He was the only one who actually saw me. Who brought over pizza when I had to cancel because I couldn't find a babysitter. Who put together my kids coat rack in the winter. Who pulled me by my ankles to the edge of the bed just to kiss me. I don't think of him everyday anymore, something I never thought would happen.. I remember waking up and before I opened up my eyes, I felt sadness.. Almost like your heart is broken even when you're asleep. It was hard to date for the longest time. Holding hands with someone else felt uncomfortable. Smelling someone else's scent was off. That probably sounds weird, but you get it. He's just one of those people I'll never get back and I'm forced to learn from. I've tried to make things his fault. I looked for ways he came up short, but they were never anything more than a harmless flaw that made me fall harder. I thought I was protected from heartbreak by keeping myself higher than him. Giving him absolute no control, no leeway, no keys, and no vulnerability. When he was gone, I climbed down from my asshole of a throne to find that the joke was on me. He was the one who didn't need this. He was the one that could wake up tomorrow and be okay, because I was pushing him away.. little by little.. the entire time. If love was making out in the movie theater just to leave 10 MINUTES before it was over, we had it. If love was chasing me down that cold hallway because we couldn't get to your bedroom fast enough, we had it. If love was fixing my cheap 3 dollar bracelet because you knew it was my favorite one, then love was you."

I worry that you don't, for I've failed to be the friend you've been to me. I hate that people have hurt you; I think we all have let you down. Vulnerability is strength and you're one of the bravest people I know. It can feel lonely to repeatedly have hope and find that nobody has a heart quite like yours.

I got this text message from you and simultaneously gasped, smiled, and sighed with relief. We only met two weeks ago; 15 days ago to be exact. We matched on a dating app, and you told me youd be out of town to visit family, but that in that time youd hope to convince [me] to go on a date with [you]. Truth be told, I didnt need much convincing. You seemed genuine, caring, and passionate, not to mention so attractive. The week went by and we decided on Wednesday during the day since neither of us had work. I told you to meet me at one of my favorite spots at 3 PM. We texted each other at the same time that the original bar wasnt open. You laughed about it; I sarcastically remarked that I was off to a good start. By coincidence, I suggested a different bar based around your favorite president. That morning, however, you told me that you just got news that youd be moving in the not so distant future and told me we could still meet up if I liked. I was bummed, of course, but I figured eh, why not. I have nothing better to do and this will probably be the most relaxed date Ive ever been on. It was settled then: wed meet for drinks and have a good one-off date. You got there before me, as Im perpetually late. I saw you sitting at the bar on your phone, and you turned toward me and smiled. I was wearing my huge sunglasses and resting bitch face. I also didnt dress to impress, wearing ripped jeans and an old Oktoberfest t-shirt. I figured this date was a non-starter and decided to be comfortable and more me than I would have been normally. You were wearing dark jeans and a blue henley that highlighted your incredibly muscular arms and chest. Uh oh, I thought to myself. We started with small talk, and I felt like I was asking all of the questions and got dead-end answers. Normally, I feel like the other person carries the conversation. I made a comment about it. You responded with I am talking to you. I felt my face turn bright red, let out a nervous laugh, and apologized. I thought this date was a goner. Somehow, we managed to salvage it. We talked about my college sports career, my friends, and my family. We talked about Chris Farley and Fat Guy In A Little Coat. We joked about how I could offer you one of my sweaters since it was 12 degrees Fahrenheit and all you had was your leather jacket. We talked about your upbringing, how you were homeless until you were 12 and then adopted by who I can only assume are actual saints. Your last name is one of the beatitudes, and you said that maybe thats why youre so soft-spoken. I giggled and told you I thought that was adorable. It was. You made me guess what you did for a living. I got it kind of right on the second try. We talked about your deployments and why work made sure to give you 6 weeks off after every one. You made me give you a play-by-play of the documentary I wanted to see so badly and let me talk about it for what seemed like hours. You let me be unapologetically me: awkward, nerdy, sarcastic, crude, both aggressive and submissive, and inquisitive. You laughed, genuinely laughed, at my jokes. That smile and your laugh made me try even harder to keep making you laugh. It worked. The entire time, your eyes never left mine, and I never felt that you were focused on anything but me. We stayed there for 3 or 4 hours. When we were leaving, you held the door open for the people walking in. What a gentleman, I thought, somewhat sarcastically. You were going left, I was going right. You asked if I wanted you to drive me home. I asked if you wanted to. You did. On the 15 minute car ride, I told you about my brother and his illness, my theories about why I loved being a student, and why I loved my high school. We talked about my time in Europe and our thoughts on Brexit. You held my hand and kissed it. Ive never felt so vulnerable and safe at the same time. When you dropped me off, you gave me a hug, and then fortunately went in for a kiss. I was ecstatic. You pulled into a spot so we could spend more time together. We would kiss, giggle, hold hands, and stare into each others eyes. I stared out the window with a huge smile on my face. What are you smiling about?! you asked me. Oh, nothing. Its a secret, Id tell you. You wouldnt take that answer. Finally I told you. You. Im thinking about you. Which wasnt a lie. It was the truth. But not the whole truth. If I wasnt so scared about scaring you off, I would have told you that I was thinking about how different being with you felt. How our chemistry was through the roof, and how badly I didnt want the night to end. I would have told you that I dont believe in love at first sight, but that this was the closest Ive ever felt to it. You wanted to get food. You asked to meet my brother and what he wanted to eat. Hes fine, I said. But in my head, I thought that was the sweetest, most caring thing a date had ever said to me. In lieu of food, we got beer and wine and watched one of Bill Burrs Netflix specials. I had just seen it days earlier but it never ceases to make me laugh. You loved it too. I cant get enough of that laugh you told me. Its probably the best sound Ive ever heard. I blushed and snuggled in closer to you. We made love and cuddled afterwards. You told me about your tattoo, and why you got it after your ex wife cheated on you a month into your marriage and was pregnant with another mans child. Oh, and that she told you this on your birthday while you were on a deployment. You werent angry. You werent bitter. It was very matter-of-fact, but I could tell it was a vulnerability that you let me in on. You asked me what makes me happy. I told you it was being alone with the person Im in love with. You told me your friends and family make you happy... and my laugh. We made love again, and fell asleep in each others arms. Ive never been so physically comfortable. You left the next morning and told me you couldnt wait to see me again. We texted back and forth, but both of us were busy. You were out of town the next week. And the week after, today actually, you texted me Happy Valentines Day!! You told me you had just finished moving out of this city. Three hours away. We agreed that it sucked, and I told you to let me know when to come down and give you a housewarming gift. You said you would. So here I am, with three and a half hours left on Valentines Day, both celebrating and mourning a budding love story. Hopefully our paths cross sometime soon, at a time when the universe believes were ready for each other. In the meantime, I hope you look back on our mini romance with as much fondness as I do. Happy Valentines Day to you, my bittersweet love. "

I love seeing your vulnerable side. There's so much you hide behind, but the emotions are always written all over your face. You let me glimpse into what had happened to you, the women who had hurt you. How they took advantage of you, your kindness and generosity. You promised yourself you would never let that happen again, and enacted a strategy of vengeance, the 3-4 rule. You would date or sleep with a woman a maximum of 4 times before you would leave them, never allowing yourself to develop feelings for them, never putting yourself in that state of vulnerability again, never to be taken advantage of again. You felt broken but you trapped yourself into a cyclical pattern. Every time you started to feel things again, you would push back. You liked the thrill of receiving sexy messages, the secret nature titillated your senses. It distracted you from your structured life, the life that was planned for you long ago. You never expected though that someone would actually care for you without wanting anything from you at all. It renewed your faith in yourself. You craved that close emotional connection with someone, yet at the same time, you remembered vividly the pain you had gone through when you allowed yourself to be open. Other men recover quickly and never think of it again, men like your brother - who is that fun-loving, easily amused, thrill seeker without a filter, but unlike him, you have an intensity that can't be matched, because everything you feel, you feel quite intensely, and that is why you have that quiet fire raging in your eyes that he does not have. I wonder for how long you have been trapped in your own mind's hell, your castle of despair? I never expected to find, much less unravel such a beautiful mind. There are layers to your depth, the undiscovered landscapes of your heart and soul. I wonder what it would be like to kiss you, to know so intimately of your heart's conflicts, and to connect in a way that goes beyond the real, the imagined and the symbolic? I wish I could take away your pain, but your pain is also what makes you such a beautifully flawed man. I wish you would not doubt me. I wish you would take a leap of faith. Talk to me. "

Sometimes I still wonder if I even existed until they gave me names. Not that it matters now. Its been years. We both know that Ive made the past an exhausting subject, but it was so easy to trap you with it. Maybe that was my earliest form. You would become enthralled in my lectures about days long-gone analysis, alternate outcomes, regret. When I first started to get unbearable, was when you met \*her\*. Right before you did, you had been on top of the world. Sure, you had ticks. But you were so strong back then. You didnt let me get any further than pinching your eye lids closed. I wasnt even capable of thought back then. You had achieved everything youd wanted to. You were so loved; so accomplished. Oh, it was a great story. Want me to tell it to you again? That new love was like the key I had been looking for to your subconscious lock. Your vulnerability due to outside forces was so easily mixed with my insecurity. You did meet me half way to move me in to your mind, though. You had always wanted so badly to be more appreciated, admired, romantically cared about. There are things youve done for it before we met that you still wont let me mention. It was prime real-estate. Sure, you always thought too much. But the previous residents of this part of your mind were much more benevolent. You always thought it fun to actively recognize your different tracks of thought. That pride gave me so much power. Now its so easy for me to call myself a separate entity, even if youve been trying your hardest to stop me from doing so. You treated that love like an obsession. You helped make it impure. You lost contact with friends, and with direction. You lost yourself. Once that love was distorted enough (giving most of the credit to myself), it left you. You retreated to where I lived more than ever. That time was so vulnerable for you. You dont even think about that love anymore, yet it fertilized me. I decided to give you presents. Things to play with while you were in here with me: nicotine, marijuana, relations with strangers who you simply like because they give you the time of day (no matter how cheap that time may be). They drew you closer to me. But so many people use them and are fine! Surely you can be one of them. For the first time since you could remember, you began to question the part of your mind you had still lived in most. You looked at reality with distorted eyes. People became what I wanted them to be. Circumstances became what I wanted them to be. Shame, anger, fear and sloth were daily activities. Didnt you even call me a demon once? That was before I started seeing for you though. It made you less lonely to have me, didnt it? Then, that fire in your eyes. The one youd always worshiped for so long. The one that made people call you good, humble, hardworking; no matter how many times you thought it untrue. One day it just left. Your eyes looked like the reflection of a muddy puddle. They were numbly empty. Your mouth agape. You had watched your achievements begin to crumble. The things you had worked so hard for were now melting. I watch you attempt to prop up your sandcastle with all that wet sand. Perhaps the waves will comeperhaps they wont. You had lived in here with me for so long. You couldnt concentrate on reality anymore. Its easier to lose interest. Your eyes remain glassed over; half way shut. I can feel your grip when it loosens. You used to come at me swinging, but it always seemed to hurt you too. I think you realized that. I havent had to flinch in some time. I saw you threw away your medicine two months ago. I praised you for it. You know, contrary to what you believe, I still want you to win. Its simply in my nature to make you lose. I watched as you threw away your last pack of nicotine. We \*both\* did not like that. I understand, though. I can feel those embers of that fire in your eyes. When you make any sort of contact with reality, that grip grows tighter. When friends express their love to you. When you call your Mom. When you laugh at a joke. Something inside me hurts. It makes me yearn for death. I hate what Ive done to you Cant you see? Why did you make it so easy for me to win? You didnt deserve this. You let me tell you that you did. You know I cant kill you. You still wouldn't let me go that far. So, I will wait here. Ill keep holding the reigns, until nature can challenge nature. I dont know how long it will take you. Reality is like shattered glass to you now. Your mind makes you tired. Your body aches. Your confidence lays submerged in mud. Ill only give you one comment of any substance: I look forward to our final confrontation. The day when you become you and not us, or me, or them. You started to call yourself by your own name without shuddering. I found that interesting. No matter how weak you get, dont let me win. This triumph I dont want it. No matter how long it takes, destroy me. I make it look impossible, but you must end my misery. Once you do the door will open again, maybe. The sun will shine. Is that enough inspiration for you anymore? I suppose well find out. "
511,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,The story of Anne's birth and how she longs to be in her fathers arms,2,arciqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/arciqb/the_story_of_annes_birth_and_how_she_longs_to_be/,2019-02-17 07:10:36,"Perhaps itd due to my dyslexia, but dont know which way is up or down, or left or right. My consciousness is turning and turning in the widening gyre. Im lost in a swirling sea of confusion here in the twilight. Really strange things have been happening in my life since very moment our eyes met on NYE. You were seated in our mutual friends living room with a glass of red wine: tall frame somehow both compressed and comfortable at the same time, in chair that my mind wants to remember as a mustard yellow, but the photographs suggest it was blue. Something in you drew me to you instantly, but I resisted. Instead of introducing myself immediately as I normally would do, I floated about the room like a sparkling Champaign bubble, waiting for you to make your way over to drink me in. Our eyes flickered at each other from behind our glasses (we are both somewhat unable to see straight without them). Yes, even thought you were literally on the other side of room, I could feel you. It was a faint flash at first, but this increasing vibration in frequency and magnitude made me break the tension. Aching for release, I uttered a simple, And you are?. You immediately stood to your full height, so my eyes could drink in every delicious inch of you and relish the full length of your haunches as you slowly made your way over to me. I watched your lips part, breathlessly inhale, and make your lispy-tipsy introduction. You, in your proper and underplayed way asked where my husband was. I knew then. You were asking if I was single and open to love. Later, I would totally call you out on it, do you think that I dont know when a British man asks where your husband is, hes really asking if you are single? This is where things start getting a little fuzzy in my minds eye. I feel like I joked and uttered something along the lines of, Me, please. Fuck no. Ive not found someone I want to spend more than 3 days a week with, let alone every day for all eternity. This is where the game first really started. I would float away for more bubbly, and you would find your way back to meboth us slowly melting away the metallic chains that have kept us captive in the bondage of darkness, and space, and time for only the universe knows how long. Once the catalyst was applied, we started to rediscover each other. Dancing through the music of our youth: swept away by our similarities, our sameness until it reached a quenching crescendo resulting in the singular best kiss of my life. I will not recount the rest, as you are gentleman and I am a lady. We both have a mutual respect to confess all the secret things hidden in the warm velvet box to only each other, the priest, or the doctor. You kissed me goodbye in cool, wintery mist. We embraced and I told you to be brilliant because for some reason I knew you needed the support of those words. Here is where it starts getting really weird, and yes, I mean totally fucked up. And I need you to know this, despite the fact that we are currently not speaking. Yes, I love you. I have since the moment time began. I love me as well. I need to tell my story for my own mental health and wellbeing. One day when and if you are ready, I want to lay my head in the crook of your arm, hand gently tracing the outline of your chest, and listen to your story  get lost and found in the words that rhythmically trip off of your talented tongue. But for now, I tell it for my own healing, my own health. You reached out and we started talking despite the distance between us. It was flirty, and sensual at first but then we moved past that, starting once again to slowly reveal to each other. My mind is literally blown away at just how much we have in common. The same music, the same movies, the same love for learning, reading, writing, science, technology and philosophy. You call me late one evening on the phone, and I clam the hell up. We met shortly after I had surgery. I told you I was disappointed that the timing was off. I didnt mean that our timing was offI just meant that the timing of union was off (wink, wink. thats a euphemism. My body has never craved to touch and be touched by anyone so much in my entire existence). One of the very first conversations we had the night we met was about Bandersnatch. You know, the choose your own adventure movie on Netflix. Somewhere over the next few weeks we both discover that Somewhere in Time is a favorite movie for us both. Why? For the love of all that holy and true, why? Why does he have to find that damn penny in his pocket and be forced back to his timeline? Leaves me shivering in tears every damn time. He dies of a broken heartbut is drawn to the light shining outside the window where they are finally reunited in death as she died after their initial meeting. You share some of your art with me. It beautiful, hilarious, and at times revels the true story of your pain (yes, I saw you). I realize that our art is the greatest and truest expression of self and to share it requires vulnerability. Im an idiot. Lol. Sometimes it takes me moment to process and find understanding. The next morning, I share a few poems written in my youth. We banter a bit, and then after work, I send you a few pieces written after my college awaking. The last, my love, two bodies, moving through space and timewas written for you. You woke me up, reminded me of me (of you?), you were the penny found deep in the pockets of my soul. Then you go cold. I hear nothing. Nothing for days. I just wanted to hear that you saw me. Saw how hard it was for me to willing apply the last drop of acid to dissolve the final gold thread holding all of me (heart, mind, body, soul) back. Vast, still emptiness like the darkest depths of an abyss lying at the bottom of the black still sea while a category 5 hurricane plows thought everything in its path just above the surface. I start to read more, listen to more music. Physical books, here on Reddit. I stumble across something that seems like a response from youhere in something beyond reality, the ebbs and flows of the digital sea. I respond to the post and get responses back. It felt like you, my person but not my person. I thought it was you. I swear I saw glimpses of you. Things only shared between us start appearing like Easter eggs for me to find. So much, that I bought an old copy of Alice and Wonderland to bring you next weekso you can read it to me naked in bed, like we always discussed. I willing followlooking to see you, to find you. I thought it was you. That you saw me, and I saw you. In general, I try to let people cave - have their space to process and be. When we initially met in the real world you shared that your last relationship needed because she smothered youwhen you need to be there for your daughter. I dont have kids. In fact, I cant due to medical reasons, which you know. We met shortly after that dream died for me. But you know I helped raise my niece and my nephew (though I dont know if you know that it was for 11 years) because they have crap parents who have never put them first. I sooo understand this about you in ways I cant even begin to process. Its always been one of my deepest desires to have a family. However, Ive let it go. Resolved, grateful, and lucky that the universe had indeed blessed me with two beautiful children Ive been given in the form of my niece and nephew. I reach out to break the days of silence. We both are deeply connected to communication in many, many ways. I ask what works for you, as Im overly sensitive to others preferences. You responded with same. I feel guilty, because you are with your daughter. I tell you to go be there for her/with her 100% and that Im not going anywhere (and I deeply mean it). Meanwhile, here in the endless tides of unsent letters the person I think is you talks to me. It leads me to laying it all out there to you (the you in reality? I think?) later that evening. I playfully joke about how you are torching me with this online banter. I make a friend get me out of the house on Sunday for Pizza and beer  tear myself away from this madness. And only find more madness in the reality of the world  meeting someone with my same first and middle name, born in the same month, physically about the same height. As we talk, we realize shes an actress and a writer: the things I was 20 something years ago. She even uses some of the same phrases as I do. I message you that I just had the oddest experience. You ask if I need a call. I do. We talk and you joke about falling down a rabbit holewhich just makes it worse for me. We joke about the fact that I interviewed for a job last year at your company, right before you started. Laughing, realizing that there would have been no way in hell for us to stay apart if we had to be next to each other in an office all day: sitting in many of the same meetings, since the overlap of us in professional world is so great. The building would likely explode from the surmounting sexual tension. I see more from the person I think is you online. I joke, with youthinking it is you. And you have no clue what Im talking about. I ask if you wrote a response and to tell me honestly. I just quit smoking and have been taking Chantix to help kick the addiction. The doctor has warned me it might cause issues. You know this. What you dont know is that yes, I quit for my health  I cant take hormones without quitting. What you dont know, is that I also quit for you. Its been a dividing issue in previous relationships, and I wanted to purge myself of that addiction before it even has a moment to be a thing. You already mean that much to me. We flirt more (Christ, we have an indescribable, palpable chemistry you and I), and I tell you Im getting mind fucked by the things Im reading here online. You mention that are getting mind fucked by Russian Doll right now. I think were playing game online, I think Ive finally uncovered your real identity and see the words youve left me un-mangled by some alt-shift realityand my computer crashed. I reach out to you, tell you that I found you for a moment, only to have it reset, and I ask you to fix it. You have no knowledge of this. I accuse you of Bandersnatching my ass. Every word you type leads me down some twisted path and I legitimately think you are trying to help me win this online game somehow. I ask how long youve be doing this  being both adorable and amazing. You said its a new thing, since the night we met. But you only go on what you are told. I implore further and ask how long youve been leaving me messages here. You are totally confused and mention that you think I have someone elses handle, as youve not posted anything. I try to tell you how much this is screwing with my head. You said you would admit it if you had. Lol. I know you wouldnt if you thought it was fun and gamesas you kept taking my glasses off the first time we met and swapping them with your own. It was frustrating, charming, adorable, and edgy. You say that there are 2 others with your name, but I know that there are not. Its not like your last name is overly common (hehe. See what I did there?). You swear on your daughters life (Hey, please dont ever do that again. Ive never met her, but I know how deeply you treasure her) that it is not you. You ask for a link. Saying you wrote things a while backbut theyve long gone afaik (funny, because it is also a software). I tease that you are little sadist. And continue to spread-out my body of evidence before your eyes  telling you that I need this to resolve soon and the mounting anxiety in my mind is tearing away at the thin veil of reality. I crack a joke about our safe word being &lt;undefined&gt;. Somehow, I manage to make into bed. I wake up groggy, lightheaded, and so disoriented on Wednesday to a message that you are really getting concerned and the honesty go God truth, is that so am I. I tell you that you are ridiculous and that your dry humor allows you to play the straight man very convincingly. In fact, given what we both do in the real-world I know how this is mathematically and technically possible. Hell, Ive even uncovered some of the code that makes it possible. Again, I crack a joke - about unplugging your life support to charge my phone. You deny, and say I keep doubling down and that this is weird, strange, and not a good situation. I still think you are being adorable (Christ even when you infuriate me, I find you adorable). I wake up Valentines day to you telling me that you cant keep doing this  telling me the truth only to have me deny it. You call off the weekend weve planned next week. Im shaking, in tears. I tell you that your words made me cry and that this was mean. I keep trying to escape this fucking loopto find you and set us back right. I write you a letter and post it here. Thinking it will end this madness. It doesnt. In fact, it gets worse. Im sitting on a conf. call late in the afternoon in my bosss office. His Alexia Echo show is displaying the weather from a major city in your country and I swear on my left breast (I truly do love my boobs) it even flashes Say hello to &lt;insert yer name&gt;, and &lt;yer name says hello&gt;. It gets even more dark and twisty, my love. The content being discussed on the call was all somehow related as welland I at one moment, I thought I even saw you dressed incognito (as a woman, which you love to do, and I dont mind in the least) in the little video boxes. All I could is laugh at just how much this is fucking up my sanity. I get home and text you, asking if we can talk. Telling you Im horribly confused and turned upside down. You said youd rather notthat youve been horribly confused by my messagesand that you cant do this as your last relationship had a million red flags you ignored. These last few days were a HUGE red flag for you. You wished me the best and told me you cant do this. It occurs to me. How selfish Ive been. Not pausing to think of how my odd words and actions might impact you. I take full responsibility. 100%. I should have been more sensitive to you and your experience/perception and I overlooked it. Im so deeply sorry, my person. I never meant to cause you any stress, pain, or anxiety. I thought it was just a game you were playing. It must be a bug. I must have been hacked or something, and it has been a hellish nightmare. I just want you know that I wish you the best, but this has cause me an inordinate amount of stress, anxiety, and soul-wrenching pain. And guess, what? Its 100% on you for not trying to understand my perspective - to try to uncover how all of this was impacting me. Things twist and turn again. I start watching Russian Doll. WTAF? Seriously? I know why you were mind-fucked by it. But you have no idea why it double mind-fucked me. So here is why. &amp;#x200B; Things you know:  Im allergic to latex and saffron  I have red, curly hair  I swear, smoke (or use to), and speak my damn mind.  The loops. Whats it with us and the damn loops??? &amp;#x200B; Things you dont know  Im deathly allergic to bees.  My birthday: August 12th. I know yours, but you never asked mine. Why do I point this out? I share my birthday with Helena Petrovna Blavatsky. She was a Russian occultist, philosopher, and author who co-founded the Theosophical Society in 1875. She gained an international following as the leading theoretician of Theosophy, the esoteric religion that the society promoted. Worked with WB Yeats in London and in part helped develop his theories on loops, or gyres, as he called them.  My youngest sister suffers from undiagnosed/untreated BPD  it has led her down a path of alcoholism, drug abuse, and extreme sexual issues. This is how I ended up partially raising her children as my own.  Every man Ive ever loved has cheated on me and betrayed me.  My first loop: College. November 16th, 1996. The man I would have married. The first man I ever slept with willingly (Yes, you read that right. That story is one that will only be shared with you in person, should we ever sync back up on the same time loop). We planned it all, down to kids names. He left for Yellowstone during the summer. I took off during the 1996 Olympics. We spent 2 weeks in the Montana backcountry, slept under the big sky. I went back to drive home with him at the close of the summer  only to find him in bed with another woman. Yes, we spent 5 days in a car traveling back. We had to physically share a hotel room. I would lock myself into the bathroom every night, crawl into the bathroom and sob from the depths of me. He was killed 2 short months later in a car accident. I had to go to his funeral and watch the woman he fucked for 3 months stand in my place with his people at the funeral. We were together for 2 years, and she took my place. The courage to pray for peace, love and grace in that moment was nothing compared to courage it took to reach out and give it right back to everyone in that moment. Our movie was Groundhog Day. He once put add in the college paper, You better put your booties on cause its cold outside for me to find on Valentines day.  My second loop: Reprise of my HS boyfriend. Last for about 4 months until he called me one day 2 weeks after I left his bed to tell me he just got engaged to another woman. The WB Yeats book that I told you about with the gold inlay cover, the one I bought for over 200 Pounds at that epic bookstore in Oxford, I gave to him as an engagement present after he crushed me to dust. My most valuable possession in the physical world, given freely: a kind and loving inscription wishing him all the happiness in the world scribbled inside  My third loop: Met him in a hospital. While I was holding the hand of my best friend dying from a cancerous brain tumor, just a few months after her husband was tragically killed. Took us a long time to get off the ground. He was a tech geek, and a pilot. He gave me my first flying lesson. &lt;cough&gt; You could say I also gave him his first flying lesson ;-). He lost his job after our first year together. I encourage him to take the moment to reset, refactor and refine. He eventually decided to go to medial school to become (of all things) a Doctor of Anesthesiology. His best friend was a female dentist who at the time was married. She used him as her emotional spouse. Tried to get him to go to couples counseling. He wouldnt go, but fuck it, I went to couples counseling alone and started to build a better relationship with myself. We eventually broke up, because she became his emotional other. He denied it at the time, but they are now married with 2 kidsso, guess I called that one right. Fun fact: I bought him an engraved compass for Valentines that year. They screwed up the engraving and put the wrong quote on it. Sent another, but I still have it the mess up one. Im holding it now. The initials on the front are PMH. The quote reads: That many had ventured further and done so in finer style bothered me not. My journey was no my own and I found it to be quite spectacular.  My fourth loop: Got engaged to the next guy who came along. I never loved him. We were not congruent. I was in love with what he wanted to give me, a commitment. We had the wedding planned. Apparently, I still have the save the date. Found it last week while simplifying my clutter. Ive never cheated on anyone  Im tragically loyal that way. However, I realized at some point that a list of people I would leave him for existed in my mind. Found out he had a cocaine problem the next week and shipped my engagement ring back to him via FEDEX.  My fifth loop: On and off relationship for 3 years with someone who always kept me at a distance, waiting for someone better to come along. Couldnt and wouldnt commit. Loved him, so I tried the ethical, non-monogamous thing. Could not do it. Not in my nature. No judgment for this preference  its just not mine. He tried to come back to me a few weeks ago. We met for dinner. You messaged me during itand my whole being lit up in a noticeable way. He made a joke about me getting a dick pic. I unintentionally broke a tiny piece of him by telling him all about you: unable to contain the bright beacon of hope youve sparked in my soul.  My sixth loop: I reset on NYE. I died on Valentines day.  My seventh loop: Here. Now. I hope and pray that youll come back to me. Be my light, my compass, run to me and Ill run to you. But lets go back to the start  the one where we exist on the same celestial plane. Lets hold still for this moment in time, do everything we can for the union of the woman and man. Fight for me now. I need you to find me here. Assure me that Im not going crazy. There is a strong possibility that the hormones, medications, and family history of disease are impacting my perceptions. I honestly need you to stead me, to seek me out, to fight like hell for me, just like I have fought for you. Until you do, Ill be working on me. Finding my center amidst the storm and never letting the dark side of life kill my last grain of hope. I hold it now in an open palm, release it to the universe, and pray that one day it will return to me."
512,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,To the girl who i so badly wanted to be close to..,3,arp6vw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/arp6vw/to_the_girl_who_i_so_badly_wanted_to_be_close_to/,2019-02-18 08:17:39,"A while ago you blurted out a sentence that was something along the lines of: ""I have issues with you _____""whilst we were working on that painting job. It was said quite aggressively but I had got used to that kind of reaction and try my best to not take it personally. I would put it down to two things, they are just theories and maybe I'm wrong: a) I must do things to wind you up, and b); there might be something else going on with you when that happens for the reaction to be that aggressive. I always forgive you and hope you are capable of forgiving me for whatever it is I do that provokes it, although i'm not always able to figure that out. I had an instinctively driven reaction of telling you that I had issues with you too. To your surprise. I dropped it because I thought I wouldn't see you again after the work was finished. Let it go. Doesn't matter... Part of me was actually expecting I wouldn't see you again. Not having you around over summer and autumn had been good for me, I began to heal and during that period I similarly thought I wouldn't see you again and part of me hoped I wouldn't. I genuinely took that job because I needed the money, despite your presence, which I thought could potentially be damaging. You seemed like you wanted to know what my issues were. I have to say I was curious what yours were as, to my mind, I've never wronged you or been dishonest with you in any way. Maybe I have overreacted to things on a couple of occasions but both of us have been guilty of that. I don't think I've ever been aggressive toward you , although in text it's hard to interpret tone, maybe you construed some messages as aggressive when to my mind they were just honest and written calmly. Anyway, the 'issues' thing was dropped for the sake of working together and we let things cool down. We carried on working and managed to get along to a certain extent. At some junctions, I saw the person I had 100% belief in previously, the good heart and the free spirit, the infectious smile.. and at other times I also had a taste of the person who broke my loyalty toward her. A mixed bag, almost the person I thought I knew, but not quite. Though she is in there somewhere. You once told me that I might not like the person you would grow up to be. I don't know what that will be and I don't know what you are now, and how can I when we've hardly spoken for so long? You used to confide in me, talk about your past and how you deal with that in the present. I really valued that. That closeness is something I have missed. I would tell you about me in return, my inner thoughts and feelings. I haven't been so honest with anyone since. I hope you still have someone to talk to , who isn't a therapist , or a parent. I hope you have someone in your day to day life because I think you need it, that ability to say whatever comes into your head. When we first met, in London... I remember the exact moment I fell for you. We were sitting outside the hotel and you told me some very personal things. I listened , whilst being completely spellbound by the most beautiful human being I had ever come across during my whole life. The way the light fell on your face under that bus stop while we smoked a J together , it's an image I'll have burned into my memory for years to come. Here was a girl who had been through a tougher time than I can ever imagine.. yet was somehow so together .. And so oozing with class. I haven't seen her for a long time, that girl. When I look now , I still see a beautiful face but I also see a girl who is putting on an unnecessary front , someone struggling on the inside and who desperately needs someone to look after her and guide her through life , though you may not know it. It's okay to show vulnerability, people will still like you. I thought you were out of my life for good when we finished the work, and during that time we hadn't quite managed the reconciliation I thought we might get (we got on okay, we even had good fun together but there were times when I felt you were rude and disrespectful toward me in way I didn't deserve and you seldom apologised for it), and you were with a guy who hates me. I knew I was leaving the area and so that was that. Forever to be a ghost of each others' memory. I carried on with my own business, sorting out my mess of a life. Rebuilding, looking forward to a brighter future I had secured after spending the previous year or two knocking down four years of hard work (all my own fault , I refuse to blame you for that. Don't think that I do). The only contact that remained was strictly professional, trying to make sure we all got paid for the work. Then you messaged me out of the blue, with a need to tell me that you had broken up with your boyfriend. I don't really know why you felt the need to tell me but you did. You even spent an entire train journey sat next to my best friend talking about that stuff before you did it, knowing it would surely get back to me. Upon receiving that message you sent, it was a small comfort to think that maybe, just maybe you were going to be a friend of sorts. Not someone of romantic interest. I know It'll never be that and likewise , I will never see you in that light again, certainly not in the near future. I find you attractive physically and I think you have a good heart but your rejection of me last year in favour of (to my mind) a soulless man with no redeeming qualities whatsoever (apart from being a 'nice guy') hurt me. It hurt a lot, for a long time. Rejection hurts, especially when you head toward an age where you know your desirability is soon to be on the wane. Back on track, so you messaged me and I thought maybe you might be someone I want to keep in touch with when I'm gone (And I am going, I'll move heaven and earth if I have to. I don't plan on coming back either.) The idea that I have a very small group of friends still in my heart and on the end of a message or phone call appeals. I'll need that, it's going to be tough out there. Tougher than anything I've ever done. I'll need people who can help me through that , as well as people I can celebrate the successes with. I do have issues with you which I'll get onto but your contacting me made me think that you could be one of those people , that maybe your issues with me stemmed from someone else (I still don't like saying his name , or typing it). I still believed in you. For some reason I still do. I still want you as a friend, it will be from a distance but I still want that. Maybe the issues need to be out in the open for that to be possible. So, here goes (I am open to you telling me what your issues are with me by the way). The first one... when I knew I was going to be without a home , you offered me your flat for the summer. I'm so grateful for that, you'll never know how much. Really. I probably could not have finished my MA if that didn't happen. But the issue was this: I put my life into your hands by accepting that offer.. the fact I was in that position was all down to me , and it should never have been that way, but there it was.. my life in your hands . From an offer you made , I never asked to use your flat. I trusted you with my life. You promised me I would be able to move in at a certain date knowing I had to move out of another property. When the day came, I was told to wait one more day. And then another ... And then you went home to London and handed my life over to a man who hates me (and hates me for no good reason other than a petty jealousy and a controlling nature). I eventually moved in over a week past the agreed date, and after my contract the old address had ended. Luckily the agency that had taken over my contract never caught wind of that but it could have cost me a lot of money. It certainly caused me much stress. During that week I had all my belongings packed up and waiting in a hallway. I was going to reception in the college and asking if any keys had been left for me , every day.. and had the embarrassment of being told no every time I went in, then I was being promised ""tomorrow"" each time I would ask you what's happening. And.. something else happened that week , I was emotional and on my own in a big house where everyone else had moved out of. I won't tell you what it was , but it's the darkest experience I've ever had and it wouldn't have happened had you kept your promise, that much I know... So, I eventually moved into your flat, your man had had quite a fun time in there from the looks of it as that flat was in a disgusting state, I took photos but thought better of sending you any of them. Despite my dislike for that guy, I wanted you two to be okay and not be a factor in how your relationship panned out. Then, fast forward to a phone call, at the end of my stay: the 'your time is up there' phone call. I asked for one or two more days, so that I could have the help I need to move. When offered the flat originally, I remember you saying the dates of the contract and very specifically remember thinking that I would be there on my birthday, which I wasn't in the end as the dates had changed according to the information you were giving me on the phone (you even accidentally started to say the date I had in mind when you were telling me this). Those details are not really important in this I suppose , it's more what happened next... You seemed to completely misconstrue what I was saying and decided to have a pop at me down phone. You were 'disapointed ' with me. when I told you I had worked my ass off getting my MA finished you gave a condenseding 'hmmm' to indicate I was talking out of my arse and told me certain things you thought 'someone had to tell me'. Exactly what they were , I can't quite remember but the tone and approach was all very belittling and you had no idea how wrong you were to say to those things. About a week or two previous to that, a complete stranger had told me the thing I ""needed to hear"" a friend of a friend at a birthday do I went to. This girl was drunk but what she had perceived, had weight attached to it and it's stuck to this day. What you wanted to tell me and what you thought was best for me was not what I needed or deserved. It was out of line and the total loyalty I had for you until that point evaporated in the space of thirty seconds. But I was living in your flat so I couldn't say anything back. You owned my ass... Another thing, related to my staying in your flat. In the days leading up to my moving in date, or certainly the original moving in date, not the week after as it turned out to be... You told me your parents wanted to know more about why I had nowhere to go. Asked about my paying rent , seemed fair enough a thing to ask at the time, despite my asking you multiple times beforehand if they were definitely okay with it.. and I explained those things to you. I then spent the following day in tears thinking I was going to have nowhere to go, that you would reneg on the whole thing 24hrs before I was due to move.. and that continued for another week, the tear and uncertainty as I have talked about just now. However, going back to the present: on day two or three of us working together recently , I asked you a question : ""I hope my staying at your flat wasn't too much of an issue with your parents??"", To which you replied : ""no not at all, _______ (boyfriend) was the one with the issue."" Your answer meant you lied to me. I have seen you lie to _______ before , I've even seen you lie to your parents before , but this was the first time I knew for sure that you had lied to me. Really disappointing, there is one thing you need to know here: because I was so in love with you before , I can remember almost all of every conversation we've ever had. Being lied to is something I do take an issue with, I had suspected you of lying on previous occasions but here was what I saw as proof of it. It's one of a few things I find very hard to take. So the real issue from all of the things I have gone through is that I lost trust in you a long time ago and you know what? I really want to trust you so that we may be friends in life. I would even let myself do that if you were to apologise, because I think you will grow into an amazing human being like I always told you you would be. You gave me a speech , maybe about a year ago, a bit less, not sure... About how some people are in your life temporarily, transient, and how some people are there forever. _______ was going to be someone transient, you said. But I would be in your life forever. Last summer was when you started to cut me out of your life, I had lost some loyalty as I've explained , sure, but i still wanted to give you another chance or for you to give me another chance or whatever.. I didn't want to be cut out but that's what happened, not my choice at all. It started to feel like it was me who was the transient one after all. And then, coming back to the last few weeks , you make a point of telling me about your break up . Specifically wanted ME to know how you're now free. All the things I have gone through in this message, all instantly forgiven because someone I care about deeply.. seems to be finally talking to me again. Yet, within a week more or less.. my messages get read and ignored. I've had that from people many times , I can take it. People are busy, I'm stuck in ______ with no friends. I get that not everyone will instantly reply to all my messages. With you though, I feel like there needs to be a little effort on both sides beacuse of the past. Because we lost trust in each other. I don't expect constant contact or to be the person you turn to when you feel lonely or to treat me like I'm some special case. What i do need though... Is a little bit of kindness from people right in this moment. I'm a long way from any of my friends , my life currently consists of waking up, looking at a computer for 7-8 hours to do an online course , then finding something else to do until it's bedtime again. I'm not smoking pot anymore, I've only ever gone this long without it twice in the last 20+ years , usually replacing it with alcohol. I'm not drinking either at the moment. I've given up smoking tobacco too. I can buy some if I want but I don't want to, it ages me and I want to carry on looking young. The result of this cold turkey is mood swings, weird sleep patterns and some really fucked up dreams. Really fucked up. At the same time as all that, I'm witnessing my father treat himself appallingly , a diabetic on a diet that will kill him, smoking so many cigarettes it's untrue , not doing any exercise at all, not motivating himself in any way to do anything with his day. It's heartbreaking to see and he tells me he doesn't care and talks about his own death regularly like he doesn't give a fuck. When I'm busy and working my new job in a fantastic new country, things will be different to how they are now . But in this moment , I need people to humour me a little and be kind , cater to my attention seeking slightly. Accept me if I act a little weird . In years to come, I won't forget those who do. And right now, the list of those people is very short . I love you unconditionally _____, as a friend. If you choose to cut me out again, so be it , I will survive . I hope you don't beacuse I want to watch your journey and have some kind of contact with you along the way to know you're ok and that you're happy. I know you have a good heart and maybe in years to come, we can get together and talk about the good times there once were."

I feel shards of glass scraping against my heart when you do this. You are killing me slowly and you don't even know it. You will never see my pain because you have not earned the right to witness my vulnerability. I'll die before revealing this to you. I would have done anything for you and I'm obviously not as important to you as you are to me. I hope some day you feel this way so you know how much pain you've caused me. "

Scared of showing vulnerability &amp; love &amp; just everything. I don't know why it was like that. I could blame it on years of psychological abuse i suppose, but is that just an excuse? Maybe. I just wish i could forget about you. I reallly fucking do my god. I don't know. I hurt you &amp; you hurt me. You continued to hurt me long after i changed. Do you feel as though i deserved it? Sometimes i do. Sometimes i feel like it was too much, but i guess I'm selfish so what's new right? I just wish for once i could talk to you &amp; we could be truthful with each other. Maybe someday.

The past year since we've been split up, I never truly believed we were apart. I could always talk to you when I missed you and be with you, when I wanted to. Maybe this was one sided. I thought about you all the time. Going on our sunny adventures, eating ethnic foods, having the best sex of my life and conversing about things that really meant something in this world. In the back of my mind, I always knew you would meet someone during our time apart. You have a great sense of humor and you're genuinely one of the kindest people I have ever met in my life. Who wouldn't fall for you? Since you are moving on, I have to allow myself to truly move on as well. I think when you have someone who shares your bed and vulnerability, it's easier to move past previous relationships. Since this isn't something I've had since we started seeing other people, I need to allow myself to completely disconnect from you. Maybe, when I've met someone that I care for - even a fraction of what I feel about you - we can be friends again. I need to take some time alone to work on myself, gain my confidence back and really get my life together for the future. For the sake of my health, I can't allow myself to love one sided. I know you are going through a lot right now, but I cannot be the person in your life to help you through it. That's why it's so hard for me to write this letter, because I know you're feeling down and all I want to do is help you through it. But It's to easy to fall for you, again and again. All I can say is for me, I know that making healthy decisions and choosing the right people to surround yourself with is the key to having some sort of happiness in life. &amp;#x200B; I will always fucking love you Lilly.

Its funny, after all the love letters I wrote to you, now I sit here, contemplating why I ever felt that way as I write this. From our first date, I fell for you. It wasnt your beautiful blue eyes or looks that caused it, although you perfectly match the description of what Id desired. It was your warmth, our conversations, your emotional vulnerability, and how easy it felt to be myself with you. You never made me feel ugly or bad about myself. You complimented me and came across as such a genuine person that I let myself fall into your embrace. I remember Halloween, and how you brought my daughter some candy and took us trick or treating. I remember holding you while you cried about your ex and brother. I gave you encouragement, advice, a literal shoulder to cry on. Early 5 am mornings remind me of you, my bed reminds me of you, Hell, now even school reminds me of you. And all I want to do is forget. I get it where youre coming from, Im a mess, moody, young, and still trying to get my life together. You want freedom, and everything about me screams commitment. I tell myself that maybe thats all we were meant to be for each other, someone to hold while we mourned over our past relationships. Sometimes I feel like Im crazy when I try to justify my feelings for you. Everyone else saw the red flags, and now Im paying for it. I saw your potential, not just work-wise but in love. I think thats what hurts the most. Today, I saw you in the parking lot on campus. C pointed you out to me, but I couldnt stomach turning to look at you until I was sure you were far enough away for us to not make eye contact. Why oh why do you have to park there now? My stomach aches and the feelings of sadness return every time I see your truck. Every morning, I deliberately come later and leave earlier so I can avoid running into you. You say you want to stay my friend, but why? To continue manipulating and using me? I deserve so much more than you were willing to give me, and you knew that. But you just couldnt help yourself, you wanted all that I was willing to give until I finally had enough. Our last conversation plays in my head today. When you showed your true colors, 11 days ago. What couldve been a simple conversation, turned serious really quick. I was forced to see how you really felt about me, and all of your true intentions were revealed. We havent spoken a word to each other since then. When Im in class, I remember your enthusiastic smile, upbeat persona, and the hugs youd give me when we ran into each other. Then I remember why thats all gone now. Im not sure how to trust men anymore, because you seemed so damn sincere and caring. I hope holding onto the past was worth it. I hope you find someone that can make you forget the pain better than I could. And I hope you never make anyone feel the way you made me feel, ever again. On the bright side, I am wiser now and aware of how much growing up I really have to do to be in a healthy relationship. I know how to set healthy boundaries now, or at least Im learning how to. Im aware of what Im not willing to put up with, and signs of when to run from someone. When you see me on campus, I hope you take the time to reflect on how to NOT treat someone that tried so hard to be a true friend to you. I hope you eventually grow up, and realize the potential of who you could be instead of throwing it away over someone who did you wrong. -The girl you broke down to feel better "
517,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,I flew 8000km to meet you.,1,as749o,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/as749o/i_flew_8000km_to_meet_you/,2019-02-19 16:57:01,"I knew from very early on in our friendship that you were something special and someone worth making the effort for. There were pieces of me that felt really broken when I met you and I had only just begun trying to build myself up and work on my confidence. Just by being yourself and being vulnerable with me I was also able to practice vulnerability and I did not realize at the time how much having you in my life was benefitting me. When I think back I can recall many times I felt myself hold back on sharing when you were opening up to me and you would call me out on that. I was always fearful of letting you in so that you had nothing you could hurt me with. It would amaze me that you could see me better than myself some days, a feeling that I believe is mutual and maybe that's why we feel supported by one another. It's not like you have fixed me, you've just shown me another way to think and how to be. How to be more gentle with myself and let people in. Sometimes when I feel unmotivated to try harder I think about you and keep going. Just by nothing other than being yourself has been enough for me to do some of the sweet ass things I've done in my life. You're my number one fan and my biggest support. Having spent this time with you in England I feel like we have finally gotten to a new place of understanding one another and it felt so effortless. I would look over at you and feel such a sense of safety, comfort, and warmth being in your presence. You have such a way of making me feel like it's all going to be okay that it's the first time that I've been able to stop thinking about everything else going on in my life and let someone else take control. My thoughts were not impeded by the past or the future and I felt more like myself, the me without the work and the school and the heavy life shit than ever before. I cannot express how safe and comfortable it felt being around you. You make me feel like I've come home after a long time away, you feel like home to me. When I was around you, everything else just disappeared. You have a softness to your eyes that tells me it's okay to be here with you. Even though you like to take the piss out of everyone and I'm not use to that I found it to be enjoyable in a comforting way. It felt like we've known each other all our lives and me visiting was us finally getting to see one another again. The weeks and days leading up to coming to see you I felt incredibly scared. I was unsure if I would ever measure up to whatever version you've created in your head since we've had a distance barrier between us. First moment I saw you I realized how unnecessary that pressure had been on myself. I remember the day I told myself that I will without a doubt come see you. As soon as I landed in Dublin, after weeks spent with you,I felt empty and like my heart broke into two. The first thing I wanted to do was get the next flight home and surround myself with friends who could mend my heart. I didn't realize I had the capacity to love someone the way I love you. So much that I feel compelled to tell you this now. This isn't news I know. But something's changed for me. I know 100% you're not ready where you are in your life right now to feel much more for me than friendship. I promise you I had zero expectations but from being around you I can say that it was perfect and exceeded anything I could have imagined. I also know how unrealistic it is for me to want anything more from you. Something more from you will never be a condition of our friendship and it wouldn't change anything regardless of how you feel. Even if you were emotionally available, someone would have to make a huge sacrifice for this to work. If all I can settle for is friendship then that is still a prize for me. However, if ever there is a piece of you wanting more I would consider all the possibilities. Change is inevitable and I doubt my feelings will hold me back from making changes for you. I have zero regrets knowing you, coming to see you, anything we did while I was there or saying this to you. You've always listened to me and have always been there. You are one incredible human being, even if you can't see it the way I do. you have overcome a heavy load and continue to amaze me. It's one of your most attractive qualities. We are two very different people and it just works because of that I think. I feel we could continue to teach each other things and it can only get more exciting from here. I could spend this entire lifetime happy with you by my side. If only as friends then so be it. Until next time. All my love. "

You were amused at my incessant messaging, and I was entranced by your conversation. We'd never met in person, but we kept a lively, loving, daring line of texts and emails flowing from the start. The end of 2018 was filled with one hell of a lot... chaos, longing, friendship, kindness, hilarity, fear, vulnerability. It was whimsical and magical and good and terrible and high and low. Mid-December, you pushed away entirely from me. I couldn't believe it, and there wasn't anything in that moment I could say that would make you understand... maybe you refused to see my side, or didn't want to see it. I wasn't catatonic, but I was lucky to have work mates who could see and understand the struggle of losing/missing someone close. Family visits over the holidays were extremely lackluster. (Hah. If only I'd known my vision of your own holiday was completely wrong.) The words of my ""final"" letter explained my side, why I did what I did and why I could see it as ""taking advantage"", but why it really wasn't. I exposed the deepest, darkest part of my world to you... and after sending it, that was it. A shared end to one thing, and a beginning into the unknown. After sending you that NYE note, things had to change. And so I started on this journey - writing you an unsent letter each day - to help me get over you. Each day, I would allow myself a moment to think of you, and see my strengths and flaws in your lens... and then let it go for the rest of that day. A team email in early January screwed that up, as we quickly went back to fast friends. I was so extremely careful, fearing a repeat of December. There were bumps, and we still hadn't met in the real world... but from early January through yesterday, another whirlwind of emotions flew by: love, respect, openness, chaos, deep, dark, light, joyous, everything and nothing. Far less negativity than 2018, and far more happiness. Yesterday, something flipped, and you were done, cutting me off... cutting yourself off. This was a pattern... the result of who I am and my challenges, and of who you are and your own battles. But after so many days of kindness and warmth, I refused to just let go. Fuck you... if you're gonna cut me off, what's there to lose? You accepted my invitation. Holy fuck, you did. Shit. Now what? How do you meet someone in reality that you've shared... well, everything... with, in this written world? What if we're not the same people we envisioned in our minds? We met. Actually met. And the hours passed as we talked endlessly about everything, for hours and hours, and we were friends, compatriots, lovers, haters, confidantes, teammates, players, allies, we were ourselves, truly, and on each other's side, all of that time. You know what, Sterling? Now that I've met you in the real world, I don't know how to go back to this, not without it being different. I see you so much clearer, so much sharper, and for that, I want to respect and honor so much more of who you are. And it's not that I hadn't done either of those. I just didn't see it in the same light, the same clarity, that I do now. I'm going to keep writing to you. And now, I get to say the things I can't ever say to you - or at least won't say for now - because of what you mean to me now. So here goes: Fuck, Sterling. I had envisioned you would be different in the real world than in text, because then I could let you go a little. But shit. You're exactly who you portrayed. You're so, so, beautiful. (I really wanted to reach out and run my hand through your stupid ass beautiful face, fuck you for complaining about age.) You're an incredible conversationalist, and there was never a moment I felt dead space, or wasted energy. You're passionate, articulate, precise, and free. You speak your mind, and do it well. You're energetic and alive. Your laugh - the really deep, infectious one - fuck, I love it. And to have had a few moments of touch... a playful shove, a heartfelt hug, or a desiring, warm embrace... damn. Even more than all of that, though (and this is why you'll never understand me, since you can't possibly fathom this is the most important): You make me feel accepted. You make me feel worthwhile, and worth something in this world, something beyond my skills in my career or my contributions to my family. You somehow see me for me, in all my fucked up everything, and yet, I'm still okay. That's why you matter so much. That's why it's been so hard to let go. And because I feel exactly the same way about you - that you're so much more than what the world says you are - that I won't give up. Not now, not ever, Sterling. I promise you that."

Im scared of trying I think I scared you when you saw how much I picked up about you. Thats why I ran. Both of us trained to run at the sight of vulnerability. Trained to be aware of every detail of someone else, hypersensitive in order to protect ourselves.

Ive confessed some level of this to you; an attraction. I wont ever say more than that. Ive been irresponsible already. Youre married. Weve discussed this. Nothing can ever happen between us. Youve never even said that youd want it to, but I would. Of course, people cross the line all the time, but I genuinely dont think we will. I dont want to end your marriage, and I know you dont either. You are happy, and I want you to be happy. I want to tell you so much more about how Im feeling and how special I think you are, but it wouldnt do any good. It might boost your ego but could also be really damaging. Im trying so hard to be responsible but my heart feels like its exploding when were together. Ive had crushes before, but this feels different. Im happy just to be around you. Im miserable when Im not, but its at the point where that sort of amuses me now. I had to accept the situation for what it is, or I would have gone completely mad. I already feel a little bit mad. My biggest hope is that we come out of this with a proper friendship. I know I will get over these feelings even though right now it feels like I never will. If I can push through this and do no further harm then maybe that will be possible, if thats what you want. Thank you for not taking advantage of my vulnerability and for being a good father and husband. Ill finish with this, which I have drafted so many times at the end of my playful messages to you, just to get it out, even though I would never ever send it: Also, I love you."

You are perfect where someone like me needs you to be and I'm constantly reminding myself that even when the world feels like it's out to get me you truly aren't. It's been nearly two years and I didn't know those two years could feel like a lifetime and a few weeks at the same time. I love every memory we have made together and the not-so-good ones we managed to work through. I trust you with everything and I swear to God that's true. It doesn't always feel that way because I know what I do and what I say are all defense mechanisms. But when it comes to you what am I defending myself from? You? You're like home and you're safe and that terrifies me in no way I could easily put into words. I'm hurting and I'm scared that's hurting you too. I know I ask every few months like clockwork if deep down you are truly happy and not intimidated but you're so comforting in your responses. I don't want to ruin how incredible and pure your character is, you put on a show and complain but in the end you'd do anything for someone you love and I still have to remind myself that I get to be a part of that. We're similar in a way that we both suck at expressing how we feel but that song you wrote to me made me cry, cos I understood. You're struggling too and I couldn't be there for you in the way I wished I could. We're lucky enough to be able to take the next step in our relationship and I'm terrified to say the least but I'm so excited? We're a dynamic team but I feel like I'm the weaker link sometimes. (Let me stress that it isn't you, it's on me and my own mind.) I have so much to work through and I know you're patient enough to work it out with me but that's a dangerous job and I'm not willing for you to take collateral. It's like I'm fighting within myself trying to keep my anxiety attacks from making me think or act a certain way I know what's right but it's like I don't have the confidence all the time to completely dismiss these thoughts as anxiety driven with no real rationale behind them. Don't get me wrong I know you, I really do but the part of me always trying to protect myself from vulnerability rejects this and I'm back at square one. I know it's my depression that reverts me to this mindset and by God am I working through it, but old habits really do die hard. I know I have brought this up in the past and you don't completely understand cos mental illness was so absent in your life prior to me entering it and all of a sudden you're learning about all these disorders first hand. I have no delusions on how long it will take, I know complex trauma is incredibly hard to process and move forward from. I find comfort in the fact that even though, at the time you only knew me for six months you knew you wanted in for the long run. Your words not mine and I'll never forget them, so thank you. Thing is, I do not want to become a job or chore. Dealing with people with mental illness is really hard. You want to be there for them moreso than they often are themselves and I know you'd be that kind of person. I've been in that position and it's crushing. Anyway, you may never read this but the chance that I do show you I know you'll absorb every damn word even though you really hate reading. I love that about you. For you I'm figuring this thing out, and I think I love myself enough now to do it for me too."

It took you 27 years to reach out and say sorry for everything... ...that your apology is long overdue... ...that you had been looking for me to personally say sorry... ...that you hope I can forgive you... I stared at your letter, thinking this is my time to get back at you. To lash out and finally purge all the pain and the deep hatred I have for you. I wanted to tell you I've been praying that someone bullies you, too, or one of your own...so you'll know, you'll finally know how I felt all those years you were making my life a living hell in high school.

I don't know if you're sincere and truly sorry for what you've done. All I know is that I don't want you to talk about me to your friends - your little minions, my other tormentors. I was scared that you'll show them my reply, and you will all have a good laugh. Just the thought of you thinking of me when you were writing that letter made me angry. 27 years... 27 years and you still have the power to make me feel insecure. And I hated you all the more for that. Do you know what you've stolen from me? My friends. My confidence in myself. My self-esteem. My ability to feel comfortable around people. I was always a shy child who's afraid of making friends. I was the kid who'd rather stay home and read books. So the small circle of friends that I had, I wanted to keep. But when you started bullying me, I lost all of them. They didn't want to be associated with me and become your next target. You took away my friends and my confidence in making new ones. News of your bullying even reached some of our teachers. And you know what they did? Nothing. One of them even joined in on the fun. Do you remember that? I do. She made you and all our classmates laugh. Oh how I hated her that time! And how I hated you. But I hated myself more. Because it was my fault, right? It's always our fault why bullies pick us. You left me friendless. I had no one. And no one wanted to be my friend. And you loved how that made me even more vulnerable. With no one to help me, you became even more powerful. And your friends would laugh! Oh how you loved making them laugh at me! The more you made them laugh, the harsher your ""jokes"" became. ...and the harder I prayed that I don't wake up. You took away my self-esteem. You are a big factor why I hate large crowds, why I feel anxious when I'm surrounded by people. You made me feel so low that I doubted myself... ...that I will never be good enough... ...that I don't matter. You extinguished any confidence I had in myself then. It took me years to start loving myself again, to gain the confidence I had lost. And then I received your message. I showed your message to a good friend. I needed someone to stop me from doing something I'll probably regret. Because you see, your message opened up the floodgates. It pushed to the front everything I've tried so hard to forget. You took me back to when I was 14. And all the pain and all the anger and all the helplessness came crashing back I felt like drowning in them. I wanted to hurt you back. Say the meanest things I could say so I can break you like you broke me. Make you cry like I cried. Push you to your knees. And post our story, your face, your name, your message online for all the world to see. Then sit back and watch as thousands of nameless and faceless strangers find you... ...and bully you so hard you'll think death is kinder, like I did 27 years ago. It could have been my vengeance. Something I long wanted to do to you. But it would have also been my greatest sin. So I needed someone to keep me grounded, someone who'll stop me from becoming you. He said either forgive him or ignore your message and let the issue go. But bullying isn't something you can easily forget, forgive, or recover from just because years have passed. Bullying scars you. These scars shape a part of who you are. And for 27 years I have been carrying the scars you have created. My bully... It's funny how the bullied calls people like you ""my bully."" It's too personal, too intimate. People like you are predators. You hunt the weak and the vulnerable. And you relish in their pain and despair. Can I forgive you? No. I don't think I can. So why did I still bother to write this after two years of letting your message fester in my inbox like an infection? Because I want to get it off my chest. A release, even if it's just a small one. I want you to carry and own what you did...as I have carried it for years. "
524,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,"To you, M.",2,auna7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/auna7w/to_you_m/,2019-02-26 03:46:35,"To you, M. For I am certain you will never ever see or hear these words that I am about to say. &amp;#x200B; We found each other as toddlers no less than around 3 years old, and to me you were a strange and very different girl from all the rest, but nonetheless I befriended you as the first girl I would be friends with for a long time. We grew up yet apart from one another but we still managed to see ourselves almost every year. I would eagerly anticipate the next time I saw you and you would the same for years to come. Despite having so many peers grow up with me, you stood out the most even though you were never really besides me. &amp;#x200B; We found the internet after a while, and our contact together only grew further as I discovered more about you. I was living a fairly normal teenage experience and I only hoped you would have gone through the same. I sat through many of your troubled issues in school and in house, sometimes wishing I was there personally to help you even more in your time of need, but distance didn't allow that. You went through phases of psychological stress that almost pushed you past the breaking point, and sometimes I wonder how I'm able to stop any of it, or if I had any effect in the first place. There were some things I never really and truly understood about you then, but out of the bad times you came through somehow, and told me you were glad to have me there. &amp;#x200B; In your call for help I found a desire to help you get back on your own feet, to help you find love and appreciation within yourself that you were so struggling to fill on your own. I started caring for you more, trying to fill that void for you. The feeling was so unknown to me I could have not ever imagined the thought of you being hurt. &amp;#x200B; In the limited amount of time we had together, no matter the distance, we would call one another for hours to share stories and experiences, watch anime, play games and music together and join the silliest roleplay groups acting as couples. Roleplay especially; silly it was but it was a fun and different experience to what I'm used to doing. Despite that many of our interests aligned with one another and we would go on for hours about our own things. Ultimately if it kept you happy though, I would have done it either way. &amp;#x200B; Eventually a time had come when I would be able to move to you, I would be able to come by and help set things straight as my old youthful self would want to believe so highly. By now we were already very close, as I considered you more than my best friend. Others would see us and would honestly assume we were a couple, doing things only people who really liked one another would do. We mutually agreed that we liked one another too, and I still remember you telling me this as I asked for you to ""wait till I was there"". &amp;#x200B; As I look back on it now, I might say that I took your time for granted, that I didn't appreciate you and show you enough care and affection that I could give at the time. And what was it to blame, we were still very young and youthful, but I thought of the future and the possibilities to come if we had gone further. We each had conservative parents, and behind the pretty figure of my best friend is a girl who's vulnerability knows no bounds. I just didn't want to exploit that vulnerability to my own ends, I didn't want to exploit you for my own needs. So I drew my boundaries until you were in a position where you capable of loving yourself no matter how long it took. &amp;#x200B; Our time together was short-lived however, the decision was made to move again despite my protests. It was evidence to me that I shouldn't need to go any further than I have with you in the fear of hurting you even more. We were never officially a couple, but doing night walks down the street, holding hands, gazing at the starry sky and giving each other cheek and forehead kisses was more than enough proof of an innocent but genuine and youthful love that existed in the moment. I feared any more would eventually hurt you in the end, so I remained on that boundary. &amp;#x200B; When I broke the news, you ran. You cried in your room as I desperately tried to console you, tried to assure you that I was not disappearing entirely. You cried about everything you wanted in your life having to go eventually, and I asked. &amp;#x200B; ""I wanted you."" The only words that would haunt me to this very day. &amp;#x200B; I should've been honest with you, I should've told you the reasons why we were moving, I should've told you how I cared too much for you to not do anything, I should've told you everything. But at the same time I didn't. It wasn't right for me to tell you at the time. &amp;#x200B; It was a farewell without calm, for as the months passed we drifted. We would still talk to one another, but in our minds we knew it wouldn't be the same. Eventually I caught wind of you finding someone else to be with, and I wished you all the best. After a while, you simply disappeared. You didn't respond to me anymore, and you cut off all contact with me. &amp;#x200B; In your absence my heart ached, ached for the loss of someone I knew for almost my whole life, for someone I've can't say I've ""loved"" for half of my life, but ""felt feelings for"" for half of my life . But in your absence, I was able to realize some things about myself as a person and I am still continuing to discover and improve myself even more, even if it took a while to get over you. &amp;#x200B; I thought it was all over up until you responded 2 years later, half a year ago. You apologized for your absence, and wanted to reconnect again. I did, albeit 3 months late but we managed to click like normal, at least initially. &amp;#x200B; You told me of the boyfriend that left you in a toxic and abusive relationship for the 2 years you were gone, and it hurt me that he absolutely crushed any self-esteem you had before it was too late. It hurt me that he had thrown away what you tried so hard to build and achieve, but you insist that it was ""necessary for growth"". You stayed in the long run to try and achieve progress, to see if the relationship will change, only to leave you in an even more emotional distress. You tell me that you're okay, picking up your pieces and trying to get it back together again, but somehow I doubt that you really say otherwise. &amp;#x200B; I wanted to help you again, but it was different this time. We were old enough to understand, old enough to know. For I understood that nobody could help you unless you helped yourself back on your feet from the ground up. You became a different person in the process and so have I too. In that same process though, you seemed to disregard anything about our past experience entirely. I wanted to know more about the new person you've become but any attempt of talking to you never amounts to anything nowadays. You're so busy and caught up in your new life you're trying to build that it doesn't include me in it. You're moving ahead and I'm being left behind. &amp;#x200B; Even if we were close, I don't want to say that we are still close now despite you labeling me as one. You're still struggling with your demons day by day in silence by yourself while I stand on the sidelines as nothing more than just a past memory. You don't tell me of your own problems anymore and I respect your decision, but sometimes seeing you struggle hurts me too, and the silence makes me even doubt if I was ever really considered a close friend to you in the first place, or if whatever I did years ago actually had any positive effect on you to begin with. You talk about the people that have made such an impact in your life, and I'm not one of them. &amp;#x200B; At this point I want to say that I still ""love"" you, but I would rather say that ""I still think about you and care for you"". Even now, I'm not asking you to return the sentiment, I'm asking you to take care of yourself. For I cannot watch on any longer. Despite how much I miss you, you don't seem to miss me anymore, and that's not any of your fault, because you have the right to choose who you want to interact with. At first I thought you were simply busy, but now you don't respond to anything I say. &amp;#x200B; Were we really close to begin with? Was I just someone you used to make you feel better about yourself? Did I ever really manage to help you out of your own problems? I can only assume with the silence you've given me, but what else am I to do if that's all there is? &amp;#x200B; Regardless, there's no point talking about it now. I don't hate you, in fact I still care about you just as much. Selfishly I wish you would just open up more about yourself, and talk to me just as you used to. To do the things we used to do. But that an entirely separate dream that would never ever come true. &amp;#x200B; I can't force you to do any of that now. We're both different people, for better or worse. &amp;#x200B; I really do wish you all the best though, for your own health and your own life ahead of you. I really hope you're able to overcome the shadows of your past and find enlightenment. I really hope you're able to find someone that would treat you better than what you've had to deal with. You may not have found friends that didn't appreciate you before, but you do now, and they're more than enough that I don't need to intervene. That I shouldn't need to intervene. &amp;#x200B; You've moved onwards from me, and I realize that I need to as well. For good. &amp;#x200B; Please take care of yourself. Please. &amp;#x200B; For this is a farewell from a past memory that I am certain you will never see. "
525,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,We're not friends.,3,av1ak2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/av1ak2/were_not_friends/,2019-02-27 03:25:44,"I put up with so much of your bullshit. Constantly interrupting me to the point where I feel the need to speak faster to finish a thought. Blatant racism. (Black people are lazy, but there are exceptions?) How every topic seems to circle back to how awesome you are. The fact that you're a cheap piece of shit and I've paid for 100% of our outings because you never offered, and even felt justified in not doing so because I always end up volunteering. Well no shit. Who else is going to pay if there's just the two of us? Unless I had a vagina, though, right? Then you pay for *everything* because girls. At the heart of it, I always thought you were a good guy. Someone that would be a good friend maybe a few years down the line. I finally get it now, though. You don't exist. There's nothing behind your annoying habits outside of what upper management tells you to be. What makes you a good employee makes you a shitty person, and you can't take a single action without someone telling you to do so. No wonder they like you so much. You're nothing but a tool, and you don't even know it. When I confided in you during my moment of extreme pain and vulnerability, you said I was overreacting and compared my feelings for a co-worker to one of your infantile workplace crushes. You did this because you lacked the emotional maturity to understand that genuine affection for the opposite sex exists outside of romance and familial obligations. When people told me you were immature, I defended you as a good guy because I really thought so. That your childish nature shouldn't be counted against your value as a person, but all that got me was disappointment and being looked upon as equally immature by the rest of the office. Why else would we be spending so much time together were we not the same? Nevermind that I mostly just deal with your nonsense while gently suggesting better ways to go about being a person, or forgive you countless times for being insufferable because really, (and I now fully understand this) I'm just that nice of a guy. Too nice to the point of being shitty to myself. I even overlooked all those moments where you talked real big about people you didn't like in the office, then became super accommodating when they were around. When I looked at you in those moments, you claimed it was, ""professional courtesy"", when now I know it was just you being a bitch. Then I left that job for very good reasons. I thought you would speak on my behalf since you knew the story, but now I'm sure you said nothing. Management instructed everyone in the office to cease all communications with me and you just followed along. What a good little worker you are. How good at following instructions. But you know, for all the times you called me friend, and for every one of your shitty actions, words and behavior I've had to put up with for the better part of a year-- you made the wrong choice. You wondered aloud once why no one wants to hang out with you, save for me of course. This is why. Because you're not worth keeping around. So no. We're not friends. You don't even know what that word means. It took me forever to realize this, and I was patient to the point of hurting myself. Talk about betting on the wrong horse. I was going to hope you never change, always being the shallow and unpleasant shell of a person you are as some sort of punishment for being this way. But instead, I think I'll simply hope to forget you were ever in my life in the first place. In a world where overwhelming kindness is often synonymous for weakness, I can't remember a bigger waste of my time. "
526,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,To his next fiancee,2,av6icp,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/av6icp/to_his_next_fiancee/,2019-02-27 11:01:59,"I know he probably hasn't popped the question to you yet, but he will. My guess is that he's going to ask you when his demons, the ones from what he did to me, start to really bother him. He will NOT want to be thinking about me again, once the infatuation that is you, begins to wear off. He'll give a stronger push in your direction, because he will know that he has caused irreparable damage to what he only wanted to control.... Not kill. You don't know what he did to me, I know. You think I'm the devil. One day you will wonder, though. You will wonder how it *really* went down. He is using you, of course. He was originally using you to get at me. He wanted me to cry, and beg, and want him back, just so he could say no, and feel justified. I have *a little* bit more dignity than that, however, which foiled his plans all up. So now he's using you to give him those affirmations alone. And to look like you are the sad puppy dog that he's rescued. He's rescued you and your children from an abusive father. He was SO excited to tell me that your husband is in Federal prison! You should have seen his face light up when he explained that ""and these kids don't *have* a Dad!"" As if that was a huge selling point for dating you. Oh brother. Sometimes I wonder if you know that he's still in love with me... Or whatever version of that feeling he is actually capable. Most days, I don't really care. I will tell you that, once upon a time, he really was a good man. Maybe he still is. But he is broken. Not because of me, but because he allows his actions to be ruled by fear, and instead tries to control others actions and emotions, in order to fill the void left by his cowardice. I know why he chose you. It's the same sad reason that he chose me. He handpicked you for your vulnerability. You need him to pick up the pieces of your life, that, in reality, only you can pick up. But so long as you think you need him, you give him 2 things that his demons need. 1) you give him status and validation, by appearing weaker than him, so that he can appear strong by comparison. It feeds his hero complex to have not just you, but *others* view him as the kind of man who takes care a woman with so much baggage. 2) you won't leave him if you think you need him. From what little I know of you, I can reasonably suspect that you may have a drinking problem.... I'm not one to assign diagnoses, but I've seen the booze that was in my kid's childhood home, both when he was courting you, while ""working on things"" with me, and when I was finally able to get him to leave for their sake.... That, and I was an active alcoholic when I met him... You have *virtually everything else* (your age, the number, age, and gender, of children you have; I've never seen you, but probably looks, by his description; NOT personality though, haha, you are my complete *opposite* he says ) in common with the me that he met. So it would stand to reason that you like your booze a bit much also. If that is true, I will give you this little nugget of advice: if you are indeed an addict, and you ever plan to get healthy, make the plan to do so *without* him. Know that you will lose him slowly, because he will try his best to stay, to sabotage you, to regain the control he once had over you. He will hang on as long as he can, and when he comes to the realization that he cannot control you any longer, he will wreck you with anything he has at his disposal. When he runs out of pliable resources, he will use your children. He will manipulate them, *and you,* so expertly, that you won't even know that it happened until way after he's done. He is so very intelligent. All of the people around you won't see it, save a few that are close enough to know. Everyone else will believe him a saint, even though he will slip up, and make himself look bad, now and again. When he does this, make sure to get any evidence you can and record it, save it, screenshot it and put in on a cloud. Do it right away. You will need it. I've got mine, if you ever care to see it. Good luck. I'd say I feel badly for you, but I know what kind of life decisions you've made to get here, because I made them too. All I can say is, it's not too late to change. You can do better. I wish you the best in life."

I dont need you to spark that. Heres some honesty. I just want to share myself with you. Will you open up and let me see the layers of a guarded man? Whatever that means in whatever capacity? Will you reach out to me if you ever feel the same so we dont have to play this cat and mouse game? Were adults, sort of, well you are, Ill stay young forever and I love that about myself, but Im pretty guarded myself and just want to be utterly vulnerable and I think we both know why I feel like I want that vulnerability to be with you. The notion of you to me is safety. I have nothing to base this on, except to say I just know. Weird with the circumstances but I understand things because you have a heart like mine. But if you feel this tug maybe we should not ignore it because for me this is new, unmarked territory, it may be rare. The idea that I feel something so deeply that doesnt quite make total sense and that I cannot act on it is maddening sometimes when I want to nourish this seed, water it, and let it grow. If you dont feel a strange tug, just let me know, and Ill find another watering pot in time and learn to let this idea go. To everyone I may seem crazy, and that is true, or maybe Im just crazy about you? Riddle me this riddle me that, riddles are fun until theyre not. Will you come or will you go? Or is this tug one-way simply an idea stemming from a low? I dont know but I want to see, what does the future have in store for me? There are many out there, options galore, but my spirit wants what it wants and Im not too stupid to ignore. Will you be stubborn or will you be free to explore my uncharted feelings with me? It isnt fair, its sort of cruel, to know Im basically begging for you. But thats ok I feel no shame because pride can be a foolish mans game. "

I stopped being as supportive for you, and I was too wrapped up in my own issues to realize how controlling and impulsive I was becoming. The worst part of it all is that I didnt realize how much it was hurting you. I didnt realize that my struggles with mental heath no longer affected me alone. I was becoming increasingly more toxic as a person, unfair, and ungrateful for everything you were going through. I lost sight of what it meant to be to be in a relationship, and you were left to suffer alone because you couldnt talk to the one person who shouldve always been there for you. I tried to go to therapy for my issues. To at least be able to talk to somebody that could help. But it didnt work out with my therapist. I felt like I was lying to her to get her to feel like I was doing better and I didnt want to do that. I wanted to have real improvement. So I went to talk to my parents, and they said they would help me, but they didnt; and being only 19 and completely reliant on my parents, I didnt know what I could do. This was when we fell out. I didnt know what to do. All I could think about was how much I was hurting, and I still wasnt thinking about you. That was wrong. It wasnt until the end of our break that you came to see me for the first time in two weeks and we decided to talk things through that I finally realized what I was doing. We set boundaries, and we decided to fix what was wrong in our relationship. Together. I started to improve my behavior, and I started to improve my mental health. I was showering every day and eating every day again. I was spending time with friends and I was happier. We were happier. But I forgot that improvement requires consistency, and the little steps I had made in bettering my mental health made me feel like I didnt have to actively work on it anymore. That was my mistake. I started acting more toxic again. Acting more controlling. I started to become paranoid about our relationship when I had no reason to be, and the overwhelming fear of losing you consumed me. As controlling and manipulative as I had become, I felt more helpless and out of control than ever. Now, here we are. You told me two days ago how you felt, and unloaded everything you had been keeping from me for the last month and a half. How you felt restricted. How you didnt tell me about things you had issues with in our relationship in fear of me getting upset. How I would get sad when you did tell me, and you would start questioning why you even told me. How you just wanted to rant, but then I would get upset with you and you would end up comforting me instead. You told me you felt gaslighted. That my behavior was abusive and manipulative. And I just cracked. All of my progress, everything I thought I was doing better for myself and for our relationship, had gone to waste. I had allowed myself to become complacent in my improvement and I regressed as a result. I tried to fix things. I tried to tell you that I wasnt upset about the things you had been keeping from me, because I was keeping things from you too to avoid stressing you out. Like my self-destructive thoughts, and the content of my nightmares. How, in times of vulnerability, I still thought about how much better off everyone would be if I wasnt here. Im ashamed that in my panic, I said some things I regret. And the exact thing I feared would happen, did. You told me that its not about you anymore, or even us. It was about me and my problems and how they keep causing issues in our relationship. You told me that I needed to get help, and that you didnt care if I didnt talk to you for a month if it meant I would just focus on myself and fix my issues; meanwhile, youd just talk to and rely on your friends instead. You told me, maybe we should just take a break. That was when I realized. Its unfortunate when only the worst outcomes can be enough of a wake up call. I begged you to stay. To please, please stay. That I would get better. That I would talk to my parents, and finally get them to help me get the mental help that I needed. I promised that I would keep working, and that I wouldnt be complacent anymore. You sighed, and wearily said okay, but I could hear the tiredness in your voice. You said that we would stay together if I started working on my issues and improving. You said that you loved me, and that it was getting late, and that you hoped I had a good night. That was two days ago. Yesterday, I talked to my parents, and I got their assurance that they would truly help me. That we would find somebody and try to make an appointment on Monday when the offices opened. I went to the gym for the first time in months too, and I worked myself to the bone with some friends. I talked to friends and relied on them. It made me feel a lot better. Im starting my journey to self-improvement again. Im determined to not allow myself to get complacent. But we havent talked at all, and I know you need your space. I just wish you could see how hard Im trying, how determined I am to get better for myself and for us. But I also know that things cant be fixed overnight. To have a happy and healthy relationship, you need to first be a happy and healthy person. I realize that now. I will go to therapy, get my medication, and fix my issues. I will improve, and I am determined not to regress again. I am going to be a kinder, more understanding, and more emotionally stable person. I will get the help I need. Once I do that, Im hoping we can finally sit down and talk about our relationship. Im hoping that we can sit down as adults and as equals, and constructively discuss what our problems are and how we will improve upon them. I just hope well be able to last long enough to get to that point. So Im sorry. I really am. Im sorry I let everything come to this. I love you."

What are you doing?"" Such were the internal gut feelings that spawned in me weeks before our final 'hello'. Yet when the time arrived I stood there, weeping with the glory of reunion, paralyzed in your embrace. A sense of complete serenity, calm, pure silence stood before me. I was among the gaze of the cosmos as I lent myself to complete vulnerability. And I realized, after thinking about it for so long, beating myself up. That the whole time I was fanning the flames at the foot of a rotten bridge. My heart took my eyesight and I chose to ignore the messages filtering through my ears. It was yet another near-life experience. I wish you the best, I know you're capable of it and deserve it. And I hope you dont think I hold any malice against you. I just have no desire to see you again because I can't take losing everything one more time."

When I was in my twenties, my person died. We never got to get married and have the family we planned to. I married someone who acted like he loathed me. At least he was alive. I eventually got away. I wanted so badly for somebody to see me and think I was lovable. Ive had an interesting life. I wouldnt take it back, any of it. Because of what Ive lived through, I dont tend to take people for granted. Im not afraid of being alone anymore. I dont even remember what that feels like. I learned to love myself. So I was quite happy when we met. You saw me. Id forgotten how badly I wanted someone to see me. You wanted to kiss my face and hold me. You were going to hold my hand. We were going to explore each other every way we could. We had emotional intimacy and honesty I dont think Ive ever had before. You made me feel safe. I fell in love with you. I felt how you loved me. Its the only way I was able to love you. Now youve abruptly left my life because life is messy. Were not even able to be friends now. You know how I said I wouldnt settle? You know how I said Id rather be alone than be with the wrong person? *Youre* why Im alone. What we felt is why Im alone. Out of 8 billion people there has got to be somebody who wants it to be like that, who wants to be in my life every day, and who isnt permanently tethered to someone else. Somebody who wants to be held and kissed in the forehead. Somebody who wants intimacy and vulnerability and backscratches and reciprocity. Somebody else Im sympatico with. That was real, what we felt. It would have been sustainable had your unfinished business been resolved. Such is life. But what we had for a moment? *I want that.* If its not that, I wont fuck with it. So Ill wait. Ill wait until Im 80. Let me make it clear that Im not going to wait for your kids to move out and your wife to leave you. I actually told myself Id do that. You didnt have the strength to break it off in a way that showed any respect for love or friendship. I genuinely hope the two of you can find each other. Thanks for letting me see that Im not crazy. You showed me that I was right about love. Thank you for loving me like thateven if you had to be shitty at the end. You also showed me that I deserve better. Next time Im not settling. Whenever theres a next time, I deserve love that will last."

Life has been busy, as you know, and the letters I would write for you were crafted immediately after we spent time together and it added to the overwhelming love I already have for you. The letters were written in front of you and I would always urge you not to read them until we parted ways, although you have read some in front of me. This one is just an apology for not writing you a letter within the past two months or so. We hadnt seen each other since the last letter I wrote and you ignored the messages I sent you before you found out that I was involved with someone who gave me the undivided attention and emotional vulnerability I desired. I was hoping that you would know that nobody could replace you, but you didnt and you got upset with me and suggested that we part ways. I didnt realize how bad your depression was, but last night you vaguely told me everything I needed to know about how to support you, but only in a way that didnt make it seem like you were asking for support or help, of course. I know you like to be alone. I know you dont like to feed into hypothetical ideas of our future, together. I know you like to keep me guessing. I know you dont like when I find the truth in your ambiguity. I know you love me. I know you dont like how strongly I love you. I also know that one day youll thank me for being strongly in love with you, and smart, and more dedicated to your happiness than you used to be. youll thank me for the subtlety I omitted, for the sake of one of your leading insecurities. Youll thank me for hearing your plea for intervention in your constant lie (im fine) and request for consistency in the way I regard you, especially after sharing your truth with me. Ill write you more letters to remind you of how intelligent you are and how loved you are. I hope the letters I write will finally convince you that I fully understand you- the good head you have on your shoulders, in combination with the full, irregularly beating heart you have... and, I doubt this would happen but, if you find this one day, I hope you thank me for not sending you this letter and for being intelligent enough to know that the person you are now would be upset with me if I did. The person you are now would tell me I was crazy and say everything possible to keep me away from their thoughts. The person you are now is still heartbroken and is entirely reluctant to giving another person power over your heart and mind. One day, the person you are now will be able to handle this letter. One day, I might even consider using it as our vows, or giving it to you the morning of our wedding day. Well see... Love, yours (unconditionally)"

I know people have their reasons for doing things and you are no exception. I know you have your own side of the story - I may not be able to wrap my mind around it, but that doesn't invalidate the perspective through which you experienced all of this. I know you don't set out to hurt people or get enjoyment out of causing pain. We're all doing the best we can in this life. But those are reasons, not excuses or an offer of absolution. You are incredibly selfish, reckless, and thoughtless; you treat life as if you are the lead character in a rom com. If you really were doing the best you could in the time we spent together, you and I hold ourselves to very different standards. My lasting impression of you is that you are a weak, self-pitying coward who runs away from responsibility. You didn't even have the balls to tell me everything - I had the pleasure of finding out independently months after the fact that you cheated on me and dumped me for the girl you hid and lied about for months. I hope nothing like that ever happens to you, because you've proven to be such a helpless and scared little baby that I know you wouldn't be able to handle it. And so. You fucked up and now the party's over. You're being forced to face the music for the first time, so now you suddenly care and feel bad about what you did. It's so transparent and so beyond too late I have to just laugh. I may not be fully moved on from this, but I'm not far off. I've vowed to put this dumpster fire behind me and to reserve my love and vulnerability for people who earn it. My heart is only for people who will handle it with care; people who will treat it as a responsibility and a privilege. There's nothing left to salvage between us - the bits and pieces where you actually made me truly happy are fuzzy at best, and all that's left surrounding them is a barren desert where nothing can grow. You don't get a do over, and I'm floored at the lack of self awareness it takes for you to think you deserve one. You made enough repeated hurtful decisions in our time together that this is just who you are to me. I don't think any conversation or efforts would ever be able to undo that damage. You and I don't have a future together as anything but strangers. And so I'm sure you can understand my request for you to quit bothering me. Let me leave this where it belongs - in the past, as a distant and unpleasant memory. I do not look back on you with fondness and I never will. You earned that and it sits with you for life - you don't get to wish away your guilt or erase your checkered history. And if your destructive choices lead you to an undesirable place, you certainly don't get to blame anyone but yourself. Your future might belong to a wonderful woman with whom you can start fresh and baggage-free, if you allow it to be so by finally facing the reality of your actions and dealing with it head on. You have a lot of work to do (to be fair, everyone does). Until you do that work, though, you're just going to keep kindling this fire that burns people you claim to care about. Leaving a body count in your wake also leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth. So learn from this and stop collecting bodies. Do better with the next person. I know I will. From me"
538,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,I guess I wish I hadn't tried,7,az148i,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/az148i/i_guess_i_wish_i_hadnt_tried/,2019-03-09 18:46:41,"I haven't done or experienced anything really amazing/significant since a year ago. Transitions are hard for me, in general, but this one was really hard. Graduating without a job, without a girlfriend, without a conviction in career path or confidence in being able to live myself was rough. Having gone through the past nine months with all of these problems still there has been rough too. I said I'd take a gap year and it turned to shit. I'm with a pair of good friends who are really good people, but I am still somehow unable to be so truly happy. I don't really know how or why, but I always end up looking in the past. Its being more muted now, which is great. I used to just despair and do nothing, now I just sort of be lifeless and do nothing. You know its really sad. I shouldn't have done what I did. I didn't know. Nobody ever warned me that the way I formed emotional attachments was, well, wrong. But I always thought that I could make it work. You know recently I found out about this thing called giftedness. Some individuals have it, and are overexcitable and/or highly sensitive. I'm pretty sure, like 80%, that I am highly sensitive or overexcitable. I don't really know which overexcitabilities are mine, but probably the sensual, intellectual, imaginational, and emotional. I might also have psychomotor but its possible I don't. Maybe I just talk too much. I don't really know anymore. I kind of have lost the zest or zeal for life. Not that I crave death. I don't. I'm afraid of death and dying. I'm afraid of suicide. I think I am experiencing a mild depression. I'm writing this because I can't explain this to anyone else. I'll tell my parents and my brother. But you don't understand. I truly believed that my future happiness lasted with you. And now I can't do anything but resent you. I envy you, I'm jealous of you, and intimidated by you. Everytime you're in my presence, I feel like I perform some sort of fucking character. I emotionally attached to you when we weren't even friends. Not only do I hate you for not being as emotionally invested in me as I was in you, but I really resent the fact that you were independent, self-reliant, and making the most of your single experience. I am jealous of the fact you have worked at amazing prestigious companies every summer. I am jealous of the fact you moved to the West Coast and made friends and had fun and enjoyed yourself during the summers while you interned. I am jealous of the fact you biked 30 miles in a single trip during that summer. I am jealous of the fact you joined a student organization only to see it through to its finality. I'm jealous of all that you have done or experienced - particularly your boldness, your ability to make the most of your experience, your choice to enjoy as best as you can, and how your past College experience was not dependent on me. You don't understand anything. Its not your fault of course. It was my fault. I forget the difference between my imaginary world and reality. I am abnormal. And I don't know how to make the most of it. You know, my mother, god bless her, says to me, ""Don't worry about it. Enjoy your single life. It only comes once."" My mother is probably right about this. I want to be single free and happy too. Like, getting married at 28 seems the right age, which only gives 5 years of singledom. That's not a lot. I've already lost a year of it. You can't appear in my life again for a few years. Its just not possible. I can't realistically do it. I need to be able to be single, free, and happy. Comfortable in my life &amp; lifestyle. I'd say I hate you except that is stupid. You didn't do anything wrong. I just had an unrealistic fantasy and made the mistake of trying to bring it to reality. I was really, and still am, lucky. I'm actually very grateful for that. But I do wish one thing. I wish I had known about this OE and HS tendency earlier. Because if I had, I think I would have understood how much different life is for me. And how differently I have to attack it, I have to modulate myself and my environment to make sure my own physical, mental, emotional, and social health are strong. I don't hold any real anger towards you anymore. You didn't do anything wrong. I did. My only defense is that I didn't understand who I really was. Life seems to have lost a lot of its color/energy/excitement. Like, I can't seem to lose myself into the fullness of a tasty meal. All I want is a sort of emotional 'high' to feel that amazement again. I've lost confidence in myself and my family is suffering for it. And the fact you aren't here sharing my pain, my vulnerability hurts a lot. Because I attached to you and thought, mistakenly, you would reciprocate. The realization that we are all truly alone is pretty hard to swallow. What's harder to swallow is that I have to constantly put the effort to articulate what I want as opposed to just expecting it naturally. The emotional labor is really hard for me to do by myself, but maybe it is best. I don't know anymore. I kind of wish, now, that I hadn't attached to you. Not because you aren't worth it - you are. You're highly intelligent, creatively funny, gorgeously pretty, and really nice/sweet. You're also quite independent, intimidatingly bold, and enviously remarkably good at moving on. That ability of yours, to let go and move on, almost instantly, is pretty amazing, I don't have it yet, and I don't even know if I want to have it, but it is really powerful. &amp;#x200B; I think I am just going to care less. Not about myself. Honestly, I probably should care for myself, far, far, far more. Try and experience the things I want to do. But I think I am just going to care less now. It hurts too much. To see you and compare my past and present selves to you. To look and envy and then look and reduce. It is as if my own self-reduction has been the consequence of my self-imprinting upon you. &amp;#x200B; I think I am much better in that I am able to make life go on. I don't need you to be happy/free. I can be a little less extreme and more at peace. Maybe that is the right path for me. I don't really know. I'm just so tired of feeling the need to prove myself to your eyes, albeit knowing you didn't ask for it. I don't think you know this, but I attended all those hack@ events because I wanted to see you and I wanted you to see me. I bought two different types of shirts, designs I'd never buy on my own, because they seemed to fit your hipster style once. You clearly enjoy style/beauty/fashion/appearance. Its good, You look good, pretty much always. Its more far ranging than I expected, but good. I'm pretty simple. I don't operate like that. It's a really weird world, because I prefer the more traditional gender dynamics, but you aren't like that. Probably, honestly, for the best. I suspect I'll have to force myself to adapt to the newer ways of today. Perhaps it is the case that this isn't that bad. Maybe you're right. I mean, its not like we broke up. We weren't even a thing. We weren't even friends. You hardly know me, and everything I know about you is from educated speculation and stalking. &amp;#x200B; Everything has been changed for me. I'm lost in a fearful paralysis analysis because now I don't believe the result is worth the effort. Its not just laziness. Its as if I don't believe it is truly worth it. And seeing you go the other direction is just, well, even more disheartening. To accept on faith things will work out is hard, not because it requires faith, but because it requires you to work. I can accept that. What I can't accept anymore is any sense of self which is wholly, unilaterally bounden towards a single desire/goal. Because if that happens, I'm going to be fucked like I was before. Coming back to reality is okay. Its not bad to be normal. I just have to do my best to work with it, as per my desires, as per my nature. I can't afford to be the One Soulmate Romantic abstinent-before-marriage if I want to flirt more, enjoy fun/sexy times, party with hot, beautiful, pretty women. I can't afford to take that risk of working like a dog for 6 years for a position of political power if it means I don't experience real adventure or better myself athletically. To take the strides that count and light consistent gains where I can. Hopefully, I'll regain my former state of surrender to love of the moment, life of the present. That would be nice. I suspect for now its going to be held back for a while. I will say this though. I don't give a damn whether it takes me 10 months or 10 years, but I will, with sheer ruthless determination, dominate my bucket list as long as my health and finances permit me. I'm not saving up for a huge marriage or a huge house for you. Fuck that. I don't live in this world to match your expectations just as you don't live in this world to match mine. I'm done giving up so much for someone who didn't ask for it. I'm just so done with trying to do my best to be ideal/desirable/perfect for you. to you. You've been on my mind for over four years. It'll probably take me a few years to get you out of my present. It is what is. Que sera, sera. But this is my rejection or renouncation. I don't really mind living in fear in that sense. I know you might think I'm a coward, but I'm done caring what you think. I think I'm just so emotionally exhausted from trying for something that wasn't going to happen. &amp;#x200B; Knowing you and who you are, whoever you end up with will likely end up being and doing great things. You are simply too talented, too resilient, too consistent, and too self-aware otherwise - and you have a taste for interest. Peace out, I guess? Good luck, have fun, enjoy life gorgeous. I'm gonna focus on my bucket list and my health and finances. I'm done dreaming. Dreams aren't realities. That's why they are called dreams. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

As predicted, winter is back. I know I am supposed to try to stay positive in my posts but this is just getting annoying. Whenever they predict another big snowstorm or more subarctic temps, I whine its not fair, like there is someone out there who could do something about it. Of all the things in our lives that seem to be out of control, weather is the one that truly no one can control. So, I have to find a way to accept it. But, I am tired of being cold all the time and I am tired of the walls of snow everywhere. It is really getting me down. You know, I think it is odd that we never run into each other. We live fairly close and I am out in the community a fair amount. I am surprised I have never seen you at the store or the gas station, or the parks, or kids events. Are you hiding to avoid running into me? I wouldnt put it past you. Your reaction to everything was pretty extreme and over the top. I have been told that you are embarrassed by me. Why would you be embarrassed? If you truly believed you were in the right you would be indignant or combative, not embarrassed. I am sorry for being such an embarrassment. I know I say I dont look for you on this sub and I dont believe you are here but sometimes I do wish you were here reading what I post. I wish you would hear me and understand me. I wish you would value me as a person as much as I value you. But then I think back on some of the things Ive said and I am afraid of what you would think of me given the vulnerability I have expressed here. I worry that you would think I am crazy or weak or a drama queen. I really am not any of those things. I am usually calm, cool, rational, and collected. But, this all hurt me so badly and I wasnt equipped to deal with it. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. Ive had a hard time adjusting. And there is part of me that would be totally comfortable sharing the vulnerability with youthe part that trusted you before and believes you are a good, kind, and caring manand then there is a part of me that is terrified of letting you know any of this, letting you see any weakness, because of the things you did. So, I feel very conflicted most of the time. And sometimes I worry that you really are a lot like me and that all of this left you feeling unsettled, too, that the lack of closure has kept you thinking and worrying about me and what happened. I have actually made an effort to post only happy, positive things on my public social media in case you ever check it. I want you to think I am doing fine so you dont worry. I really dont want you to suffer the way I have. I suspect it has been easier for you. You got to keep the group. Your life really did not change at all because of what happened. You just lost me and you didnt really want me to begin with. So, hopefully, you easily let everything go and moved on. We had some similarities in our personalities but I hope the differences made all of this easier for you. I will admit, though, that as much as I want you to be happy, it hurts knowing how easy I was to forget and leave behind. Nobody likes to be forgotten, especially by people they care about. I am frustrated because I am not singing well. My tone quality has been terrible lately. And, while I can still handle notes and rhythms with ease, I am finding words nearly impossible. I dont know what is wrong with my brain. It is all English so it shouldnt be hard. But, for some reason, when I am trying to add words to music, it is like a I am reading a Greek. It has me kind of worried. What if this never gets better? In the end, I guess I just feel like I am not good at anything anymore. I feel like I peaked a couple of years ago, around the time I met you, and it has been downhill ever since and the rest of my life will just be a decline. I wonder what you would tell me if I told you this. I always valued your perspective. I guess I will never know. "

Its a crushing in my soul, its a feeling of despair and hopelessness. You chose me on purpose you knew I wouldnt tell, you took complete advantage of my vulnerability and needing your help. It may have only been a brief moment in time for you, now that moment is forever with me. The atrocious act you committed, the words you said to me when you were done and the smile on your face are forever burned into my mind. You might think you got away with it, and maybe you did for now -just remember the truth is never far behind. You made me feel so ashamed, alone and very confused as to why and how someone would be so cruel. Maybe Im naive like someone told me, because I just dont understand. None of it makes sense, you were supposed to help me. You were supposed to be someone I could trust. Trust actually shouldnt even be a question in this circumstance. Instead you left me broken and devastated. You left me with an unspeakable sadness. You caused me to loose weight, have high blood pressure, cry all the time, have sleepless nights and unrelenting gut wrenching nausea and a fear that I cant explain. And the fear of running into you in public. I can only pray that doesnt happen. Your actions caused me to be terrified, utterly humiliated and panic around people I knew I could trust, (they arent anything like you, they would never hurt me). I want you to know you didnt take away my sparkle, you may have tried but I wont let you steal that from me. Although you left me shattered, Im going to pick up all the pieces and put myself back together. I am stronger than you thought. I have something you lack, its called empathy, human compassion, and a heart. With each day that passes I can feel my heart healing from all the emotional pain you left me with. I know I will make it through. They say time heals. Plus I know forgiveness is a powerful thing. "

But every time I was able to touch you I tried to impart the deep human love I have for you. I concentrated on an absolute, tender presence and awareness. You made me realize how connective and romantic sex can be. The revelation shocked the whole of my system. Logically I had expressed my love through sex before, but with you...that clicked on a physical level more simultaneously than previously experienced. More intensely and vibrantly. I was indeed afraid. You meant so much to me, so abruptly. Sex became a potential only 2 days after my coworker had turned me down (I'd nursed this crush for over a year, his friendship gave me happiness in the wake of my father's death). Too immediately i became enamored with the flattering concept that a friend could find me attractive. I already loved you as a friend--it's easy to love people, especially when they have a special energy like you do. Thinking of some of our kisses, so slow and gentle...it's as though my brain even still can't recall these moments with complete clarity, there's so much attached to the sensations (so many layers to each of the little sparks). I don't know that we were ever on the same page, and maybe that won't change with time. But I am certain that I will in some form always love you and support you. And I hope that somewhere in the future I can express that deep appreciation physically, again. At a place where we're both more mature and communicative with expectations (I was wrapped up with expectations of rejection or daydreams of perfection). Ah, I can't word this as seamlessly as desired. Basically i wish I could tell you you're a wonderful human as frequently as I think it. I wish I could adventure with you and come to know you more. I do cherish what has transpired and whittle at the heaviness to my desire for so much more of it. Desire breeds misery and I aim for contentment above this lengthy ache."

I miss your hair, held in place exactly where your hands laid it in the morning, standing in the mirror with your head cocked to the side. Wispy, but heavy when I pull my hands through your curls. I miss the warmth of your neck, nestled next to mine, skin on skin. I miss your eyes, reflecting your soul with every blink. Unconditional, thirsty. Honest. I miss your beard, my favorite salt and pepper scruff, tickling me with your soft kisses. I miss the way you tenderly run your lips down my neck, down my chest, belly, naked thighs and down to my toes. I miss laying beside you, losing sense of which limb is mine and which limb is yours. Diving into ourselves, together, cradled in our vulnerability and rocked only by each other. Closing our eyes. A breath in. A breath out. A sinking, a tumbling. Fingers squeezing together tight. Falling through the trip, bodies melted in heat. We are us. You are my waking light, and you know I am yours. Youre the center of my gravity, keeping me grounded and balanced. Anchored to your steadiness. And, youre a husband. But you arent mine. "

I should have run for the hills then honestly-affection too soon is asking for trouble. There was something about the child-like part of you that was still healing which I recognized. I wanted to protect and love you. I thought you were an absolute angel. Weve been together almost two years now, the first year was magic.This last year has been barraging wave after barraging wave. I always felt like pain was like the ocean. Trauma ruining any progress we had made. My worn out heart has been stretched so thin, I am a beaten dog ready to be stray. I reached my breaking point long ago. Were both fearful and damaged people. I recognized the cries for help in your radical avoidance of any potential of someone having what you perceived to be power over you(you feared vulnerability). I did my best to guide you and support you, I was willing to bear the heavy burden because I simply adored you. I couldnt bear the thought of your jaded perception of lifelong relationships, perpetually questioning every loved ones intentions. Im sorry I fell apart trying to support you. Its been really hard on me, more than I ever show. Getting you to recognize manic behaviors, projections, deep communication, lack of emotion and avoidance were all symptoms of scars from your past. It took three months of a delicate and exhausting tightrope walk to convince you to go to couples therapy with me. All of those symptoms you had were triggering me and I had to continue to grow past my own traumas. We understood each other the best Weve come so far, but 6-8 months after we started your lack of accountability to practice mindfulness, sex therapy and communication have finally broken me enough. I remember the last time my heart broke it was so deep I knew there was no going back. I was triggered, had a panic attack and you said coldly, That [panic attack] was to manipulate me wasnt it?. I have seen very little progress in the way of your diligence in practicing grounding techniques as well as checking your perception. I knew then I didnt have it in me to continue sacrificing my well-being for your healing. When anytime I brought up my own discomfort or emotions even after practicing that verbiage with a therapist it drove you over the edge every time. I could never say that I was saddened or hurt by your actions without repercussions. Thats why I had a panic attack that night. I tried to talk to you calmly countless times about what I needed to feel safe, when you made me feel unloved and unsafe. You made promises you never kept. I lost my faith in you so long ago, but I stayed because I thought I was strong enough to help you figure your trauma out. I didnt want you to suffer the same cyclical realization of trauma affecting your life and I didnt want anyone else to hurt like me. No one deserves to be hurt by your inability to take responsibility for your actions. The way we started our relationship tells me youll fall in love quickly again then the pattern of your inability to be truly intimate/vulnerable will fear its ugly head. We finally had all the answers and we were massive making strides. We had resources that most people dont, and you still didnt want to take responsibility. I wish more people spoke openly about how trauma affects relationships, intimacy and love. I wish there was a more radical push for men especially to take responsibility for their mental health and avoid inflicting more emotional damage on to women. Today I stopped hurting over you. I stopped caring. I care for you, I worry for you, but I dont love you romantically anymore. My tears dont hurt my heart anymore, theyre empty. I thought my heart was an endless pool of unconditional love. Who was I kidding? Thats bullshit, in reality all love is conditional. Youre moving back home, and Im moving to my own apartment in the city without you in three months. I cant wait to be alone and focus one myself. To have peace when I come home, or snuggle my cats while I study. To not have to care for another individual when I need to be caring for my own mental, emotional and physical well-being. I want to finish up my degree, kick ass at my job, competitively lift like Ive been wanting to for the past year, and move overseas. I want to discover myself, and avoid dating altogether for a really long time after this. Im sorry Im not madly in love with you anymore. Im in love with the man that trauma didnt consume, the man that didnt excuse perpetuating toxic behaviors. I blinded myself with the hope of the you outside of our relationship. I just cant stop thinking about how pissed Im going to be if you repeat the same cycle for the third time and hurt another. I wanted to save a kind soul from the poison of trauma. "

that one point in your life i was your entire world. that you would drop anything to be by my side. i taught you love, you said. it's not your fault, it's mine. everyone says your reasons were just excuses, but they do not know your background. to be fair, i don't think you exposed much of your past to be, your thoughts, your struggles, your scars. you ended up being consumed by your own insecurities and demons, masking them as being too inadequate for me. you said in the long run that i will understand, that i would be grateful for this decision. that night i didn't, i pleaded and i begged you to reconsider, because now that i know your innermost thoughts, we could've worked on it together. it wasn't a battle of me versus you, but us versus your monsters in your closet. but you chose the cowardly way out. you said that you've tried to change, that you're sorry you couldn't change enough, that you weren't enough. you already made the decision long ago and it pains me that i was so blind to that. you say that we were too different from each other. two different backgrounds, two different personalities. you told me to not change myself, that you'd hate yourself if i changed more than you could change for me. and i said, yes, i would change for you but i would also change for myself. because isn't that what relationships were? to better ourselves. you were too busy sobbing to reply. i said that there is potential in you and that's why i still stayed, but you wouldn't believe me. you couldn't see the potential you had that i saw in you. you chose to be so rooted in your insecurities to even lift a finger to try. i'm sure you tried, but as you said, i guess you were clinging on to a romanticised version of me. the 'me' that you crushed on. you said that you didn't love me as much as you did before. but what was before? the honeymoon period never lasts, and you cannot continue a relationship just purely on passion. love is commitment, it is understanding. no one is perfect, but people try. you stopped trying. and it's so disappointing when i see everything now with clearer lenses. that i have loved you so much and gave a huge chunk of my heart for someone who just takes and takes and takes and takes and *takes*. yes. i see it now. i can pinpoint so many root causes as to why you feel this way. your family, your ex, your desire for escapism. you say that you're pragmatic. but let's be real, you are idealistic and you yearn for this intangible feeling that you once felt when you were at your happiest. you want to recreate that feeling again of freedom, that carefree joy you once felt when you weren't bogged down by the stark reality. you craved that escape you're still suffering with withdrawal symptoms. i am stuck here in the present but you're still in the past. these short months were nothing but joy to me. that was how oblivious i was. i was blinded and i gave my all because i thought you were perfect. i thought we could tackle your demons together and make you into a better person. i wanted to be there to cheer you on, so that you'd be better. to change yourself. but how foolish i was to think that i could undo so many years of turmoil and suffering. i cannot erase scars, but i wanted to mend them. you said that maybe everything would've worked out better if you got to know me more instead of jumping in head first. i agree, sorta. it was rushed, but i fell in love with you each day as we got to know one another, whereas you fell out of love. i know you can't say it and it may be a bold faced lie, but i know you fell out of love. you said that you will never hate me, but i think the flaws that i carried grew too much for you to handle. i am not perfect, neither are you. the only difference was that i tried. and it sucks because i will see you around campus. i hate how we planned our school lives around each other, or at least how i planned mine. one day i will see you with another girl around college and it will sting, i admit. it will sting that you moved on so quickly. but it will hurt me even more knowing that you haven't changed, and this new girl will be subjected to even more pain and suffering. i know, because i am feeling it now. do me a favour and i pray, sort your demons out first. love yourself. you have too many burdens to shoulder and i know that it is difficult. but if you do not confront those demons, you are just going to hurt another girl again. you are still a close figure in my life. my first love, the one who showered me with so much affection, who made big sacrifices in the beginning but ultimately couldn't handle the differences anymore. my first life lesson at 20, that i have to guard my heart and choose the right person. *you are foolish*, i would tell 19 year old me. i'd tell her to not let any man who shows some interest to weasel his way into my heart this easy. because when i love, i *love.* but i will still be there for you. it hurts now to look at you, because we have entangled our lives so deeply that it takes time to undo the knots. but i will still be there. you promised that too, but i'm not sure if that promise can be kept in the future. you are a wonderful person, a brilliant mind with a heart of gold. but you are a tortured soul and you don't realise it. since i am a friend now, a blip in your life story, i can only cheer you on your journey to become someone better. to overcome these obstacles in your life so i can smile proudly and say '*you've done it'.* i will be devastated of course, that i am not the one you will spend your entire life with. not your soulmate, not your life partner. no more till death do us part. no more family of three with a samoyed in our yard. no more of that. but i will be happy for you, the day that you have moved on and made a life for yourself. for now i will simmer in sadness, drown myself in pools of tears. but i will be okay. i hope that when you tell your friends and family that you still hold dear to your heart the news of our parting, that they will scream logic through that head of yours. it is incredulous, they will say. and i know they will say that. they will look at you with disappointment for letting the good one run away. this relationship was not like your previous one. the one where you were so badly mistreated that everyone could see. no one will deny that i gave you my all. i exposed my vulnerability to you and i loved you for all it was worth. no one can deny that. dare i say that you will never find someone like me, who has shown you the extremes of what love and dedication is. i pride myself on thinking that the next girl cannot compare to the beacon that i was to you in your darkest days. i sacrificed and sacrificed until you could not bear to see me mould into someone you could barely recognise. i hope one day we can talk. and that we will both be mature about it and be respectful. i do not harbour any hatred towards you, and i do not think i can hate you at all. i can only be sad and disappointed that the man i thought you were turned out to be false. were my expectations too high? perhaps. you were right. you could not give the amount of love i expected. but for now, while the wounds are still fresh, i cannot look at you without feeling a pang in my heart nor burst into tears. i do not know how to react if i see you in class. but i will be okay. i will be mature. you are still a friend to me, someone close to my heart. and i will treat you with the same love, although platonic now, that you deserve."

I haven't been so excited about another person before I met you, and I don't usually have speeches or love letters to people that touch my heart but you...you're different. You're exactly what the artists write and sing and make movies and paint about. You're exactly what love is supposed to feel like and you feel amazing. You're exactly what I've been looking for since I set out to find love and I know I sound silly. And I know the love poems and the slow songs arent all about you but they are now. And I know that vulnerability isnt the best color on me but I want to wear it for you all the time. I've told you that red is my color. Red, like the lipstick kisses I leave on your cheek and like the heated love I feel for you and like the dress that I keep spinning in because spinning is the best way to recreate how I feel after you kiss me. I love when you kiss me. Your kisses are like sugar on my lips and I have a sugar addiction I'm not interested in breaking. Your earthquake kisses are as sweet as the blackberry bruises you leave on my neck and sometimes I wish you'd leave more on my chest and on my hips and everywhere you can get your teeth because the bruises on my skin are so much nicer than the ones left on my heart. The bruises on my skin are displays for the world to see and know that I love the one I'm holding hands with and I had so many great times with him in the last few hours and he knows how to love me. I love the way you love me. With crooked smiles and hearty laughter and tight hugs with you rubbing my arms and back, the way you love me is as gentle and powerful as your heartbeat, and I love your heartbeat. I don't usually have speeches or write love letters for people that have touched my heart but you're different. You've broken past my most powerful defenses with so little effort. Your smile brought down my walls and your laughter jammed my weapons and your body stopped my soldiers and your kiss closed the space between us and I've never been this vulnerable for one person, but I like how it feels to trust and hold you. I want to melt in your hands like ice when you kiss me and I love that you make that so easy. I want to make you as happy as you make me, and give you everything the world has to offer because you deserve nothing but the best. I want you, and everything you come with, because I have so much love and it's running out of places to go. I'm so unbelievably and indescribably lucky to be in love with you, and if nothing else, I want you to know that."

We were just beginning to reconnect again after years of dancing precariously on the precipice of friends and lovers. We jumped. Do you remember? We held hands and laughed as the wind whipped our faces. Those onlookers with their stares and judgement we ignored. It was you and me. Against the world. Against the odds. You sent me quotes from our favorite shows. You sent me quotes from Shakespeare. You sent me poetry from Pablo Neruda. All to show me how much you loved me. It wasnt a red flag. To me it was a man at a loss for words. I too sometimes have trouble expressing my true feelings. I can still feel the shape of you. The tactile memories of running my fingers across your forehead and through your thinning hair as your eyes became heavy with sleep. Your vulnerability at those moments broke through my own walled-off heart. When I kissed your forehead there was no monster there. I know you. You let me in. Behind the bravado and facade. And Ill never forget that you. As we enter another eclipse tonight, I like to think of that day we stood along a highway watching the moon cover the sun. The ying and yang together for a brief moment. I know we loved each other more than we were able to express. More than we could handle. Our love opened our old wounds, and our hearts being the fixers they are would try to heal the other by fusing together. And every time one of us would pull away it would break that new, delicate skin and re-open the wound. We bled too much. We became anemic. But like all scars, each time I look at my heart I think of you and the time we shared. I no longer am clinging to you out of fear. Our ship was destroyed long ago. Instead of crying as I look at the wreckage, I hug you tight one last time and then push off you with all the strength, releasing myself out into space as the sun dims the moon. I love you. You were the bear spaceship all along. - me "

Dear S, I remember you every day. I don't hate you. I never could, though I wanted to sometimes in hopes it would help me to get over you. I'm realizing that all through the changes in my life, and sometimes those changes have been very significant, there is one constant thought that always remains, the thought of you. I know that it is solely related to me, it isn't your doing or even your choice. I didn't wish for this either - for you to become this fantasy, that I can neither be freed from, nor ever achieve. I didn't wish for you to become this root, this core, this comfort that I always return to. The one, the only one I wish to share my moments and thoughts with, his idea following me, like a shadow, or a part of myself. I don't know when or how it happened. It doesn't even occur to me on most days that it has been over ten years since I met you. Many years since I saw you. Almost a year since I last contacted you. Somehow it doesn't make a difference. Somehow, it always feels as though I carry you with me all of the time. I know you didn't want this. I know it means nothing to you. Trust me, if I could stop it, I would have a long time ago. I sent you an email (well, one of many), nearly two years ago, saying that I'm in love with you. You never replied. You blocked me. Surely, that isn't the action of someone who cares. I have counseled and coached myself a million times, not to keep loving someone who can't even bother to respond to me, especially when I took such a big risk and bared the vulnerability that comes with confessing love for another. Perhaps you think the thought occurred to me recently. But I fell in love with you in 2010. I even wrote a one page love letter to you then. I never sent it. After you left at that time, I couldn't stay longer either. We somehow ended up in the same country. How many years was it? Was it 7? 7 years in the same country without seeing you once. 2 years you didn't even speak to me. You said later I was so negative then. I was sick a lot S, I was going through a tough time and yet you never cared. You, and your ambition. Your job. Your money. Your sex. Your power. That's all you wanted isn't it? You got everything you wished for. Perhaps you even loved. Only you would know. All I know is that you never loved me. It isn't that I didn't want to see you. But you kept talking about how I was when I first met you. How I looked back then, how I danced. I felt that you imagined me in the way you had known me then. But years passed and I have changed. I was frightened that you would be disappointed when you saw me. If I saw that in your face... If I saw a version of you that didn't admire me and want me, I would'nt have been able to bear that. That was the only reason I refused to meet you. I regret it now. I wonder if I had met you that maybe it would have given me the closure I need. Maybe I would see how different we had become over the years, or how there wasn't chemistry as I thought there would be. I wish I had had the courage to find out. Most days I fantasize about seeing you again. I wonder how I would react. Would I want to ignore you and not speak a word? You did after all, hurt me deeply. Would I press my finger on your chest and arm, checking if you were real, whether it's really you I'm seeing? Would I cry and hug you, trampling my ego once agai I don't know. And it seems I will never find out. I know you can't feel anything pertaining to me. I'm the one who has always dreamt of you, seeing glimpses of your future as though they were mine. If you could feel anything, I wish you would feel my need for a closure that you could never have the decency to offer me. How cruel are you really? I can't be doing all this on my own S. You must be holding on to me as well in a way I can't understand. Does it boost your ego to have someone pine for you, lonely and unable to love another, for more than ten years? You've had your share of romances and intimacy, would you not wish the same for me? You don't need me, and you don't really care, so why don't you let me go? I've been living in the same cities you lived in. I didn't intend to, it just happened thsat way. Yet I wonder if I am seeking you still? Does it make me feel closer to you, knowing that at some point you walked the same paths that I did, ate at the same restaurants, experienced the same views. Yet it's time to let you go. I have to move on. I want to love again, a man who loves me at least just as much I do if not more, who will appreciate and dote on me. I want to be happy. I want a life companion and a family. I repeat that I don't hate you. You, the idea of you, some of your values, the way you see the world, have over the years become a part of me too. And that little part will be there. I will remember you well, and I want you to be happy too. I want you to fall in love, and know how it feels to love someone deeply, just as I loved you. I know you will always be fine. Goodbye friend and fantasy, Turk "
554,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,"It's over, isn't it?",1,akqyrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/akqyrh/its_over_isnt_it/,2019-01-29 06:26:06,"Finished.docx 1 / 4 I hope I never abandon my dignity enough to actually let you read this. I always make an ass out of myself with my clingy, thirsty bullshit. I associate emotional vulnerability with humiliation because I take it too far and embarrass myself. I already have. I mean, you left me kneeling on my floor. Why the fuck was I kneeling on the floor? Why did I text you and then text you again? What the fuck is wrong with me? Its 4am. When I said I wouldnt be able to sleep without you, I wasnt exaggerating. I need to figure out why this feels so out of proportion, why my reaction was so intense. Ive been trying to just name my emotions first, and it turns out Im mostly scared. Terrified. Our relationship has always been strange. The boundaries are unspoken. You set them, mostly, and I find them by running into them headlong. Our feelings for each other, and our ways of showing them, are so different, and so imbalanced. I think so, anyway. I really dont know how you feel about me. Or maybe I know exactly how you feel about me, but I want to pretend you might actually feel some other way. Once, right before you got sober, you were on the edge of sleep, and I was fumbling around trying to talk about it, and you got angry and said I like you. I like spending time with you. Why cant that just be enough? But there was also your big apology speech, before that even, where you said youre my best friend, and the best thing in my life right now, and I love you so, so much. Please dont stop being my friend. I wonder how much of either of those conversations you remember, and I wonder if that matters. Usually when I find myself tripping about it, trying to label it in my own mind, I remind myself that I just left the most intensely labeled kind of relationship there is, the kind that has a legally binding fucking contract attached, and that wasnt shit. That label didn't mean shit in the end. The words we use to describe it dont matter. You have been getting the best of me. All of me. I do my best to understand you, and accept you, and to be the kind of person you need. I try not to make demands, try not to be difficult. I know that there are real, valid reasons why this is already difficult. Is a bad idea, really. We both know the reasons. I wouldnt change any of them if I could, and I cant. Six months went by. Six mostly pretty great months. When I mentioned the other day that youve been sober for six months, I almost mentioned that you've slept in my bed for six months straight too. Every single night since rehab. But I didnt say that, because it seemed too girlfriend-y. So tonight you felt like shit and wanted to go home. So what? That's not a fucking crime, it should be neutral to a mild bummer, not a big fucking deal. So why did I want you to stay so badly? One night by myself wont kill me. Why does it scare me so much? What am I afraid of? Thats the real question. The only question that I can answer on my own. Well it was sudden, you leaving tonight, and totally unexpected. I reacted badly, reacted in a way that makes me cringe in hindsight, because I didnt think, I just reacted. No, no, no. Stay What the fuck, Hope? What kind of bullshit is that? Now that Ive had some time to think, I realize the thought that set off this reaction, the part I still don't understand, is this: What was it about your place that made you want to go there? Whats better there than here? -------------------- 2 / 4 My insecure, asshole brain says its because of me, of course. I am here, and Im not there. You wanted to sleep without me clinging to you, breathing down your neck. Ive never been able to tell whether you like that part, or if you just tolerate it. You did kiss me, though, before you left. You seemed to want to, but it's hard to tell. Or else you stopped and got a bottle on your way home. You said that the way youve been feeling lately feels like withdrawal. You seem sad, upset, more than sick. Youve been grumpy as fuck, and your sense of humor has a cruel edge sometimes. Do I have a strong intuition because youre on the edge of a relapse, or am I just being paranoid and negative? Depends on whats happening right now, and what happens next. Ive already asked myself if I would still hang out with you if you started drinking again. Answer: yes, I probably would. The thought of it scares the hell out of me, though. I have dreams about it sometimes, dreams where youre suddenly holding a glass, and you just look at me and shrug. I know theres nothing I can do about it. Or it could be as simple as what you said. You felt like shit, and you wanted to go home. Or some other reason entirely. Thats not what I need to figure out. I need to figure out how to take back the things Ive put on you that you never asked for, that you never wanted anyway. Take back the tender parts of myself and put them somewhere safer. I need to pull up the drawbridge, and fill up the moat. I cant say I love you. I mean, I could, but I feel like Im not supposed to. Im not sure what that even means, or rather, it can mean too many different things. It never means the same thing twice. I try to say something more specific instead. Im glad youre here. Youre wonderful. You make me happy. You usually respond me too, but you dont go first. Do you realize that the nicest thing youve ever said about the way I look is it's not true? After making a joke about how you're naturally good looking, and I should try it. A goddamn double negative compliment? Im so fucking pathetic that it made me happy, too. The nicest thing before that was when I said something cringey while we were having sex, tell me you like what you see I think, and you said well, Im staring at you while Im jerking off, arent I ?. And you were, but holy shit thats a terrible compliment. The most hurtful thing youve ever said to me was during a conversation about how wed both like to fuck Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. A threesome was proposed. You asked in that joking-but-really-not-joking way that all men ask eventually, if I had any girlfriends who would be interested. Nope, all my girlfriends are married with kids. So you said, if I knew any girls who would be interested, Id be fucking *them*. Emphasis on them. Them instead of me was very much implied. As soon as you said it, and saw the look of slack-jawed offense on my face, you apologized. It came out wrong. Youre bad at phrasing. As If there was a way of rephrasing that so it wouldnt cut me like a million knives. I broke down the other day and asked you to say something nice about me. It didnt go well. You said You're really funny, but not always on purpose. I cried. Thats really the nicest thing you could think of to say to me? And I reacted badly. Like I said, I cried. I cried because I was hurt, and furious, but also because I thought it might make you dig deeper, for something better, make you lie even. Anything would have felt better than being damned with faint praise. -------------------- 3 / 4 (It's over, isnt it? Isn't it? Isnt it over? It's over, isnt it? Isn't it? Isnt it over?) You arent here anymore. You had another stomach bug and went home a few nights in a row. Then you didn't have a stomach bug, and you still went home to sleep. Until I told you that waking me up at 2am to tell me goodbye was keeping me from sleeping and breaking my goddamned heart. I said a lot of things. Thats what you get when you wake me up, when I feel bewildered and rejected. You said youre having a rough time with depression and anxiety, that you felt worse at bedtime, and that it felt better at your apartment. It didnt make it go away, but it felt better. You said you haven't been taking your meds. You promised to start taking them. You said you love me, but we're at different places in our lives, and you try not to think about it. I laughed and said that's the same way I feel about you. You said you love me. You were the one who asked Do you want a steak? You know, tomorrow? three nights ago, the night before Valentine's day. And the next day Let's do it another night. And then all of this, and we never ate the steaks. It was such a sweet and unexpected gesture, though. It made me so fucking happy. And then all of this. And of course you said its not my fault. It's got nothing to do with me. You dont know why you feel this way. You said I just need to let you go through what youve got to go through, and then we'll see where we're at. Where we're at. I refuse to be let down gently, always. But Im really trying this time. I texted you the next night, awkwardly. You were ice cold. I sent florp?, a nonsense word that we had sent one another dozens of times and which means, roughly time to hangout and watch TV?. You responded English please as if it wasnt a word from your own nonsense vocabulary. As if you aren't the reason Violet calls fruit banangas and strawbabies. It was the first time Ive ever felt like we had nothing to say to each other. I left you alone for the next two days. No contact. The nights I maintain silence are fucking excruciating. I wait until midnight to take the Benadryl that knocks me unconscious. Im a writhing mass of anxiety and frustration. I churn and writhe with emotion. I remember feeling exactly this way before, as a younger me. Feeling it as older me is interesting. I have a bittersweet kind of perspective. Im so many years past my first heartbreak that I know this feeling will eventually pass. That I will be ok. But I also know that I will forget the way your face looks while youre sleeping, the way you smell. Today at work wasnt too bad. It felt all kinds of weird and a couple of kinds of sad, but it was functional. We were nice to each other. You talked to me for 20 minutes about the video game youre playing, and I made a dick joke. You chose the music in the dining room, Paul Simon. All that plaintive, melancholy shit. The boxer. Carole King singing you've got a friend. I bitch to Jess about it, and again the next day when you ask for Roxy Music. Do we really need to listen to The Cure right now? I text her Can't tell if totally oblivious or an act of psychological warfare!?! A few days later we went full Adele, this time not by your request, but still. Rolling in the Deep. Lauryn Hill singing Xfactor. I was saying something to you and in the middle of a sentence realized I was listening to This Woman's Work. -------------------- 4 / 4 If I wanted to fuck with you I could. I would show up to work with no glasses and a face full of makeup. A totally different face. Id wear cedarwood oil as perfume, and we would listen to afro-cuban dance music all day. Your time card would be gone again. Your cash drawer would have bills facing every which way. There would be a TV on in the background for some reason, with the volume set to a number thats not divisible by three. Also everyone would be barefoot. I dont want you to suffer, though. I want the opposite of that. I wish I knew half as many incredibly specific ways to comfort you, to make you feel relaxed and happy. It feels like youre ghosting me. Your answer to the question wanna hang out and watch TV? is a vague not tonight. I tell you to let me know if I should stop asking. No response. At work after a night spent with my heart in my throat, waiting for you to respond to my Degrassi memes, I said if you want me to fuck off and leave you alone, please just tell me. You said no, you said You're good, you were just asleep. You hugged me then, and we never touch at work. Im still the only one reaching out, always the first and the last one to text. I asked flat out if it felt like I was intruding. You said Youre fine. I dont feel intruded. I cant help trying to figure out why things changed. My mind obsesses, it needs to have an explanation, some kind of narrative. It might be that youre drinking again, and you want to hide it from me. Makes sense. But, I know what a man metabolizing last night's booze smells like, you in particular. I sniff you out every morning when I see you, and I dont smell it on you. I look for purple wine stains on your lips and teeth, and I dont see any. You werent trying to hide it from me last time, so I have no idea how good you are at it. You could be interested in someone else. That would make sense too. Your clothes are clean. You got a haircut and started shaving, and you hate shaving, and have a difficult time getting your hair cut because a stranger has to touch your head. That could be about looking nice for someone. or looking nice as a smokescreen to hide drinking, or to help fight your anxiety and depression. Or any combination of those things, or none of them. Maybe it was something I said or did. Maybe I'm too difficult, too needy. Maybe you thought about it rationally for a while and reached the conclusion that we just arent a good match. Or maybe you are telling me the truth. After all, you are sometimes honest to a fault. You might be white-knuckling your way through a really bad time by immersing yourself in video games, or doing things to calm and comfort yourself that you think would be embarrassing. You could feel too sad and bad and weird to be around anyone. It could pass eventually. You have to come back here, at least once. If you don't you forfeit your childhood N64, your favorite cure t-shirt, three NASA t-shirts, your old AA keychain, seven nice pens, a dozen button up shirts, your Mr. Rogers sweater, your Gryffindor pajamas, two drawers crammed with underwear, socks and pants. It's a lot. You will have to let me know eventually that its over. --------------------"
555,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,To the one I thought I would marry,1,aksgv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/aksgv0/to_the_one_i_thought_i_would_marry/,2019-01-29 08:42:10,"Against the advice of every person I asked and perhaps my better judgement - if I ever had any - I'm writing this. I'm not sure if it's more to you or to me. I never did listen to anybody anyway. You can't win a relationship. I wish you could because it might make it easier. But a relationship isn't about winning or dominance or control - it's about vulnerability, sharing, and growth. Or maybe you were right when you said you've always known too much. I guess if you go into every relationship expecting to get hurt, you're going to get hurt in every relationship. I don't know that. Maybe you did, but I wish you didn't. Or maybe I did and wished I didn't. Either way, we both thought we knew we'd destroy each other and bailed before we could. You had me. You got me. I wasn't going to hurt you. Or at least I wasn't trying to. I wasn't going to ghost you or move to Japan or whatever other terrible stuff you dragged from previous relationships into ours. And I got you and you weren't going to hurt me or whatever terrible stuff I'd dragged from previous relationships into ours. I really wish neither of us knew anything. You said I got you - but I didn't want having you to mean you still had to lie to me. ""Yes I said that because I don't know you and I didn't want to say ""I didn't want to call you because I didn't like talking in airports."" And ""I don't know you"" isn't an excuse, but I think you know that and were just scared. But it scared me and that's why I bailed. Asking someone to trust you that you'll open up eventually after lying to him is a lot. It's not impossible, but it's a lot. So don't lie to people. In relationships, unlike art, nothing true comes from something false. You said I broke up with you because youre a boring person and I wanted more. You and I both know thats you putting those motivations behind my actions to avoid reconciling with what you or I could have done. I saw you. I saw you for all your faults and insecurities and beauty and wonder and cared for you because of it. You were so hurt that morning in the coffee shop. I knew when you were sure to tell me it wasn't the worst week of your life or made it just another ""winter relationship"" to learn about yourself. Or when you asked where I'd be the next couple weeks and I'd moved onto DC and New York. ""I don't want to change. That's the reason that I'm so successful in other areas of my life."" I'm still not sure if you were more upset at you or me. Or if you believed it. It's okay to be hurt. To be vulnerable. You don't need to figure out how to control someone before opening up to him. In fact, you have to give up control if you ever want that loving, supportive partnership you talked about I know you say it was about making sure I knew I made you scared by showing up to your apartment - and maybe I did. But I flew eight hours from Belize to Kansas City because I cared about you and I wanted to figure us out. And yes, part of the reason I wanted to have that conversation in person was control - not leaving every bit of it in that relationship to you. You said I was controlling, but you were too. You controlled by playing games with texting or being available when I literally came to Kansas City just to see you (Im sick so may have to lay low). I mean I've never been so much in someone else's control and only half known it. That's scary and I wanted to feel not completely at the mercy of when you felt like being in the relationship. I didn't need more of your time - I just needed you to keep the promises you did made or at least work on it when you didn't. And then you made you not keeping your promises about women suppressing their feelings for a man in a relationship. You know how to show up on time - I just wanted you to be secure enough and to care enough to do it for a phone call. But if your feeling is just ""I'm going to do whatever I want and you can deal with it,"" that's...too selfish for any kind of relationship - any kind that I want anyway. And I suspect maybe that's the same for you. I tried to ""lawyer you."" I guess using basic logic to show you hypocrisy and selfishness was too much because you didn't know me. You asked what I expected by doing that and then mockingly provided an answer before dropping back into a defense: ""sometimes I'm just tired from being on time to everything else and don't have the energy."" But you were like that before med school. You've always been like that. It's you picking what's important to you based on what you can get away with. And you've surrounded yourself with people you've conditioned to put up with that selfishness by making it up with being otherwise impressive. And that might work for a friendship, but how do you expect that to work in any strong, supportive partnership? Being accomplished and funny and confident and polite to strangers might be enough to impress friends or resumes, but being open, honest, and reliable are what matter most in a relationship. I didnt like you for your accomplishments  I liked you for those moments of deep vulnerability and honesty we shared. You talked about wanting to be a strong supportive partner and worrying about not being able to do that now. Yes, you're in med school now and residency soon, but there's never going to be a magic time where you just decide to be a supportive partner. Like anything else you've become good at, it takes work and practice and only gets harder to start as you get older. You're not going to suddenly wake up one day and be a supportive partner. You've got to work at it. But if you don't, at least you've picked the perfect career for an excuse. But no matter how badly I wanted that to work on all this in a night, it wouldn't happen that night or maybe ever. I asked you when it was over for you and you fed me something about forest for the trees. I asked because you asked me to stay that night. Because we stayed up talking like there might have been some future. I asked if you were a 9/11 truther so we could break up and you said if only it were that simple. I asked if you wanted to break up and you said why does it have to be me who decides? And when I asked you why you didn't text me for three days, or told you the last thing I asked you was ""is there any hope?"" and you responded ""not tonight. In the morning."" you got mad and made it my fault for setting up a boundary or you not knowing what that meant. Maybe it was my fault, but you never let my feelings stop you from doing what you wanted anyway. I asked you if I'd stayed those two weeks if it would have been different, and you said yes. But I left because you said you were going to be busy studying for that exam. I don't know how we can be both fundamentally incompatible and somehow if I'd have made one or two different decisions, it might have worked. You got mad at me for doing something you didnt want to, or maybe wanted to but couldnt  end the relationship. Why didnt or couldnt you end it? I guess if I had my druthers, you'd have tried to talk to me after I went back to Belize. But maybe you were too afraid to put yourself out there for fear of being hurt. Worse, I wish I might have talked to you before sending that text because I was too afraid of letting you hurt me. But I never could make you do anything. And I wouldn't want to anyway - that's why I liked you. You told me it was infatuation or physical stuff manifesting as actual closeness and maybe that's what it now has to have been for you. But that contentment you felt when I held you that day by the dam in Lawrence is what I hoped it felt like for you - at least for a while. For me it was bullshitting quantum physics poetry while I held you in your kitchen and you accepting me for what I was. I told you I wanted to stay with you in that eternal instant and some happiness in me always will. When I was with you, it felt right. You fed something in me and I think maybe for a little bit I did for you. And that's why I'm writing this - it feels right. It feels right to put this truth out there and just let feelings fall as they might or not at all. It helped me feel not bad to end it on a positive note, but it didn't feel right. So take this as what you will: forest or trees or nothing at all. It never would have worked between us anyway - unless it did. Maybe being on the same page intellectually isnt enough to sustain a relationship. But not trying for fear of hurt or failure definitely doesnt sustain a relationship. Things did end less than ideal for both you and me and I didn't want them to either. But they did and all I have are letters. So call it 21 days or tell me I drink too much to kill your heart or whatever you need to do to keep going. This is a wellspring of songwriting material for me, so I'll play it out till it's just a song to me. I really wish I could've played for you, but you made a sarcastic comment ""ughhh is this really happening?"" when I tried and to hell with trying for people who don't want it. Making sure people keep trying enough to cover your insecurity isn't going to lead to any kind of healthy relationship. Its not all on you. Its not all on me. I've already cut to the bone - I just didn't want to regret not going deeper. I know better than to expect anything. As someone who can't help but care about you as a person, I tell you this. I hope that makes you feel secure enough to have the ears to listen. Then again, I never did listen to anybody anyway. I hope you get everything you want. And I hope thats enough. "
556,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,You were so quiet that I noticed you,1,akw2xs,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/akw2xs/you_were_so_quiet_that_i_noticed_you/,2019-01-29 14:53:45,"Agape, the highest form of love. We were camping, at a spiritual retreat, a retreat that I was told never to make any significant decisions in the first 3 days afterwards. In the womens meeting someone said I dont come here for the nature, I come here to be touched, and to touch all of you. I remember reading a thread on the AskMen subreddit asking single men how long it had been since they had been touched by another person outside a familial hug. The answers were super depressing. I wonder now how long its been since youve been touched. Not that know your life, or that you arent attractive. You just strike me as someone with some reservations. Who wouldnt generally make a first move toward contact, platonic or otherwise. You were so quiet that I noticed you. Everyone there this weekend treated the space, physical, social and spiritual, like home. The long timers expressed as much in words and the new comers felt it. You were standing around, right outside the circle of conversation, and thats where I noticed you. You didnt necessarily look like you wanted to talk, but something told me that you did, and we hung out until they spilt us up for the meetings, I guess people like us need gendered topic discussion. I very much enjoyed our conversation. Youre easy to talk to. And once in a conversation, very much engaged. I decided I liked you. I was busy being the social butterfly (my mask?) so I didnt see you again until about 4am. Your mattress was next to mine in the sleeping space. I intended to go to bed. But we started talking instead. About life, fear, resentment, relationships, childhood traumas that linger in our present, God, ghosts, spirituality, science...we talked until 6am. I could have talked for longer and I think you could have too but we both knew wed have to wake in just a few hours. Everyone else had been silent for some time. I dont remember at what point in the conversation I started getting turned on, but I felt that feeling where we do. I joke that vulnerability is my kink often with friends and lovers. It is one of them. I felt a desire to crawl into bed with you, just inches away from mine and take you in my arms. Obviously that would have been very inappropriate. Years ago I might have tried to anyway, so I guess thats growth. Sex for me is not inherently vulnerable. Nor is cuddling. But I wanted to be that way with you in that moment. At least as that way as two people who just met can be. I looked for you on Facebook Sunday when I got home and thought about adding you, but didnt. Maybe our paths will cross again in these circles we run in. I hope they do because I like you. Not necessarily in the I want to make you mine sort of way, but in the way that I could see feeling that in the future if we keep intersecting along this same plane. Youre a very special person and deserve the best my new friend. Until we maybe, hopefully meet again."

Im looking for my smile and Ill be sure to paste it back on as soon as possible. I made a few mistakes recently, and (combined with a serious reaction to a medication) it looks like my hurt and vulnerability slipped through from where it was contained for so long. Im working on tucking it back in so I can go back to impressing you all with the activities I do, the meals I make, the craft projects I complete. I see now that the cheerful, joking, always busy me is the acceptable me. Im sorry I let ANY of you see anything else. I only hope I can get out of this hole, I see none of you will be giving me a hand... so I guess, as usual, its up to me. "

I think both are true, because you are two people: one the charming man who swept me off my feet, whose vulnerability was a privilege to hold in my heart, who looked at me with love eyes and brought me coffee while I showered; and one the dark angry man who resented me for the help that I never asked for, the money pushed into my hands and later held over my head like a pinta of reproaches ready to spill down at any moment, and I couldn't do anything right. I walked on eggshells. I loved you in an immature way. I loved you in a way that meant only being happy when you were happy. When you started to withdraw, I hated myself. I tried to cling on to you and you withdrew even more. It was a horrible, horrible self-reinforcing cycle of codependency. I was only eighteen. I thought you always knew best. You should have known better; later I realized that you've been through this pattern so many times before. I pity you. I wish you hadn't picked me to seduce out of all the other vulnerable kids in your life. Not that I regret any of it, because I don't, and I am glad that you helped me in the ways you did... But sometimes I feel so angry, because I was just so damn young. I didn't know how young I was, but you did. After our very first fight, the one we had when we were on acid, you were crying on the couch and I was holding you. I was wounded but I also felt so glad that we had already talked things through. I felt so close to you. And then you started to tell me how much you missed that one ex, the artist who has the cute house and husband and babies now, the one who almost killed you and herself in a car, the one who made a video of hundreds of selfies of herself dedicated to you and you found it on YouTube that night and watched it and I sat there and watched it and wanted to cry because I was eighteen and sheltered and you were the only man in my life. But I didn't say anything. I didn't say anything when we were in Colorado and you spent another acid trip talking about the cute quirky Chinese woman you'd worked with, who had almost cheated on her boyfriend with you. You told me all about the falling out. You were still angry over it, even though it happened years ago. We watched videos of her too. You ruined my trip. When you took a sedative and fell asleep, I cleaned the house neurotically and cried for hours. When you woke up, I told you I'd had an awesome trip. I wanted us to be happy. Or when you told me about a smart, beautiful student you'd fallen in love with. And I assumed it was me, of course, and then you said her name. And it was the aussie girl with the short dark brown hair and weird sense of humor who you had talked about a lot but never mentioned having taught. I was like, what the fuck: you dated a student before me? And you got angry at me, for daring to suggest there was a ""pattern"" even though I never did and you just were projecting your own insecurity. I cancelled the plans I'd made that evening. I apologized to you. God, I need to stop because I could keep writing for hours. There are at least ten other women. I had no self respect. I just loved you. I wasn't ready to love someone with that intensity and necessity. If you find this, you'll know it's you. Maybe I'll delete it. I'm not sure. I don't want you to be unhappy, and now it's not a codependency thing. I love myself. I'm happy and strong and thrilled to be who I am. My life is good. But I miss you and you will always be someone I care about deeply. This is a letter about the frustrations. You know there were good times. You just need to love yourself, please. Please just fucking love yourself. Stop playing games. Stop trying to lose yourself in some fairytale that will soon be too exhausting to keep up. You are such a lovely person and you're not treating yourself like one. I miss you, I resent you, I love you, I wish you well. "

Maybe its because I havent had a real relationship in so long, I forgot how to treat someone right. Or maybe I just never knew how to begin with. I lied to you and rather than telling you the truth about something because I was humiliated and embarrassed, I lied. Instead of being as vulnerable as I claimed to be, it was me trying to protect my vulnerability. It was me hiding something to save my own skin, rather than make you think I was worth it. The truth didnt break you, it was the lies leading up to the truth that broke you. Sorry will never be enough. Things couldve been different... had you had the truth from the beginning. Things can be different going forward and they have been. It was selfish of me. I cant argue anymore. I have felt so terrible that it just weighs me down. I think about it every minute. Something that really was so stupid, ended up breaking us. No Im sorry will ever describe how I feel or take away the pain Ive caused. But throughout all of it, every emotion was real. Every I love you. Every Im in love with you. Every kiss and hug with those big arms. Every phone call and every FaceTime conversation. Every plan we ever made. It was all real. My favorite was Bob do something. How I wish we can go back to that night of giggling and laughing so hard at our plans together. How I kept asking you of places and how far away they were to where you work and where Id work. I looked everyday. For weeks. I applied to jobs, I didnt even tell you. And had I just told you the truth, life wouldve been so completely different. I am so sorry I destroyed our happiness. I didnt lie to you because I dont respect you, I lied to you because I dont respect myself enough to have told you the truth sooner. I never searched into a relationship with you but Im so grateful I was yours. I fell in love with your soul. I hope one day youll forgive me. Im also entirely hopeful that youll decide that our love is worth trying to save. That youre my person. Im yours. Your mine. But in the reality that it wont, I want you to know that no matter what happens, I am so grateful to have known you and while it was shorter than I wanted, I did spend part of my life with you. I will always be someone who is so thankful that you wake up everyday, even if you dont get to wake up next to me. I will forever cherish every memory laughing and every moment we were so in love. Im not going to beg or plead with you. Im going to let you go. Whats meant to be will be. If you love something let it go. If it comes back to you, it was meant to be. I hope and I pray every second that you come back to me, my sweet love. "

Everything that happened between usparticularly the depth of vulnerability I opened myself up to with you, and the excruciating pain that ensuedand the way Ive interpreted what I learned from my therapy, has caused me to (unintentionally and without choice) put up an emotional wall WITH EVERYONE, higher and thicker than any emotional wall I used to put up to protect myself romantically. Its kind of like living a double life and I feel like theres a 50/50 chance I either go completely numb forever or explode and burn my whole life to the ground."

We've grown up. We've gotten hurt. Sometimes by each other. We've drifted apart, and we were never really that close to begin with. We can never talk to each other alone, we never sit next to each other on the bus, we never approach each other unless by circumstance. But at the same time, I haven't really been able to stop thinking about you, remembering the days we used to talk for hours, reminiscing on the times our paths intersected and I thought it couldnt have been anything other than fate itself. I know your flaws. You cant talk about anything serious, youre insecure about your social capacities and academic abilities, youre a dick when you get stressed, you're judgemental and self-sabotaging and insensitive and overly argumentative. You probably know all mine. I'm overly sensitive, equally insecure, also an asshole under pressure, forceful and callous, indecisive and uncomfortable, obsessive. The universe did not will for us to get along with each other. But at the same time, you're flawed in ways I understand. I understand when you isolate yourself and then complain when no one reaches out to you, I understand when you take things too far, when you get pissed at authority, when you avoid emotional vulnerability. I still get annoyed, and it's still wrong when you take shit out on people, but at the heart of it, I sympathize with you, because I know at the heart of who you are, you're the same person you were when we met. I know you probably don't want to talk to me anymore. Something shitty seems to happen between us every year; we fight, rumors spread, what have you. We cant hold a one-on-one conversation without complete silence taking over. There is little to no individual chemistry between us at this point in time. Our social circles have shifted to the point of little intersection. We will never be what we once were. But secretly, I still miss you and the bond we had. I know I'm no one special to you anymore, and perhaps never was. It's been a year since the hike, two years since that summer. I shouldn't care anymore. But I miss your smile. I miss your stories about your family, I miss rambling about childhood nostalgia and politics and music with you. You don't cross my mind as much anymore, but the rare times we talk nowadays, when you tag me in something or show me something on your phone, all the memories, all the fondness comes flooding back. I don't know if I truly miss you anymore. Perhaps I merely miss the rush of adrenaline from caring about someone so much. Perhaps I miss naivete, believing in fate and meaning and love where there is none. Perhaps I miss emotional intimacy, that hike down where we talked for hours about our dreams for the future or those DMs where we shared our thoughts and in those moments, we really, truly cared about each other. Perhaps I miss friendship as it stood that summer and not as it is now, my current friends disjointed and distant, my happiness in isolation. Regardless, if you ever want someone to talk to, I'll always be here for you."

But, despite this situation that neither of us expected, or wanted, you're still listening to me when I spill my emotions everywhere. You're, in your own way, spilling yours too (and I know how much you feel that showing emotion is a vulnerability you don't care for). You're still willing to work with me to make us work, even with these wild demands being thrown at you. I know you sometimes think I don't know how much you care. I do. Otherwise, you wouldn't still be doing this with me, on top of all the other shit you've got on your plate right now. It'd be the easier road to call it quits and say ""well, shit.

We worked together and you reached out to me as an outlet to talk. I was so broken at the time I needed a friend. Five years later I realized you just took advantage of my vulnerability. You kissed me in the parking lot one day and I drove off. You called me and apologized but admitted you had feelings for me. I knew how wrong this was but I felt something. I fell head over heels for you. Im not really sure why. You promised me forever. I was preparing to become a wife at 18. I came home to you when I could to stay the night. The one moment I remember the most about that relationship was one night you held me so close and sang if tomorrow never comes. I remember thinking, wow. This is what love feels like. Then came that day in June where you all of a sudden sent me less snaps. You opened a lot but didnt reply. You kept cancelling. You broke up with me. I was so heartbroken that I had given you so much. My time, my body, my love, and my future. But you didnt care. You kept snap chatting me from time to time. Only to sext or exchange pictures. I didnt care. At least you wanted that part of me. Two years of on and off sexting I finally woke up and realized I was taken advantage of. You knew I was vulnerable and I would let you in. You kept me around to fuck while you were still married to your wife. You knew I wouldnt tell anyone because I fell for you. I still want that relationship for some odd reason. But I have so much anger and resentment for all the tears I cried over you. "

To preface this, I want to say that I am mulling the decision to give her this letter because it is somewhat cheesy and mushy. She likes affection and would probably appreciate it, but I dont know. Part of me is maybe embarrassed of this, I guess? I dont really know. Almost like Im afraid she wont like it. I think she would but what if she doesn't. I dont usually get all sentimental with her ever. Dear You, Youve been in my life and I in yours for a while now. Ive wanted to tell you some things but havent had the courage. Or maybe its because the words would trip stumbling out of my mouth. So instead, this letter is for you. I can see you rolling your eyes at this now. But listen, Im a writer (or at least I like to call myself one.) Even so, this isnt easy for me. I dont want to drag on here but as Ive been saying, I need to get some things off my chest. If you can push past this rough prose (which at this point sounds like it was written by a twelve year old), I think you can understand how I feel. Long before I met you, I never thought about the future. I was aimless. No goals for life. No real dreams. Even recently, I had no idea what life would be like in the dark and distant future. I couldnt see anything changing for me. I was coasting through life, thinking the world would deliver itself to me. I was wrong, of course. I took everything for granted. It seems we only realise these things when we lose them. Now more recently before I met you, I started learning about this guy writing the letter. I started exploring him. Hes actually pretty cool, I found. Most people see him as this sort of artistic guy. So deep. He writes music and stories, even if theyre no good. But this was just a facade, a mirage of someone too cool for anyone else. The real truth: he already knew who he was. He discovered what he feared most. Behind the countless hours of writing, stood the author. A hollow man crippled by his insecurities, too afraid to move because he might fall. A man who could only ever dream of sharing a bond with someone else the way his characters could. He didnt care for many people and he liked that. Less balls in the air he had to juggle. Life was getting complicated as it was. This reality was depressing but it got easier. It was after all just that: reality. We deal with it. We adjust. Not everyones dealt the same hand in life (and to be fair, Ive been generally lucky in that regard). You can whine for a bit but after a while no one wants to listen to you. I dont blame them. I wouldnt either. You just have to get over it. Time too would heal this wound. Ive known some dark days in my life. I really dont know why. Mostly self-involved and self-inflicted. Dont get me wrong. Im not complaining. Thats not really my style. I think I just have some fucked up brain chemistry or something. I used to romanticize the whole misunderstood artist trope. Beethoven. Hemingway. Kurt Cobain. Less famously, my idols, Billy Joel and Phil Collins. It looks good on the outside. Creating art from thin air that amazes people even if they cant understand it. Even if they dont like it. You know you have something they dont. But there is this constant struggle within yourself to fill a hole on the inside; only you dont know that its really a bottomless pit. Ive always liked the appeal. But when I started to live it, all I wanted was to close the book that was my life and cast it to the pyre. You just want to be someone else and not have to deal with the pain. Theres no pay off in the persona. Now here we are. Emphasis on we. At first, you were just another part of another world I didnt have a place in. We both tried to play it cool. Id glance quickly at you from far across the room only to look away when our eyes met. You would do the same. Nothing I hadnt done before. In fact, this was usually par for the course. I knew you were probably interested in me if only on the surface. Thats okay. At the time, you were just a pretty face. Only I never knew you would be so much more. Our interactions were brief as could be but I just didnt know how to proceed. You were nice to me when few were. Its completely my fault. As you know, I can seem distant and isolated. I dont have a very inviting face, I guess. Anyway, it wasnt the right time for me. Maybe it wasnt the right time for you either. About a year and a half passed. I thought about you a lot. Consistently. For all the girls I wish I would have pursued, you ranked at the top of the list, erasing everybody below. I wasnt interested in anyone else, romantically or otherwise. Luckily I didnt delete my instagram. I kind of hate social media but use it a lot for school. My heart sank to my stomach when I messaged you, basically introducing myself, explaining where you might remember me from. I thought I had nothing to lose, so why not? You took a day to respond and it was complete torture. Total agony. But when you responded and said you remembered me, I was ecstatic. I casually asked you out for coffee, even though I hate the stuff. I thought thats just what people did. To my surprise you said yes and we had a great time. You were even more beautiful than before. To add some more cheese to our story, I felt that it was love at first sight. I really hate when people say that because its just lust more than anything, but I remember literally thinking that. I kicked myself a bit just because the thought entered my mind. Before you, I never knew what love felt like and figured that was fine. You cant miss what you never had. But you pushed it on me. Forced it on me, really. In a violent show of the essence of you, I got sucked in and fell for you. I came down hard and havent been able to recover. I was vulnerable. I was scared. I still am. I can admit that. It takes strength to admit vulnerability. And to be honest, its a core part of humanity. But without it, I wouldnt know fear. I wouldnt know that it feels better when we are in each other's arms. I feel safe with you. I hope you feel the same way. Because at this point, youve given me so much I can spend the rest of my life trying to pay it back and it wouldnt be enough. I love you. I know that you are my person. I love that I can be me with you. I love that you can be you with me. The countless day dreams I had where we were together pale in comparison to reality. What we have may not be perfect, but its real and its what we share. And for that Im grateful. With you, I know that somehow, Ill make it through the darkest of days because you mean more to me than I let on. You mean more to me than you can know. You mean that I always have a reason to fight whatever comes our way. I wanted to tell you in person so I could see your response but Im not the best at actually saying the words. Still, for what its worth, these (words) are for you to have for the rest of your life. I had this really specific dream. Something that Ive regarded as my perfect paradise for many years now. I never expected it to come true, but I found comfort in it nonetheless. Its still something that I try to work towards. Picture a backyard beach in Key West. Blocked off from the rest of humanity. The waves are washing on the shore and the orange sun is tucking under the horizon. Im sitting in a chair on my beach, writing. Its my happy ending. My lips begin to curl into a smile and the ink stops. The End. Only now, its different (brace yourself for some more cheese) because youre there. Which is all that really matters. The beach scene is a nice image. But I dont care if thats not how my story ends. As long as Im with you. Always yours, X"
565,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,A Letter to the Love of My Life,1,ao86yf,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/ao86yf/a_letter_to_the_love_of_my_life/,2019-02-08 07:30:15,"To the love of my life, Every occasion I give you a clich, cheesy, white girl gift. To you - this may be the same as others. But, to me - this is so much different. It all started while I was a junior in high school, sitting in English class as I watched you walk through the doorway. I wondered to myself, what would it be like to kiss him?. A strange, uncommon thought I had from just first glance at a cute boy. Then we were forced to introduce ourselves. I remember how nervous you looked - turned out you didnt talk to girls back then. But I will never forget those stunning green eyes I looked into. Occasionally, I would stare at you, as you were straight in sight of our teacher. Curly, dirty blonde hair that I wanted to run my fingers through. The year progressed and we rarely spoke to each other, yet every time we did, I was shocked by how sweet and gentle you were. I knew you were not like every other hormonal, high school boy. So I took a shot, I flirted with you. And when you did not know what the hell to do, I could tell you liked me. I started getting more and more comfortable with the idea of flirting with you, and even though you had my number, I never got a text. So I took it upon myself and texted you. You asked to go for coffee - Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts? Of course being the white girl I am, I said Starbucks, though looking back, I know you were counting on the latter. And then I started to fall in love for the first time. Sitting across from you - you had the cutest expressions on your face. I remember smiling so much my cheeks started to twitch. I tried to stop, fearing I looked like a witch, but I could not. I wanted to reach out and touch your hand so badly, they looked so soft and big compared to mine. I remember how shocked you were that I was into classic rock - Aerosmith and the Eagles. We had the same taste in music, until I mentioned the good old Taylor Swift. As we walked together out to the parking lot, I remember how badly I wanted to lean in and hug you, feel your warm arms around me and breathe you in. You waved. I was hooked on you, like no other guy I had dated before. When you asked me out again, I could not help but smile ear to ear for the next week.   Flash forward three years and we are in college. Young and in love. Yet, I was having an internal battle with myself. I daydreamed about kissing you on what could be our wedding day, but then scared that if I ever said anything, you would freeze up, and shut me out. The worst feeling possible. So I never said anything, knowing that a nine-teen year old girl was way too young to make decisions about the rest of my life, and knowing the vulnerability it would take for me to speak of how much I loved you. And then this year rolled around. Winter break was finally here and we spent all of our living moments together. Not only was I in love with you, but I was in love with your family, and the idea of being a part of it forever. I realized there would be no point to my life without you in it. You had been with me through the lowest point in my young life so far - from friends committing suicide to my stomach disease that always seemed to beat me. You were always patient, understanding, and had kind encouraging words to say. You were thoughtful and genuine, something I had never seen in any man before. Every quality you had was something I admired, and something I looked for in a future life partner. Then, we started to talk jokingly about our future together, knowing nothing was set in stone. There were many what ifs we would talk about. What if you caught our child in a lie? What age could they get phones? What kind of dog would we get?. The list was endless. And I found myself wanting to have more and more of those types of conversations with you. I wanted to talk about having a potential future with you - not just a dreamlike one. I slowly came around to the idea that I wanted you in my near future, not wanting to get hurt. I brought it up and you felt the same way. I was delighted, but still unsatisfied. I wanted more. The more and more time we spent together, the more and more I feel in love with you, and the idea of spending eternity with you. But I could not admit that to myself for a long time. But suddenly, every song on the radio was about us. Every other relationship I saw, I thought, wow, were better than that or we handle problems so much healthier. Not only did I see that our relationship was thriving, but I know we both felt fire inside. And then I finally began to realize where my feelings were headed. I was terrified. At twenty years old, how could I have a feeling so strong inside of me, that it started to burn inside my heart and it was all I could see? I wanted to marry you. I secretly fantasized about the day we would move in together, the dog we would get, and the wedding I wanted so badly. Admitting these feelings to myself made me feel vulnerable, and I knew there was no way I would bring this topic up. But me being who I am, I spilled the beans when I was not sober. I remember saying If it were up to me, I would marry you one day. And then I cried. I could not believe I told you my deepest, most vulnerable thoughts. I could not look you in the eyes, fear of rejection. Fear that this was the moment I would lose you forever. And my world would be over. But then, from what I remember (not so clearly), you made me look you in the eyes, and you said I feel the same way about you. Then I cried for two hours, maybe more. You said you had been feeling this way for a while, but did not want to say anything because you were scared of rejection too, and maybe you knew I was not there just yet. I constantly ask you to repeat the events that occurred that night. I tell you it is because I cannot remember any of it, which is a lie. But I wanted to hear your side of the story. Your own true feelings about us tying the knot one day. Since that moment, I endlessly annoy you about this topic to the point where you probably just want me to shut up. I do not blame you. But, to be fair, I have never been happier about anything in life until that moment. I think about it every day, over and over. I think about the conversations we had after, how many kids do you want? What kind of dog should we get? And the name of our first son we agreed upon. So what is the point of me writing this? I want you to know that being with you makes me feel happy, alive, and the most loved person in this world. I have never felt this way about anyone before. No one can make me smile the way you make me do. I cannot wait to see you again. I cannot wait for the day we move in together. I cannot wait for the day you ask me to spend the rest of my life with you. I cannot wait to have beautiful children with you. And I cannot wait to have a lifetime of memories with the man I love. I will love you forever, through thick and thin, for better or for worse, and in sickness and in health. Happy Birthday handsome."

You lied. I have gone back and questioned everything about the past year and I think I have been played like a fiddle. You love to act like you are so perfect. To pretend like you are some morally superior person that people just love to hurt. But I think you are a predator. You could see my vulnerability, my desperation for love, and my utter adoration of you. That was my appeal. You knew I would always, always love you. Like I always said, I thought the sun shone out of your ass. And I think you knew that quite well. Because if you really cared that much, you wouldn't have ghosted me for such an immature and stupid reason. You would have realized that you can't keep jerking someone around for months and expect that they are going to still take off their clothes for you whenever you randomly decide to want them. You would have valued my presence in your life enough to try to make it work as friends, which is what you said you wanted. But you didn't. Did you ever even love me? I know I made mistakes but god damn, I worked so hard to change for you only to be shot down every time. I think that as a friend, I did an okay job. You seemed to think so too, but apparently that was a lie too. Were there always other girls? I know there were others near the end. It would explain the hot and cold behaviour. I suspect that for quite some time I have been on the back burner. Maybe you have someone sizzling hot right now. Maybe you have for a long time. Maybe you just always came back when you were in the mood for me. You couldn't admit it because the hypocrisy would be obvious. But I am really starting to suspect that you crucified me for things you did yourself all along. And then, when you didn't have a use for me anymore, you discarded me without so much as a goodbye. I reached out. I tried. Because I never wanted you to not be in my life. But no matter what words you fed me, you tossed me out of your life without a second thought. Because even though I gave you close to a year of my life, I was never more than a tool in your box, something you take out when you have something that needs fixing and then put away without a second thought. With a face like yours, you'll always find women willing to do what I did for you. You'll be fine. I truly want nothing but the best for you. But it feels bad man. But you knew that.

Eating your food that you'd cook for me, even though you didn't want to eat it. Taking you on dates, and talking about life. Having endless conversations with you that went nowhere. I fucking love you still. But I can't bear to tell this to you, because I know you'll take advantage of my vulnerability. You've always been good at taking advantage of me while I'm vulnerable. I cried about you twice in a matter of 72 hours. And it was heavy, gross, man-crying. I cried because i miss you, and who we used to be, and what we shared, and the memories we made together. I miss it. I miss you. It was the first time I cried about us since we broke up 4 and a half months ago. But the person you turned into, I can no longer love. The person you've allowed yourself to become, I just can't stomach your words without feeling disgusted. You abandoned me. You left for NY, and you stayed there. You told me you were done with where we called home, and that I had to make a choice between staying here, or moving there. You wanted me to quit my job again, you wanted me to put everything on hold again, you wanted to put our financial foundation at jeopardy AGAIN, so you could have what you wanted. We would have been out and in our own place by now if you didn't fucking leave. You left me. I just sealed the envelope by ending us. You kidnapped my daughter, and are stonewalling me from being in her life. You told me you were going to be back in 2 weeks, but then stayed there. I haven't seen my daughter in 5 months TO THIS DAY, and I have sent so many emails begging to see my kid. I have begged desperately to be a part of her life. But then you say ""You'd see your child a lot more, and would have seen her a lot more if you dropped the case."" but that's extortion. so, middle finger to you. I told you that any single parent would want the other parent to be a part of the picture just so each parent can get a break from being a parent for a little bit. But it looks like you're trying to take this on all by yourself. I've began writing to my daughter so she can know some day that I thought about her while her mother kept her away from me. You were going to start working here with me full time, and we would have been making almost 4k a month together. I got my yearly raise, but I'd bet money that you don't give a fuck about that. Our daughter would have been in daycare, and we'd be saving up for a place to stay, and life would be absolutely splendid... Just like it was when you used to work here with me, and at the other place we worked together! Oh yeah, remember when you lost your job, and I got you hired at MY job at the time? yeah, just another way I significantly helped you mentally, emotionally, and financially. But yeah, fuck me, right? My point being. You're an lying, kidnapping, controlling, narcissistic asshole. But for some reason, I still fucking love you. I don't know if we'll ever reconcile, but if we do, I think it'll be nice to kiss you again, and to fuck you again. And the cuddles too, fuck me I loved cuddling you. And the conversations... sigh. k bye. i said all i needed to."

Close to two months. Which means its probably been 3 since I started writing you in this sub. I still dont understand how one can be so cruel as to let so much time pass without a whisper after everything we shared. I dont really count your one reply/angry accusations/rejection as a conversation. Its the most pain Ive ever felt in my life. To be honest Im not sure Im even at a place yet where I could talk to you. I thought I saw you from a distance the other day and my chest tightened and my breath sped up. Theres still too much going on for me to properly focus on healing. Its going to be a while. You seen just fine though... you seem to have skipped right along with your life without a thought of me or the others you left sitting in vulnerability and sheer disappointment. I wonder if you even think of us? Somedays Im angry. Somedays tears still well up in my eyes. Sometimes I smile a bit if I pass you. Somedays I feel at peace. Most days Im still a little bit sick to my stomach and sore in my head. Last we spoke you told me at this point my silence would be cruel and I dont want to be that person . Except then you went silent again. Your silence has always been cruel. It was cruel 4 years ago, and it has been every time youve implemented it since. "

I'll call you, before you have the chance to call me in the early hours of 2019. I'll call you, while under the influence, like you've voice called and video called me many times before. Only this time, I'll have it all carefully planned out with what to say to you. I'll tell you that before 2018 is over, you deserve to know anything and everything. Starting with that I love you. I do. You were right about this all along. I don't know how you knew you loved me, and how you were so SURE of this, with time separating us, but wow. You knew, before I'd come to terms with it. I realised this year, all of this year, that I've loved you. I've just been trying to come to terms with it, myself. I've been trying to figure out how to TELL you this. I've been trying to be someone that's deserving of you. Its been you. It's always been you. And maybe, in this stage of your life, you still feel the same for me as you did last year. Maybe you don't. Or maybe you're unsure. But you deserve to know how I feel. You deserve the same transparency. And that I'm always going to be sorry for what I did a few years ago, for us to lose contact. But I also know that we won't move forward from it, until you admit that I hurt you and you can forgive me for it. I'm trying here, I really am. You know, I realise how much vulnerability you showed me, in admitting you love me. And I realise, the more I try and pull those walls down, that it was INCREDIBLY hard for you to do so. I think the world of you, I honestly do. You're adventurous, funny, sweet, generous, and kind. And I know you probably believe you're not good enough for me, because I finished high school and went to university, whereas you dropped out and pursued a trade. I'm the girl that's always weighed up the risks and walked on the safe side, whereas you're the boy that runs headfirst into anything and asks questions later. I know you've made plenty of mistakes in your time; but you are not your mistakes. When I look at you, I don't see you for your mistakes. I'm most scared of you not knowing any of this, and one day down the track, one of us will settle down with someone else. And by then, it'll be too late for us. For you to know this. But I can't not tell you all of this. I'm going to finish off 2018 by telling you all this. Before I hang up, I'll tell you that it's up to you to decide what to do with everything I've just told you, but I won't be playing the same games in 2019.

576,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,An honest and vulnerable letter to my mother,1,a851cc,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/a851cc/an_honest_and_vulnerable_letter_to_my_mother/,2018-12-21 12:37:35,"Quick background. Writing is somewhat new to me in the sense that I now am taking it seriously while enjoying it. Here is a letter that I started on Mother's Day for my mom. I can't stop editing, adding and redacting. So, I thought I'd see what strangers thought about it. I know I still need to break this down into more paragraphs, but here is the rough deal. &amp;#x200B; # Mothers Day (Part 1) Ive been sitting in this coffee shop for an hour trying to imagine what its like to be a parent. Trying to find an original means of saying the same thing everybody else tells their parent on a day like Mothers Day. You know, the sort of things you say on a specific day and in a specific way. Almost as if the point was an exercise in narrative vs. a vulnerable expression of sincerity. Im sure youve noticed that I have very little patience for most holidays and forced social situations. No matter the occasion, I find it almost unbearable forcing myself into buying a card and filling it with clich empty sentences. Or even worse, dressing up in clothing designed to show others a sense of respect; yet this very same clothing holds nothing of the sort for my own comfort. I somehow feel worse about the situation when I give in whereas if I do nothing about it I at least feel honest. In this kind of social behavior honesty, sincerity and authenticity - the very character spectrum we shade our identity with  serve as a monochromatic means for predicting each others behavior. To confirm and solidify our roles and identity within ourselves and against others. So much so that our identities become defined by the past so we dont take time to observe ourselves now. We find ourselves stuck to our script, all the while doing our best not to be seen rolling our eyes at the fact that weve already read these lines aloud many times. And, at the fact that we have to be in character in relation to the other actors in the room; who by the way are also whispering to themselves in this same bored tone. I cant help but feel annoyed when I am expected to work in these hired situations; even if for a moment. When we engage ourselves in such an automatic feedback system, we become mechanical. Our sense of humanity and ability to honestly connect with loved ones falls to the feet of social calculation. We no longer express love as a sense of discovery. Instead, we apply it as if it were grease for our social wheels. And though society needs its fair share of grease at times, the act of expressing ones dynamic, or self, can only manifest in others once one is honest within themselves. We all recognize false and forced attempts of connection and emotion. One either feels love or they dont. You cannot be convinced to love. This is why Christianity produces so much hypocrisy. This is why too many people are getting married and 1/5 o them are getting divorced. Our culture has settled in on a fixation for love and life while choosing to ignore anger and death. We fail to recognize that existence is many things but one suchness. We have culturally decided to favor one side of the equations so much so that we now manufacture it. We shun their polar opposites and act surprised once they play out their portion. We say its a shame that somebody should feel anger; or what a pity it is that they died. We cling to love and life until weve cut the natural circulation from it, and then in a brief moment of honesty we see our true emotions. And in most cases it scares the hell out of us; so we distract ourselves once again. True expression should never be called upon, never dutiful, never employed, never exploited and never utilized. When we insistently implore others to connect with us, that is, to insist that they love us, respect us and so on, the art of expressing an individuals interpretation of experience and relationship is diminished and in turn becomes one of duty. There is no love in this place. There is no sense of honesty here. It is with these kinds of ignorant acts that we continue to further embed an unbalanced social mold by emphasizing empty ritual instead of a true introspective sense of unity. To shift this kind of cultural conditioning we would have to acknowledge and celebrate both love and anger. Both life and death. A shift in attitude and in a fundamental understanding as to what and where we are. There is no doubt in my mind that this stifled way of connecting with each other is the very same manner in which most love God, and too, how God loves man. Keep that in the back of your mind for later. The more I sit here and think about giving in to the obvious and easy ways of how a son is expected to behave towards his mother, the more I want to turn away from the whole ordeal. A boring game in which the rules state I must say and do these things on this day so that mom knows you care. So that mom feels as if she played her role properly. This is not love. This is the antithesis of love. A controlled game in which there is no risk. After all, risk is a sort of balancing factor, an unknowingly integral participant, the unknown, one of many veins that flow to a state of mind wherein love is bestowed upon any who discover themselves in another. You cannot separate risk and love because fundamentally they are two aspects of the same outcome. When you understand one, the other is understood by implication. It is within the dark space of risk that love shines so brightly. Without this space, love would have no relation, no contrast and no background to recognize it against. And of course, the same goes for vulnerability or risk. Without a fluctuation of love we wouldnt recognize the human experience; which suffering is equally a part of and should be respected as such. So, instead of praising and adoring your character, I will instead attempt to do something much more meaningful. And though fundamentally existence does not flow with such concepts as meaning, conceptually we do. We animals, we humans thrive on reason and purpose. We have this marvelous ability to reach into a void of consciousness and materialize abstractions with our actions. And so, with my words, I will show you that you exist through me, through my words, through the beating of my heart and through the shining of the sun. I cannot think of anything more enjoyable than this kind of human interaction. In order to do so, I must introduce to you my current philosophies on life, consciousness and the underlining fundamentals of what it is to exist, to love, and the overall human experience. Now, I know my approach may seem a bit odd, out there, weird or even esoteric at times. You might even wonder if I was the one who really wrote this. The Jason you know usually behaves in a manner that correlates with certain factors that define the Mother/Son relationship. However, I assure you that the comfort and beauty one normally finds within familiar words will at least be found within my intent and symbolism behind the words Ive chosen to use. My use of extreme measures and dramatic talk shouldnt be taken too literally. Instead, understand this is my way of getting a point across. Most importantly, no matter how much you understand, or dont understand, what I am attempting to say, know that my intent, exploration of life and passion in explaining my philosophies are done so with your light of compassion guiding the way. Also, let me emphasize that I am not trying to convince you of anything. I am not making any claims or proposing anything that isnt already within every human walking the earth. I am not claiming to have something others dont. I am not saying that any level of consciousness or existence should, or could, be obtained. And most importantly, I am not preaching. I am merely acting as the finger pointing at the dandelion. If you become fixated on the finger pointing you will miss the point of the finger. # Mothers Day (Part 2) Nobody truly wants control of what it is to exist, to live or to love. We might think we do when we live strictly by our senses and emotions, but if we had complete control we would always have a sense of already having lived this current life, as mentioned above in my dramatic situational examples. This is the same reason we dont finish a card or board game once the future of the game is determined. Once weve seen the outcome before the game has officially come to an end, we consider the remainder to be known; and, all that is known is of the past. Like a story told a second time, the variables have been stripped and the act of carrying on becomes methodical. Just like in these games, the same goes in our life. Uncontrolled variables are what allow us to feel a sense of self. This is because uncontrolled variables create a sense of other; thereby also giving a sense of self. Otherwise, life would feel boring, mixed up and pointless. You wouldnt know who you are because the factors that are out of your control, which give way to the ones that are, would meld into a boring state of affairs in which there was no sense of self and other. This is why love is so highly regarded. Love is trusting a person to willingly live and act in a manner which allows us to recognize ourselves in them. Giving yourself to the notion that you exist in others, but only finding out so by their willingness to show you, is one of the most beautiful experiences one can have. This goes back to the fluctuation of love and risk. Two sides of the same wave. Love is a spectrum which, in all forms, is a game of hide and seek. One where we seek to find ourselves hiding within others. And, the game becomes boring if you are told where to hide and that you must play. So, with this bit of writing I have chosen to hide where and when I please. Here I will express my side of our relationship with a selfish  therefore true, honest and vulnerable approach to the dynamic that is Lori/Jason. Here I will not rehash the past. I will not explain away my actions with my filter of experience known as Jason. And I will not coddle our relationship with desirable moments in which most of us tend to cling to. No number of cards or flowers could possibly express the true connection that our existence is based on. An attempt to bring an organic moment back into our narrow view of consciousness is like one who becomes frustrated in trying to groom their reflection. In both cases there is no true sense of who and where you are. In attempting to do either of these one lacks a basic understanding in that there is no centralized you that can reach into a reflection, of time or self, in order to access a particular version of you. The moment we cast an expectation in conjuring a past experience is the moment in which we bind the possibility of said experiences from happening again. And in those moments when we have fooled ourselves by thinking weve brought a desired feeling, moment or place into being, it always leaves us feeling slightly disappointed. Like we arent quite where we wanted to be. The truth is you never brought about such a desired moment, place or connection. At least, not the immediate narrowly conscious you. Why is this? How could such a centralized feeling, such as I, not be the driving force in which we can recreate happiness? After all, wasnt it I who felt the enjoyment of experience? This is because if something must happen, must being a conceptual and theoretical force motivating action, we look to our ego  which is a useful but incomplete view of self. Ego is a socially derived process, comprised by conceptual roll playing married to a physical sensation in space, and felt as a centralized access point - which we refer to as I, or identity. This naturally gives birth to a sense of responsibility by way of separation from all that is not our immediate sense of self. This sensation of ego, identity, and self are motivating factors that transpose our thoughts into our immediate physical environment; but only so far as its direct relationship with its immediate environment will serve. But who is it serving? And to what extent does it define the idea of self? This goes much deeper and I will explore this later. For now, understand this to be my point. When we realize there is no such thing that must be done, and that this must is really just a conceptually comprised pressure of thought feeding thought, we allow our ego to dissolve and our natural flow of emotions, words and honesty may naturally trickle to our fingertips so that we may write; or our lips, so that we may speak. And guess what. This is what you have always done. At no time has your identity made a feeling happen. At no time has your identity loved, hated, or created another human being. The same happens when an individual masters a certain skill. This is a person who realizes *they* cannot make the paint go where it *should* go because *they*, as an ego, cannot extend outside of the conceptual world where the ego is applicable. And, this idea of should is nothing more than a desire and concept in their egos mind. This is a person who understands that creating art involves much more than identity. This is a person who understands how they are interconnected to all else. An individual who understands the way in which art manifests from the inside out. Who truly understands the extent of what it is to be human. Art is created when there is the realization that no one or thing is leading the dance. A human representation in which the ebb and flow of all existence is reflected upon itself as if it were saying, here I am."

I love your resilience, strength and passion, and that youre not afraid to show vulnerability, that youre human. I love how occasionally you will let your mask slip. I love how you stick up for me when people tease me. I feel like my world is physically brighter when you are there, and an inexplicable energy when we touch. You told me that you lose your filter when youre around me, and I feel the same. I feel so off my head on oxytocin that I dont really know what Im thinking, or saying. I hate you being stressed, or miserable, and I know I could remedy that, yet Im limited by what is appropriate at this time. I feel that you may feel the same, but I know you would never say anything, and neither can I.

In more ways than one... I cannot reflect back to when we first met without being reminded of the quote in fight club, ""You met me at a very strange time in my life."" I was beginning to recognize my vulnerability in some areas while still very unaware of how many more I had to uncover and overcome... Have to still overcome. You have been with me through my recovery journey so far and I really cannot thank you enough for being my support through it. Still supporting me... There are things I want to tell you that I know you would rather hear yourself, or at least wouldn't mind, but I feel like that might be a little too much pressure if I said it. I already feel like you've taken some of my other words to heart more than I'd like and you don't need that kind of weight right now. You are the last person I want to hurt. That's why I can't tell you that you are the main reason I have not gone through with killing myself since I have known you. Especially while you were on the other side of the world. I could not imagine the sadness and helplessness you would have felt if I had. Not to mention the identity crisis I bet you would have had afterword. No, I could not have left you like that. And I can't tell you now either. I can't tell you because that also means I had reached points where I was willing to leave my family, significant other (who I've been with 4x as long as I've known you), and pet(s). Those were the times I think I cried by hardest, when I was willing to leave them but not you. The pain of not wanting to hurt you and not wanting to exist at the same time was unbearable. I just kept telling myself that you needed me as much as I needed you. However I really don't think that was all of it either. I've been afraid to admit it, but honestly, I love you. I think I might be in love with you. But I know I can't be. Shouldn't be, not right now. And that's the main reason I've kept my distance from you. I know you might not believe it, but I have always found you attractive. Attractive, kind, wise, patient... And that's why I couldn't let myself get close because frankly, you were a threat to my current relationship. (A relationship that I have begun to more consciously question than before because of my healing.) There is just so much involved that makes it complicated and tense in different ways. All I know is that the tension I experience around you is one I do not mind. It is not the type of tension that follows an argument. It is a comfortable tension that I like experiencing. I enjoy sitting in that tension with you and I wonder if you feel that way too. I have no idea what is in our futures. We both have other people in our lives that we really care about as well. I just wantted to say that I will be happy as long as we can stay best friends with you to talk to and be there for each other. Even if my relationship doesn't end up working out and you are with someone else, I will be happy as long as I know you are happy. I just want to be able to be here for you. Sincerely, Yours"
579,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,To my secret lover and workmate. Now I know you're a narcissist. Please show me I'm wrong.,1,a8ki3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/a8ki3s/to_my_secret_lover_and_workmate_now_i_know_youre/,2018-12-22 23:36:56," M Despite so many tries to show you my remorse and vulnerability and to be mindful of the potential trauma exacerbated by the situation at hand, youve refused to offer any real chance to talk. It seems youve have chosen a path of silent treatment and discard to me. I use these terms very succinctly. These are forms of physiological abuse and punishment. Even if a relationship is over, warm, caring, heartfelt people do not do this. This wasnt no contact, to protect yourself. Instead you set an ultimatum where you would only recommence communications once you felt that I had been sufficiently exposed, shamed and punished for alleged misdemeanours in front of my business partner. I suspect you were even trying to use me to cultivate this person as a new source of supply after discarding me; to enlist a negative advocate in D. This was just a worsening of the emotional withholding and attempted isolation we cycled through in C and I noted while you were visiting T. Again, warm, caring, heartfelt people just do not do this to someone they have loved. Nor would they isolate someone they care for, to ultimately be left to conclude such things of you!! I believed we had a real bond. There were deep meaningful feelings on both sides; feelings that could really be hurt. But now you act in an abusive manner of control, punishment, avoidance, disempowerment and a shame gaming. By blocking me, youre repudiating my very existence and denied any expression of either of our feelings or needs. You insist that I am THE hurtful person. However in choosing the silent treatment what else can I think but that you seek to evoke pain and suffering in me in order to derive supply to feed your self-esteem and control. Nice people, even if incompatible and parting ways just never do this to one another. Unfortunately for you though, from the outset, this is a game Im sadly all too familiar with. I am no mind reader, and as long as I do not receive any answers, it is not my job, nor responsibility to analyse the message you may actually be trying to address by your silence. You shouldn't expect from anyone to read your mind. It is up to you right misunderstandings or to set the record straight. And a good person would strive to be caring to do. Independent of anything you feel I may have said or done, what you have done is beyond any acceptable boundaries and will not be tolerated. If you ever decide to adjust your behaviour, and open up I promise I will be respectful, supportive, not be angry, nor will I take advantage. I remain prepared to reset, to compromise, but this is *mission impossible* as long as I don't get a clear answer and you dont show signs contrary these conclusions. Sadly, for me this is how the situation now rests and I will move forward in work and life accordingly. S"
580,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Snowflakes are caterpillars,1,a8mkvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/a8mkvm/snowflakes_are_caterpillars/,2018-12-23 04:23:12,"(I have hundreds of letters I've sent to people over the years. I even have all the letters they responded back with. Some of these letters I never sent. Mostly because I was afraid I was being too romantic and I was trying to turn it into a poetic fantasy. This is one of those letters. I only edited our names.) Miss D, The sun is rising. The cats are weary, drenched in cold and rain. I can see traffic from my window. Life is busy, always busy, even at this terrible time of the morning. While gulping down my coffee, staring out my window (which Ill send you a picture), a thought came to my brain. *Death is for the living, not the dead.* I want to think that is something profound, but Im sure it means nothing. Outside my window, I can see glimpses of buildings, shopping arenas, congested traffic, horns honking, the sirens of an ambulance, a dog far in some distance barking. I wonder what sound is like for fleas. Here it is - out my window - the theater of amusements. The theater has a purpose. Its purpose is to create a mystical experience out of life so that we are somehow special and the universe is always aware of us. None are right, all are wrong. My love, all is love. We are all beautiful and we are all dead. I started to think of time travel. Energy, light particles, flashes of space. Since the Sun, galaxy, planets are constantly moving, we are always in a new part of space where nothing has been before, so if you were to travel in the past or future, you would end up in space because the Earth is no longer there. Maybe space and time are linked. So if you travel to the past you end in space on a collision course with Earth. If you travel to the future, you end up millions of miles in space behind the Earth. These are the silly thoughts that press into my weird brain while overdosing on coffee. I imagine Google reading the things you look up on the internet and messaging you and asking: *We noticed you seem to be having feelings of hopelessness. Would you like us to send over a friend?* That thought is both amusing and scary to me. I am spiraling. We are spiraling. I think God is an atomic molecule. We are within a multiverse, a parallel universe in which we are immortal and forever repeating an endless cycle, simultaneously young and old and bright and star-fed and alive and dead like a record that spins and spins at hundreds of miles per second only to start over again and again and again. This life is like millions of records playing different versions of your life, like the black holes in the center of everything, spinning the spiraling universe towards the edge of cognitive phenomenons created through illusionary and magical physics, maintained by poetic philosophy that softens the loneliness of consciousness. I feel small and insignificant. My truth seems so very subjective and completely useless. I know nothing. Maybe thats the best way to act. To know that you will never know anything. But love and lust are within me. Those are values I can understand. There is truth in some illusions. Though mostly they are false pretensions manifested to give me some semblance of significance. We are the syphilis. The dissonance between deviant abstractions. Bred into complacency like cattle. Manipulated by codes and customs. Genetically engineered to commit suicide. We are mathematical, cosmic, spaceless. Infected with reasoning and logic. Our ghost are mad. A psychosis brews. Escape is irrelevant. We are tied to these infantile distresses and fears. The general will of humanity is stupidity and conformity that chains itself to a constant and pure ideology of fear. Love though, love is the seeking of truth even when there probably is none. In this world, we are cybernetic junkies tied to lustful simulations. Poetic robots with laser brains. Talking orchids in a burning forest. I think sometimes thats my journey. To get out of this bondage, escape into wilderness, to break free from the wastelands. I keep myself grounded in hopes to find something that connects with me. An adventure. It cant all be hopeless, I think, if love still exist within us. It seems you have been on the same adventures of seeking a type of wild abandonment as well. We both seem to be very rebellious. A natural seeker of the wildness we find in nature and in the stars. I feel the same resentment towards consumerism. I want to strike it all down. Mostly though, I laugh at how silly it all really seems. I dont feel anything magical or fulfilling about civilization or the people who worship it. I feel like it was made for them and not me. Like how certain movies or television shows have a demographic they are trying to entice. I feel the same way about holidays, civilization, politics, communities around me. They were made for someone else. Im only standing here because Ive been molded by the same institutions. I feel like an animal caged in a zoo. These worlds, conversations, jobs, they all seem superficial to me. Plastic and unreal. There is no substance. It feels empty. Maybe they, the people around me, feel the same way. Maybe they are just better at pretending. Maybe everyone is just an actor or actress on the stage that everyone has forgotten is a stage. The audience is a sea of placid faces. Porcelain mask cracking near the eyes and mouth. Everyone is waiting for the applause to die down so they can start a new soliloquy. I cant be any different than them. They are just as human as me. They have fears and worries and love and hopes and dreams. I cant bring myself to hate them so instead I hate the indoctrination. I like to think you can be molded out of ignorance. You can be represented by love. Thats the poet inside of me. To see some hope in all of this. To find that humanity is something worth saving. Most days I feel only indifference. What in the fuck are we going to do with one another? I really have no idea where my intimacy hides. I think Ive forgotten. Id have to find it again. Ive tried to remember what it was like to be next to a woman, to feel her body on mine, her hands and eyes and breast pushed up against me. The wave of lustful rivers when you press yourself inside someone. The gentle moans, the soft words, the ecstasy on your tongue, the way your pores open up, your eyes dilate, your body merged within another body. She is a cup that I pour myself inside of. I have those memories but the memories are shadows. Like seeing a shape of something far in the distance but I cant really tell what it is anymore. If my dreams are any indication of anything - they keep telling me that something is close - theres a wildness inside them these days. A passion. Like Im being haunted. I wake up and I smile at the idea of being possessed by that spirit. No exorcism necessary. I welcome these lusting demons. I have the same fears of intimacy. I dont know if Im strong enough for them. But, theres intimacy inside these letters and conversations we have. Theres vulnerability in this. Those are the chances we have to take as human beings. To create is to give yourself to something else. Its not a weakness, its a strength. Maybe you are afraid because of all the mischief in the world. Con Men and magicians are everywhere. They have pockets full of tricks. I think we eventually give in as we melt further into all of this. Before long the fear becomes an excitement. A bonding of muse and poet. The thunder in the belly. Theres a difficulty in lovers. The way we seem to shed our pretensions to find value within ourselves. We are seekers. Always faithful to the spirit. We wish to find that which connects us to something that gives us a familiarity we can bond within. To feel safe and comfortable in the intimacy of others. My spirituality is never really consistent. Mostly my insecurities that I project. I just feel so goddamn lost sometimes. I feel this loneliness around people, more powerful than I feel when Im alone. It feels silly to me that I can connect with you so effortlessly, yet, I find no love for those around me. I feel sorry for people more than I dislike them. Its a pity. Thats such a bastard thing to admit because it makes me look like Im somehow better than them. I dont feel better than them, I just dont really find anything interesting about them. Im not really interested in the human condition as much as Im interested in the experience of magic and poetic realism. I imagine you feel the same way as I do. We are both phantoms seeking a connection in a world of animate properties. Whatever that may mean. Your darkly ghost, \-b"
581,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,You Got Jealous,1,a9h0uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/a9h0uk/you_got_jealous/,2018-12-26 05:23:57,I know its hard on you. Having me far away. Feeling like our lives only intertwine when Im there with you. It eats me up a lot of days. Knowing how far away you are and what all we are missing out on. This is new territory for me. Im not used to having so much time on my hands when Im in a relationship. I usually balance my friends and my SO. But with me being so far from you I often have to find ways to fill the time. Last night you got jealous and hung up the phone on me. Your not usually so immature but in your defense you had been drinking all day. You were upset because I went out with a friend who Ive known for a decade. One I try to meet up with every so often. He isnt a threat to you. Not even a little bit. After we talked about boundaries I made sure to be more vocal about my relationship with you with my male friends. When him and I were out I showed him photos of you and talked about how happy having you in my life makes me. I talked about my trip with you. I showed him that great photo of you at a party entertaining an entire group. He got a good laugh from it mainly because he teases me about doing the same thing. Usually explaining some concept to a group of people. My informal lectures as the resident know it all in my friend group. When you called I was actually in the midst of talking about you. You were being drunk and obnoxious but confessed your love for me... which he overheard. He also heard me tell you in my patient tone that I loved you too. Im not sure what is going on with you but I know something is. Im going to try to talk with you about it when we catch up later this week. You are drinking more which means you are masking something. What is it? I adore you. I want you to be happy and healthy. I am scared to talk with you about whats going on with you because Im afraid Ill sound like a nag or that you will assume Im judging you. We have been through some tough times together and I know you will pull through this like you always do. You want a life with me and I want it too. But we need to get whatever is weighing on you out in the open. You can talk to me without being drunk. I promise I savor those moments when you show your emotions because it is brave.Its brave to show vulnerability without alcohol. Its brave to be honest and take a look at yourself and truly examine whats going on. Hang in there. Everything will be okay. I promise. I only have eyes for you. Once I set my mind on something I am a force to be reckoned with. Ive had my mind set on you. I have so much patience when it comes to you. I understand. I dont want to fix you but I know that when we are together it brings the best out of both of us. I love you. Remember that when you are uncertain and insecure. Im protecting our relationship and Im not letting anyone get in the way of the life I want... with you.
582,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,"Andrew,",1,aahie6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/aahie6/andrew/,2018-12-29 14:25:20,"Its been over three weeks since, in our very last contact, you said you felt like didnt really know me. Three weeks since so many hopeful beliefs you had single-handedly instilled in meabout you, about the prospect of healthy relationships, about love, and trust, and vulnerabilitywere completely obliterated. Its been five weeks since I made this account. It was supposed to just be a throwaway but its become a place to go when I feel overwhelmed with thoughts about/feelings for you. Its been over nine weeks since we broke up. 12 weeks since we last kissed. God, I miss kissing you. I know that your intentions in telling V the things you did were to hurt me and my closest friendship and I genuinely do hope that it makes you feel some control over the whole situation to know that you succeeded at both. I dont think she will ever forgive meI think she believes the lies you told her and I dont think our friendship will ever be the same. You effectively took my oldest and most loyal friend away from me. And you hurt me. Oh, you hurt me. But not only in the way you intended. Of course it hurts to know that V is mad at me. It hurts to know that Ive lost her friendship. Thats a hard blow. The hardest blow, though? That was the removal of hope; the belief in romance and trust. And maybe knowing that would make you feel some satisfaction. Maybe I should tell you that for real. Because, quite frankly, since you betrayed the most solid trust Id ever felt in my life, Ive felt very little motivation to go on. And its different than a depressive suicidal ideation. Its more just a general sense that nothing really matters because I really have nothing to be aiming for anymore. The deepest desire of my heart is actually, truly, definitively impossible. The knock out punch, though, was the confirmation that I cant trust my feelings. Ive based my whole adult life on trusting my gut and believing I was justified in my emotions. Thinking, in fact, that my ability to be in tune with my feelings was my only strength. Even in my dull, hazy, depressive state, when experts were advising me to make decisions that went against my feelings; when I didnt have the strength or energy to physically disobey, internally I still believed that once I got better, Id have the vitality to stand up for the validity of my feelings and make a case for following my heart. In a final, devastating uppercut, your revenge proved the therapists right and in doing so robbed me of the *one* thing I actually liked about myself. Ive been trying, these past couple of weeks, to figure out if there is anything else I truly, deep down, find redeeming about myself. But there isnt. Right now, I really feel like, even in my mentally healthy states, Im resigned to an existence where I pretend not to be repulsed by myself, and where Im forced to regularly make decisions that categorically go against what I think might make me feel good. I absolutely concede that this isnt really on you. But I think it might make you feel a bit of satisfaction to know that you helped me along to this state of being. There is zero doubt that Im more miserable than you will ever be. "

I'm terrified at your lack of enthusiasm for me, despite what you say to the contrary. Do you realize that what you say and what you do need to match? And because of how much you've hurt me in the past, you need to work even harder to help me learn to trust you again? If you realize it, you sure don't show it. You express your interest in me with this air of ""ugh"" about you. As if I'm someone to be disappointed in being in love with, someone to hide away. I've seen such enormous beauty in small moments with you. Moments when you've allowed yourself to be earnest and sincere and simply be you. That's what made me fall for you, those little cracks of light in the darkness. Before everything went so fucky, we were surprisingly good friends. You helped me through some tough times and taught me how much I'm worth. And yet, now, after all this time and irritation- after all the pain you've caused me and whatever pain I've caused you in return- it's still my job to be the one to start the conversations. It's my job to help you grow. It's my job to do all the work, wait around for your dragging feet, put up with sleepless obsessive nights alone while thoughts and confusion about you linger relentlessly in my head. All that's on me. You built up my self esteem to expect to be treated well by romantically interested partners, and yet you can't do that for me. &amp;#x200B; Honestly darling, it's too much fucking work. I'm tired. I adore you, but we simply aren't a match. I need enthusiasm, I need sincerity and vulnerability with my partner. I need to FEEL like they see me in a positive light, without question. All I get with you are questions and insecurity. The only time I feel loved is when you fuck me. &amp;#x200B; And out of 7 billion people on this planet, I'm sure I can find someone who fits with me more. So sure, leave me on read darling. It's what your best at. &amp;#x200B; That, by the way, is ICE behavior. Leaving someone on read mid conversation. Mid EMOTIONAL (oh no, scary emotions!) conversation. I'm not here for that shit anymore. I'm just not. I hope you find someone less complicated and more patient that I. I'm looking to enjoy my future romances, not be tormented by them. Looking forward to no longer fucking you and getting back to being friends. I love you so damned much, but baby, I'm not your therapist."

Simply, you are not the person I thought you were.and, you are definitely not the person you think you are. I expect my letter to be ignored, just as I recklessly ignored the feeling inside urging me to protect myself when you messaged me on Facebook years ago. I wish I could have a second chance to meet you again for the first time so I could run like hell to avoid the poison that lives inside of you that I allowed to poison me. I am not broken ..why did you try to convince me that I was? Because you are broken? You are a coward whom would rather impress a stranger than be loved by your own family, whom was never a place of safety or comfort for his own wife INTENTIONALLY, and left me asking myself why you awakened feelings within me that you never intended on taking care of? No excuse or lie can satisfy this; patterns of your actions and words did, so thank you for not putting forth much effort into pretending to be someone you are not for longer than you did (the beginning must have been a difficult time for you to pretend to be a caring human being). It is sickening how quickly things changed once there was something tying me to you. The normal narcissistic cycle played out just as everyone/research said it would. My acceptance (finally) of who you are rather than who you pretended to be and never were was game changing for both of us. I do hope you read this; I was unheard for too long. I have unexpressed feelings from the chaos, abuse, and dysfunction that came along with you. I don't expect that it matters to you; otherwise, you wouldn't have done what you did repeatedly. This is for me to finally process and get rid of it. I have been torn deciding if I should lay it all out for you or just hope it goes away without you knowing the honest to God truth for myself to gain closure...but, I am quickly reminded that this letter is not written for you; its written for me. I distinctly remember you telling me in the beginning that _________ taught you to tell the truth because then you didn't have to remember what you said. Remember? What about you telling me you didn't like getting mad because you said mean things when mad? So psychopath-like that you CONTINUALLY tore me down about how sharp my tongue is..so was yours AND you admitted awareness of it YET tried making me feel badly for it IN EVERY FIGHT with suddenly no responsibility of your own? Do you recall the ongoing discussion before moving to ______ about my fears of relying on someone and the vulnerability I felt moving away from my support system/everything I know and your reassurance that you can be trusted (which confirms you've manipulated and lied from day one)? How about the awful words about my relationship with ______ (that I pray you burn in hell for and even the lowest would not allow to come out of their mouth) and the raw wound you ripped open so many times when your uncontrolled anger came out of your mouth? Let's not forget the silent treatment you used as a childish, absolutely dehumanizing poison THAT IS ABUSIVE AND NOT NORMAL UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, which happened to be your pathetic go-to attempts at making me guess what was so awful within me that you couldn't even act as if I'm a human being and what did I do so wrong to feel nonexistent to my husband, as well to spin any situation by not arguing with me so blame was shifted to me for wanting to argue, and amazingly enough, the only issue then became my fault and yours continued on unaddressed .. FYI: Psychologically abusive fucks like you know EXACTLY the manipulative games you play. Fun fact: Using the silent treatment is just one requirement on the pathological relationship agenda. No one EVER deserves to feel unworthy of attention or love .. Not even one time. Why was I unworthy countless times (even after you acknowledged AND APOLOGIZED) for the hurt it was causing inside of me? Is it coincidental that other narcissists find joy in seeing someone struggle? It makes sense now that it boosted your false sense of superiority when things were difficult for me and the enjoyment it must have given you watching (and a lot of times intentionally caused) by yourself. I understand now too the reasons you attacked the things I value the most (______, fear of relying on someone, ongoing throwing in my face of all you did for me but never once recall the things I did for you, ever); that is what narcissists prey on! It turns my insides to think that you will (or probably already are) invalidating and arguing with your girlfriend when she innocently speaks her hurt feelings to you that she is wrong in how she feels. Give her my number; shell need it someday. She doesnt even know what awaits her. TIP OF THE DAY: You are wrong in thinking you get to argue someone elses feelings and thoughts. Normal people understand the fundamental concepts of honesty and kindness. NO ADULT SHOULD NEED TO BE TOLD HOW THEY ARE MAKING OTHER PEOPLE FEEL. It was no coincidence that you targeted what I value most, as those are the things I will defend most passionately, it was intentional..I trusted the part you were playing early on and naively believed the lies you told of not wanting to ruin things by having sex, you didnt want to get mad because you would say mean things, and I ate that garbage with a spoon believing you were my dream come true and not like the controlling relationship I'd just gotten out of  You were right, you arent like anyone else, you are so so much worse. What did you hope to gain by devaluing me? You said unimaginably horrible things to me and mocked my tears. I let those demeaning phrases take hold of me. I let them convince me that I was everything you told me I was. How is that you can say you love me, but yet are capable of leaving me in tears, having no mercy, because in your mind, I was always the problem, not you? You make the people who love you most hurt in small, mean, cowardly ways. I remember the way you would talk about my friends and family and how I couldnt tell you anything about their lives because you would be so quick to judge. I remember how you told me I was a bad person for associating with bad people. I remember you insisting over and over that they were terrible and never being able to understand your reasons. Why? You didnt know them! I once saw myself as a strong person. I have survived hard things, but the level of stress you placed got heavy quick. I began to question and doubt everything - the silent treatments when I challenged you, the hiding behind emails and texts when in the same fucking house, and the belittling of my existence. I sought counseling to find ways to regain the control you had on my mood, emotions, and self-esteem. The feelings of insecurity I took on while with you make complete sense to me now .. You liked it that way. You tried putting out my inner light because you hate me; hatred that grew as my realization of who you truly are unfolded. You should know that there is positivity that came from the lies you told about me and to me, who was really using who, and the total destruction you tried to cause, and the bad qualities brought out in myself, forced me to self reflect and face things I never wanted to visit again and when I got real with myself and realized that you tried making me feel badly for discovering YOUR truth..it all makes perfect sense as to why you tore me down each time you did. How awful to live void of a conscience - why were you mindful when people were watching or listening and ruthless when it was just you and I? What kind of person mocks someone elses pain and tears, especially a childs and his wifes? What kind of person tells a 16yo child that she is a loser? What kind of person refers to his stepdaughter as that pointing in her direction because he is upset at the childs mother? You. I knew something was wrong when you acted in contempt to my children and allowed me to cry inconsolably with no attempt to apologize for something you had done, yet carefully twisted it around to be my fault. I knew then I was dealing with a monster, not a person. I encourage you to remember in the future that the heart gets confused when it is constantly told I love you by the same person who destroys it Everyone sees what you appear to be, few experience what you really are. Your cold words trained me to feel absolutely nothing. During our fights, I did anything possible to not hear your rage yet again, waiting for you to finish. I moved my head just to make you stop. I agreed to everything you said.just to make you stop. I heard you and I had heard it all before a million times. TRUTH: You were wrong and still are! The only truth surrounding this is what an abusive POS you are and attempting to make me feel insignificant was your favorite pastime (besides lying to me about masturbating to porn rather than having sex with me)! Disgusting. I know its your belief that you have not have wronged me in any way. Its truly sad that you are so disconnected from yourself and your own behavior. What kind of douchebag calls an ex to string her along while having a girlfriend and having NO intention of doing anything he says? Does your girlfriend know that you told me how much you love me just a month ago? Does she know that you use my body to masturbate too? How about the lies you were telling me about our future plans (which you had NO intention of carrying out)? She doesnt deserve to begin a relationship on absolute lies; YOU are SICK! Did it ever occur to you how awful I felt when you would put your hands on me? Id have to assume not a bit when my tears would be met with you mocking me. How could you expect that I would want to be your friend? No. I admit that I allowed myself to be treated in these ways because I thought I needed to suffer in order to get love because that is what you groomed me to believe by the way you withheld affection and conditionally gave it. I have worked to retrain my thought process how unhealthy this is and working through the negative thoughts Ive been carrying around was imminent..and freeing. It appears you must be really angry on the inside and I hope you find ways to process and release what is hurting you inside in order to avoid such pain moving forward. Lets talk about MY anger LOL LOL LOL! Once Id mastered one of the qualities youd told me so many times I lacked, the rules to your game changed. There was suddenly something new that was disappointing youa relationship forever off balanceimpossible to ever measure up or find stable ground. Why is it that you are the only person throughout my life who sees all this terribleness in me? Why? If my memory serves me right, it always played out that if I had a reaction you disagreed with, regardless of the fact that I was rightfully angry and hurt; if I attempted to discuss my feelings, I was called crazy, emotional, overreactive, and my VALID pain was minimized and talked over 100% of the time. If your cruelty broke me completely, which it did many, many times, and I screamed and cried or yelled back in your face out of sheer frustration, suddenly that became the focus  MY BEHAVIOR, NEVER YOURS. This became what you repeatedly used against me in all future fights. Where did you learn this? I know it is not part of education, so really, where? One of the largest issues between you and I was as above. My BASIC HUMAN RIGHT was taken away by you no matter how badly you had treated me . You shamed me into believing my voice shouldnt rise or my blood boil . why was the privilege of rage reserved for only you? NEWSFLASH: When people are angry and it is expressed, WHICH WILL HAPPEN TO ANYONE BEING ABUSED AT SOME POINT, (just watch with your girlfriend, it wont be long until you have her in the EXACT SAME GRIDLOCK)..you always jammed it right back down my throat and used my anger against me to prove what an irrational crazy person I am, like a fucking straightjacket. Straight up psychopathic tendency. GUESS WHAT STUPID? Crying, shouting, screaming, and swearing are perfectly normal responses to being abused and repeatedly pushed to the breaking point. When someone is trying to survive in an insufferable environment.narcissists such as yourself pathologically use COMPLETELY NORMAL REACTIONS to an EXTREMELY TOXIC SITUATION as leverage. SICK. Again, I attended the same curriculums you did and know you didnt learn this toxicity there; so where did you learn it? Why did you get upset when I reacted NORMALLY to what you provoked? Exactly, Im certain the answer came quickly. Get fucking help; you destroy people. I remember the onset of true panic was triggered in myself directly by you and we called it love. You know EXACTLY what Im referring too. Goddamn. I do wish that your friends whom you talked badly about me to could be a fly on the wall. I hope you find a friend just like you one day:) These last few things have taken up too much of my time and headspace, so you can have them back. The first being how sick your father must be having knowledge of you taking my keys and phone from me, while screaming at me to leave and then blocking the door; more times than not, chasing me and dragging me back into the house and not allowing me to leave after just ordering me to go; and doing absolutely nothing about it. The codependent enabling sickness that flows between the two of you was confirmed time and time again when your dad allowed me to borrow a vehicle while you held the one I always use hostage because you were mad! My dad would have knocked my fucking teeth out if he knew I was doing that shit to someone! Good fucking luck! Thank you for the laugh at mediation where you tried portraying that you paid a cent to anything for me .. $2150? Did you forget that came from OUR joint tax return that you monopolized every year using MY children that you berated and did NOTHING for? You cannot give away something that is not yours! $825? That is what YOU transferred to ME to purchase paint and tile to complete the bathroom in YOUR house. Grasping at straws is rough isnt it?! Do you know what is easy? The truth! Desperation doesnt flatter even the most beautiful face . Seriously. TRUTH: Not telling me something or hiding something on purpose is just the same as lying. Clear as mud? It's really not difficult to understand, although you used this soooo many pathetic times. The best part about this is that the 2 pairs of eyes that were innocent witnesses to all this dont have to be disgusted with me anymore. They saw it all. They know what a psychopath you are and no one has to pretend it wasnt happening anymore. My kids and I wont have to feel rejection on a daily basis. The rejection and pain you must feel from your own daughter seems ironic. I hate you for making me question myself when the problem was you all along. Last, if you learned anything from me, I hope it is this. I hope you can learn to accept that it is ok to feel what we feel and the importance of someone hearing and accepting things. People need to trust that people arent going anywhere when things arent perfect. We need this simple security in relationships to feel safe. If not, there is a constant feeling of fear that if we honor what we feel, it means a loss of love. _____, your love was fake, but the pain it caused was very real. Best of Luck "

I was afraid, that any kids we might have would have my depression, or my bipolar. I have accepted myself now. I know if they had them it would be a challenge for them, but even with that challenge life is worth living. I got to meet you, I got to fall in love with you the first time we talked. My life was and is worth living. I'm not afraid to have kids, a family now. I want that with you. I want cats, and maybe even a dog... I'm a cat person not a dog person though. I want you to be their mother, and I want you to be my wife. I want romance, I want passion, I want the good and the bad... I want the cuddles, and I want shared colds. Spending time with you is worth any cold. I want to make love to you, and i never want to lose that passion, never want you to feel unwanted. I want to tell you I love you all the time.

I think I'm so patient, so ready to walk away from the thought of you. But then I read something you wrote to me and it takes my breath away. Your honesty. Your vulnerability. The way you write. Your voice. Your just being you. You are so amazing and beautiful. Words elude me to describe how I feel about who you are. And I don't mean the way you look; which yes you are a beautiful woman. I mean who you are on the inside. You take my breath away. And you give it back. Butterflies in my stomach. The air tastes different. Fresher. Cleaner. My heart and mind come alive. I so wish we still talked. Why is it that I am not breaking down and writing you as you used to write to me? But I know why; several months have passed. And the man I am, I respect you. Even though you didn't say goodbye--I would think that after my super short one word text in November and my quick, innocuous and nonchalant voice message a couple weeks ago that you would've reached out if you wanted. Perhaps, I didn't show up as I should have when we last talked. I certainly likely seemed, more or less, emotionally unavailable. Certainly not as wide open as you were in what I read just now. Even though the truth was that I was a bit overwhelmed and scared. Whew. I said it. I think I was just scared. And so many other feelings. Wow, I really miss you, my dear, dearest friend. I don't think our connection was meant to be so transient. I think we were placed in each other's lives for a longer term. You have indelibly effected who I am - and I am grateful to you in ways I am still learning. You have broken down my walls yet again and you have no idea that you've done it. -Me. "

I had you chasing me around town while I enjoyed the single life. I had you wrapped around my finger. You wouldnt go away, and I was vulnerable for attention. Its not like I wasnt getting attention elsewhere though. I thought you were cute, but I needed time to relapse from a difficult break up. Your persistence and my vulnerability led to a relationship. Why would you pursue someone who you cant even marry? I knew you were from Saudi Arabia but the only thing I knew was that women wore niqabs and had few rights. You were a feminist. So I overlooked where you came from, because why should that matter? I grew fond of you so deeply. We moved in together, we became so intricately connected. It didnt matter where you were from; you knew I was an atheist and yet you fell deeper and deeper into love with me. When you intermittently visited home, I realized that youd never tell your family of my existence. How peculiar, I thought. A culture which prides itself on family, and yet your family had no clue about who you really were. A whole person cut out of your story for an audience. I understood why, and I couldnt ask you to change, because your culture was a part of you, and one that I loved. Now, I only have one question: Why all of that? Why start what you cant finish? Why did I meet you if your intention was to leave me one day? My minds on children, my minds on forever; and dont kid yourself, so is yours. Life is cruel. "

The one I feel you will be passing sooner than later. And also rest assured I get it and there is nothing to fear in regards to us. I know you feel unstable as this is new for you. Inner battles rage with fire as you try to make sense of it all. I know now this connection I thought only I understood you do now also. Its one that takes deep courage and strength with vulnerability to make it through - and faith. I anchor the faith and whether or not you like it - I see you your everything energetically. You cant hide and neither can I. As much as I see you you see me. I know you are a bit clouded now but thats okay! Things arent what they seem.

It's something that, on this terrible night I am having, I felt the need to type up in order release this sadness. Surprisingly, it really helped me and lifted a heaviness off my chest. Thank you for having this area for us to vent to. &amp;#x200B; \--- &amp;#x200B; I'm not sure how to begin writing to all of you. This is not nearly everyone that has made an impact in my life, just those that made a memory that has never left my being. &amp;#x200B; * To my father, who left when I was 3 and never called after beginning another family. I appreciate you giving me life. When you moved away, I was thankful for the lack of communication from my father and that I could forget that I even had one. Now, I appreciate the attempts you made and still make to try to be in my life as soon I became a self-sufficient adult and did not need or want your attention anymore. I appreciate you loving my younger siblings more than you could ever bother to love me as a child. I appreciate your interest in their academics, in their social life, and your concern for their well-being, even if I did not get to experience that support. I appreciate your love for tequila and how you passed that trait on to me somehow, even with no contact during my developmental stages of life. I appreciate that you came to the realization that I have become cold in a lot of aspects and will never truly bond with or love you like my other siblings. I realize, now, as an adult, where my fucked up, unquenchable thirst for suffocating, dominant men came from. I am thankful to know that because of you, I am strong enough to always fight off the certain void and the bitterness and distrust for people that I've had since a young age. I forgive you for your faults, because I now realize that they have come back to haunt you. &amp;#x200B; * To my step mom, who had an affair with my father &amp; broke up the family I never knew. I appreciate how, even before the divorce was final, you and my father began your lives together. I appreciate that when I was young, you were always there and able to make me feel unwanted. I am truly, honestly thankful to have gained so many siblings from the addition of you to my father's life. On the rare occasion my mom could force us on my father, I appreciate you telling me that I should lose some weight, because I didn't want to grow up and become my mother - overweight and alone. I appreciate the salads you forced upon me while everyone else ate something else. I am thankful you made me hate my body before I even knew what a beautiful body that my body would grow to be. I am thankful for the fucked up relationship with food this ignited in me, and that I am able to overcome this daily, even decades later. Because of you, I am strong and healthy now, able to enjoy food and not fear it. If it wasn't for you, I would have probably never became a nutritionist. I am extremely thankful that, while I overcame my eating disorder, you have grown to become exactly what you told me not to become -- overweight and alone. I truly forgive you, because I know you have a bitterness and a hole in your heart that can not be filled and that you more than likely didn't intend to make me hate you. &amp;#x200B; * To my mother, who loved me and provided for me, despite the set backs and errors in her approach. I forgive you for not knowing how to be there for me all the time. I forgive the fact that you had to work so many hours a week to provide for us and could not always attend my events or sign me up for activities and would often forget me at school. I forgive you for all the men that came and went from our household &amp; the 8 marriages I witnessed beginning and ending, because I know deep down in your heart you wanted us to feel a father's love &amp; security. I even forgive you for the not so nice ones that you brought in our lives that I can picture clear as day still.... I forgive you for the constant moves we made &amp; for not being emotionally or physically present while I battled an eating disorder alone. I forgive you for the mental breakdown you had once we all moved out, because you could finally breathe and stop putting up your front. I forgive you for the drinking habit you picked up in the past few years, because I know you have had a rough time providing and now that it's done, you don't know who you are anymore. I forgive you for the commitment issues that I now battle in every relationship I pursue. You are the strongest woman I know, despite your flaws, and I appreciate you and everything you have given me and taught me. I know that you tried hard to give us a stable life, even if it doesn't appear that way to most. You have a good heart and I know your love is deep for me. Without you, I would not be the empathetic, independent woman I am... You caused me to be this consistently inconsistent person and I appreciate and forgive you for it at the same time. &amp;#x200B; * To my older sister &amp; best friend, who helped raise me when our parents split and our mother was a tad bit uninvolved. I forgive you for your selfishness in our adult age, because I know it stems from having to grow up quicker than me and having to become my guardian. I forgive you for your blunt comments regarding my weight, because I know you were struggling with an eating disorder, as well, and didn't know I was also suffering. Growing up younger, I watched everything you did, which is probably why it was so easy to begin that hatred and obsession with my weight and food. I forgive you for this, knowing you did not intentionally help bring that into my life. There's not much else I would ever want to forgive you for... because we were raised in the same fucked up family and I could never resent you or be less authentically appreciative of you. I want to apologize for the wrongdoing that has happened to you -- losing your husband in the same way our mother lost our dad and seeing your kids experience the heartbreak and loss that we went through. I am appreciative of your will to overcome our past and to better yourself. I appreciate you for being the rock in my life that I have always needed. I hope I have become that rock for you, as well. &amp;#x200B; * To the many men that utilized my vulnerability -- I appreciate now knowing that I never wanted you &amp; that it was never about you. I wanted a body, a lover, a placeholder to help placate the uneasiness I always felt in my soul. I appreciate you for allowing me to explore a side of my sexuality that opened the doors to mental healing. I appreciate you for making me feel confident and sexy in the body I always despised from a young age. I appreciate the lessons I learned about myself and how it helped me work through my fear of commitment. I appreciate that you helped me realize that I didn't need a man to make me feel complete, but that I needed self awareness and satisfaction and now I have that. &amp;#x200B; * Finally, to my husband...... I appreciate you for all that you are. I have absolutely no reasons that would cause you to need forgiveness, this is simply a lovey dovey, appreciative letter dedicated to you. You have consistently shown me what love is every step of the way. I never thought I would marry. I always thought I would be single for life, traveling and belonging no where and to no one. You proved me wrong. You proved that I belong wherever you are, with you. I appreciate and love you more than I have ever loved another human in my entire life. I love that you love me as fucked up as I am and I know you love that I love you. You push me to be a better person and you love that I am a confident woman. You may not know all of this old hatred existed in me and that I have overcome so many issues in the past, but that's what you do to me. You make me forget about the evil in the world and make me live. You are the most wonderful thing to ever happen to me. I appreciate your humor, your wittiness, your sensitivity, your sensuality, your patience, your intelligence, and so much more. Thank you for letting me be yours. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

The way we joked about going to Vegas to get married and the way we told each other over dinner the 3 things you should know? The feeling of vulnerability shared over a dish of Spaghetti and Penne Pasta reminded me of my youth. That dinner took me back to a time filled with fraught, hardship and hope for the future. Sitting with you I felt ready for the future ahead of me, and for a foolish moment I felt ready for the time I was going to spend with you. We didnt have sex that night, you wanted to wait and a part of me wanted to wait too. I told you in the late night and many times to come how I am easy to deal with almost all the time, with the same breath I warned you of the times Im not. I warned you about the panic that sets in, the crying, the hopelessness, and the way I need someone to hold me. I warned you of the times when I would need someone to just be there. You told me I look forward to the time when I see you like that, and the time I can be that person for you. Despite my warning you said you were ready, and in that moment, I was ready too. Things were fine, we were together, and we told people so. I told the people who mattered most to me, because I felt like it was something to show the world. Telling these people, I was happy was something I looked forward to for years, but it was short lived. The day came when my life took a turn. One died and the other tried, you were there when I got the call. I became the family glue for the night and for the foreseeable future. I had to leave you alone that night to be with others, but I returned the next day. I was miserable and for the first time in years I let the faade crack. I sobbed for 30 seconds, but that was all it took. You couldnt handle what was happening, and I dont blame you, but I do blame you for what you did in the following days. We spent our final night together, naked and smiling you said to me Im so glad I found you. The next time we would see each other it was done. You didnt give me and answer, but I knew what it was. You promised me safety in vulnerability, but you ripped the net as I was falling. Right now, I hate you, I hate you for what you did but I know I wont hate you forever. I want you to reach out, so I can tell you this myself, but with the same thought I removed the chance for that. I know in the future I will wish you well, but right now I want you to feel bad. I hate you, but I wont forever. FP "

Because I think it would scare you off. We're both opening up slowly, so someday I will give it to you. The early morning sun rays scattering through the slats in my window blinds. The red and orange hues of light caress every part of your bare body. Laid out on my bed as if posing for a priceless artwork, created by an artist with an eye for detail and perfection. Attention to details such as the shadows and highlights along your curves and toned body, the soft light illuminating your face and feminine beauty with no need for a mask or makeup. You were glowing like some sort of seductive angel. That's a fight I gladly could not win, gave in and let our primal desires run wild. Nibbling on your earlobe, kissing your neck, teasing bites all over you and then as I brought my head up and caught your gaze. Just staring into one another's souls while you put in work, I almost lost it in that moment but I knew neither of us were ready to wrap this up. Standing, your legs wrapped around my waist and I pushed you against the wall. When I whispered ""ohhhh yeeaaah"" in your ear, busted up laughing, you instantly knew what I was thinking. That I thought we were going to break through the drywall into the other room, Kool-Aid Man style. I love that we both laughed, it shows me we're relaxed enough and not too serious about ourselves that we can't have a moment of humor in what was otherwise hot af. I love that you are on my wavelength and knew exactly what I saying/thinking. It seemed to bring something out in you once that had relaxed you. I think we hit every position possible, on the dresser, the floor, the wall, the bed, the shower. Some kinkier things we'll keep between us. I never knew as a man I could have multiple Os, You gave me a first and I know you were taken care of, we exhausted each other. I love our cuddle sessions and pillow talk afterwards. How soft your voice is, the twinkle in your eye and the grin from ear to ear on your face, the gentle kisses and quiet laughs. We can lay there in silence just looking at one another, me tracing your outline with my fingertip, and it's bliss. These are the moments I live for. The moments where we bare everything, our bodies, our deepest locked away thoughts, our dreams, our souls with another human being. I can't say it yet, I'm definitely infatuated and mesmerized by you, but I can't say I love you yet because I don't know you well enough. I hope you turn out to be the same. I want to hear you say those three words, just not so soon. Too many people confuse infatuation with love and it leads to disappointment and heartache. Here's to hoping this is the start of something great, I'm finally getting my life on track and to have an angel such as yourself come along with me on this journey would be a true blessing. Until next time, JW"

You shouldve let me swing, let me wander, let me make my mistakes. You wouldnt. You needed proof and an upper hand. A ruinous mistake I will never understand. Has your moral compass been so warped by all those turbulent energy fields you pass it under? Perhaps, become more flexible, since we're criticizing each other. Perhaps, accept your humanity, your vulnerability, instead of allowing those hands of anxiety and greed to intervene in your happiness and my security. Ill be fighting my whole life not to settle into the easy, rosy roads of simple explanations and the lowest energy state. Youll be fighting to resist your sadist impulses, or will you? Whats your truest form, when life reaches a tumultuous cacophony tearing down all but your strongest fortresses of mind, who are you? What survives? Thats up to you. Today is a new day. I want to make the best of it. But first, you need to know. I know you heard. I will say and do many things in contrary to my central drives, contradict myself, and mindlessly reprise the insolent, numbing tones of fear and exhaustion. But I will not forget you.

My job changes child to child. Some days I start IVs, some days Im on chest compressions, some days I chart and watch the entire process from the door. Some days I give medications and others I stand by you and help you process what you are watching. I hear your cries and pleading. I feel the soul wrenching pain you are in. I fight back the tears to do my job. We often know the eventual outcome before the patient comes in our bay but we fight like hell for your child. We come together as a team and we fight. We put everything we know and can do into helping your child. Sometimes we are successful and sometimes we are not. We may not cry in front of you, we may even move on to another child without skipping a beat. Inside we cry with you. Inside we die a little each time we cant save a child. We carry the image of some of your children in our minds. Ones that greatly impacted our medical careers and ones that emotionally took their toll on us. Sometimes we have to take a break leave work for the day because like you we grieve too. We love what we do and would never trade it! Do know we try our best every day and we see you, we see your fear, your vulnerability, your helplessness and you begging us to save or help your child. You may not say anything but we see you and hear you. You and your children are never alone in our emerg dept. "

Then you continued to push me for sex, because fuck it, *you* wanted it. You are outrageous. Can you see the dissonance? The arrogance? Your desire to fuck negates anything I might be thinking or feeling. You seem to think you're entitled somehow, no matter how awfully you behave, to have sex whenever you're in the mood. That I should feel grateful that you'd even offer the services of your mouth - but only if I go to you. You accuse me of preferring the story I tell myself about you to the reality. That story is based on bullshit like this, which you'll no doubt tell me I've misunderstood somehow, maybe because I can't read your mind to know your true intent or some garbage like that.

I have no intention of contacting you because of the level of frustration it causes me. I sat in my car yesterday and cried just to relieve it. I can't do it. It's not because I harbor some sort of 'hope' of feelings or relationships, I never really had any of that. I listened to everything you said to me and I adjusted all of that accordingly. I was never going to be for you and I made peace with that way back. I didn't fit into any of your requirements and that's how it goes sometimes. I'm a big girl and can pull on my big girl pants and get on with it. When I saw that you emailed me, it took me a bit to open it. I wasn't sure I wanted to read it, but I felt a surge of hope that maybe we were going to fix some of the history. *That maybe you finally cared enough to want to*. I know in my head and totally rationally that you have no skin in that game, but I do and pithy, casual conversation with you causes my anxiety level to go from 0 to 60 in about a second. But I opened it and I walked right though that door. Again. And again, you wanted nothing but casual chatting. I mean, why? You open the door and shut it on me every time. I always likened it to giving someone a hammer and holding out my hand. For the love of God, I have to stop holding out my hand. After everything I said to you in those last letters. After putting everything I felt and demonstrating a lot of vulnerability, the thing that motivated you to say anything at all to me was 'curiosity' about someone who doesn't really pay attention to boundaries. None of the words I said meant anything at all. You ghosted me back then and stopped responding and the thing that caused you to initiate contact with me for the third time in 3 years had nothing at all to do with...me. I asked you want you wanted and you wanted...nothing. Then why? I mean, if you wanted to see what was going on, you obviously could read my posts. It wasn't necessary to contact me. If you had no motivation other than pithy comments, it was cruel. It is incredibly hard to recognize and continually relive the fact that someone you cared so deeply about could really care less about whether you come and go, whether you're doing well or not or whether you're simply even around. I don't know if you've had enough relationship experience to have experienced hitting the brick wall of someone's cold indifference when you haven't really done anything but care about them, but one day you will and it will be soul crushing. I don't even wish that for you. Every time we interact, it's just another moment to recognize that I'm a just a blip and you'll go back to not even recognizing my existence tomorrow while this crushes me for a while. Hell, even I was surprised at how I responded to it because I know I need something from you that I am never going to get. I need to hear that you cared about me, but I also know that you didn't. That I was one of probably hundreds and that reconciliation is simply never going to happen. What I don't need is to be reminded of it through pithy conversation. You wish to ignore all the history and all my feelings as though they don't exist. Our 'relationship' was always about you and your terms. Always. Your introversion, your stress levels, your level of effort. It hasn't changed. In all this time, you haven't changed. Take this for what you will, but if you ever want a relationship with someone - anyone - that's healthy and long lasting, stoic non-emotional person has to go. There is no other way forward. Perhaps it's too late to change. I always believed people could, but I also figured that over time you'd gain some emotional awareness of how what you do impacts others, but you have zero. Even when they *tell you*. This is called low hanging fruit. The high level fruit is hard to grab, but always, always grab the low hanging fruit. I wish I didn't care about you. I wish you cared enough about me to grant me the peace I need. I've never in my life meant anyone so callous and closed off and I've met some emotionally compromised people in my life. I was one for a long time. But in the context of all of this, it may not be that you are emotionally closed off. Maybe Occam's Razor really does apply. The simplest answer really is the only answer, that you just could care less about me. "

Admitting my mistakes kills me. I strive for perfection too. I expect people to do what I can. And fuck how can? I don't even know how I do it. I have this belief that if I of all people can overcome x then anyone can. It is inspiring to people but frustrating for me. I learned this the hard way before. I wish I could apply all these lessons with you. I also need to address something else. I lived and breathed for my passion we share. I blamed you when it fell apart. Not at first. Im sorry. I am so sorry. It was nobody's fault. Really. But your anger towards me showed you blamed yourself. I tried to tell you not to blame yourself but I became frustrated you at you. For what? Caring? No because it sucked and I needed to blame someone. Similar to now and my previous words and actions. I said some REALLY mean things too. And said things but then didn't act upon them. I have a lot of things I need do fix about me. I know I lash out at people and that's why they leave. I know these things. I'm not dumb. The thing is I can't seem to find control ovet It. Like for real. I ruined so many friendships I don't bother getting close to people. I know I am suffocating and needy. I know that I say things that aren't 100 percent true. It's like when I talk sometimes I dont hear myself or anything.i I suddently tune in amd realize what I am saying to find out I don't have any clue what im talking about. I believe it to be a social anxiety coping mechanism that Im working to unscramble. My best friend called me out on speaking things that dont make sense or are exaggerated truths. I ended up stopping talking to her. You see when people tell you things they want change. Of course they do. Boy , do I try hard to change. Thus why I wish I was different. My new medication is helping with my lashing out but I know I need to change something about me that is jacked up and can't. it breaks me. So my inability to change broke me. There's only one way to change and that is to do something about it. I think a part of me hiding my vulnerability because it's not vulnerability to me but rather you. Some days I scare myself. And I just can't put you through that. I can't risk you starting drinking again. I can't risk you hurting yourself over my shit. This isn't goodbye. This is my apology that I can't send. This is no excuse. No one should take it. I'm afraid you would because you are that amazing and sweet. You would take my shit over and over. But fuck man you don't deserve my shit. Who am I kidding? I know you would take me as I am but you don't deserve who I am now. You deserve who I was years ago. I'll get there I promise. This isn't me not loving myself, this is me not settling for this me. My constant need to grow and shift has made me successful. Me saying is this really your best? If you did xyz or 123 would there have been a better outcome. Or me saying this wasn't good enough is loathing; it's what pushes me to keep going. It forces me to do better and never settle. It may not seem like it but I am working of bettering myself and ridding toxic people. I just need one person to believe in me. That's it. That's all I truly need is you to believe in me. I love you so fucking much S Sending love to you Xoxo"

We were doing so well building each other up, working on things, maturing together as a couple. We stumbled, but we spoke openly about things, it was nice being in a relationship with someone who would see your faults but help you work through them, live above those faults. Then you ended it. You ended it a week after we talked, ended it after we shared major sources of vulnerabilities for the both of us, sources of vulnerability and anxiety. After I opened up about a major source of relationship anxiety, after we had for the last two years done such amazing things for each other when either of us was down. I guess I wanted to keep working on those things. It's not like they were problems for us, but I guess I was wrong. It wasn't a problem for me because I was ready to take on the challenge of doing right by you because I thought you genuinely deserved someone who would do that. But a week after we talked and we shared those vulnerabilities and promised we'd work together on them, you called it quits, and bailed on it. It's not just the breakup that's frustrating (it is), it's that after two years of doing such an amazing job growing with each other, and talking about all the things we had done great for one another, and opening up to what I thought was a really important step for ""us"", you bailed on it and ran. It's frustrating to open up major vulnerabilities to someone, having them reciprocate, and lovingly look each other in the eyes and say ""I want to be better for you"" and having that person take away the chance to actually deliver on that by breaking up with you. So I'm not mad. I'm frustrated. And hurt. I hope you're well. I hope you have a great holiday, and I hope whatever happens you find happiness. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

I thought I could never love someone more, I thought you were my soulmate. My best friend. Purely platonic, but all the same, I thought Id never connect with someone like I did with you. And come to find out that love was fake! What a twist! Because how can I love someone I dont know. And that's the thing. I dont fucking know you. The only thing I know is that I DONT know you! And you DONT care about me! And Im all the more sure, I fucking hate you! I genuinely hate you now, and it is SO much more freeing than what it felt like to love you and to be loved by you. What I understand now is you were lonely and I was just a pawn. And thats what he is too. Im sure. The things you said about him to me Im sure you spit back at him with my name replacing his. He probably knows too, but its sad and obvious enough he wouldnt care. Just like me. There were warning signs at every turn, people pulling me aside screaming STOP. Just like him. Maybe. Because he may be fucked up but he actually does love you. Same as me. And yet, I am confident in the fact that one day youll blink and hell be writing this letter instead of me and and his tears will reach the keyboard, same as me. Its sad. I fucking bawled my eyes out. I couldnt breathe. It was like an anxiety attack. I think I was just so shocked. Because lately all Ive been able to think about was you. Dream about you. Flashbacks, sometimes nightmares, but all the same you. And Id wake up the same; missing you. But now, I am sure, if I were to dream of you, thatd be the nightmare. Repulsive enough to wake me up, so if I get the timing right maybe I wont need an alarm clock for work anymore. This probably sounds harsh, and maybe it is, but my emotions are raw, and you were the only person in my whole life I believed in and trusted. You were the only person I told everything to, things I now wish I had never even thought to say to you. You didnt deserve my vulnerability, and definitely not my secrets. My feelings. My life. It wasnt yours to take! I kept thinking over and over again, how could I replace you? How could I love? How could I ever have a best friend again? The answers are I wont replace you, because I don't want anything to do with you. I will never look for you in another person, seeing you in someone else will be a reason to run. Loving will never be easier. I've learned what not to do. And the last one, I dont know. Its possible, maybe, I wont connect with someone like I did with you. Maybe I will never have a best friend again. But Id rather be alone than share anything with you again. It wont be you. Not ever again. Goodbye."
603,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Incomplete,1,9yzgn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/9yzgn9/incomplete/,2018-11-21 14:30:50,"I remember one time when I was at your apartment and you asked me to go home by saying you felt complete. I thought about whether I feel complete at this point, but the truth is that I dont. Im not sure that complete is a word that I would use about the totality of relating to someone (Im not saying that is how you used the word) - especially someone that I shared the deepest intimacy of my life with and that I was hoping we would spend our lives together. But I do experience a feeling of loosening, of fading, of growing disconnection. I think thats what the experience is. I think I told you the story about my first retreat and watching the dissolution of the container of noble silence. I was so worried that I would cling to the retreat experience and suffer when it was over. I didnt want to go back to work, go back to my life. I wanted to stay in that safe, intimate space. And yet, as the retreat ended, I brought awareness to the experience and the process of dissolution was beautiful also. Awareness is also present as this experience with you dissolves. And it, too, is beautiful. The gradual arising of emotions and experiences. The touch of skin under a blackened sky with the sound of the ocean washing over us. Waking up in the middle of the night to your emails waiting for me. Listening to your voice over the phone as I sat at the beach. The taste of your lips. The opening to each other and our experience. Laying ourselves bare to each other. Holding each other on your couch. Watching John Oliver. Holding silence together. The feeling of your body next to mine as we slept. Confronting our fears. Sharing plans and dreams of the future. Talking about raising children in this loving co-created space. The peak of intimacy. An email with just the words I love you. And then the dissolution of all of those things. In its own way, its beautiful because its the nature of conditionality and impermanence. Co-created space between two people obviously depends on the effort of both people to support the necessary conditions. I used to think in very simple terms about the necessity of communication, loyalty, honesty, effort, etc. in relationships. I thought these were just necessary for their own sake. But as Ive watched our space change, I see that communication, effort, quality time, honesty, being together, sharing deep aspects of our experiences, etc are the active creation of the conditions necessary to support a fundamentally impermanent space. And it takes both people to co-create that together. Of course all things change, but there are a multitude of directions that the space can change - toward greater intimacy, toward a life together, or toward a growing estrangement. I continue to become more aware of the ways that my experiences are conditioned. You and I co-created a space of beauty, love, vulnerability, and intimacy. I feel so thankful for being a part of that. But the space was conditioned and impermanent. And as the conditions necessary to sustain it have changed in this particular direction, the space itself passes away. Perhaps pass away is not the right phrase. But as it existed, it ceases to exist. I had heard this before, but for some reason it had a greater impact when I heard it recently - open yourself to allow everything in, and then let go of those things that do not serve you or others. Unfortunately, the space we are co-creating now isnt helpful to me. I think one of the benefits of mindfulness, awareness, and seeing into impermanence, suffering, and not-self is the ability to make choices about my life instead of responding with reactivity and just blindly following habit energies. I used to think that just bearing with whatever came into my life was the point of acceptance. If there is really no self, then it doesnt matter the pain, suffering, or dissatisfaction. But the middle way seems to be more supportive of happiness. Not being aversive, not grasping, and yet making helpful decisions about my life. Sure, I could sit outside with no shirt in 40 degree weather and practice acceptance, but is that really helpful or necessary? In the same way, willingly inviting difficult experiences and instability into my life doesnt seem very helpful either. I recognize my words could be interpreted in many different ways - especially since recently I asked for time to adjust to a new way of relating to you. This decision is actually unrelated to those struggles and unrelated to my divorce (I just wanted to be clear about that part as well - the decision about the future of that relationship has not changed). I feel that Ive found a place of peace with my experiences. Yes, they can be unpleasant, difficult, and suffering is still present. But there is a place of refuge in the midst of impermanence and suffering. I have found myself thinking of this as groundless stability - the ability to stay with the groundlessness and uncertainty in life in a way that is rooted in emptiness, peacefulness, and acceptance of the truths of existence. Ive intentionally avoided getting into the detailed reasons behind this email because I dont think its ultimately helpful - especially since you and I have different desires for the direction of our lives to go. I think its enough to simply recognize that the space we are co-creating together is substantially less close, less intimate, and less connected. We are just no longer on the same page. Hope takes a long while to fully dissolve in my experience. I read an interesting article that men tend to take longer to get over relationships than women. Like any generalization, its not true for everyone. But it certainly does take me a long time to get over hoping that things will go the way I want them to or that someone will have a change of heart. So I will have to focus on just accepting this dissolution as it is and look toward developing some equanimity about the situation while also allowing the experience to just be what it is. Yes, the future is uncertain and could go any possible direction. But that is exactly why it is not helpful to hold out hope it will go in one specific direction - grasping simply leads to more suffering. I do want to be clear about one thing - should you ever need something from me, I have the intention to do my best to be there for you. I have extremely deep feelings for you and I experience a very deep, albeit one-sided, connection to you. So please do not hesitate to reach out if there is something you need assistance with. I made that commitment to you before and I am making it again. I wish you all the best in the future. Perhaps our paths will cross again at some point when we are able to co-create a more helpful and intimate space together - or at least that is the hope that is present in my heart. But if not, I will always truly cherish the impermanent experiences we had together. Thank you for your love and your willingness to deeply engage this emptiness of Me. There is a song by Andrew Bayer called The End of All Things. There is one line in particular that really touched me when I heard it several months ago and it mingled with my thoughts and feelings for you. I know that you wont have the same experience of these words as I do, but I want to share it with you because of how deeply meaningful it is to me and how closely connected it is with my feelings for you. I wish somehow you could step inside my heart for a moment to feel this with me. This could be / The end of all things / Or the start of always. I hope you are able to find your own refuge of groundless stability. May you be peaceful. May you be happy. May you be free from suffering. With deep and enduring love, "

Today was not a good day. Nothing in particular happened, it just really wasn't a good day for trying to deal with everything. I should have written earlier. I've just had all these thoughts about you and *[her]* and the lie you've forced me to live for the past year and a half. All of the lies you've told me. How fucking easily you lied to me so well and so often. How can I believe you about anything now? Ever again? How can I believe that you've told me everything? How can I believe that you've been completely honest in what you have told me? That you haven't spun things to make them for the narrative you'd prefer me to think of as the truth? How could you do that to me? You didn't just have sex with someone else. You say you told her it was just sex multiple times, but you didn't just have sex with someone, you had a full blown affair for at least 7 months. You had a full fucking relationship with *[her]*, she was your girlfriend. You had more of a fucking relationship with *[her]* for those 7 months than you did with me, your wife, at that time, even during the times that we actively spent together! Even when you were spending time with me, you spent more of that time with her--texting her, mentally with her, emotionally with her. You put more time, effort, care, and thought into your relationship with *[her]* than you ever did into your marriage with me. It makes me sick to think about it. To realize that it was all a lie, an illusion, a joke to you. I'm a fucking joke to you. You didn't even care enough about me or respect me enough to tell me yourself. How can I ever trust or respect you again? How can I ever depend on you again? How can I ever open up to you again? How can I ever respect myself for staying with you? I regret not making you sleep on the sofa for longer. I regret letting you back into the bed with me that second night. I regret giving in to my yearning for intimacy, for closeness, to feel like someone cared and having sex with you when I still don't trust you. I regret being so vulnerable and weak and willingly &amp; knowingly putting myself at your mercy knowing who you are (or, rather, who you aren't-someone worth my trust, vulnerability, intimacy,... My love). I regret continuing to have sex with you when it psychologically &amp; emotionally tortures me the entire time. I think more about *[her]* than either of us the entire time we're having sex. I hate myself for it. I can't make the thoughts &amp; images stop. I hate myself for trying to push through because I'm fucking terrified that if I don't you'll decide it isn't worth it to deal with the mess you've made of me, of us, and you'll go running back into her arms, or anyone else's. I fucking hate myself for being terrified of that, for even fucking caring. I say I love you, and I do. At least, I will always love the person that I thought you were. It's hard for me to say that I love you though, because I honestly don't know if I do right now. I don't know if I actually love you, or if I just love who I thought you were, and for some reason still hope you might still be, even somewhere deep down. It's even harder for me to not say that I love you, though. Part of the reason for that is that I'm terrified that you won't see a reason to even bother trying or caring anymore (assuming that your current assertions &amp; demonstrations of such are actually true) if I don't tell you I love you. The truth is, right now, I hate you. I hate the person you've been revealed to be. I hate the way you could so easily lie to, manipulate, and use me. I hate the way you destroyed me, our family, to make yourself feel better, to stroke your fucking ego. I hate that I didn't really mean anything to you, that the life &amp; family we'd built together for 10 years didn't mean anything to you, that everything we'd been through &amp; survived together meant absolutely nothing to you. Even worse, I hate myself for allowing you to have so much control over me and how I feel. I hate myself for choosing to trust you against my jaded (but apparently better) judgement from the beginning. I hate myself for having ever broken down my walls and let you in in the first place. I hate that you can enjoy yourself, have fun, get everything you fucking wanted, and selfishly fulfill all your desires while simultaneously destroying me. Then, when everything fucking crumbles, you aren't the one who's shattered, you aren't the one who has to fucking clean up your mess, you aren't the one that's actually fucking traumatized, you get to still have had all your fun &amp; have had the ability to process and deal with everything in real time as it unfolded and so now, to you, you just have to fucking sit there and wait for me to fucking deal with the consequences of your fucking choices. You fucked up, you repeatedly made a conscious decision to betray, violate, and just fucking decimate me. But I'm the one who has to deal with the fucking consequences of your decisions &amp; actions. I did not consent to any of this. But I'm still the one who has to deal with the fucking fallout. I'm the one who is completely destroyed. And. You. Never. Cared. Enough. To. Even. Give. Me. A. Fucking. Choice. You can't fix it now, that ship has sailed. I'm the one who has to deal with it and you can't do it. You made that choice for me. You keep saying to let you know off anything that you can do. That's the problem. You can't fix it now. You can't do anything to make it better. You already made that choice for both of us, but now I'm the only one who has to deal with the consequences. I fucking hate you. But I still love the person I thought you were for 11 years. I don't even know if that person is real, and it's not even like I idealized you before. But I still don't even know who the fuck you are anymore. I think that's what I'm scared to let go of. And that's why I hate myself even more. Fuck you. You've taken everything from me. You've taken &amp; destroyed my heart, my mind, my well being, my memories, my happiness, my security, my safety, my confidence, my sanity, my self esteem, my hopes, my youth, my opportunities, my dreams, my sense of identity, my self worth, my friendship, my love, my soul, my everything.....my life.

I thought youd text by now :-( After seeing no notifications from you for days I feel quite sad and empty. You know, I sleep best when you text me goodnight. I really really miss you and your kisses and your sleepy eyes. My love for you grew so big in such a short time. I want to be close to you. I cant stop recalling our cutest moments. Today on the bus a stranger caught me smiling at the thought of you. I probably looked weird but if they knew the reason theyd understand. I probably gave you reasons to be hesitant about texting me. If you were wondering, I want to say that every single second of my affection and love for you was real. Every little moment and every little touch. Can you say the same for me? You dont have to be afraid of being hurt anymore. And you dont have to be afraid of hurting me. I know Im sensitive, deep down. But for me, its better to have loved and lost. If youre ghosting me, thinking its for the best, I want to say I understand. The long distance, trust issues and fear of vulnerability are big problems. Its hard. But if we like each other enough we can overcome anything. Lets just pretend that we were never hurt before. Lets just trust in each another fully and love each other without holding back. Im tired of playing games...So how about it? Lets pretend we were never hurt before. Lets pretend to be each others first love. Sadly youre far away and I probably wont see you for a while... but I hope I hear from you soon, sleepy boy. I hope you miss me too. Love, Strawberry "

You know what sucks most? The time when I gave my heart to you, instead of cherish it, you shrew it into the dirt and trod on it. You are suppose to be my armor, my protector, but sadly you are my weakness, my vulnerability, and the person who hurt me the most. I often wonder would we have a happy ending if I did things differently. I sometimes question even blame myself for finding out all your dirty shady betrayals and darkness. I try to convince myself that if I didn't dig deeper, maybe I would never know; if I didn't know, maybe I would still be in that fantasy bubble and be happy with you. I really miss the time we had together, everything we did together, those texts and jokes, and I want them back so badly. I don't know what you've been through and what made you to be like that. But I did give you chances to correct it and I hoped maybe we could work things out. But you disappointed me again and again. How do you say goodbye to someone you can not image to lose? I don't know how to say goodbye to you. But seems like I'm so disposable that it takes no time for you to leave. Right, I forgot maybe this is who you really are.

I fell back in love with you and saw a chance to redeem myself for breaking your heart when we were younger. I had become so tangled up in you. My only goal was to give you all of the love I had been too afraid to give before. You made me feel wrong for loving you. As if we didn't have a history. As if we had never loved each other before. Yet you didn't shy away when it came to anything sexual. Ehh. It's easy to speculate that your intentions were toxic from the start. That you took advantage of my trust and vulnerability to get back at me for when I was a 14-15 year old who didn't understand their emotions or know what they were doing. The punishment most certainly did not fit the crime. I know you *can't stand* drawn conclusions, but honestly it was mutual acquaintance who tried to convinced me. I refused to believe it, I felt I knew you better. You can't be that vindictive, can you? I don't know you, though. Not really. The funny thing about the ""traits"" that pushed you away is that you can't see when you're equally as guilty of them. You assumed so much about me and my intentions. Things we could have easily had conversations about to clear the air. You were too stubborn and arrogant, though. I don't know if what we had was real anymore. If it was, I hope that you realize one day that you played a large part in our falling-out. Shame on you for letting me blame myself. I genuinely loved and appreciated you. I loved you for you. A human. A human who made a difference in my life. You made a difference in my mood. I was truly grateful for you just being a part of my days. Even when our interactions were short. Those long nights, though. They meant the world to me. Please stop saying you only ever had true love once (your other ex). You had me, too. Just because you did not feel the same- does not say a damn thing about MY love. Honestly, all you seem to know is your own lust. I think I'm finally ready to let you go.

At this point, I don't think any good would come from rehashing it step-by-step together, but for closure and clarity's sake I just need to get this all out. My depression was setting in. While I let you know that, I didn't communicate to you in clear enough terms that my sex drive was truly nil, and that what I needed from you, if we were going to spend time together, for a little while was pure companionship. Because of my past relationship history in regards to sex (which you know all about), any ""compromise' we made in this area felt, more and more, like a burden to me--one that I didn't have the bravery to communicate to you. So as I began asking you for more space, this was at the root of it. Of course, on top of that, was the numbness, exhaustion, and general listlessness that comes from being depressed. I couldn't bring myself to shower, and certainly not to put on makeup and I didn't want you to see me that way. When you reacted to my not initiating our spending time together with veiled threats to go out drinking with other girls, and by implying that I didn't care about you at all, I realized two things: 1. The weight of the guilt your words and feelings were piling onto me was pushing me down into an even darker, more hopeless hole of depression, and 2. If I wasn't able to clearly communicate my needs to you (I wasn't) then it wasn't fair to keep playing this torturous (for both of us) game where I was totally unable to give you what you needed. I suggested that we take a break. The next week or so is hazy for me as I ended up going into inpatient treatment for my depression as I became suicidal. During that time, my therapists advised that my ties to you, my feelings of obligation to you, my guilt about leaving you in the dark, about hurting you, etc., were all holding me back from being fully honest even in counselling, *and* from getting better. You later, fairly, pointed out that my ending things via email was cruel. I'm so sorry that I had to do it that way, but I did not have access to my phone and was not allowed visitors. It was the only way that I could communicate to you what I needed to say. It was a torturous decision that I did not take lightly. All I can say by way of explanation (not excuse) was that at that point in time, it genuinely felt like the decision was life or death: either I end things with you or I kill myself. Which, sitting here in a healthier state of mind, I can obviously see sounds dramatic and ridiculous but I guess that illustrates, at least a tiny way, the kind of head space I was in. The fact that this all happened right before your birthday... the above is the best explanation for why that is that I can give. At this point, **he** was not in the picture at all. Over the next couple of weeks or so I remained an inpatient and I started to make some progress but as we transitioned out of talking about my childhood and first marriage, and got into my most recent marriage, we hit another wall and I started to regress and become suicidal again. I won't bore you with all the details but at some point the decision was made for my mom to contact him to see if he would be willing to come in for a session to help clarify some things and maybe allow for me to get some closure. The session was kind of a huge shock to everyone as he shared some deep emotions that I never even considered he'd had. It was decided he would come back daily for the rest of that week. After another week of that, with him coming in every other day, I was discharged and moved back to my mom's. Honestly, my feelings for you were incredibly strong--as strong as they'd ever been--and I was internally going back and forth between taking the advice of everyone around me (advice based on my past decisions, my mental health, my apparent lack of willingness to see a commitment through difficult times, and his willingness to make changes) and trying to make it work with him, and following my heart and going back to you. I was going through the motions with him, basically seeing each other at weekly therapy where we would go out to dinner afterwards, and hoping something would change inside me. I had learned in my time as an inpatient that I can't really trust my own feelings. It didn't seem fair to you to let you know that all of this was happening until I had made up my mind one way or the other. Then, everything blew up. It's kind of ironic to me that LITERALLY, the **very** first time I used instagram after two months away, that I tagged him in a contest for a weekend getaway, and *somehow* some mutual friend of yours and mine saw it and told you about it. It doesn't even seem real to me that it happened that way. And at first, your message to me made me love you even more and it, quite honestly, almost made up my mind that I was going to end up with you. But then your anger (understandably) took hold and you messaged me about your house key in a way that genuinely terrified me. I'm admittedly sensitive to anger because of past abuse in my first marriage, so it probably just felt like blowing off steam to you but it really scared me to my core and I can't really put a finger on exactly why. So, I was back to vacillating--unsure of what move to make while I continued living with my mom and going through the motions. But then, the whole V thing happened. And while it didn't make my love for you feel any less intense, it *did* make up my mind for me. It made it really, really clear to me that I **cannot** trust my own emotions. While you are still a wonderful man who deserves a partner who appreciates you and shows you the same level of love and attention as you're capable of showing her, you *aren't* the person I thought you were. I was vulnerable with you in ways I've never been with another soul on Earth, and I did that on the pretense that you were trustworthy on a level--that you loved me in a way--that was TOTALLY safe. Our entire bond; my belief that we were soul mates; it was all predicated on this trust and vulnerability. And now, that foundation has been obliterated. I understand the reasons you did what you did... and I'm not even angry (aside from the fact that your words emotionally destroyed her). So, that's the whole saga. I think it might fill in some blanks for you. I still think that I'll always love you, but I know now that we could never be together romantically again. I'll continue to mourn what we had as I move forward. I will stake my little dog's life on the fact that I've never meant any words more than I mean these ones: I want you to be happy and I want you to be deeply loved by someone who can give you everything, K."

How are you doing? Are you alright? Made friends with the people at work yet? I hope you have. Maybe even establish a relationship with someone there. Someone not...online. Haha, its kinda weird how the world works, isnt it. I still miss you. Although its been a good 2 years since we parted ways. I wonder if you still miss me too? Probably not. You really shouldnt. ...Remember when I tried to save you? Emphasis on tried. I got way too invested. At one point I did everything because I thought itd be good for you. I forced you to make friends, join a group with me. I tried to make you get out of your parents home - remember when I called the CPs on your mom? I still think she deserved that. Especially after she took your phone and threatened to kill you. But I guess I never considered your feelings, did I? You were just a teenager, desperate for love, positive attention, or even just a good friend. I wanted to be all of that. I wanted to be a positive light in your life. ...Even though I had a partner myself. I dont really know what got into me, Im sorry. When you called me a cheater, you were probably right. I kissed you, didnt I? You were my first kiss. And I was yours. I remember getting on the bus in the middle of night, all the way from Toronto to your little state in the middle of nowhere. It was winter and I almost froze to death getting home - no joke. ...I wonder if I was taking advantage of you. Maybe it was your vulnerability, your fragility that kept me there. When I hugged you, I almost cried. You were too much like me. I just didnt want you to walk the same path I had. I know I cared. I just dont know how much. Everything feels an awful lot like love if you cant see it in front of you. All I know is that when I kissed you - it felt wrong. Like I expected something...else. When I kissed you the second time, I did so to reaffirm that something was wrong. Maybe it was instinct. Maybe I knew things would turn out this way, somewhere. Im still with the same partner. I still love him - maybe now more so than ever. He never gave up on me - he never put me down, even after Id told him what I had done with you. The world works in strange ways, huh? I found out I had some unresolved issues myself after visiting a shrink, and Ive tried - trust me, Ive tried - to forget about you. Maybe I do have a God complex like you said. Maybe I was just trying to hard. Sometimes I still look at your social media to see if youre still doing okay. If youre still alive. It hurts a bit, seeing you live a life on without me, but you know what? Thats okay. I still wish Id saved you. But youre alive for today, so Ill try to convince myself again, that thats all that matters."

That I'm not supposed to break my own fourth wall, infect the background processes with my errant hand, tilting at windmills, flailing in embarrassing vulnerability. An allergy to life itself. I believe we fill what we perceive to be our containers, no more and no less. When we change, we do so because spaces were made or the walls closed in. This time last year, the walls were closing in. Windows were being barricaded. I carry an unnameable, unfacable remorse for allowing those years to accrue into a torment for both me and my would-be partner. There's a lot of important lessons to be taken from that, which is problematic because examining that relationship is not something I've got much bent to do. But it remains relevant. As do you, if you haven't given up, and if I haven't these are memories I have to withdraw truth from, otherwise I can't rightly claim to be human. We learn from our mistakes. But learning is all about approach. Truth is of course, truth is as meaningless as good and evil, just a silly word. We stamp truth on what we keep and false on what we throw out. One man's treasure, and all that. But what else am I gonna do? I'm not a very good grey rock, some people do well in stasis. Some people do very well. I'm not one of those people. "

Right now, you would see a broken woman, trembling with tears uncontrollably pouring down her cheeks yet again. My face is a mess, my hair is a birds nest. My nose is running. The collar of my shirt is wet from where the tears streamed down my neck. The sleeve of my sweatshirt is damp from being used as a Kleenex since there are no tissues nearby. Im not even trying to stop the tears now, because there is no stopping them. My nostrils are flaring as I try to keep the lump in my throat from turning into audible sobs because I dont want anyone to hear. I am not particularly attractive to begin with and I look absolutely awful right now. And I am just sitting here, listening to sappy music and typing as the tears pour out. If you approached me right now and were willing to listen, this is what I would say: You are the cause of the tears. You and the depression. And my life. And my mistakes. And everything I am missing out on because of them. But mostly you. You hurt me so badly, A. How could you? I would give anything to go back in time two years and do everything differently. I would give anything to have never talked to you, to have never seen your vulnerability and let you see mine. I remember that day in rehearsal when I noticed you seemed to be struggling. We were only acquaintances but I was concerned so I asked if you were okay. I wish I had never noticed and never asked. I wish I had never offered my support. I wish I hadnt continued talking to you. I wish I never trusted you with the real me. I wish I hadnt felt anxious and awkward about making a friend. I wish I hadnt shared my enthusiasm with you and my weird sense of humor. I wish I had never trusted you. I trusted you, A. Do you know how hard that is for me? Nobody sees the real me that early in a friendship. But, I let my guard down for you. You disarmed me. You told me you were a good listener and were used to people talking to you, that you were used to all kinds of odd behavior. You reassured me that you didnt feel weird about me talking to you. And I was on such an upswing because I was finally feeling alive again after starting treatment for my thyroid that I talked and shared a lot. I let my walls down. You seemed to appreciate what I had to say and to encourage it. But I guess you lied. You were apparently uncomfortable. Why the hell didnt you say something, A? Why didnt you talk to me? Why did you just let it grow? God, A, if you had just said something, none of this would have happened. If you had told me you had a problem, I would have stopped talking to you. And I would still be in choir and we would still be acquaintances and, whatever it was would likely have blown over. But you didnt say anything. And then you treated me like a crazy freak and kicked me out of choir. You knew how important it was to me. I told you as much when I was reassuring you after you said you had been embarrassed to be a choir teacher. I told you exactly how important choir had been in my life, that it had been the one thing I stuck with through everything. Yet, you still took it away. And every time I look for a new choir, I get so sad and frustrated, I break down. I dont want to drive to the northwest suburbs or the next state to sing, A. And I dont want to sing baroque era classical pieces. Thinking about doing that again makes me feel like I am going to throw up. You were so hurtful, A. You didnt just insult me, you went out of your way to destroy my self esteem, to attack my strengths and highlight my weaknesses. You used what you knew about me to tailor your attacks to do the most damage. Or, more likely, R and S did. The attacks didnt really seem to be your style. I saw evidence of your occasional impatience and temper when we knew each other but, even with that, you never struck me as the kind of person to go on the attack and deliberately hurt people. So, I concede it was more likely R and S who came up with the strategy. "

Of course, youve always had a right to disagree and express your opinions with me. I just wish you could understand that when your words make me frustrated its only because I value you so immensely.

All I needed was the details, and to be asked for time. Instead I got a half assed explanation, and silence. I know the damage from our kind of past runs deep...

Growing up in an abusive home, I never knew what real, healthy love felt like. You were not my first choice but I think I loved you even from the very beginning. You always had that pull. You werent amazingly attractive but there was just something in your eyes. Ive been told I could do better but I sincerely loved your soul and looks really didnt even matter to me. Falling in love with you was so easy. It was like drinking a cool glass of water when you werent even thirsty; you didnt think you needed it until you did. You saved me from my home life and from myself. Your love was a high and I couldnt get enough. I broke things off the first time and I tried to convince myself that we could be casual. But if Im truly being honest with myself, every person I ever slept with, I wished was you. I wished they could soothe the aching in my heart when things started to go down south. You were so inconsiderate, did horrible things to me and I still loved you. Those times youd storm out, I always wanted to chase after you but my pride would not allow me. Damn. My pride got in the way of everything. Even when you tried to be nice, I pushed you away. You tried but I just couldnt stop after a while. The last time we talked, we fought. Youre in a relationship now and its been some months and I still think about you everyday. This summer was the worst. I stalked your page for 3 months. It was bittersweet, seeing you happy with someone else but at least I could see your face. I still remember your number. I think what hurts the most is knowing you still loved me but you decided to move on anyways. I didnt fight hard enough when i needed to. I pushed you away so many times and when you wanted to move on, I tried to hold on as tightly as I could. You lied to me so many times. Im not even sure after 2 years, who you were. I still trusted you even as you were lying to my face. To be honest, Im glad its over. I was sick of the fighting and the tears that always seemed to follow your presence. Love should never hurt that bad. I contemplated suicide for the first time in years. I didnt think I could live without you, yet here I am. Ive moved on, I no longer check your profile. Im seeing someone now. I realize how toxic we were. I realize how much we took each other for granted. I miss you, in all honesty. I think about you everyday. You were my best friend. I miss that. It doesnt hurt anymore when I think of you but I still do get choked up if I talk about you for too long. I guess Ill always love you. I dont want to see you again and Im glad Im moving soon, even if its just an hour away because then I dont have to think about the fact you live 5 mins away; or even just worry about running into you. I dont want those old feelings back. I have a new person in my life and I need to be able to give her my 100%. You messed it up for the rest. Im not as open as I used to be. Im so cold Ive forgotten the warmness of vulnerability. Im scared of having my heart broken again. Even when an amazing person in trying her hardest to meet me halfway, I find myself pushing her away, but Ive decided Im going to let her in little by little until I forget that used to be your spot. Im sad we didnt meet 10 years in the future. Teenage relationships really are the worst, arent they? Being a young adult sucks but Im learning great life lessons. Like how it eventually stops hurting and becomes a dull ache. How you can fall in love with someone else and how you learn you dont really need anyone. I hope youre happy, I hope all is well. I even hope you think of me sometimes. We were the best of friends. I acknowledge that we werent good for each other and I hope you know one day that Ill always be here for you even when no one else is."
619,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,I wonder how youve been...,1,9pq3fr,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/9pq3fr/i_wonder_how_youve_been/,2018-10-20 12:41:48,"Its been eight months since I broke up with you. Although I dont regret my decision, I do miss what we had at first. I would never think that our 2.5 year relationship would go down the drain because it turned into an abusive, narcissistic, and draining relationship in which I could accommodate anything you would say - yet I would never be good enough. We lived together. We renovated a house together. I made you breakfast, lunch, and dinner along with snacks in between everyday. I made more money than you, and that ultimately snapped your subconscious to retaliate in toxic and harmful ways. When you were drinking, you would still call me names, tell me Im a piece of shit, and twist my sincerity and vulnerability into something that it wasnt. A thorn in your side. They say the toxic person after a break up moves into another relationship the quickest. That proves to be true, only for you to break up months later after she found out how obsessed you are with me still. Yet, call it obsession or love, but I suppose that either way we are both still thinking about each other. Youre blocked on all communications, but I cant help but wonder what you have sent and texted me all this time. I see youve gained weight in photos. I am not sure if youve seen how much weight Ive lost. Breaking up with you released the subconscious dead weight that was apon me - only to reveal the person who I almost remember in the past to be me. I am thriving. Yet there are moments like this at nights in my new city that I sit and look up to the sky and wonder how youve been. I was told by a therapist that you wouldnt think twice about me and my circumstances ever since our relationship ended; given your inability to be empathetic towards others, and demonstrate the capacity to love. But honestly, thats not the guy who I know to be my ex-boyfriend."

So scared",1,9q9knu,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/9q9knu/sending_this_on_thursday_when_we_are_supposed_to/,2018-10-22 13:30:02," Hey, C. I want you to know that the second best thing to happen to me this year was when you admitted me you like me in a romantic way. The *best t*hing is when you told me you love me. My job was a close fourth, while being able to do my job full time a third. The point is, Colin, you are the best thing that happened to me this year. What I didn't see coming were these things: that my past would come back to haunt me in some pretty ugly ways, resulting in some major insecure feelings. I didn't know the distance would be harder the closer I felt to you, either. The truth is, Colin, you have seen me now at my worst, something I was afraid of. I suppose this is inevitable, however, since when two people love each other, they will see all the sides of each other. That is what vulnerability is. Still, I can say that whatever came out on that night was not worth the end result. Anything that hurts or scares you to this degree is something I am willing to get rid of. I've been stubborn in the past. With you, it's easier to just let all that go. It's not worth losing you over. I will continue with therapy so I can have an outlet for those things and in order to keep us healthy, provided I am given the chance to still be with you. Given the chance to still be with you, I will spend the rest of my life making sure you that you know how much you are loved and valued. I still have hope for us and I haven't let it go. I never wanted to leave you. I've always wanted you even when things got confusing. It hasn't faltered. It won't falter even if you tell me no. Not for a long awhile, at least. If you still want me and love me after all this, I will consider myself a very lucky, happy, grateful person who will do what it takes to keep you. "
621,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,"You are the one, and many other things I can not yet tell you",1,9qi02s,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/9qi02s/you_are_the_one_and_many_other_things_i_can_not/,2018-10-23 08:04:46,"Dear One, &amp;#x200B; This is a letter for you that I doubt I will ever show you, it's the unspoken things I hold deep inside my aching frame, the vulnerability that you know I am terrified of showing. How do I begin this? I believe I have written and rewritten this letter a thousand times, be it on paper, on the random pages of books, our lips as we kiss, or a text I delete after I have typed it all out at 3 A.M. I can't seem to get the words right. But here I am, laptop on my lap and tears in my eyes, a lump in my throat. It's not a bad kind of cry, but a realization. I love you, I love you, I love you. I think of you in threes, and you know numbers are a comfort to my excessive OCD. Tap, tap, tap, your fingers dance on mine, tap, tap, tap. A silent I love you. The reason for this letter is to explain something, because I know that my awkward silences and weirdness about being open scares you, makes you feel hidden, but my love, you are anything but hidden. Your name is on my lips while I dream in shades of blue, it's on my airless breath while I stand in the rain and the wind yelling out, it is in the way I look at you when you aren't looking. You are there in every way I can show. You are every stanza in each poem I write, you are the drawings that fill my notepad, you are every careful outfit I plan in case I run into you in the halls. You, you, you. And I wish I could be vocal, I wish I wasn't so scared of falling apart under your finger tips, I wish I wasn't terrified of turning to dust each time we touch. I wish I wasn't nervous and anxious and fucking scared of love. &amp;#x200B; Before you, I never let myself love. I never let myself fall. But here I am now, falling 20 stories down to the ground covered in your sweet affection. And it's not your love I am scared of, it's the what-ifs. It's the lack of control. We both know how I am about control, whether it be me repeating the same word five times until I get it right, or watching how your lips form the three letters, just so I can mimic and memorize, whether it be the 10 times I go to the bathroom to wash my hands because I am so nervous, or perfecting how to write your name, or every time I throw up my meals. We both know how i am about controlling everything. I can't control how you see me, I can't control feeling this strange new emotion of love, I can't control how much I want to kiss you, I can't control whether you'll end up losing love for me, or if you'll see me the way I see myself one day. I can't control any of it. And it scares me. Please know that, although it pains you that you feel so hidden by me, the only reason I refuse to tell my parents is the same reason love scares me. Control. You see, everything that has ever brought me happiness, they are taken from me. Control, control, control. I don't want them to take you. it's irrational. I know. It's always irrational. But I hope you know I've gotten better about doing things against their vice grip over my throat, be it not coming home on my curfew, or not telling them what time I will be home, or even smoking weed with you. Whatever it has been, it's progress, and one day I will be able to tell them with confidence in the fact that they can't take you. &amp;#x200B; Lastly, my dear one, I want you to know that I love you. Only you. Last year, when I first saw you, everything changed for me, and it may only be a month, but I want you to understand that I do love you. You, you, you. Hot cocoa eyes, sweet mint smile, you, you, you. I've kept every poem we have written together, or I re-read the poems you write for me, I listen to your playlist you made for me, and yes, I sleep with your flannel every night. &amp;#x200B; I love you, I love you, I love you. &amp;#x200B; Sincerely, &amp;#x200B; Me."

624,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Dear Friend I Left Behind,1,9r9791,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/9r9791/dear_friend_i_left_behind/,2018-10-25 21:55:46,"Dear friend, We both know that apologies are bullshit next to action, but since my actions were everything but what they were supposed to be, I feel like I should say it anyway. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for making you break up with your boyfriend... but at the same time not really. He was a cunt. He made you feel like much less than the woman you are. He made you feel ugly and worthless. When you needed attention, he turned you away for television or games- or most of the time to run off with his friends and waste himself. He made you slave over all the house chores, in HIS HOUSE. He would look at other girls on his phone while with you. The latter of which in my personal opinion would possibly be passable if it were JUST looking. He contacted them behind your back (or so he thought) and flat out lied about it to cover his tracks. When he got caught, they were suddenly ""just friends."" God forbid what else he'd do, but that's me starting drama. It took me forever to convince you that he was doing you wrong. Somewhere deep down you knew, but you were too stubborn to let him go. I couldn't see why until now. And I didn't just help you dump him. I replaced him. I don't remember if it was intentional, but I did. I'm sorry for doing that. I'm sorry for making you fall in love with me. I don't know if that's a thing people can actually do, but it feels like I did. I forced you to love me. I made no other opinions valid in your own head. I brainwashed you. And all throughout I became no better than him. I'm sorry for showing off my exes to you. I wanted you to see that you weren't the only one who hurt... that's not the whole truth. We all know how that goes. I did it to make you jealous. I wanted you to see me and think there was some quality that makes women want me because I'm too pussy to just make a move. I did a lot more than I'd bargained for. I'm sorry for showing off my girlfriends to you while we were just friends, for the same reason. I would apologize to them for using them, but they treated me like shit so it's probably karma that it ended up this way. Either way, I shouldn't have done it. I'm sorry for saying I love you. I did. I do. But I shouldn't have said it- for several reasons. You were fresh out of an agonizing four years that I watched you strughle through, and I knew you were vulnerable. I could use my own vulnerability as a valid excuse, I suppose, but in the end I still did what I knew I probably shouldn't. But I did. And afterwards I hated myself even more than I thought I could. That self-hatred made me do terrible things to you. I would be irritable for reasons I never explained. I would avoid you just because I couldn't bare to face my shame when I looked at you. And every time I came back felt worse because instead of being pissed at me or any kind of upset, you were happy. You were genuinely happy just to see me again. I couldn't understand why. I still struggle to. When I asked, you said it was because you loved me. That's when I realized something. I don't think I loved you. At least, not the way you loved me. I don't know if I loved you at all. I don't know if I know what ""love"" really is. I know I cared about you. I know I wanted you to be okay and safe. I know I liked talking with you and watching you. But I don't know if I loved you. And in thinking about it, I've always had a problem differentiating various kinds of love. And I think I could have prevented a lot of pain if I'd spoken up on what I thought. I'm sorry for not explaining that I have aspergers. It's commonplace for people who have autism to be wired differently than others, and because of that we a lot of times don't understand certain social cues or constructs, or morals, or emotions, etc. Hell, some of us, like me, have a hard time understanding ourselves let alone others. But I hid all that away. I wanted to be as close to perfect as I could. I wanted to be a ""normal person."" So with everyone I met, I hid it. I hid the fact that every time you said ""you know what I mean,"" I didn't. I hid the fact that I was scared every time we said we loved each other. I hid the fact that I was scared to love. I hid the fact that I was scared of what I thought I felt not being genuine- that it was some passing infatuation or just that you were a really close friend. I still don't know what it is. I'm sorry for letting you take my virginity. The truth is, as much as I wanted to, I was scared that I shouldn't have sex with you- and not just because I was scared not to be good enough for you, which I still one hundred percent believe I wasn't. Moreso because of my wavering feelings about you. Was I really giving my all to you? Do I deserve to have you? Do I deserve you at all? You knew that I was scared to disappoint you, we were both scared to disappoint each other. But I don't think you understood that when I said ""I don't care about myself,"" I really didn't. I suppose I can use that as a segway to something that messed us up just as much as my autism. I'm sorry for not fully explaining my depression. With this one I will use the excuse card of me not knowing what exactly my depression consisted of. You would always ask me why I was depressed, or why I turned away from you or got mad at you out of the blue. ""I don't know"" really was the answer- at least, partly. What I failed to explain was in what context. I didn't know what I felt about you. I didn't know what I felt about myself. That's why I lashed out. I think you figured that out, though. Then you blamed yourself. I'm sorry for being too late to tell you that I was depressed even before meeting you and that I just hid it. I wanted to be in control for you, keep things stable. I'm too high-maintenance when I'm myself, so I tried to not have any problems. I ended up being worse than if I'd come clean. By the time I decided to tell you, I couldn't tell if you didn't believe me or if it just didn't make a difference at that point. I'm sorry for breaking up with you too late. I could've left you with a lot less scars and a lot more time to heal, but like you I was too stubborn to let you go. I was too selfish to face the fact that this wasn't right. I was too selfish to face that I was making things worse. I also knew that you wouldn't want to let go either. I finally understand why, now. I also knew that we couldn't be friends after this. If we did, we'd both want to keep coming back to this. You would keep crying to me and I would cave in. So I had to leave for good. Hate me, forget me, forgive me- whatever you have to do, just move on somehow. I know I'm still struggling to. I don't know in what way, but I know I love you. So I hate that I had to leave. And moreso that I left you to pick up the pieces of my mess because I don't know how. I'm sorry for literally everything that I did to, for, or even anywhere close to you. We should have never been friends, and the truth is that I knew that from the start. I knew I was unstable and weasled my way in anyway. I'm doing all the things you knew I would. I'm in college, now. I'm not doing the best, but I haven't failed yet. I'm writing poetry again, and I'm even starting a band- just like you always said you dreamed about. I even made friends like you said I would. I always find myself laughing because I can still feel you getting jealous or having to fend you off from them making a joke about me. You act just like an overprotective mother, yet you're half my height. You were always looking out for me like that. We always did what we thought was best for each other, no matter what. In honor of you, even though I'm still fighting that depression and all the darker thoughts, I want to achieve everything you wanted for me. I want to make you proud. To the friend I left behind, one of the first true friends I'd ever had and a once-in-a-lifetime friend I'll never have again, I hope things are turning around for you. I hope that you're on your way to gaining your strength back and leaving the past behind you for once. I hope we both get out of our shitty neighborhoods and shittier relationship issues and make something of ourselves. And maybe even find each other again... if that's even an okay thing to happen... To my bestest friend, I miss you. I love you."
625,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,To my stalker,1,9rrb9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/9rrb9d/to_my_stalker/,2018-10-27 14:37:18," For years I lived in fear of you. In fear of you hurting me or my family. In fear of speaking out because I wanted to remain under the radar, so as to not trigger you. I never thought it would happen to me. These were stories from hollywood thrillers that surely wouldnt happen to me. What a life lesson, to learn compassion for victims. To live knowing the impotence of a system that doesnt really protect stalking victims, male or female. And today the local news is covering two recent restraining orders against you for domestic violence. Years later. I dont feel joy, it is of no relief to me that others went through much worse than I did. It is no relief to me to read comments that demean you, like clockwork there are comments questioning the allegations, from people that never even met you. From people that never saw the murderous look in your eyes. I was lucky to escape early. Only a few months in. I was lucky that you moved on to other things. Someone elses suffering ensued. I feel immense sadness and guilt now. I am confronted by the memories and the recognition that to this day the experience became part of who I am. It made me stronger, as facing fear and trauma can do. But i also internalized a sense of profoud fear and vulnerability. There is no safe space to be when someone is obsessed with obtaining your love whether you consent or not. This is not a political statement, it is just my personal expwrience and knowledge that it takes an enormous amount of strength to fight back, to have to consider how to peotect even your aging parebts from your obsession. It takes so much resolve to protect yourself, even when fighting back involves strategic hiding of your presence, not only in the real world but in the virtual world. I try to muster all the empathy I have to say to you: get help. learn to love yourself and let go of anyone who does not want to be with you. It will bring you much more satisfaction and peace. To anyone who hears I dont want to be with you, accept it as truth. We do not need persistent convincing. People are very obvious when they want to be with someone,, find someone who openly and obviously wants to be with you out of their own volition. That is true love. That is an experience that heals all demons. The only way for me to heal is to treat you and others better than you treated me. I need to have faith that this world can change and that even in the sickest or most tortured souls there is a possibility for change and healing, so that others dont have to live through hell on earth."
626,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,To you my friend,1,9ta35i,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/9ta35i/to_you_my_friend/,2018-11-02 01:50:59,"Dear \_\_\_\_\_, We met three years ago. Three years is an awful long time, particularly in our context. However, I dare say, and don't think you would disagree, that there has been more space and quiet in that three years and the last year, has been truly silent. Is it ready to be concluded, once and for all? I don't know. Maybe it already was, by you, a year ago and I just am realizing it myself. In that case, and in an effort to give myself some measure of closure, there are a few things I wish to express. Bear with me, as you know I tend to get wordy. First, when I called you my friend- I meant it. I didn't use friend instead of lover, fuck buddy, boyfriend, or any other term. I used friend because that is truly what you were. Second, when we met, you were the first person I had encountered who seemed to accept me for all my quirks, weirdness, and yes, naughtiness. You seemed at times to dig my bizarre bazaar. And I needed that so very much. To the extent you found my gratitude and appreciation for being accepted, as stifling, overbearing, frightening or concerning- I am sorry. Third, I never loved you in the way that I think you think I did. It is hard to explain and there is not a proper word in our lexicon for it. It was a mixture of many things including concern and worry. I worried about you- not just in generic risk ways that you may have encountered, but because I suppose I saw in you a kindred spirit that was also roaming and looking for something he couldn't quite find. Some call it peace, and maybe that is what I sensed. You were not at peace and I wanted you to find that. I admired you for many of the qualities you possessed that I was incapable of possessing myself. I admired your commitment (despite the ironic undertone of our meeting); I admired your resolve to do better than had been done to you. I admired your intelligence, wit and sarcasm and even your rather cold humor. Most of all, I felt I suppose, special or privileged because every few occasions, your rather tough exterior would crack and little bits of a softer and more vulnerable you peeked out. Sometimes that vulnerability even stayed a bit with me, and sometimes it shot down even deeper inside of you. It was a bit like a deer- if one can sit quietly in the woods, without moving or stirring, sometimes out of the corner of your eye will appear this magnificent and vulnerable creature, lithe and golden brown, with large brown eyes starring at you, sorting out what you saw. The entire time, you are frightened but also seemingly unaware of how beautiful and captivating you are. Not once did I ever think of gently raising my quiver an loading an arrow as you walked away. Yes, I admit I also wanted to inspire and encourage you to pursue some of your strengths and skills that had seemed, thus far to be back-burnered in your life. You possess an ability to express yourself and thoughts in a way that should be recognized and admired, and it saddened me that an audience had not yet formed for you. Fourth, the physical stuff was fun, and wild and unique. There are moments that still I can recall that make my stomach do a weird little flip- and in my mind, I know that eventually they will fade but for now they just serve as frosting on the cake. Why then, did we fail so miserably? Why did we fuck this up so much? Did we both sabotage this out of some area of self loathing or hate? Are we both masochists who have to ruin or try to ruin anything good in our life because deep down we don't feel we deserve it? Or where you a monster who machinated and orchestrated a little game you decided to play with someone else. Was a means to uplift your ego, and once consumed, you no longer needed the container that held the elixir? Was everything a lie upon a lie because you have forgotten what the truth is? And all the fucked up ness came from someone who never cared, but just learned to fake it when he needed to? Or was I the monster? Was I a frightening and scary and threatening creature who made you fear me? Did I need to be managed while being led, subtley and yet incrementally into that monster trap-- that black hole you could drop me into, but out of which I could never crawl? What is the truth? I do not know. I do know that it bothers me, it haunts me, and despite everything else in my life which has changed for the better, this is a part of me that feels...unresolved. I have tried being angry at you. I have tried being angry at myself. I have tried being Zen about it. Just like my other imperfections, I can not maintain Zen on this for long. Perhaps that will change when I no longer drive on roads that take me past places we were together at. Perhaps when I am far, far away and no longer in this area, and no longer see the colors of fall, and the river and the trees and towns and the buildings....I will forget. For now though, I remember. Peace, &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\*\*\* &amp;#x200B;"

I love you and this physical distance is a lot on us. But Ill be damned if I am leaving this without a fight. This time if we end Im making sure we burn it to the ground. But that doesnt seem likely. It feels like we are starting to settle into a new normal. Like we are getting a flow. The banter was good and believe me... you and I are some of the best at it. That intellectual stimulation is something we both crave. The way we play off each other is special. At least to me. Now we are moving into a new stage where there is a level of comfort in vulnerability for both of us. Ive had a pretty rough couple weeks. I was worried with me quitting smoking that my messed up brain chemistry would impact our relationship. Terrified really. I wanted to quit for me, sure. Ive done it long term a few times now. The main reason I wanted to quit is because having kids is so important to you. Thats a new level of love for me. Quitting smoking so that I can potentially have a child with someone. You have told me directly that you wanted me to have your kids but it wasnt till I heard you tell your mom that I believed you. I took a week to think and decided that I should quit smoking. That I needed to start taking better care of myself. I even booked an appointment with my doctor to have a checkup and talk about getting ready for pregnancy. We run some blood work to make sure my fertility is doing well next week. Ive never seriously considered having a child with any man Ive ever been with much less actively tried to prepare. As I got dressed following my appointment I realized that I was smiling... no beaming, really. I love you in a consuming way. All I want is to start our lives together. I miss you every day. Its intense and crazy. Im playing it cool with you but my goals are the same and when we are ready I dont want anything delaying us further. "

629,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Im tired of running,1,9v9eas,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/9v9eas/im_tired_of_running/,2018-11-08 23:01:28,"We are both runners. We run in different ways from different things but we both have this knack for lacing up our running shoes and taking off. Im still figuring out what you are running from. Is it long term commitment? For someone so focused on kids and marriage it seems odd. Is it vulnerability with someone who could actually hurt you? Im starting to think thats it. Why do I run? Well its complicated. Ive always had this wanderlust. A thirst for starting over and Ive been doing it for as long as I can remember. As a child Id switch schools and start over. It was refreshing. Most people fear change but for me hope has always come from significant change. Life leads me amazing places. The decisions I make, while not always the right one, are never things I regret because its all part of the ride. I was talking to my friend about my relationship with you and my history of taking off. He pointed out that I pushed you away by running the last time. A new country then a new city then another new city. I just couldnt seem to settle down that year. Work and school were the reason but the real reason was that I didnt know my place in the world. That I needed to start over and couldnt get it just right at first. I run. I run from relationships that end badly, from past hurts, from problems. Sure I do it in exotic locations but it doesnt change. Run to Europe, the Middle East, a new American city (or two). With each new place I shed the hurt and pain of the what could have beens. There is something so liberating about running especially when you run to somewhere amazing. My friend brought up that if I go home, finally, that it will be the first time I have run towards a relationship. With you it feels natural to run to you and that says something. Im ready to stop running. Im terrified. I want to settle down and make a life long term. I dont talk about it as much lately because Im scared. Im scared to let you know how much I want this. How much Im willing to sacrifice or risk. Running would be way more fun if you were with me. I can run away on my own but it will always be me running away from my problems. I dont want to run anymore. I want this to be the last time I run and I want to run straight into your arms. Show me its going to be okay. That you can be that safe place that Ive went all over the world in search of. "

You have different women everywhere, all in love with you, all charmed by you. You coaxed me into an odd, undefined. unsaid, emotional affair with you over the past decade. I know that sounds like I just dont want to take responsibility for my actions, and that a lot of people are going to post mean comments about how worthless I am and that I will mostly receive hatred for this. I understand that I let it happen. But I also know that you preyed on me, and that you studied me more than some people study in college. You made yourself into what you thought I wanted. Many, many many years ago, before I succumbed to your efforts, we were walking together, and you told me that your wife didnt like how you werent creative when complimenting her. I said oh yeah same thing for my at the time boyfriend. Soon after that, you told me that I looked lovely. I was younger than, and stupider, and that took my breath away. That was the first time you had success. I resisted for a long time after that, with many little interactions and gifts and what not coming my way. When your wife died, you seemed so sad, and had always been nice to me. It seemed like no one at work was really caring for what a painful thing you were dealing with. I started checking up on you. I have a big heart, and I thought it was harmless. You cried in front of me, multiple times. Now I wonder if that was planned vulnerability, especially with how you sometimes use vulnerability to get me to forget that Im mad at you. I dont think that you want to let me go, but you want everything your way. You fucked up by lying to me. Now I know that nothing will stop you from saying and doing what you think I want you to say and do. You underestimated how much the misguided belief that you were somehow honest with me meant for there to be an us. Your definition of love has always had this flavor of love meaning never having to say your sorry, but when you lie to someone you have to say sorry. Have you ever actually trusted someone? I am getting mentally more healthy, and stronger. I truly hope that you are happy, because I am afraid thats the only way you will let me go. People who hate me based on these paragraphs, bring on the hate. This is, without a doubt, the worst thing about me. "

Your adolescent mindset was bothersome, though you were transparent. I wish I understood youre struggle grappling with faith at the time. I feel the same as you did now. I didnt realize your progression, and I was ignorant. I guess I just cut people off too easily. Im not sure. I definitely wont send this, nor unblock you on things. Its been two years.

I'm sorry I didn't communicate and I'm sorry I risked my safety by being dumb and reckless. I've been working so hard on vulnerability. On opening up and trusting people. On loving myself through the hard stuff. But last night, I ignored all those lessons and reverted back to a worse version of me. In that moment, I was drunk and I was so emotionally triggered that I could not think through my choices. It's so rare for me to not be able to do that. But I couldn't. And I didn't feel like I needed friends to talk to or cry on their shoulders, especially not while you were in the midst of dealing with another person's crisis. No, I felt like I needed the space to quietly self destruct and so I left and I lied and I did some stupid shit. I don't know why I'm like this. Why my first instinct is to sink into my emotions and do reckless, harmful things. I know that I've tried to learn different. Sometimes I can do different. But sometimes I still can't.

Ill never forgive myself, ever, for hurting her by falling for you, but when it got messy YOU were allowed to leave, YOU came out unscathed. You think its as easy for us to block you and move on with our lives? You think the angry email I sent you all those months ago was the end all for the toxicity and destroyed trust and feelings that you evoked in my life? I have never seen such kindness in my life, her, letting me back into her heart after I strayed from her like a fool, every single day for months it was like building the pyramids all on my own to simultaneously get over you while falling back in love with her, learning to treat her right, and preying to God that I never make the same mistake. Ive been given a second chance WITH THE RIGHT GIRL. I hope every time you think of me or think of her you know what chaos you caused, how you uprooted our lives, and imposed yourself on us. I hate you, I hate what you enabled us to do, and I hate how weak I became and how awful of a person I was when you were in my life. I made an unforgivable mistake, but you were always right there to let it happen, KNOWINGLY and willingly engaging with me. Youre sick. I was then, but I had everything to lose. She was your best friend, she IS and WAS my whole world. Shes the only woman who I will ever trust again. Shes a better woman than you will ever be. I hate knowing you work and live on my commute.

I blame myself for thinking you'd be here, for thinking you'd stay and for thinking I was allowed to be vulnerable. I hate you, but I hate myself more. You know I'll always be here and that you have me wrapped around your fingers. You could leave and I'll be here waiting. So I'll put all my cards out because you won't.

One day you might realize it and one day you might find someone who you'll treat how I treated you and realize how much it hurts to know what you're giving them is real and what you're receiving is fake. I'm the opposite of what an abused child should be like, at least according to psychologists and I'm sure I'm not the only one. I crave affection even if it is the fake kind you're giving me. I crave someone to give me the care and love my parents never gave me. I guess that's why I grasped on to you. Maybe I'm at fault : I crave any affection so i get fake affection in return. Maybe after trying to correlate attention with affection I'm learning my lesson. I have nothing else to you besides I'll still be here and you know I will. I will always be here until you leave. Maybe when you leave you'll realize how it feels to feel an out of body experience.

It hurt too much. I couldn't formulate my emotions about it. I didn't want to speak. I shut out the world. You always taught me to be strong, to not show vulnerability, to never cry, to always get back up if I fall. So I did. There were boxes of your documents. Mother wanted to throw them all away, but I opened each one, and there, I found your letters. I found a letter from a woman who was in love with you. You had won so many awards. From the time you were in middle school, you won every award there was. Academic achievement, military achievement, you were always at the top of your class. A Captain, a Major, a linguist, a translator, a photographer, a polymath, a polyglot. I found a folder of all your awards and certificates. You were always humble and thought it was shallow to display your achievements, but there they were, locked away in this box; but hidden within this folder was a letter from her. *Her.* A woman 7 years your senior. She was married but her marriage was falling apart. She was in love with you. I read her words to you, I saw her photo. She wrote a letter to you 4 months before I would be born, pleading you to write to her because she missed your letters. And then I remembered the story of how mother told me there had been someone else you had been in love with before you had gotten married. There had been another woman, it was this woman, it was her. I looked her up and found out that she had died exactly 4 months after you passed away. She was a pretty, tall woman with blonde hair with striking blue eyes. On her obituary page, someone wrote: ""I miss you Grandma"". She had gotten remarried to someone else after her first marriage failed. In the end, instead of choosing her, you chose me, your unborn child, and my mother. You chose me, and you gave up this woman you were in love with, and who was in love with you, who was ready to leave her husband for you. You chose me. You chose to do the responsible thing. You chose duty and responsibility over your own desires. You gave me everything, Dad. From the time I was little, to when I went to university, there was no expense that had been spared for me. You worked night shifts to send me to the best schools. You gave me an allowance to buy all the latest fashions. You would wake up early to tutor me in math and science before you would leave for work. I was the apple of your eye, I was your ""Little-Me"". You taught me to be strong, that I could be just as good as any man in any profession, and that it was my personality and my character that defined me, and not just my looks. You taught me to stand up for myself, to walk with my head held up high, even if everyone was against me. You taught me to be to be responsible, to always have integrity. But in the end, I couldn't save you, Dad. I couldn't save you. And I'm sorry I failed. I'm sorry that I wasn't a better daughter. There are so many things that I regret that I wish I could've done. I wish that I had spent more time with you. I wish that I went on more walks with you. I wish that I had finished the flight course and gotten a pilot's license like you'd wanted me to. I miss our talks. I miss the way you used to advise me about everything. I miss how we would watch movies over Thanksgiving and your insightful commentary about each film. I miss the way you would lecture me about being on time and keeping my promises and my word, and that I was meant for more things than just becoming an athlete, a scientist, or an artist. You gave me the best of everything, everything a daughter could've asked for, but life wasn't fair to you. I failed you, Dad. I couldn't save you. I miss you so much. I feel so lost without you. I thought I always knew what I was going to do and now I feel so uncertain. It's been a year since you've passed away, but it still hurts so much. I hope that you're happy, wherever you are. I hope that in the next life, you get to choose the woman you're in love with, and be able to do everything you had wanted to do and not feel a burden to responsibility. I love you, Dad. I hope we can meet again, someday. &amp;#x200B;"

I was uncomfortable with the way I felt tricked into accepting a date, and was feeling like I'd just be falling victim to my own emotional vulnerability if I followed through. I begged out and asked for a rain check. I told him part of the truth, that I had a medical procedure on Friday that I wasn't bouncing back from as quickly as I'd hoped, but not the whole truth. I didn't tell him that it made me uncomfortable that he's been pushing me to go out with him, that he turned a friendly drink into dinner. The shark is someone who I've known a long time, but we've never really been friends who hung out alone. I didn't know him 10 years ago, and I really don't know him now. I need to see if I like him as a person before I can decide to cross the line from friendship to dating, so we texted last night instead. I asked for a rain check, because I might want to go out once I get to know him better, but he isn't a random stranger, and the stakes are higher. If I'm honest, I'd much rather see Doc again. I still want to hear from you, but we never really got off the ground and Doc is real, rather than a fantasy like you. I've become fond of saying that I want to be someone's choice rather than just an option, and the shark is just an option. I don't know if that's fair to him, when I want more than that for myself. I chose you, and would choose Doc (if he let me), but not the shark. - K "

You desperately needed a therapist of your own, and what self respecting couples therapist would have seen us in that condition? I didn't feel safe to be vulnerable with you, and the things you did when I broke up with you were beyond my worst suspicions. It would not have been safe for me to open up further in a therapy session with you and I would not have trusted a therapist who would have allowed that. It disgusts me that you're romanticising someone else so soon, whilst harrassing me and claiming to desperately need my help. If it's true, and you've lied about these things before, where is your self respect? She has a daughter and a mental health vulnerability. Do you really believe you can will away your abusive behaviour? How does your conscious let you play her? You sent me an email saying you 'fucked' her and that she's 'supportive' now, where is your shame? Just so you know you evil fucking gremlin, I fell in love with you when I met you and the residue of those feelings is still clogging up my insides like gunk. I can't demonise you and pretend things to forget you, I see you just as I did then, when I had the right idea that you were too crazy to ever have. Yes I still love you although I am leaving the feelings to wilt and die. Yes when you say you are with someone else, or when you say you were drinking behind my back the whole time, or when you say your friends have heard nothing but descriptions of what a monster I am, yes that hurts me. And I hate you for being capable of so much worse than I thought, when I had the right idea that you were too crazy to ever have. I loved being together and I hated the way we were. I told you what I thought and why always but my explanations never mattered. Were never heard. Were never anything but rationalisations and excuses to you. What the hell was I to you? All the things you told me? Why did you ruin this? You asked me the same thing but I let you destroy my resilience rather than leave you to destroy yourself. Why did you play with the meds? Why did you alienate the professionals? Why did you lie to me? Why did you use all of us to abuse yourself? How can you be the victim of abuse without an abuser? How can you pretend your attacks were self defense? Why do you have to tell me who you fucked and when you drank? Why do you beg me to help you after begging me to promise you I'll never speak to you again? How crazy are you really? Are you ever going to revert to who you were when I met you? Because I remember the things you revealed to me. You revealed that one day I'll know why you like that picture, with the smoke obscuring your entire face and the water in the canal reflecting nothing but darkness. You revealed to me that you call yourself the Other and when you met me you thought I was Another, but after a while you realised it wasn't so. You went silent when I spoke about what I think about lies. You said you were pleased with my attitude that I will treat you as an unreliable narrator in search of the truth. What's the truth? Are you schizo? Borderline? Faking it all? Do you even know? I hate you more than words could say Ben."

They never will be solved: at best, they get buried under newer confusions. Would you believe you were the first adult friend I had made in over 2O years? You were almost like a brother to me, except we fucked, and despite that, I cared more about your happiness than my own. I suppose I should have never replied to your email you sent after our first flop of a meeting. But you got me hooked- not with your cold professional male bravado, but with that little boy lost look in your eye when you first mentioned why you responded. I saw pain, hurt and rejection and it resonated with me. I could never reject you once I saw that. Knowing too well how you may have felt- I just couldnt. And time and time again, I took your blows. No matter how you reacted, cut me off, made me feel crazy, maybe even inferior, I never stopped seeing that look on your face when we first chatted. It broke my heart and it made me weak. I never could bear to see other people hurt, no matter how much they might not need or want my empathy. As time went on, and we talked more, I resolved foolishly to let my guard down. I offered my vulnerability to you- not as a replacement, but more as a shoulder for you to use to step on to climb. Too bad in so doing, I sunk deeper into my own muddy hell. I wanted so much to believe the things you said. I needed to know that my dirty, bruised shoulder wasnt unappreciated, taken for granted. As time continued, you failed to give me that in return. You knew it and rather than do something about it, you just said that is what you are. We both know that isnt true. We also both know many things you told me were not true or mostly not true. Anyway, while you are now absent from my life, our meeting left some indelible imprints on me. I wish I could trust my faith to let them be positive. But part of me wonders how far did the lies go? If you lied about me being a friend, then why should I believe you ever thought I was sexy, pretty, interesting? Why should I ever believe you missed me or you had regret for being how you were? I almost could but for that very last email. It had been months since we last met, months since you promised to do better at staying in touch. It was the first and only promise you ever made...and broke. To then hear from you out of nowhere, months later-and without accountability- it broke whatever empathy I had. I hope some day I can find the right hole to bury this in. Like Goldilocks seeking perfect accommodations, I seek the right characterization. Sometimes you were a shortterm friend. Sometimes you were a manipulative flake. Sometimes you were confused, scared and frozen. Sometimes though, you are just like the other monsters in my life- the ones that used my sweetness and vulnerability to their advantage before they used my body. God, I dont want to think of you that way, nor do I want to think you were just another type of perpetrator I encountered. But I am starting to fear you were- and were meant to be my last. "

It was the spring of my freshman year of high school, and I was going through a rough patch emotionally. I was constantly confining myself with self-doubt, self-hate, and low self-esteem to the point where I would cut my own flesh to relieve the pressure that was constantly weighing down on my mind. I truly was at a dark place, and I honestly cannot thank you enough for simply talking to me at that time. Talking to you was an outlet for me. Just knowing that someone out there cared enough to laugh at my jokes and ask about how my day went really helped me push through the emotional struggles inside of me. Because you cared and because you made sure I knew it, I began changing into a brighter, happier person. My posture changed into a more confident one and I began smiling and laughing a lot. My mind began to heal and I truly began to enjoy spending time with you. We would go out, get a sandwich, and argue about the most pathetic things to the point where we would both laugh hysterically. You always complained about how I never make eye contact with you when we talk. You would always say, I dont know if youre talking to me or the window and I would just laugh. Whenever I made an effort to look at you in the eyes, you would give me the warmest smile I have ever seen. I would shyly smile back at you and with a grin, you would say, See? That wasnt too hard, was it? You were a heavy smoker and I hated everything about cigarettes. I begged you to stop smoking because your lungs will literally rot and rotten lungs arent that attractive. I never expected you to stop smoking but you did. I know it drove you crazy, but you did it. I remember telling you that I would buy lunch if you didnt smoke for the next three months. And you did. Or I thought you did. I remember the day you came out to me about your feelings towards me. I was out of town and I was upset about something that involved you. You called me at midnight that night and you said Im sorry, I cant lose you and our friendship because I really really like you. I really do. You have no idea how much I like you as a person. I dont think I took you seriously during that phone call because I refused to believe that you had romantic feelings about me. It was about two months later or so and we were still talking. We were friends. My friend called me one night to tell me that you were still smoking. You were smoking in front of her and said, Dont tell her (me) about any of this. Please dont. She did tell me and I was hugely disappointed in you. I dont know why, but I started crying. Maybe I felt stupid or betrayed. I think I felt betrayed. You called me later that night, apologizing over and over again about how you shouldnt have hid the fact from me you simply didnt want to disappoint me because you really really really liked me. I told you that I liked you too. But I meant it as friends. I meant to tell you that I liked you as a friend. No more, no less. I dont think that message got through, because apparently we were dating? I really should have told you what I meant when I told you that I liked you, but I didnt. Curiosity got the best of me and I just went with the flow and began dating you because I wanted to see what dating was all about. There were no emotions attached on my part, at least in the beginning. I was hesitant in the beginning of our relationship because I wasnt sure if I was making the right choice or not. But you tried your best to make me feel at ease and at home with you. As the relationship progressed, I began falling for you and your kindness. I knew it was a mistake, but ignored my conscience telling me that its a mistake because I simply liked the feeling of being loved. It was warm and cozy, like a campfire in late autumn. I remember the day I said I love you for the first time. You had already told me that weeks before I said it, and whenever I refused to say it back, you would just say, its okay, Ill just stand here, waiting for you. I wanted to wait until I had those exact emotions for you, and when I developed those emotions, I finally said it. When I said it, you simply replied by saying, I love you too, good night. Later, I found out that you werent able to sleep that night because you were just too happy to waste time on sleep. I also remember the first time I reached for your hands, the first time we cuddled and felt each others warmth, the first time you kissed my hands and cheeks, and the first time you kissed me on the lips. The firsts we had were always so tender, soft, sincere, and passionate. I dont think Ill ever forget the feeling of laying my head on your chest, listening to the beating of your heart and feeling the warmth of your body while you tightly hugged me because I was always cold. You would always whisper how gorgeous I was, how making me laugh and seeing my dimples emerged from my cheeks brightened your day, and lastly, how much you loved me. I dont think Ill ever forget that content, warm and fuzzy feeling I got whenever we cuddled. We were so uncertain of what would happen to us because of the nature of our relationship it was hidden, kept as a secret from everyone else besides the two of us because I was 15 and you were 23. You would say, To you, this is probably some high school relationship but Im dead serious about what we have right now. You were eight years older than I was, and it was wrong and unacceptable. The older I get, the more I realize how wrong it was of us to be together at that time. I was just a naive 15-year old and sometimes, I cant help but wonder if you were taking advantage of my innocence. I remember the day you gifted me a diamond necklace by stating, This is a collar that shows that youre mine. I should have seen your true self then and break up with you. You were beginning to show your true, manipulative, possessive side. We had our happy moments followed by bitter fights and arguments that hurt us more than we thought. But we got through it. We tried like hell to get through it. And then one day, my parents found out about us and what we had between us. All hell broke loose and I was not allowed to go anywhere without the accompaniment of my siblings or my parents. I was not to step outside without supervision. The relationship I had with you caused a riff between my parents and I, and I didnt even realize it then. They felt betrayed at the fact that I didnt trust them enough and the fact that I was putting myself, my education, and my future at risk by being with you. They knew what you were about before I finally realized. We continued on with our secret relationship for a few months after we broke up. We would call each other at 1 am in the morning so we wouldnt get caught and I would change your contact info so when my parents looked through my call history, they wouldnt know that I was still in touch with you. During those few months, I moved to an area 7 hours from where you were, two states away. The fact that I was now at an area hours away from you made you desperate. Not in a good way. I tried to understand you, but after a bit, it became too much. You would make sure that I was not talking to any guys in school, even for homework help out of fear that I may fall for whoever the mystery guy could be, instead of him. You would discourage me from working my hardest in sciences and maths to become a medical doctor because you wanted me to be more financially dependent on him later in the future. Because of your worthless obsession over my dependency on you, I strived for a career in the medical field, which was not where my passion lied. My true passion lied in art and you supported that, not because it was what I truly wanted, but because art generally does not generate much profit and you wanted me to depend on you, which disgusted me. You would also try to control my style and my clothing choices, discouraging me from wearing clothes that seemed fitting or revealing because you didnt want other guys staring at what was yours. My patience for you and your ignorant words and logic was running out fast. I should have broken up with you earlier, but I didnt because I was afraid of losing someone that loved me. But what we had, at that point, wasnt love. You were objectifying me and tried to own me. That isnt love. Thats violation. My last straw was when you trash-talked to me about my own mother, how Shes a bitch for not liking me and what we have together. Also, nobody likes her and she should really fucking know that. I lost it when you said that. I just couldnt do it anymore. I blindly let you control my identity but I just couldnt let you control the relationship I have with the people who I have loved and cherished for my entire life, maybe more. When I told you that I was breaking up with you, you got mad at me and yelled at me for not being able to See what Satan was doing to the relationship we have because apparently, God was trying to make something beautiful happen through us. As you know, I am a Christian and I believe that God has to exist. I still have a lot of questions about God and his nature, but from the limited knowledge I have of him, I know for a fact that he exhibits selfless love, which does not include manipulation, control, and hate you have shown me over the course of our 8-month relationship.There are numerous other events and how they were handled that created a riff between us, and you probably know what those events are. At the end of our twisted relationship, I realized that I was being controlled and manipulated by you the entire time. You caused me to break away from my peers so you could be the only one who truly interacts with me. I was enraged when I realized that and not going to lie, Im still angry. But now, I have pity for you. That was probably the only way you knew how to exhibit love to others because of the way you were raised. Im sorry you had to grow up in that environment, but always know that you cant use your twisted, messy childhood to justify the wreckage, pain, and unwanted control you assert into numerous individuals, including me. You are your own person and your mistakes are your own. Please stop hiding behind your background and realize the amount of wreckage youve caused. After we broke up, you occasionally sent me paragraphs about how you want to check up on how Im doing until the Thanksgiving of that year, which is when I cut you off of every single mode of communication. Between the night of the end of our relationship and Thanksgiving, so much has happened to my life, including the death of a close family member. I was trying to pick up broken pieces and put myself back together, and your constant presence distracted me. After I excommunicated you, I compartmentalized my feelings and memories of you into the far corner of my mind. About four months after breaking up with you, I decided to stop pursuing medicine and began pursuing art, where my true passion lied. I started to become my own person and truly enjoyed myself. I was receiving grants to take art classes for free at an art college and even landed on an apprenticeship at a museum for a semester during my senior year of high school. I worked the hardest Ive ever worked in my life to get my application together and I was accepted to and is attending the hardest art school to get into in the United States. By the time I moved into school, memories of you were packed away for a long time, along with thoughts of being in a relationship again. And I honestly was not planning to be in a relationship, at least for another few years. But earlier this week, I had a conversation with a friend of mine about relationships and my opinions about being in one. During my conversation, he asked, Would you be in a relationship right now? I caught myself replying, Relationships are great when youre in the midst of it but would it be really worth it at the end, with all the aftermath and complications it creates? Then, I realized that Ive literally been pushing and running away from everyone who has shown interest in me because I didnt want something I had with you again. Before I knew it, I became afraid of being emotionally vulnerable and intimate with other men because the vulnerability I showed you ended up backfiring on me, leaving me feeling stripped and alone. Because I was afraid of the aftermath our relationship created, I was running away from individuals I had not even given a chance to. I am writing this letter to tell you that Im done letting your influence control me any longer. I have loved you and shared so much with you once, and perhaps that is the reason behind why I am so afraid of being in relationships, in general. I dont know if youve let go of me and my influence to you yet, but Im letting go. I cant let you control what I do with myself, like what you did back when we were together."

Was it when she beat me with a mop, till my leg was black and blue? Was it when she shut me in a door and bruised the entire right side of my body? Was it when she hysterically popped the hood of my car in our suburban drive way and began to pull at hoses, wires and sever them with landscaping sheers? Was it when she told me she hoped my husband would cheat on me so I could know how she felt? Was it when she called me a witch, a bitch, a sorceress and cursed me at 8, 10, 12 years old? Was it when she said she was sorry she didn't raise me better, and I turned out the way I did? Was it when she said she resented me for being a woman with the traits I had because it favored a woman she thinks my dad had an affair with? Was it when I was born, and she was happy, maybe, for a moment? When did I become the thorn in your side? When did you decide I was a horror to behold? When did you decide to love me? Is it only when you feel like it? When do you feel like it? Was it when you attempted suicide, and I sat by your bed every night while those machines kept you alive? Was it when I came to visit you everyday at rehab, and offered to bring you a candy bar, they wouldn't let you have? When was it? And why is it so fleeting? Why is your love so circumstantial? I used to be angry. But now I am thankful. You taught me to love, when it makes no sense to. You taught me to be there, even when you don't want to. You taught me to be strong, when you have nothing left within you. You made me who I am. I am not perfect, but I am who I am because of you. I used to think my upbringing was a scar I wear, one I have always had. A birthmark really. It was all I knew, so I never knew it not to be normal, until of late. I realize I don't know what it's like to be loved, let alone by a mother. You say you do, but I walk on egg shells around you, awaiting for the moment you take it back with your words sharper than steel, and your malice so intent, but flailing simultaneously. My father, he loves me, but he looks to me like I ought to look to him. He asks me what to do, how we are supposed to help you. The only times I have seen him act as a father was in rage, fits of protection that I have yet to understand. They came so out of character. Don't get me wrong, this is not a letter of pity, but one of gratitude. I have never gone without. I have never wondered where my next meal would come from. I had traveled more places by the age of sixteen than many people will in a life time. I have had many pets, backyards, toys, and clothes than many will ever see. No, I am not ungrateful. I am thankful. And I forgive you. I thought I had, many years ago. I said I had, I wrote I had, I declared I had, but in my heart I carried a stone of protection from the vulnerability that would come from loving you. But you're my mother. You brought me into this world, and although you very nearly took me out, on several occasions, here I am. I am shattered, but I am grateful, for that too. It is in the shattering that I am able to sift through the pieces that no longer make up who I am. I am able to throw out the bitterness, the anger, the pain, and resentment. I am able to make piles, and realize the happiness amidst the sorrow. The video of you on the beach, playing with me in the sand. I don't remember it, I was too young. But dad says you were happy then. He smiles when he talks of it. The picture of us at a piano. I don't remember these, they are captured on paper and film. But when I look at them, I believe them. I only wish I could have experienced them, as I am now. But I think that is part of the problem. I am not the beautiful baby girl you brought home, from the hospital and placed a ribbon on her head. I am not the toddler you held by the hand, and walked through the snow. I am not the child you took to kindergarten, and packed a lunch. I am a grown woman, now, with her own thoughts, ideas, dreams, plans, and they do not align with yours. I am the opposite of you. I look like my father, I favor his mother, I walk like his brother, I talk like his aunt, I study like his uncle. I am barely yours at all, it seems. But your music lives in me. Your piano plays in my head. Your humor rings in my ears. Your singing reminds me of when I was young. I am yours. I am your daughter. And I love you. I'm sorry, for all you've been through. I'm sorry I was not wiser to know how to better take care of you. I hope you forgive me, as I am forgiving you, and as I must forgive myself. I cherish these glimpses of you. Your kindness. Your thoughtfulness. But I realize I only approached them an arms length away, with a stick, as if you were a rabid dog I feared would lash out at any moment. I cannot go on like this, and neither can you. I will receive the moments you love. I will throw out the ones you don't. And I will remember the times you have. Can we start over? Hi, I'm the little girl you once called daughter. "

I put out my heart and soul out there for you. I wanted to make you happy. I've never regretted a decision more. If I knew you'd use my vulnerability and desire to please you against me, I'd never have opened my mouth that night. If I knew you saying ""Thank you for loving me"" meant ""Thank you for giving me the chance to exploit you"", best believe I'd have walked away. You had absolutely no right to hurt me the way you did. To humiliate me,ignore and use me for your selfish reasons. I was a child, untouched and pure. You destroyed me. You broke everything good in me and now anytime I'm in front of a crowd, i can't help but recall the events that happened that night. My voice shakes, i want to scream instead. I want to yell at you, hit you, throw stuff at you until you feel even a fraction of the pain you caused me. I remember you smiled when i cried out in pain. You shut me up when i asked you to stop. And most importantly, you told me you loved me afterwards. Not only did you take away my music, but you made me hate love. I never want to be loved again. If true love is what you felt for me then I'm ready to be loathed. I'm scared. I can't open up anymore. I already know my next relationship will have issues because i can't stand anyone getting too close. Dear Ex, I hope you're happy."

They say the beginnings the hardest part and I hope thats true. I still dont know why I want you this much. I shouldve been content with the friendship we had, because now I feel like weve lost it altogether. I cant tell if Im the one putting distance between us or if youre avoiding me but I really dont blame you for it. Im sorry for my greed, for wanting you all to myself and telling you at such a bad time. I was so caught up in my emotions I forgot that maybe you were struggling too. I see too much of the good in you, and I forgot that you were struggling with things just like everybody is. Im sorry I fell in love with you with the intention of getting to know you better. I think I really took the trust we had for granted and assumed that youd be comfortable telling me anything under the sun, as I was for you. Id tell you every god damn thing, but maybe you werent ready to tell me whats bothering you. Sorry Im rambling, I meant to write this letter as an apology. Ive noticed for the past few weeks that youve been acting different. Maybe its the upcoming exams, maybe its the lack of purpose you feel, maybe its just something else you never really told me about, and I respect your privacy. Im sorry I never really asked how you were coping with things. Are you doing well? I was so blinded by the construct in my head I forgot reality isnt a parallel universe. I remember asking you if youd ever let anyone know you through and through and you said youd never because you were afraid of people knowing too much. You were scared of being vulnerable, and that was the most vulnerable youve ever been. Im sorry I never told you Id embrace your vulnerability and be there for you if youd ever need anyone to just. Listen. I remember asking you if youd ever tell anyone anything but you hesitated but after a while named somebody and god I hope he listens to you and makes you feel better about things. I hope he supports you to the fullest of his abilities because I would, anytime. Id still love to get to know you better but I guess it takes time. And I need to accept that maybe I cant be that person even if I wanted to. I understand you arent ready, but dearly beloved, Therell always be time for you. Heres to moving on.

I self sabotage, but I also let others walk all over me. I cant find a happy medium of self preservation and vulnerability. I can make all the excuses for why you misuse me, but I cant find the balls and sack up to defend me. The energy Ive wasted in trying to convince me that if I just hold my tongue just this once that it will all be ok in the end and it will work itself out. But fuck that! Its bullshit that you act like my requests are too much like Im asking to much of you. You jump on my ass and demand I consult with you before doing the things you previously asked me to. I cant do this. The uncertaintys killing me. On top of it all I feel guilty for even staying true to my integrity. Like me standing up for myself somehow justifies the way youve been treating me. No, this is no good for me. The expectations have stemmed from the promises youve made me, its not to much to demand reciprocity when it comes to respect. I dont ask for much. "

You took my virginity and later told me you liked to take good girls and ""ruin"" them. I told you I had struggled with an eating disorder in a moment of vulnerability and you held it over my head when it was convenient for you, but still made comments such as telling me you would break up with me if I ever got fat. You would text me demanding my whereabouts and questioning why I wasn't with you if I wasn't in class or at work. You encouraged me to skip class to stay with you. You would bully me into spending every moment of my free time with you, or else face the consequences of your coldness and passiveaggression. You used affection as a carrot and lack thereof as a stick. You refused to spend time at my place, and refused to keep food at your place that I could eat, which led to me eating what you ate, which was fast food and microwave meals. My undiagnosed at the time acid reflux started to bother me more and more and you said I was overreacting. And you said I was overreacting every time I was sick, and would find excuses to get out of taking care of me, though when you got sick you demanded my undivided attention. You got my birthday present a week late, valentines was a day late, and Christmas never came. You told me it was stupid to care about that stuff. You refused to spend any time with my family or friends, and would whine and pick fights if I spent time with them away from you, until you were my whole world. You cheated on me, and told me ridiculous lies until you could lie no more, at which point the excuses started. Then you got me drunk and chased me up the stairs, and when I shook you off of me you fell down the stairs and pretended to pass out at the bottom. The next day you tried to convince me I pushed you on purpose, though I would never hurt you in a million years. I tried to leave, but had become so isolated from everyone in my life that the loneliness was crippling, and I came running back every time. Every time you said it would be better. It wasn't. Then you started hanging out with her. I could tell by the way you talked about her that you liked her. I told you your relationship made me uncomfortable and you told me I was crazy, but the day she broke up with her boyfriend was the day we broke up for the last time. The next day, you told me you were done with me. You told me you were worried that I was going to hurt myself, and I was too ashamed to admit that I already had. I wasn't okay for months after things finally ended. I had to rebuild my whole life, because without you, the structure had shattered. Some time has passed. I've been okay for a long time. I'm with someone who would never treat me the way you treated me. I'm with someone who is patient and loving and supportive and honest - all things you never were. But you're still with her, and though I hated her for such a long time, I've since made peace with the idea of her. All she did was love you, and I can't hate someone for a mistake that I also made. But when I heard that she was telling people that I lied about you cheating on me and mistreating me, that I was a crazy liar, I knew that you had her under the same spell you had me under when you convinced me that the girl before me was a crazy liar. And I hope to whatever higher power that exists that you're not hurting her the same way that you were hurting me. "

Neither of us had any idea where it would lead. We've followed coincidence like trail markers, reading each other's hearts like maps, with fate itself as a compass, and we've found ourselves in the middle of love. From the word go, you've had every ounce of my love that you'd allow me to pour into you. You woke it in me, so of course it belongs to you. This love has not come without its challenges... You and I both have walls and defenses at the ready to repel any and all comers... Mechanisms we rightfully erected at times in our lives when they were absolutely necessary. Pushing past that into true vulnerability has given us moments that I can say for me, have been transformative.. But 'pushing past it' is the understatement of the year. The way you shut me out over things is absolutely brutal. I've been nothing but consistent though, since day 1, expressing my love, giving you updates and reassurances, being specific about plans and intentions... Even when you leave me on read all day, or stonewall my affection in person... Even when you accused me if being a player, KNOWING how hard it was to give myself to you... Even when you lied to me and peaced out without telling me to abort the baby you almost didn't tell me about... Even when I began to cut off a dear friend in need to satisfy your insecurity. And she's absolutely getting the short end of all this. Whatever you believe about her, she has been generous to me and A---- and the house situation, she was there for ALL of us (you too) while we were figuring this out, she was honest about her feelings and intentions, and backed the fuck off when I asked her to... And I (we all) repaid her by ghosting her while her life falls apart around her. For all the good it's done me. You've spent the last 4 days acting some kind of way, while I pour my heart out to the void... because you'll take the word of known dopeheads over mine. So she loses her home and her circle of friends, and I still lose your trust... Can't help but feel like I'm doing it wrong. I have two kinds of relationships. 2 options. All. Or nothing. I've been working out if option 1 with you since the beginning, without fail. I've given myself to you mind body and soul for the better part of a year. I've changed my life for you, literally. Option one... is that I push for the deepest, most intense, uncomfortably vulnerable relationship either of us has ever had. Option 2.... I shut the fuck down. I've been fighting hard against going there. A time or three, you've gotten me close.. but I've managed to stay open to you, to this. I've now more or less committed my life to you, so I can't just fucking run away. But you've let me spend the last three nights staring at the fire, alone, chain-smoking the hours off my life, contemplating what it looks like without you....... You know I'll go back to the woods, right? Unwillingly, I felt myself switch gears today. Did you even notice? Do you feel anything at all right now? I've never shut you out.. not in the whole time you've known me... I'd continue to tear my chest open to let you see my heart, every. single. damn. time. But if you don't put it back together at some point, I'm gonna bleed out. I'm fucking tired... I can't hold us both up forever... "

Our cohorts also socially lubricated on the varieties of beer afforded by our venue, I turned my attention to you. My comfort in our friendship, conversely, yours with me, was showcased, but cleverly covert. To the perspective of those around us, they were watching, unsure of just how we both could be so utterly consumed; surely we had a serious matter to discuss, but, again, theres a connection we have that stops all who witness it. You lost sleep, you said, when I communicated that I was hurt. You also never reach out to me first, so, in kind, since you did check in, I avoided judgment in my response. You deserve the best of me, but I dont know why I remain so faithful to this ethos! Ive always nuked the sandbox, instead of just leaving. Perceptions of abandonment have always sent me reeling, furious and desperate to destroy the perp. You, however, you dont raise that ire in me. I quite literally cant ever see a time where Id go into familiar old patterns, to eradicate you from my life. Why is this, B? Why? You told me you lost sleep. You were so upset. Now, if you were lying, Id have punched you in the mouth. True story. You didnt lie. You also said you were a bit wrought over it all, knowing youd hurt me. I know you so well, and I also know you dont lose sleep over anyone. You cried? My heart broke for you, despite the heartbreak that I felt from being hurt by you. In sober reflection, this the response from a man who loves a woman. You love me, B, and I love you, too. We are not going to be platonic much longer. I see that now. Thankfully, our cohorts quickly whisked you and I to our own separate directions when headed home last night. And we texted at the same time, as you so sweetly pointed out, to follow with ...never again will I hurt you. You know how you feel, and its bubbling just barely beneath the surface. You also knew my feelings, by way of my language and communication. The devil inside was planning our escape, departure from the crowd, and the clumsy awkward first kiss that would have made me revert to an embarrassed teenager on a first date. Why the hell do you unleash the restraint in me? How do you? Our boundaries are nearing collapse, the distance between us is now just mere inches, and I see how you look at me. You were real and honest with me. You were vulnerable and playful. And we remained respectful. I bit my tongue. I had to. I love this game, I love you, too, and I dont want to give in just yet, to a hurried embrace, tangled limbs, tongues and other delightful sins.

I fought back my family and my friends, the distance and the stress, the heartbreak and the pain, the doubt and the disappointment. If I could just take everyones advice and move on and simply fall for just anyone in my life then everything I have fought for would be absolute garbage and I know that what we had is not garbage. Sure it sucks missing someone who probably isnt even capable of returning my feelings anymore but then again, it would have hurt me a thousand times more to look for you in everyone I know, every place I go, every song I listen to and every beautiful thing I have the privilege to see and fail miserably.

Lust can, obsession can and all those other things, but not love. Love doesnt wait to be admired, it sweeps two people away. Two people freely open up to each other. Theyve both been hurt before, they dont know what the outcome will be, they may be hurt again. It may be a disaster, the variables are too many. But when youre in love you embrace that vulnerability for for each other. Love is the hope that this time things will be different. Love isnt part of your plans. Love is the reward for the brave, for those that take a chance on someone; for those that do the maths and the numbers dont look great, but fuck it were in love. And if thats all were left with at the end of it all then thats enough. So if youre heartbroken too. What youre feeling isnt love. And dont let todays feelings make you miss out on that next chance to bet the farm on someone. Because if youre too scared to feel pain, youre too scared to be happy. "

I didnt tell them that I was moving out of my ex boyfriends home after being broken up for about two and a half months. I remember that summer my ex husband helping me pack my belongings and that of my out children. My ex husband said to me, and you thought I was an asshole. I remembered my ex boyfriend had locked himself in his room as one of my children banged on the door  hey were moving and we are going to me homeless dont you even want to say goodbye I assured her that we would be OK. I was in Vermont and Maine this past Labor Day Labor Day weekend. I went to see my ex in laws, imagine that, and spent some fine at a beach. I was with my boyfriend of 8 months. My ex mother in law had pulled me aside and said, I like him a lot more than the other guy. He doesnt hold back and is more interactive with the kids. I smiled because I knew this was true. For the longest time, you were the first person I couldnt wait to see, and now you are my greatest regret. I loved you, and so did my children. But now I see with eyes and a heart so clear, that I was in love with a myth. I wanted so badly for us to work but I was exhausted and everyone knew it. I was the last to know. I grew tired of walking in egg shells, the silence, the loneliness. I was afraid if you. You left me in another state because you said I ruined the weekend because I wanted to see where you stood in terms of marriage. We had been together for 2 years when that happened. I remember that the happiest moments, that I felt you loved me were when you were drunk. You had only had two serious relationships, never married, no children, nearly 20 years you older than me. I hated going over to your familys for dinner because I knew I made them uncomfortable. I didnt feel comfortable. Your friends were so much older and I felt so out of place as they spoke of hip replacements, retirement and golf. I was such a fool. Of course we werent meant to me. You know what? I dont even remember what it looks it is what you said that made me think that you were the one. I was a sex object, someone you didnt respect or take seriously. You would tell me that I would never find anyone like you, and I actually believed you were right. I was divorced with three children, still finishing my degree because I had taken breaks in my previous marriage to raise children. Who would want me? I had no respect or love for myself. I was meek, easily to take advantage of. I would ask you what it is that made you attracted to me and you would say  it was always easy with you. It was easy because I walked on eggshells. I believed you when you said that you saw my children as your own. Actions always speak louder than words. Later, you would say I dont want children. You had said later in the relationship, that my children were burdens and you didnt want to struggle. My children are not burdens. They are just too cool for you, including me. I dont miss you. I feel sorry for you. I were meant to be a lonely bitter old man. You blamed me for your aging, because you were unhappy with yourself. You lacked faith and vulnerability. I should have seen that. I thought I could. Hangs you. I thought that I could be the light in the dark. I wish I had saved all the hope I had for you on me. I wish that it was my current boyfriend that I had met almost 4 years ago and not you. I hate who I was when I was with you. I hate having my children believe that you were apart of our family. I regret waisting my time. You were such a narcissist and when you told me that you were an asshole, I should have believed you. "

659,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,5 Things Ive Learned From Having A Disability,2,9e3alb,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/9e3alb/5_things_ive_learned_from_having_a_disability/,2018-09-08 20:12:42," 1. Happiness is a choice. To be happy, one must look inside their soul. You have to want it. You have to realize that you are in control of your emotions and you are the ultimate creator of your own happiness. All the advice in the world cannot change the way you feel unless youre truly willing to make that change. Regardless of whether we want it or not, life is going to have obstacles, and its going to be messy at times. When happiness seems like a long shot, theres something you must always remember: you get to decide how you want to handle those hardships because you are the pilot on this journey. You can either feel sorry for yourself and all of your troubles, or you can learn to move on and lead a life of happiness. The choice is up to you, and only you. 2. Its okay to be weak sometimes. Being weak doesnt mean youre giving up, and it certainly doesnt mean youre a failure. Those feelings of vulnerability and helplessness are a part of life, and Im sure they happen to everyone. Between my long-term hospital stays and one-after-the-other medical problems, Ive had plenty of experiences in my life where Ive felt physically and mentally weak. Im actually okay with it, though, because I learned to take my moments of weakness and turn them into strengths. In other words, youll never fully understand how to be strong unless youve experienced what it means to be weak. Despite what many people think, being weak can teach us a valuable lesson. You just have to be willing to pay attention. 3. Different is the new normal Growing up with a disability, Ive always struggled with self-esteem. In middle school and high school, I didnt like the idea of sticking out from the crowd. I was smaller and skinnier, I felt as though my wheelchair took up half the hallway, and I couldnt seem to come to terms with the fact that I wasnt like everyone else. All I wanted was to look and be normal. Fast forward to my 20s now, and I realize I had it all wrong. Fitting in is entirely overrated. Im unique, and I like that Im my own individual. My uniqueness is in part of what defines my personality. Besides, theres some sort of mystery to being unique that people are drawn to. 4. Never take anything for granted. So often, we hear this saying whether it be from a family member, mentor, or friend. Yet, I firmly believe we never understand just how powerful its meaning is until we lose what we have. Having a degenerative muscle disease, Ive lost certain mobility like feeding myself and handwriting over the years. And truthfully, a part of me wishes I could go back in time to when I was able, just to savor that sweet taste of independence for one more second, but life doesnt exactly operate like that. So, wake up every morning and be grateful. Instead of focusing on what you dont have in life, focus on what you DO have. Live in the moment, and learn to appreciate every tiny detail of your life, even if it is just being able to hold a pen between two fingers. 5. Dont judge a book by its cover I understand that writing about clichs is somewhat frowned upon, but this one had to be mentioned because its completely and utterly true. A persons outer appearance should never define who they are as a human being. Being confined to a wheelchair my entire life, I cant even begin to describe the way many people treat me because of my disability. Their assumptions and misjudgments can sometimes be hurtful; so, Ive always felt the need to validate myself as an individual to everyone. I may be disabled, but that doesnt mean I dont have feelings. With that said, remember that, disability or not, everyone deserves a chance. Instead of jumping to conclusions, take a moment to really get to know a person. You just might be surprised."

I never gave up, I always kept my hopes, and I always loved with all my heart and soul. I grew up in a verbally abusive household, enduring years of sexual abuse.Yet I always had an awe and wonder about true love and the possibility of soulmates, I never gave up hope that this could possibly be in my life some day. As a little girl I always dreamt of that person that would walk into my life and just have me fall head over heels for them. That they would ride in on an elegant White horse and save me from my abusive, depressing life. That they would hold me in their arms and tell me everything will be fine, that we will leave together, ride off into the sunset and never look back. We would live a full, beautiful life with passion, two hearts becoming one, and never letting go of each other. Then reality happened, he came into my life. The prince charming I had been waiting for, the one I thought I knew from another life, the one who felt so familiar, the love of my life from past lives. I loved him so much, even when he didn't know it or see me for so long. I tried for so long to get his attention, to get him to see me and that maybe he would feel the same way about me one day. I blame myself for being a fool and believing that I would end up with him one day, that he was the love of my life. I blame myself for allowing myself to stoop so low as to do just about anything to make them see me, to hope and pray every day they will love me some way. After 19 years of praying for the love of a man that would never love me back that will never see how wonderful life could be with me. Yet I don't hate him, I don't blame him. I just continue to love him unconditionally despite his vices and addictions, despite never loving me by. He took advantage of me, if my vulnerability and of my heart. He left me out in the cold many times, to the point I no longer feel love. Yet I am thankful for the most painful experience and most beautiful thing that could have happened in my life. I grew up, I stopped dreaming that prince charming could be real, that dreams come true. I gave up on the idea that someone was going to ride up to my door with roses and take me away from all the pain and save me. I now believe that if you want true unconditional love, you must love yourself, that is where true love lies. Now I know if you want to be swept away, you must do it yourself. You are your own knight in shining armor. You want to be rescued, then pick yourself up and take care of it yourself. Don't expect someone else to do it, no one will come. Love yourself, put yourself first, make your own wishes come true, no one else will or should do it for you. Then maybe someone, that special one, will come in and not sweep you but come in to compliment your life. That's how you'll know they are meant to be the one, because they will be there to lift you and elevate you just as you will do the same for them. They will want you just as you are. They will wipe your tears when you are sad. They will hold your hand when you are diagnosed with a chronic disease. They will not give up on you when you have given up on yourself. They will change completely when they are going to lose you. They will say you are the most beautiful woman in the world when you have no makeup on, you are in your old torn pajamas, with a mud mask on. They will hold your hair when you throw up from surgery. They will make you laugh when all you want to do is cry from losing your baby. That's how you know they are meant for you. With that said, I wish I would never had lost that child like part of me that makes me want to love without holding back, that passion without fear without too much fear or thought. The ability to dream and wish on a star with the hope in my heart that dreams can come true. I wish I could get that part of me back. We should always keep some of those parts of childhood I'm our hearts, they keep is young and feeling like anything can happen, any dream can come true. "

Imagine that we have created a forum for people to write letters that will never be sent, with feelings intended for specific people that are mostly still out there and real, saying the most important things we could ever say to someone in life. And yet, what were saying by writing here is not sayin , just writin. Reading here is like staring into the trapped mind of a huge collective, the mirrors all pointed inward inside the jar, bouncing around on itself, thousands of streams of free-form thoughts pouring by and deflecting everywhere. Inciting false hope, inciting false disappointment, just inciting Look, Im not saying that real-life vulnerability is all that its cracked up to be, its mostly a losing proposition, and I have experienced that loss fully myself So Many Times (I am m4w). Hey, but at least you did it, at least you said it, at least you gave it. You tried to be clear, you tried to be understood. You left someone else a choice, when it came to you. It seems that one of the things we are least likely to ever say to someone, is the impact that another person had on us, how we really felt about them, what we wished we could have said to them but never did say, about why we handled a situation the way we did. In all that Not Saying, we leave our own trails of dark matter. That is why so many of the posts here have comments where someone is pleading for the other person to just communicate what they wrote to their intended person. Wouldnt it be so interesting to know what fraction of the time that EVER happens. I tend toward optimism, but wouldnt take an optimistic slant on that number. At any moment in life, in any situation, any of us can concoct more than enough excuses to justify whatever course of action we want, the behaviors we have chosen. We can convince ourselves of being right in our minds, pretty much All Of The Time (our political discourse will tell you the same). The easiest courses of action to justify, for most of us, well those turn out to be choosing to do nothing at all; to stall, to delay, to not rock the boat, to not take the risk, to just duck and disappear But maybe sometimes we assume the wrong thing of a person when a few simple sentences exchanged are all the distance the truth lies away. But that is a bridge too far, way too often, leaving all the dark matter rushing by down below as we stare off into the distance, and try to forget. We push ourselves to move on. But what we tend to find is the things that get stuck into our most sensitive spots, those splinters get embedded there for a reason, they embody unresolved and confusing feelings, and they Never leave us and they linger on-and-on throughout our entire lives, challenging, requesting an answer, demanding an answer in our weakest moments. And we are never in position to provide those answers on our own, because another person was involved and they are not there to testify, and the time that passes is Never enough, could never be enough, in and of itself, to heal us. With open wounds we trudge forward, hoping the sepsis doesnt take us down. It is often so needless. A little courage, sufficient interest, making the effort to correct mis-impressions could fix it all. If we could only be our best selves, when it comes to handling each other (not just ourselves). And the more someone came to care about you in life (you should feel you are lucky to find it, whether you choose it or not), it is fair to assume that the more impact you had on them, and the more of your attention they require to do the right thing by them, to help them get back to a good place when you can't be with them, when it for them it comes to you. But do we do? ??? Hey, at least all that dark matter we are creating is helping to hold our universe together! So we get some more time to figure all this stuff out. When I first watched The Matrix, I thought I had the angle I needed, but no, it turns out reality is a bit more complicated than that! Anyway, intending nothing but goodness with this letter, hope it does."

You tried to take from me and in my moment of weakness, you would have succeeded if they hadnt found me. You, out of all people, should know about my vulnerability, my weakness and the fragility that stems from that. We were friends once and it fucking kills me to know that my consent meant to little to you. I should have taken your inappropriate jokes seriously and the stories I hear even more. I blame myself everyday; for keeping quiet, for speaking up, for doing nothing, for doing everything. Youre proud of your court dates, parading them around like some sort of fucked up celebrity. I cherish the couple of days youre missing from school every month. I hope you know how deeply youve hurt me but I know you never will. Youre far too narcissistic to believe that anyone could ever actually not want to have sex with you. Id pray the same fate on you and your family but honestly, Im just tired. Youll never feel the sweat coating your palms as your boyfriend asks you how school camp was. Youll never spend an hour in the shower, scrubbing yourself raw anywhere he touched you. Youll never know what its like to see nothing but pity in peoples faces. But I do. I will be forever known as that chick that *almost* got raped. However, thats not enough for you is it? You walk around school, wearing my virtue like a medallion. How you can tell people that you succeed and that Im just one of many is beyond me. How people eat it up despite you spending a night in jail after running away from the youth protection group is beyond anyone. I hope that, even though Ill never see it, you think about me. Not as an object youve conquered and threw away but as a person. I dont give a fuck how much power you think you have over me, some part of you (no matter how small) knows what you did was wrong. You dont have to tell me what went on that night. I dont want to hear how me saying no could have easily been a yes. I dont want to listen to you rant about how easy girls come to you and how I should have been no different. I said no. Just like that drunk girl at that party did before you tried to lead her away from her friends. I know now that you lie. Not just to me, but to yourself. We were never friends, were we? I was nothing more than a warm body to you. Despite telling me that I was different, that we were good friends and that youll protect me from harm, to took that trust and broke it. When you locked the cabin door and turned off the lights, I should have known what was coming next. My first pleas to leave should have been enough. Instead, you told me to shut my mouth and open my legs. When I declined, you took it to yourself to pry my leggings off. You told me I was lucky that your phone died and that you couldnt take pictures. You valued yourself a photographer. An artist. Have fun making art in jail motherfucker. "
664,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,You've Lost That Loving Feeling - Allow Me to Give it Back!,4,90cr1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/90cr1p/youve_lost_that_loving_feeling_allow_me_to_give/,2018-07-20 14:02:08," I won't pretend to be a wise, all-knowing expert, but I've seen enough of life and loss to be irrefutably certain that hiding your heart is no way to live. It's just setting you up for loss. And as someone who cares deeply about you, I want so much more for you than that. You deserve to let yourself feel and care about someone who feels the same and appreciates your time and effort. If your avoiding opening up to that opportunity because it didn't pan out in the past, you're avoiding your future happiness. I just cannot sit idly by, not say a word because it's your life and your choice, when I'm concerned. I'm worried if you stay in this safe, detached bubble, you'll ultimately regret it down the line. You don't need someone to complete you. And I'm not corny enough to suggest I'm your ""soulmate,"" I just simply know you could have the career and adventure and everything you want AND enhance all of that by also inviting love into your heart. Love and a solid relationship shouldn't, and wouldn't take away from those goals of yours. If you let how poorly others treated you in the past scare you away from a great relationship in the present, you're holding yourself back from your future. You're ultimately just living in the past. I fully understand being jaded because you've burned before, and if the attraction and connection wasn't there, I wouldn't be so ademant. But I've seen little flashes where you let things happen naturally, then it's like you recognize what's happening and hit the breaks to keep it from progressing. It's as if you're overriding your natural, instinctual response in order to preserve your ""safe"" space. I want you to stop holding back. I know it's scary because then you're no longer in meticulous control, but if you're just holding back because of that fear, you should know I would never take advantage of that vulnerability. Because I know all too well justvhow much strength it takes to be vulnerable again after being broken. I want to push you and encourage you to grow and thrive, but I don't want to change you or make you be something you're not. My point isn't to advocate how amazing I'd treat you (you've already assured me you know that), I'm just trying to advocate taking a chance on the opportunity to let someone in. Someone who would never dream of holding you back, who just wants to ride with you and support you. Someone who understands why you're so guarded and knows you're worth taking a chance on nonetheless. You're playing this martyr game - not like you're sacrificing just so you can play the victim card - you're acting like you're sacrificing yourself so as not to hurt someone else. But here's the thing - all you're actually doing is hurting yourself. And that hurts my heart A because you are the most beautiful man I've ever met. I don't just mean aesthetically, I mean you have this beautiful, caring heart, and you owe it to yourself to open up that heart. To feel. I'm not trying to pretend I know how the future is going to pan out, nor am I trying to make some intense declaration of love. I just know it does not sit well with me to know you're hiding your heart away out of fear of being hurt - I know I owe it to you to at least try to breakthrough and show you how much better it is to open up and let someone in. And that's not even because I want to be with you - this isn't about what I want or what I deserve - YOU should want more because YOU fucking deserve it. I wouldn't be doing right by you, even just as a friend, if I didn't push you to grow and give yourself the opportunity to live your best life. To use your own words from when you always encourage me -shock the system! You've gotten comfortable being alone. Only it's not really comfortable, it's just a controlled environment. That's why you get so stressed about your dog. I know that frustration perplexes you, but it's solely due to your lack of control. That's the scary part about giving in. About letting go. You lose the control. The upper hand. You can't control how people treat you and that is terrifying. You can be the absolute best version of yourself - give absolutely everything to someone, and they can still not give a single fuck. They can still decide to leave. That is what's so scary about giving into the vuneralbilities of love. That's what hurts the most every time in the past when you give someone the chance to break you. But damnit, what if they decide to stick by you? What if I decide to stick by you? Do you have any idea how amazing that could be? I do. That alone tells me it's worth the fear. That alone tells me it's worth trying. If you don't think I'm worth taking a chance with, then I can't change your mind. I would give anything to be the one you choose to take that leap of faith with, but ultimately, I simply just want you to stop holding back and to let yourself really live. "

666,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Thanks for being the reason I don't kill myself,3,91n6ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/91n6ts/thanks_for_being_the_reason_i_dont_kill_myself/,2018-07-25 10:53:56,"I mean, this isn't some sort of cry for help or anything. I've been through the whole ""you're the reason I'm still alive"" thing before when I was a super-suicidal high schooler, and I lost all my friends because of that. Apparently most high schoolers aren't equipped to keep a suicidal friend alive. Learned that the hard way. No, the reason I say thank you for being the reason I don't kill myself is something less intense than that. You see, it's been a rough few weeks. Moving to a new place far away from family, friends, and my entire support network has been nothing less than incredibly difficult. That plus the stresses of my first real job out of college and sleep deprivation because of said job has done a number on my mental health, which was already pretty shaky to begin with after ten years of depression, mania, and anxiety. I can't say the suicidal thoughts haven't come back - they have, in droves. But I'm not taking them seriously. They just pass, like a kidney stone or a particularly noxious fart. Because I know that if I kill myself out here, that's another funeral you'd have to attend, further taking time away from you studying for that incredibly important career-defining exam you probably should get back to studying for. And after your grandfather passed a month ago, I can't in good conscience put you through another bout of grief, especially over something I can so easily control (it's surprisingly simple to not commit suicide - don't walk in traffic, don't own a gun, keep your head out of the oven, and put the knife back in the drawer instead of gazing longingly at it. You know - the obvious things that most normal people do on an everyday basis). The fact that I'm not at a point where I don't care who I hurt by killing myself gives me hope that soon this episode will pass, like they always do. Yeah, it sucks, and I'm not really looking forward to a lifetime of periodic episodes of really not wanting to be alive, but I'm going to keep going regardless. As you know, I'm a stubborn idiot that brute forces their way through everything, from uncooperative machines to difficult math problems to joint injuries. And I'll stubbornly fight my way through life, no matter how much I want to give up. After all the shit you put up with from me, the least I can do is make sure that you never have to wake up and find out that I'm gone, wondering if you didn't do enough the night before to prevent it from happening. And the fact that I still care about that gives me reason to get through another day. Thanks for being there. I hope you know that even though you can't fix me (I'm not even sure I can fix myself at this point), the existence of our friendship gives me strength to get through another day. Love your sad sack of a shit of a friend who uses anger and sarcasm to mask vulnerability, KeyMonitor"

Something was off last night and I cant put my finger on it. I felt blocked somehow, like a pen with no ink only scratching at the surface. Im a try-hard when it comes to you. In my attempt to move forward and ever closer to you, I trip over myself. Maybe its the self-doubt. Maybe its the impatience. Maybe its because Im hopelessly fractured and far too desperate to become whole again. Please know that these desperate attempts are all motivated by my longing for you. I tried to feed you my life in bite sized, easy-to-swallow pieces. But how can you condense abandonment and isolation into digestible projected images? You ask and I deliver. I am your humble servant. But dont ask for the pill and spit it out because its bitter. Do not mistake my vulnerability for weakness. Nor my honesty for lack of gratitude. Do not presume to be an anthropologist of my evolution when you only see the bone fragments of a much larger creature. Perhaps I disappointed you. Perhaps I am too human for you after all. The very possibility breaks my heart. Yes, of course- Ill admit it; I am tragically flawed. But Im also brave and determined. I will face all of the cobwebbed closets in my mind if it means just one precious moment with you. I need your guidance. I need your eye to see the truth that eludes me. Please feel me, teach me, and be my guide into the unknown future. But above all dont be a stranger. -XO- Forever Yours "

I will love you til the day I die. This I know in my heart to be true.... my person, a whole person once, until I broke you down. I pray, EVERY day, the best for you. In my ideal vision of the future, and we laugh about the past and share so many happy memories together.... until we get to this part, and here is where we shudder together, but we never forget. Not ever. In my ideal future I am as in love with you as I always believed myself to be in the past, but I will never again blindly trust the messages of my emotions... I will have all of the love, but will pass on the bliss, because it's true what they say, that ignorance is bliss... I take that a step further now. Im beginning to believe that bliss is ignorance, and after having learned this horrible lesson once, for us, ignorance is only gained by complacency. In my ideal future I am never again so complacent. I recognize your value and I treat you as such. And I recognize my own, and accept nothing less than respect, ever again. In my ideal future we are the biggest nerds!! We go to meetings together. We go to seminars together, we volunteer together, we travel together, we love together, we respect together.... we live separately. So that we can appreciate each other, the WHOLE other, together. Most importantly, we never hold back together, meaning that we cry together, we fight together, we get angry at each other together, we talk about (Gasp!!) feelings together, and we forgive one another together. I love you, with my whole heart, my whole person... my soul, my spirit. You are my family, you are the only person on this planet who has ever come close to rivaling the love I have for my own children. It is because you belong here. With me. And with them. In all of our hearts. You have played a part in shaping who we are. And we all miss you terribly. I hope you will come back one day. I see you climbing that steep path back to us. I see your hard work. I see what you are doing. I see the vulnerability you are allowing yourself to experience, despite the imense fear that you feel with it. I want to fall in love with you again. And I finally think I can. I had to make a choice. So I did. I made a decision!! It was so fucking hard. I didn't mean to love him, Ferd. I didn't ever think it possible. But I do and I probably always will. I know he has a place there in the living room of my spirit because he taught me something so very special. He taught me that there ARE people in this world willing to be vulnerable. Willing to take risk. Willing to look inside himself, and wonder, ""am I really the best I can be?"" Willing to listen without wildly setting off defense mechanisms. Willing to speak truths assertively, knowing that the impact of his words might have powerful effects. He was the representative of all that I never got from you. So my heart pulled a tricky on me.... and decided to love him instead. I wasn't lying to you Ferd, and I won't lie now either. I meant it when I said I'm all in. And for me being all in means trusting you to now do those things. To allow you the chance to do that, I can't have a safety net anymore. So I let him go. Because I'm all in. It hurts to not be near him. It hurts to not have him in my life. And it hurts most of all to know how much HE is hurting now too. I wish I could reach out to him, I do. Every day. But I can't help him. I'll only end up using him. And it breaks my heart. So I don't know what my real future will look like. Maybe you'll be in it. Maybe it will be ideal, even. Maybe one day I'll find out he is well, and in love, and happy. Or maybe I'll have none of this. But I know one thing. In my real future, I will have peace and solace in the fact that I acted on my very best morality. I made my decision with integrity and kindness, and love. -VB"

So Ill pretend youre on the recieving end of this note, and that youd even want to listen anyway. We havent talked in a while, wholly because of my own stupidity, but I still think about you. It ended because you wanted to be close but at that time I was too young. My emotional immaturity built obstacles between us, giant walls erected from my own insecurity in the spaces of my mind. Your own vulnerability scared me. You scared me. My mind was a dark place at that point. My thoughts were a twisted jungle of dark thorns piercing into my brain. You took it upon yourself to pick each thorn out personally, your words a carefully crafted set of tweezers gently plucking the darkness from where it used to stick. You didnt have to do that. But I am thankful. You never expected anything back. You had made it known you wanted us to go farther, be more then we were. But you never pushed. You just said what you needed to for your own apparent personal belief of total transparency and moved on. Even as I distanced myself you tried to breach the miles between us. You were always faster than I was so this chase had almost always ended in your victory. Until it didnt. My whole life Ive been running. But you can only run so far before you reach the end. And theres always an end, isnt there? Thats why, when I was leaning over the edge of my own mentally precarious precipace, I cut all ties. I wanted to jump and feel the fall. I couldnt do that if your life line was still wrapped around me. My only choice was to cut it at the source. So I did. After we were done, I finally felt my free fall. It was exhilarating at first, Im not going to lie to you. But the feeling of your heart in your throat is only exciting for so long before it feels like youre just choking. But I continued to fall, only now it wasnt to feel the adrenaline or the self-destruction causing it. Now I was falling because I had no choice. My tether was cut and the void of pitch black thorns was waiting below me. I had made my bed, and now I had to lie in it. I spent a long time in that dark recess of my internal jungle. Writhing in the pain, desperately hoping Id find some tweezers to remove the spikes from me. It took a little over a year until I finally found them. You had saved me before but it wasnt up to you now. It never was, but you did it anyway. Im incredibly thankful for that. As I laid, covered in darkness in that awful place, you became a beacon for me. An event in my life that illuminated the fact that some people were good. Some people cared because it was their inherent nature, not because they expected something in return. The way you cared about me back then inspired me to try to care about myself. To remove my own thorns because it was worth it. Because a one point, at one singular moment in time, I was worth it to someone. And that had to mean something. Someone as smart as you wouldnt just waste your time. So I crafted my own tweezers out of all the things Id learned and began to pick every last hurt from my body. It took awhile, another whole year if Im honest, but Ive almost finally done it. But there is still one thorn sticking out of my chest, directly over my heart. A name is carved into it, and it goes deeper than all of the other ones. Its your name grafted into the spike and youve made a permanent place in my heart. Youve shown me that I should care about myself. Ive got more to offer then it seems and even if I cant see my own worth, someone can. There is always someone who can rub the smudges away from my own dirtied glasses and see clearly. This letter isnt meant to make you come back. I dont really know what I want from this, actually. I guess this is meant to be closure for me more then anything. I needed to somehow put down into words how thankful I am even if the sounds of my gratitude will never reach your ears. This letter became another life line for me. A connection to you thrown down into my mental pit. Im using it to climb out, to finally come back to the top. And even though I know you wont actually be at the end of this rope waiting for me, Im okay. Because you reside in my heart as a spike directly through it. The pain reminds me Im alive, that Ive made mistakes but it was worth it. Through the pain Ive learned. Theres beauty in pain dear, and youre the most painful of it all. -h"

At first glance it appears so unbelievably sick and wrong, and I would say that it still is. But after coming to terms with my own background with these situations the whole process becomes illuminated in truth. So. It honestly makes me disgusted how attracted to you I was at first and even a week later as it came back. I was a sad, lonely girl.

Thats why it made the situation even that much worse. And we both know what exactly you took from me. Something I can never have back and give to someone else...

I hear empty words that you text to me, after spitting out lie after lie like a viper snaps its forked tongue. You claim vulnerability. Yet you claim vulnerability after a seemingly endless infinity of lies. It wasnt easy talking to me? This all just seems like some cruel and unusual joke I cant shake the feeling of it And the fact that you refuse to take responsibility for how you framed the situation is mind numbing. You placed the blame back to me somehow. And thus, I remain unsatisfied And justified Tell your mother Look her in the eyes and tell her exactly what you did....how aware you were. To your wife, to your daughter someday But I wont be there to see it As long as it occurs it would make my heart sing The most joyous freedom chant echoing off of every single star in the night sky.

You told me that all of the things I suspected about you were true and more. I can't say that I am surprised but holy fuck, you're more of a monster than I ever realized. But thanks for brining over that $180 bottle of wine, you dumb ass. Watching you navigate your break up and your narcissistic approach with the next poor girl (victim) showed me the extent and depth of your NPD. I sure hope she figures it out before you start being cruel to her little girl. Getting jealous of the attention her mother gives her and alienating the poor little girl. She's about the age my daughter was when I met you. God help her. Guess what? I've been recording your conversations with the kids and we live in a two party state so it's totally legal. I heard what you say to them. I heard you call our son those awful names and blame him for your breakup when you caused it with your abuse and cheating. I heard you attempt to gaslight him by trying to insist you didn't drag him down the stairs to meet the two drunk girls you brought home and slept with in your bed after you promised him they wouldn't stay. What about those shots of alcohol? I hope all of this was worth it. I hope you had your fun.

675,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,To the boy who taught me what real love is,1,952tka,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/952tka/to_the_boy_who_taught_me_what_real_love_is/,2018-08-07 02:36:05,"After 18 years, I pulled my very first all nighter last night thinking of what I wanted to say to you, and I do not regret it in the slightest. Last night, you opened yourself up to me in a way that I honestly didnt expect you to. Youd always been so closed off about your emotions before, so when you decided to come out to me, I felt incredibly honored and happy. Of course, there was a part of me that always knew, even if I didnt want to. For 3-4 years, you have been one of my closest and most treasured friends. It didnt take long before I developed a crush, and my feelings for you always made it so much harder for me to read you in an emotional sense. Whenever I would ask about anything before, you would lie or dodge the question, but yesterday night you gave me the gift of your trust. I knew it would happen at some point, and to be completely honest I thought it would be a lot more devastating for me than it actually was. As a straight girl, there is no hope for someone like me with you, the boy that I have completely and utterly fallen for. I was expecting heartbreak, but somehow I feel... complete. My feelings for you havent changed in the slightest, but its almost as if the romantic tint on (my view of) our relationship has been lifted. And now, I can sincerely say that I love you. Its funny. Ive been in a bunch of relationships and used those three words a lot of times about a lot of people, but not until now have I truly felt that I meant them. Of course, I always thought that I did, but this time I know. I love you. It was surprising for me to realize it, but I love you so fucking much that it doesnt even hurt me in the slightest that I cant have you for myself. If anything, I wish I were a homosexual male just so that I could give you the kind of love that you deserve because no man will ever be good enough in my eyes for my best friend. And even thought Im a skinny 55 girl with barely any muscle on my body you can bet your fine ass I will not hesitate to find and destroy any guy who dares to hurt you. Ever since you told me, its as if something just clicked. All of those things I didnt understand about you make sense, and the more I know about you the more I love you because youre sincerely my favorite person I have ever met. Youre absolutely gorgeous inside and out, even if youre a bit self conscious about your appearance. Dont worry, your secret is safe with me. I am so grateful to have you as my best friend, and I wish you the best of luck when you eventually decide to come out to your parents. I know you worry about getting rejected by them, but even if the worst should happen I want you to know that you arent alone. My love for you is unconditional, as are many of the other friendships you have build up over the years. As much as you try to pretend that you are emotionally desensitized, its okay for you to feel and to show some vulnerability sometimes when you need to. I probably didnt say everything I wanted to say because my memory is shit right now from lack of sleep, but I needed to write it all out even if I dont end up actually telling you all of this. Thank you for trusting in me my love, it means more to me than you will ever know. "
676,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,To Ashley R the girl that destroyed my soul,1,95be88,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/95be88/to_ashley_r_the_girl_that_destroyed_my_soul/,2018-08-07 22:57:55,"Dear Ashley R, You don't know me but I know you. I remember that night so clearly. My boyfriend and I had a huge fight, he left to go meet friends and cool off. Instead he met you and he went home with you that night. All the while he was texting me his girlfriend of 3 years. He came home the next morning and I knew he had been with someone else. It crushed my soul. I was devastated. Heartbroken. The feelings of self doubt, unworthiness and anger were washing over me like high tide crashing into the shore. He apologized, he said it was a drunken mistake, he promised to do everything to make things right. I didn't want to believe him and I didn't trust him. Why would I? He sent you a text telling you he had made his decision and it was to fix his relationship with me. The girl that stayed faithful by his side through the good, the bad and now at that moment even the most ugly. You apparently couldn't respect that decision. For weeks you kept trying, tempting him until he finally blocked you. He showed me everything you sent him. He kept nothing from me. He still keeps nothing from me. I have access to his phone, his email, his social media accounts, we are working with a therapist to rebuild the broken trust and growing stronger as a couple every day. I hate you Ashley R. I really do. You told him how you were just cheated on in your last relationship yet you encouraged my boyfriend to cheat on me even after he asked for you to respect our relationship and understand that in the heat of the moment in a bad argument he ended our relationship only to realize 9 hours later that it meant more to him than you ever would. To him (his words) you are a THOT (that hoe over there). You disrespected yourself, our relationship and you caused someone innocent to go through the most devastating pain she has ever went through. You saw his vulnerability that night and not even 2 hours after he walked out you were trying to get him into your bed. I'm not saying he's innocent in this. He's brave enough though to face my hurt, my anger, my contempt, my disappointment and resentment head on and doesn't make excuses for his behavior. He still apologizes for that night with you. And we are still together changed albeit but probably for the better. We don't have explosive arguments anymore, our sex life has improved, we tell each other how much we appreciate each other, we hold hands and kiss in the grocery store, we support each other in ways we didn't before. We have learned to become a team and work together to solve our problems. We talk more, we laugh more, we spend more time together and with family. We surround ourselves with positive things and positive people. I know this wasn't the outcome you wanted. I think you expected him to leave me for you but in his mind you were just an easy slut in a bar. You weren't the girl that his mother and grandmother adore, the one that works a 60 hour week but still keeps the house spotless and cooks him a gourmet meal every night from scratch, that does his laundry and most importantly the person that loves him unconditionally. You see in all of this I never stopped loving him. Yes my trust is fragile right now, yes I'm still hurt, yes I'm still angry but as time passes I get better. We agreed at first to take our relationship one day at a time. Slowly it moved up to one week at a time, then a month at a time and now I'm planning our next year's anniversary trip. So maybe instead of hating you I should thank you for the wake up call of how troubled our relationship was. Maybe with more time I will be able to do that. All in all I think holding onto this for months has made me dwell on my feelings towards you because I haven't ever told you how I felt. It's been a slow, festering, constant resentment and anger boiling over inside. It needed to come out. I needed you to know how I feel. That you played a part in how I feel. He takes his punishment like a man and deals with it daily. But you have been acting like a scared little girl that doesn't want to hear what your actions have done to someone else. I think you're despicable. I think you lack respect for yourself. I think you're the type that wants what you can't have. I also think you're a desperate, skanky slut that deserves everything I just said in this letter. Sincerely, The Girl Who's Soul You Crushed "

I am far from perfect. I forget things. I left the house, only to double back to pick up the bag I left behind. I feel so stupid. Is it just an indication of more to come? I feel like Im dancing with life, with two left feet, embarrassed as I dance this slow dance of unrequited love, all alone, wishing it was you I held tightly in my arms. Wishing you were here. I cut myself and I bled for you. You saw the blood and did nothing. You heard me wince in pain and did nothing. As my life force trickled in red crimson droplets showing my human vulnerability, you did nothing. No words to console me. No remorse. No empathy. Nothing. You left me hanging as I walked away to find a band-aid to stem the flow. You abandoned me in my time of need, yet I hold no grudges. Im not mad, Im just sad, feeling bad, like you must be feeling the piercing hurt from my senseless acts and selfish moves. Words strewn across the page at you, hoping to find a speck of concern. Crying out for your attention, like a teary-eyed babe growing hoarse crying for his mothers milk. Oh how I wish you would take me back into your arms and suckle me in your bosom. How could I be so stupid to do those things that hurt you so. I am guilty, guilty as accused. I am sorry, but it was such a long time ago. Years and years in the past. They say time heal all wounds. How much time will it take? How much time do you need? Tell me, so I can hold onto a glimmer of hope that soon will come a brighter day. Maybe I can hold out until then. I want to see you. I want to touch you. I want to kiss you. I want to fly high again on the cloud of happiness, well above these dark clouds of despair as I feel the pain of missing you. Reaching out as you move away, so far away, always missing you, never kissing you. Calling your name and never hearing back from you. Playing the fool for you. You leave me hanging. Do I deserve this? How long must I be punished for my sins? Let me assure you one last time that if you can feel the friendly laughter that fills the air, the joy of happiness devoid of despair, if you can feel my vibes and join me in this motion picture, I will be here to play your leading man. I want the part and I will diligently play the part as I stare deeply into your eyes whispering sweet nothings in your ear. Telling you about the pleasurable delights that await you on this very day, all you have to do is open your heart in that special way. Say yes, you want to see me. Say yes, you want to be my friend. I am here, not far away, listening and waiting for my cue to brighten your day. I am here. I can help you. I can feel you and console you, if only you will let me into your life. If only you could find it in your heart to give me a chance. A chance to show what I can do. A chance to show my love for you. Tell me what you want. Your wish is my command. I just want to please you. What is it I want most in life? To wait on you hand and foot. To serve you. To bring you joy and happiness. The joy I lost and hope to find. Kiss me. Hold me. Hug me like no other. Give me a chance to show you what I can do for you. Let me into your life and let me touch you deeply as you touched me so deeply with the words of encouragement spoken with sincerity from your soft succulent lips. I may dance awkwardly with two left feet but when I hold you in my arms, I feel whole again, filled with courage as you make me complete. Everybody sees us together. We make the perfect couple. Two lost souls finding true happiness in each others arms, dancing to a tune of lofty goodness in our hearts, filled to overflowing with bliss from a lovers kiss. All I need is your kiss and warm embrace to show me the way to a brighter day. "
678,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Sorry I just vanished,3,8rk3fb,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/8rk3fb/sorry_i_just_vanished/,2018-06-17 01:33:26,"Im not sure how this is going to come out, or what form its going to take. Like most of my writing, I have the vague notion of where I want to end up, and no idea how Im going to get there. So I just start writing and see where the words lead me. Ive considered the form, and obviously if youre reading this Ive decided on some variation of written form. Theres a lot to be said for that; you can more easily and carefully craft and refine your message. If something doesnt fit or comes out wrong, it can be deleted and no one would be the wiser. The downside of writing is it can seem impersonal, and it doesnt allow for questions that may come up along the way. Again, on the plus side  you have to hold your questions til the end. I want to be frank and totally honest. Maybe that would be easier If I didnt have to look at you at the same time. Maybe face-to-face Id be tempted to hedge my bets, gild the lily. Ive lived just 3 hours away for a bit over 7 years now, and I havent been to Your house yet. I dont call, I dont write, hell, Im hard ever even on Facebook to keep in touch. And Im deeply ashamed of that. I guess it would be understandable if you thought I didnt care, or that my new family had become a replacement for you, and I no longer had any need for you in my life. Nothing could be further from the truth. Absolutely nothing could be further from the truth. Maybe it would be easier, better, in some way if that was it, if it was that simple. Or if I could blame it on my current battle with depression, but I dont think I can. So I dont have an answer. No good reason, no poor excuse, nothing in between. Its, apparently, just me. I love you and your sister, more than you could imagine. Probably more than youd ever believe. Im in awe of the both of you  you turned out so smart, so capable, so beautiful. I suppose in many ways, probably like most dads, to an extent youll always a little three-foot tall elven princess in my mind. Ive always been introverted, and tended to be asocial. My tendency to isolate has only gotten more so as the years have passed. I stepped down as Scoutmaster the summer before I transferred to Moline, and that pretty much ended my social life. Moving up here pretty much terminated any friendships I might have had. I have no friends here in this area. And Im not particularly motivated to change that. Is that weird? Im considering see someone  psychologist, counselor, something. Ugh. Im vacillating on that  I talk myself in and out it pretty regularly. It was hard enough to talk to my doctor about depression  to admit to that weakness, that vulnerability. Actually, too, she was the one who noticed signs and brought it up  she was maybe a little too engaged. I suppose I mostly want to see someone to see if theres a name for me, for my asocial tendencies, my preference for solitude. Other than the damage it has caused our relationship, I dont necessarily see it as a bad thing, but is it normal? Ive always tended to be a loner. That sounds so flipping clich, doesnt it? When I was in grade school, we lived on a farm for a time. My favorite place was a bit of cut bank under a wild apple tree. The cut bank made a perfect back rest, and I would sit in that shady area with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and a stack of books. Hours of blissful solitude. In a lot of ways it only deepened during the years I spent alone in the Navy. Remember that trailer I lived in in Washington? I remember sitting in my recliner one night and looking at the door to see a silhouette walking towards my trailer. I recognized the silhouette as your cousin Amy. I loved that girl dearly  she was bright, self-assured, almost always up  she tended to brighten a room just with her confidence and sunny disposition. And my initial reaction to seeing my young niece approaching my front door was a flash of annoyance. I wasnt doing anything  wasnt even watching TV. It was simply the intrusion. At work Im off the floor (thankfully!) so I dont deal with the public much. An occasional phone call, maybe. Amongst the other officers and supervisors I have a reputation for being unapproachable, and while Im not hated, Im not real popular. And I like it that way. Some of my coworkers know some of my personal life, no one knows much. And I like it that way. When I travel on business, I tend to hibernate in my hotel room, by myself, reveling in the solitude. Sometimes Im loathe to even leave to get something to eat. Ive attended a few geocaching event caches. Since 2009, except for last year, weve attended a mega event; a geocaching event that attracts over 1,000 people. I dont mingle, other than geocachers I might bump into out caching, I dont interact with them. Im not unfriendly, just dont really initiate any social contact. Rather, I tend to avoid it if at all possible. Even with family gatherings, I tend to find myself overwhelmed and looking for the exit or at least a quiet corner. If its at my house I can (and will) hide in the kitchen fixing food or doing host things. So, Im not making excuses, Im not looking for sympathy or anything  just trying to explain myself. There is nothing about you I do not love - youre strong, successful, beautiful. I couldnt be prouder. I wish I was wired differently; I wish it hadnt taken so long to reach out to you. And I hope you can understand, at least a little. Most of all, I hope you can forgive me. "

I've missed you so much. Sometimes I feel maybe it'd be better if we never met, cause my heart is in so much pain everyday just thinking about you. We've only known each other for a week but I already know I won't find someone better than you. I didn't believe in love at first sight, but you made me a believer. There's no one nearly as compassionate, as empathetic or as smart as you. There's no one I'd be more comfortable revealing my vulnerability to. They say it was just a date, and maybe they're right. But to me it was more than just a date. Just talking to you made me feel all over the moon. You made me feel things I've never felt before. I know at that moment I could love you with all my heart and soul. I'd love every bit of you, all of your perfect imperfections. You're so magnifying, and I know no one could ever come close to replacing you. You'll be a good doctor, I know. Though you decided that we'd remain friends for the moment, my heart can't wait to come to you. I love you that much. I can't stop myself from thinking about you every moment. The moment you texted me back, my heart skipped a beat. I'm that in love with you. I want to, and will always be ready to love you with all my heart. I love you my doctor friend. "

Dear A. B., I found you on Facebook today. I finally got him to tell me the whole story last night. Not just that he cheated but with whom. His roommate's 21 year old younger sister (over a decade younger than him and I.) I spent a while looking at your pictures. You look so young and ignorant. Surprisingly, you actually look a lot like I did when I was your age. He and I had been together ten years. I supported him through the worst times, stayed by his side through medical school. You are too inexperienced, too immature to even understand a tiny bit of what you've just aided in destroying. I blame him completely, but you had a role. You approached him. You asked him to fly to Florida. You preyed on his vulnerability. You knew about our relationship, and probably got a thrill out of being the ""wanted"" one. Here's what you can't possibly know: he's a sad, messed up man. He's sick. He doesn't want you or even lust after you. You were an escape for him from his problems, an outlet for him to release his frustrations. You can't save him or change him (not that you want to, I wouldn't know either way) I know this because I have been his confidant for ten years. I know him more deeply than you ever will. Which makes it so unbearably ironic that I'm the one getting completely shit over in this situation. My life, my dreams, my plans, the person I thought was my loyal partner, all have been shattered before my eyes. He told me he'd been planning to propose. All this has happened for what? So that you could have a few nights of mediocre, fucked up s&amp;m role-play? My dear, you don't know what you're doing or what you're getting into. You don't know me, your conscience probably still feels pretty clean. But you will regret your involvement with him. You will regret the type of sex you've had with him (rape role play) When I googled your name, I found the obituary of your mother, died when you were probably just a little kid. Do you think your dead mother would be proud of you right now? I wanted to say all of this to you directly, but I realized I don't need to. You and him will continue down your pathetic, messed up paths. You don't need to hear from me- you will realize at some point how dirty, despicable, and ashamed you should feel. And I hope that feeling never leaves you."

It really makes it easier to let go, but instead.. It hurts and makes the spirit sore. I dont know what to do. You really remind me that there are beautiful things we are capable of feeling for someone and maybe some day be able to share it with them. With courage. How badly I want it to be with you... I know youre not perfect. Your friends arent either and neither is your kin. I want to embrace every imperfect part of you. Im sure as hell not perfect either. But who you are; in those eyes, through that seductive smile and hypnotizing voice rendering out a beautiful mind - I cant get enough of it. From your hands to your walk, to your butt and even the acne on your skin - Who you are because of the journey youve been through makes you so much more unique in my eyes. Not divine but perfect in your experience, in your developing philosophy. I see and am in love with your vulnerability and sensitivity. And I dont even know what youve been through. But i see what it is you do. It makes me miss and long for this curiosity more and makes it harder to let go of. The best part is that Ill never learn you entirely, no matter how close you let me in. Its a continuous journey of self discovery through the eyes of another. But I hope youre not a bioluminescent with a deceitful chomp. Cause I guess Im just another young nave impressionable guy wishing for something he cant have. Too afraid of appearances to dig into what you want that maybe you too are too afraid to share. Idk. But Im finding the strength to claim what I deserve. Are you what I deserve? Do you deserve me? Hmm.. Well thanks for making me feel alive. Im putting myself through so much so willingly... doubtful youll ever see it from this side. We die every day a little inside but i rebirth to life every morning I rise. With a little more strength, Im better equipped to give it to whom deserves it best - a love that brews from this pain in my chest. This is because I know how to love.. but Im working on better ways to communicate and express it. But maybe one day with you, or maybe never. Teach me your language. Ill learn it for you. Maybe youre just a schooling for coming days that will get better.. Im good either way. Still though, I might be living in hell, but just a kiss would seal a deal and show me a heaven that Id climb out out for, so a story I could some day tell - That Love is mysterious; not a force that takes over us but is all over and around us we choose to take by controlling what we choose to give what we wish to receive from the others underneath. Its not superficial. The world doesnt have to see - it cant be seen, but felt, knowing that what we have is real as long as we choose to believe thats the deal. Love isnt a language. Its a higher, intuitive communication most dont have the sensitivity to find within themselves. I know when its right. Doesnt mean others will see it as well inside. But youre not like all the others...And this feels right. Thats why I let go of it a little more every night."

You have so many scars. I know, you are depressed. You have tons of emotional limitations because of your history. But that doesn't make you a horrible person or someone unworthy of love. Yes, you have a hard time saying ""I love you"". It's hard for you to get attached. You are terrible giving advice. You're not romantic, at all. Bad at giving compliments too. Can never think of good gift ideas and doesn't know how to write a happy birthday message that's more than ""happy birthday"". You can never make a decision, and going out with you to eat drives me nuts. You change your opinion about things all the time. You're so pessimistic about things, even after all these years you can still impress me with your lack of faith in humanity or anything that can be good. Terrible communication skills - I mean yes, you never shut up about most things but when it comes to tell your feelings it's just... gosh, nope. Taking you to some place that you ARE going to enjoy is such a hard quests that sometimes I feel like I'm playing against some sort of Dark Souls boss. You keep trying to wear that mask of emotionless human being with 0 fucks given like some edgy teenager and sometimes that makes me feel quite tired. But you also have long, bony and gently hands. You know how to read my eyes. You TALK with those big eyes of yours. If you know that someone's sad, you try to distract them or cheer them up. I know, you don't say ""I'm sorry"" but you try to make up for your mistakes. You hold my hand when we sleep. You have a comforting voice. The fact that you exist is enough to make me feel safe. You care, even though you don't admit. You care about your family. You care about your grandpa even though he wasn't the best person in the world and isn't easy to deal with. You miss your cousins. You love being taken cared of. Every once in a while you drop off your mask and gosh, you are so beautiful. Even with all your faults and fears. I wish you could let me love you. Be part of your life. Drop all these barriers, tell me about your feelings. In the few times you did that you seemed so happy and relieved. If only you dropped that vision of yours that you're alone forever and should deal with all the things alone. If only you knew that vulnerability is not weakness. I can't and won't push you. I'm not saying that love would save you, no. Never. You can't save people, you're not a project and I shall always respect your space. But I can't help but wonder if there's anything I can do to make you open up more. I wish I could inspire you to be more gentle with yourself. Sometimes you listen to me and it's the best feeling, to know that you can trust in another human being. I just wish it was more often. But I don't know how. So I keep doing my thing, living my life, giving you support when you let me and leaving you alone when nothing nor anyone matters to you. Perhaps one day you will let me love you, or not me, but someone, anyone, because you deserve love even though you told me you don't. "

Actually, that may be unfair to shit itself. If youre unhappy in your life, in your marriage, or with your wife, thats your business. Dont interfere with someone elses relationship. I know that you had every intention to sleep with someone elses wife. I know that youve been infatuated since day 1 and have been just waiting to expose some vulnerability to make your move. Youre neither tactful nor clever enough to hide that from everyone. I know you tried so hard to just be a friend, but had every intention to exploit a person to have an affair with her. Its bad enough that youre married, but youre also an administrator where she works, and your daddy owns the company. You thought you could hide everything but mostly everyone at work knows. You too are so terrible at hiding things. Way to be so inconspicuous (In case you dont get it, that was sarcasm). I hope that in life you get whats coming to you. I hope that your wife finds out and just takes everything away from you. But most of all, I hope that your children find out what kind of shit you really are and want nothing to do with you. For the way you treat their mother and other, your children deserve better. I hope that your children are nothing like you, for their sake. They dont deserve to grow up to be lying, cheating, scum like their father. Im sure the state would like to know what kind of person is in charge of a treatment program and what really goes on in that building. Secrets always have a way of coming to light, and its only a matter of time before every one knows anything. One day your actions will bring on all the consequences that you deserve.

I could have punched you. You're gorgeous, yes men can be gorgeous. But you know what? It's not just your looks (even if the way you look at me with those blue eyes slay me) but what I saw in you today tempts me more than ever to put everything in the balance. Your vulnerability, your caringness, protectiveness, that you're just, hard working, strong as hell in many ways, incredibly intelligent, and most of all our conversation. You say things to me and really mean it, and for once I feel heard. I wish I could say more but you've got your own problems I really don't want you to even slightly worry about mine. However the times you do listen to stuff, you really absorb it. The only thing I'm left to wonder is your passion, I wish just once I could let my feelings overtake me and just find out. I know if I do I would get burned, but at least we would be electric and burn bright as hell. Just once. But that would mean burning you. If you by insane chance read this and can take the heat, Thursday afternoon is that BBQ and a rare chance of freedom I get being a mom and all. Maybe I can go for 2 hours and then after let's go to that Thai place you brought up when I was giving into you last time. One evening where we break every rule, can I be a rule breaker once in my life? Message me. I can never build up the courage ever to say it to your face. If you can't, know your value and whatever woman didnt/wouldn't want you is bat shit crazy and why you are still single baffles me. You're hot as hell and flaunt it while you got it. Please win the lotto and streak naked throwing money like you joked about. Haha anyways I'll still be just as excited being your friend because at the very least I want my mind to be open and see the world from where you stand. Thanks for visiting me today and talking to me, you caused me not to fall apart. That's friendship right there. PS: The red dress I wore today, I bought thinking of you. And I wore it because I knew today was going to be shit and I knew I had to go see you. It looked great with my strawberry blonde hair and made my legs look good . "

Heres fucking why: You tried to guilt me saying that our friendship should have more value than our sex. You stated in ominous terms that I couldnt draw the line you would, that me loving you was toxic for me, and suggested that denying me the physical intimacy that you would readily share with practical strangers would protect me. You wanted me to keep taking care of you, cooking for you, and being your therapist, teaching you how to set up a stream and whatever else, to even keep letting you sleep in my bed. Your pet name for me when we hung out nearly every day and night for the past month was husband for Christ sake! You wanted every moment of my time when it was convenient for you, when you werent hanging out or trying to bang other men who you would complain about nonstop when you would decide to take refuge in my company and my home. Worst yet, I fell for you. Thats right despite the fact that a month into dating you casually, that not wanting a label became I would like to try poly, I still loved you and all indications were that you loved me back. I never once tried to pressure you, or otherwise change your mind, I simply didnt want to discuss the relationships you pursued that took place outside of our own. I only once said that I would prefer with you in a monogamous relationship. Wed both experience jealousy because of our open arrangement, but for some reason you labeled my jealousy wrong even though I never used it against you in any way I merely told you how I was feeling. You said you no longer wanted to have sex with me just after we had sex. The reason, because I have feelings for you. Yet you complained about men who didnt see your value outside of being a sexual object, what the fuck?! You insulted my physical characteristics even though you constantly said I was sexy and desirable. You said that if I ever needed to institute no contact that you would respect it, you didnt, the first time you sent a fucking meme followed by the sentiment that I would be the only one who could appreciate it that you knew, and the second time was after I politely texted you for permission to return your property safely, you insulted me calling me mechanical and emotionless. This has hurt me to my core, you said throughout the time that we spent together that I was important and desirable. That perhaps youd give up on the poly thing after all and simply be with me. You have been an endless stream of false hope and insecurity. So thanks for clueing me in about the hotel orgy in September, that is totally the last thoughts I wanted to have about the woman I loved. You gas lit me constantly when I reminded you about those comments and confessions you made to me when you considered seeing me exclusively. You constantly hinted at wanting to marry me, and would later say that those sentiments should be ignored. You made a ham handed attempt at having me looking at rentals with you. You tried making long term plans for trips and vacations constantly that would never get brought up again after they were first mentioned. You wanted us to live together, and have separate fucking bedrooms. Worst yet we are both returning to the same school this fall and as it stands now I cant even look at you. I gave you consistency, love, vulnerability, nourishment, affection, honesty, and some of the best kinky sex you have had your adult life (appearently diminished by me loving you!). From what I hear you have either forgotten about me, or you have been playing the victim. I am still suffering, I have had to remove all the guns from my house today, because if I get worse I might have been in danger. And the bitch of it is I still have feelings for you, I wouldnt believe it myself if it werent for the fact that I cannot deny it. You painted yourself as guiltless and I am part of your wreckage. Youre sick and I hope no one else ever has to experience this because of you. "
688,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,You're right. I'm a boy.,2,8xex1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/8xex1b/youre_right_im_a_boy/,2018-07-10 05:02:27,"We started dating knowing it would hurt. You kept warning me about heartbreak because you had gone through it too many times before. Im sorry I was too naive to fully understand what you meant. The childlike giddiness of asking you out, kissing you, and holding you for the first time blindsided me. It was so nice to love in such a different way. We dated with big ambitions, each of us building upon each others strengths. You helped me emerge from my cocoon, teaching me everything you had learnt from your previous relationships. You had much more experience than I did and taught me as much as you could. I did my best to absorb it all and reciprocate your love the best I could. I climbed higher than ever but was unknowingly keeping you lower on the ground. Im sorry I did not fully comprehend how much more of a person I needed to be to love you. As we dated, I discovered more about your past of illness and emotional abuse. It troubled me and I did my damn best to be the bedrock you needed when things got harder. Im sorry I couldnt fully commit to you while your health got worse and I feared the worst. You were calm and collected while I was worried about the future. Im sorry I jumped ship when you need me the most. I said I need time to figure myself out. We agreed on a two-week break but I came running back after two days. I had cried so much and was left confused in a huge sea of emptiness. This was when things should have stopped and we would go our separate ways. I latched back onto you without thinking about the damage I had already done. I became one more person who could not be your calm in the storm. We tried our love again while your health declined. I did my best to be present with you, trying to ignore the uncertain future I feared the most. We created better memories together and shared more than ever. Your health started improving yet I felt parts of our relationship chipping away. You had already lowered your expectations and we had both begun setting up barriers. Tensions built up and one evening I could stand it no more. I goddamn worry about the future and your chronic illness. I worry about being a caretaker more than a lover. I worry about competing lifestyles. I worry about not finding myself before giving into you. I worry about the grass being greener elsewhere. I worry about a lot of things and I cant help myself. ***Youre a boy. Not a man,*** **you said. That hurt. It hurt because its true.** I guess its normal to wonder and worry when you have nothing else to compare. You were my first embrace, my first love, my first everything. I wish I could have been yours too. I wish I had had the balls to ask you out two years ago when I first met you. I wish I had taken the time to know you better and help you in your lowest moments last year. The highs are higher and the lows are lower when youre in a relationship. Im grateful for your patience and vulnerability with me. Thank you for showing me so much love. Its sad to think that I wont see you under the same light as a lover. I realize that we're not right for each other but I hope we can stay friends after some time. I respect you so much and hope you have fun living your best life. Be safe and climb higher than you ever have. - Your Zacoon. "

690,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,My Story (ps super long) I just need someone to listen atm...,6,8k3blz,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/8k3blz/my_story_ps_super_long_i_just_need_someone_to/,2018-05-17 20:51:52,"Hey, so Im not going to give anyone my name, but I really need to get a few things of my chest. Sometimes I think it would be easier to tell somebody I dont know, so they can support me without directly affecting or interrupting my daily routine etc. So here I am, I think I just need someone to listen Im 15 years old, my parents were drug addicts and I moved to live with my nan when I was 3. Although I was young I still remember quite a few horrible experiences from living with my parents, I attribute that to our brains tendency to more actively recall our more traumatic or happy experiences. While I was living with my parents I was subject to domestic violence, neglect, drug abuse etc. My mother had Bipolar Disorder and Battered Wife Syndrome, I dont know anything about my Father other than his name and I am incredibly grateful that Im no longer in that situation. My two brothers and I moved in with our nan, but things never were truly sunshine, and rainbows and they never will be. My older brother has extreme anxiety and when having an episode is extremely controlling, belittling and manipulative. My younger brother has ADHD and Bipolar Disorder, he requires constant attention and is very easy to set off. My Nan has her own set of issues, she never tells me much about them, but I know she has PTSD and she has several health problems including arthritis and high blood pressure. Ever since I was little I had my own set of health problems, I have Tachycardia, Asthma, Osgood Schlatters etc. Instead of believing I have these issues my entire life people have told me I have been faking passing out or faking pain. These issues continue to affect me but Im happy to say I havent passed out for about a year now. Up until I was about 5 years old I would cry myself to sleep every night, I was too young to understand why I wasnt allowed to see my parents. I still feel like a part of me is missing, I will never know what its like to come home to someone who would call me their own and would embrace me or care for me more than anyone else. When I was in pre\-school I moved around a lot. Initially I was living with my Grandfather as well as my Nan and brothers, but eventually he kicked us out. From there we were homeless, we found a shed and lived there for however long until my Grandfather finally let us come back. We stayed with him until we found a landlord willing to have a grandmother with three young children living in their home. We went through several horrible, rundown and disgusting houses until we could finally afford to live in a house of our own. By the time I was old enough for primary school we were living in one of our last rented homes and I would soon move into my first house. Primary school was not easy for me, I was bullied, and I only had two close friends. The worst part was I was bullied because I was the only kid without parents, I couldnt understand that either. Year Two came around and it was time for me to move to another primary school, my Nan was teaching there so it went a lot smoother for me. I wasnt the best kid admittedly, I was often put on detention, but I always tried my best academically. Im glad I did because in year 5 I was chosen to go onto a television quiz show to represent the school. Later, in year 6 I would be chosen to join a class with other academically gifted children. I never really fit in there, I was somewhat exiled because I joined the class a lot later than the rest of the kids. The teacher didnt like me either, she had me for many of the detentions I had received so I guess that makes sense. High school was and probably still is one of my hardest experiences \(I am still in high school\). I found adjusting to high school very difficult, my brother refused to help with my transition and I always have been socially inept. In year 7 I was having a difficult time and I didnt know how to deal with it, I was constantly overwhelmed, and I had no outlet for a complex and confusing tidal wave of emotions constantly crashing down upon me. I began to self\-harm and at the time it felt good. Year 8 was difficult. Despite having finally proven myself to be gifted enough to be in top classes I still felt inadequate and out of place. I began to plummet academically, and people began to become concerned with my behaviour. I had more than one friend see cuts on my arm and report me to my school year advisor. Somehow, I must have slipped through the cracks because no action was taken to confirm or deny these allegations and I was left feeling more helpless and uncared for than before. If the school didnt care than who would? Year nine came around and everything continued to decline; I was sexually abused, bullied and although I reported these things to the police they couldnt do anything as it was under the schools supervision that these things happened. I had to explain to my school principal what happened in detail and watch as nothing was done about it. I had to come to school on the bus the next day with the kids who had done unspeakable things to me. It was heartbreaking, and I was destroyed. By this point I had already attempted suicide before but I had hit a new level of determination to end my life. Nothing felt worthwhile, hell, I couldnt feel. I moved schools halfway through the year. It was one of the best things that has ever happened to me. At my new school I get along with all the kids \(most of the time\) and things were really looking up for me. Then, towards the end of they year my great grandmother passed away. I was very close with her and I miss her greatly. Im now in year 10 and things certainly could be a lot better. At the beginning of the year I reported a friend who was displaying worrying behaviour and I began to be tormented and abused by said friend. We patched things up and she has been doing a bit better recently. Hot weather came around and I refused to take off my jumper, teachers were becoming suspicious of me now. It wasnt until we went on a school excursion that I finally caved in and took off my jumper. I hadnt self\-harmed in a while and my scars were very faint, however they werent the problem. It wasnt until the next day that I realised what I had revealed. During class the high school supervisor pulled me aside and notified me that a teacher would like to speak with me. I didnt have any idea what it could be about, but I was tense, I knew I hadnt done anything wrong. I entered the office and the tension in the room reached a new level when I closed the door behind me. She told me that a teacher on the excursion had reported me to her because she saw bruises travelling up the back of my forearm when I had taken my jumper off. I was shocked. How could I have forgotten they were there? For the most part I was very good at hiding them. It was then, for the first time I had to explain to someone that things at home were horrible. As I was forced to describe how I got the bruises a single tear trailed down my cheek. I had never displayed any kind of vulnerability to anyone other than my own family before. It was a relief to get it off my chest, but I was scared to go home, they would be angry that I had to say what happened. When my younger brother has episodes, he has violent outbursts and becomes abusive out of nowhere for no reason. Sometimes I get beat up at home, he doesnt mean it. This kid has a heart of pure gold but when he doesnt take his medication on time he loses all control of himself. He is always sorry afterwards, he breaks down and doesnt understand why he loses control like that. I kept my head down after this secret was revealed to the school. It was very difficult considering the school is extremely small and I was already on the schools radar as I had bad grades. My school work and books constantly disappear, my homework is never done, my assignments are always handed in late, the school had a lot of questions for me. I refused to let up. Im ok, I left it at home, I should be able to get it done by tomorrow, Ive done most of it. The teacher that asked me about my situation at home would become my saving grace. She has honestly saved my life, she gave me hope and help when no\-one else could. I havent discussed many big issues with her, but she set up a safe place for me to talk about small things and has offered an incredible amount of support to the fullest she can. Another big drama erupted at school recently. Unfortunately, I am one of the only kids at my school who will take an active stand against things that arent right. I understand why some kids dont, nobody wants to feel attacked when they walk into school. It shook the school so deeply, within a week of school commencing, I had been the reason four students got suspended. Suspensions are rarely given out at my school, so this was a huge deal. I had to delete social media accounts as I was being attacked and I had to stay away from kids in my own class. The kids are back from their suspension now and if they are rude to anyone or do anything bad then Im pretty sure theyll get expelled \(which as far as Im aware has never happened at this school\). Im getting along with these people now and things are seeming to patch themselves back together. The teachers have realised \(through my brothers behaviour at school\) that things are tough at home and have began to try and be as lenient as possible with me and my school work. Im incredibly grateful for all this because things have been getting tougher at home and school is kind of a haven for me \(even though my grades suck\). At home I am constantly in trouble and am berated for things that I did not do and even for not doing things fast enough or not reading someones mind. Im probably in tears most nights but Im too proud to let any of it show, I go to my room and softly sob to myself. I do not see a psychologist or psychiatrist however, I have been diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder and Performance Anxiety. I dont have the confidence to talk to someone about these issues as I have grown up being chastised for discussing them. I also dont want to burden anyone with the incredible weight of all the things going on in my life. I would say that this brings whoever is reading this to speed with a few details in my life. These are only the things off the top of my head because I dont feel like having a panic attack right now Thank you for taking the time to read this if you did, Im sorry to anyone going through anything similar to this. You arent alone, please stay strong. Thank you."

As someone who doesn't connect with many, I was thrilled to have a friend I clicked with so effortlessly. We could talk about anything; we could say anything to each other. Never any awkward silences, no wondering if what's about to come out of my mouth is going to sound stupid. We had magnificent times together. I valued our friendship. I kept you close to me. For quite a while, I was so glad I found you. I learned you had some type of feelings for me. That didn't ruin anything, though. It wasn't your feelings. I know you think that was the reason everything went to shit. But that couldn't be further from the truth. It was all you. It is all your fault. You'll never understand how it feels to be put into the situation you put me through. You will never be able to comprehend the way one feels when the person they've always trusted without a single doubt degrades them. You'll never know how I felt that night and how I've kept that pain with me for nearly two years now. I was drunk. You took advantage of me. Then you humiliated me by telling a twisted narrative to all of our peers. And you never even batted an eye at any of it. Best friends, though, right? One is supposed to choose when they become vulnerable. We should be able to decide if we want our guards come down. I wish I was given that choice. Instead, you chose my vulnerability for me. Stripped entirely of my comfort, you changed not only me but also the capacity in which I can handle relationships with others. I can only get so comfortable with people. Then suddenly I'm afraid and its as if there's a glass wall separating me from them, preventing me from getting any closer. That way I won't be vulnerable again. That way I'm no longer susceptible. I learn how to effectively handle this hurt over time. I've learned how to deal with the pain, with the anger- I've learned to deal with this flow of negative feelings that come along with the memories that sometimes creep into my mind in the middle of the night and haunt me until I wake up the next morning. However, that doesn't mean I'm over it. Better? Yes. Completely passed it? No. You sneak up on me from time to time and I feel like its happening all over again. I get lost in my mind- I get stuck in those memories. You've taken part of me. For that I will never forgive you. I keep on waiting for karma to hit you but it hasn't. I don't want to lose faith that it will but it's hard knowing that you're so pleased with yourself. Although you will never understand what you put me through, I just hope one day you get what you deserve. From the bottom of my heart, fuck you."

All I really want to do is grab you and sob in your arms, and hear you tell me it's gonna be alright. But I know the patterns of an unhealthy relationship now; I went from occasionally wanting to be around you to needing you. I let my guard down when we transitioned to supposed ""friendship"" and I feel like I actually care about you more now. And the funny thing is because I care about you, I won't ever let you know about any of this, you deserve much better. I genuinely want to see you happy, and I feel like I'm going to be the snake that poisons your life. You deserve to be happy. I wish you had just faded after us meeting that sunday. I wish you had been as distant as you were before. I genuinely felt like that would be the last time we see each other and I was perfectly ok with it at the time. But then these past weeks, I knew shit was changing when every time I saw something awesome/cool/exciting, the first person I wanted to share with was you. I should've pulled back then, I should've texted you back hours later until you distanced yourself. Then Monday, the thought that you had a freakout and I wasn't able to help made me feel helpless. And the fact that you shared that with me meant the entire world to me, that you trusted me. More importantly, it made me realize just how much I've grown to care about you; just because you were hurting, I kind of felt bad too, and would've done anything to make you feel better. Lol.... I'm a fucking idiot. My amazing girl friends would murder me if they knew how much I'm pining for you like a complete moron. Yesterday... Fucking yesterday. That sheer childlike excitement and glint in your eyes yesterday I will probably replay for weeks to come in my mind. I could listen to your nerdy-ass talk all day that I don't understand half of, and just feel fucking ecstatic at the smile you couldn't wipe off your face, and keep asking you questions just to hear you talking. I am genuinely so happy for you. I've told you before you look cute when you smile, but now it's turned into: I would do anything to see you happy all the time. Despite all of this, I won't ever bring up the topic again. Keep things clean. Not ruin your life lol. How do I be a friend to you and keep pretending I don't want more? Lord knows, I guess I'll keep trying to be there for you, until I can't anymore. Maybe if I put this in writing and come back to read it every time I'm tempted to tell you how I really feel, this will be a good reminder of why I shouldn't , and had decided not to at this time. Fuck, I thought I'd done such a great job not getting attached to you and keeping distant, yet here we are. Fuck my life. I'm a dumbass, how did I let this happen AFTER you said you didn't know how you felt. I wasn't even entertaining the thought of you changing your mind - but then you had to go and open up to me . Great. ""Power of vulnerability"" my ass Bren Brown. Now I have to torture myself with the thought of your happy face and know I had nothing to do with it. Vulnerability comes with conditions, that if you don't feel suffering, you won't feel joy either. Just seems like it's only the suffering that's determined to show up to the party though. Wtf is up with that? Now I have to pretend like my shitty state of mind isn't because I just came to this realisation, but because of some other obscure reason. I think you know though. I think you see right through me now. "

Yes, that is vulnerability of being in love. No, those words do not heal your pain. BUT, if we strive for happiness with each passing day, repeating the words that were okay until we believe and before long, we no longer have to convince ourselves that we are in charge of writing our own story and patching the holes in our pierced hearts. We search the words of this sub hoping to find the musings of those we love, pretending that a strangers words belong to the holders of our hearts, only to be met with disappointment. Look around you and see that we are all here in this together and that most of us are riddled with our own special brand of heartache. I relate to so many of you. So many stories are similar to heartaches that Ive felt in the past. So many longing hearts writhing in misery to have the requited love that fills their dreams. I dont have the words to comfort your soul or to make it better. I just wanted to post this to remind you all that you are not alone. No matter where in this world that you are, you are many and you are strong. "

You know that Im an absolute cry baby. I cant help it. You always made fun of me for it. That was always you, kicking me when I was already down. When we first met, I thought you were the sweetest guy. Your vulnerability was so endearing. I believed that you would never hurt me. You played the part so well. It has taken me over 5 years to finally realize that it wasnt vulnerability that I saw in your eyes, it was greed. You never cared about me, you just wanted to possess me. I used to think that you were just so sensitive that you had to hide behind your mean disposition to protect your feelings, but now I dont believe you possess a single sensitive bone in your body. You are simply a mean, cruel, selfish person and I fucking hate your fucking guts. Im lying though. For some god awful reason I still love you and I still care about you and just want you to be safe, comfortable, and happy. Everybody asks me why. I dont fucking know. All I know is that you won the jackpot the day you met me, because Im the ONLY person in the world who could ever put up with your shit. Who else has been there for you like I have? Who else has had the patience to try and look past your harsh exterior to see your true heart? Who has dedicated more time, money, and energy into making sure you feel loved and cared for? Im the fucking best and you know it, youve said it yourself. So why couldnt you just act like you knew it? Why was it so hard for you to put in even the tiniest amount of effort? Lord knows I deserve it. But I cant even ask you these questions, because all Ill get in return is bullshit excuses. I already know the truth now anyways. The truth is that you didnt want ME to know it. You just wanted to keep me down. If I ever realized my own worth I might not need you anymore and leave you. The irony of it all is that you pushed me away in the end, when all you had to do was love me sincerely. And now that Im already gone, you want to talk. You want me to tell you everything Im feeling, but just the other day you didnt give a shit about my feelings. OK Cool was your response. Its like youve turned hurting me into an art. You know exactly what you are doing and youve always been the best at it. Well fuck you. You dont get the privilege to talk to me anymore. Youll never know my feelings because Ill never allow you near them again. Im lying though. My friends say that youll be begging for me back eventually, as always, and Im afraid that my weak will may betray me once again. I cant talk to you because I dont trust myself with you. There are a million things that I want to say to you, but there is simply no use. I cant keep putting myself through this emotional hell. Im done being your personal servant. Im done revolving my life around you. Im done sacrificing my own happiness for yours. Im done letting you constantly shit on me and belittle me and make me feel worthless. There is simply no possible excuse you could give me anymore. You had me in the palm of your hand all along, and you just watched me slip away. Its simply too late. The damage is done, Im already gone. "

Out loud, at least. I can write a letter, or one of those long texts where you have to tap it to see the whole thing. But Ive never been able to look someone I care about in the eye and share my feelings with them. Im afraid of vulnerability, and afraid of being laughed at. Im afraid of sounding ridiculous. Im afraid people just simply wont care. So sometimes, its easier just to shut up. Show how I feel through actions, and not say a word. But lately, my actions havent been good enough. Nobody said it, but I know it. Ive been depressed and when youre depressed you doubt everything and everyone around you. When youre depressed you think nobody loves you, and its easy to respond to that by retracting love in return. The only time I can ever be expressive about my feelings for you is when Im fucked up on something. The only time Ive ever been fully transparent with you is when Ive been high in some way. I poured my heart out to you last night while in this state. I watched you tear up. I watched your face very closely and to my complete surprise, you loved it. I realized that Id never been so raw with you before. My mouth was going a million miles a minute, I just could not shut up about how much I fucking love you. It was like in that moment, all our problems melted away. I didnt care about money, or things, or mental illness, or crap from the past. I cared about you, standing in front of me, in the middle of an art show, with some guy playing the sax a block away. You just looked so fucking beautiful and all I could think about was every single reason I fell in love with you and how incredibly strongly I still feel for you. It made me realize how dull Ive felt about my life in general. Ive been taking you for granted, and despite that, youve stood by me. Ive been sad and broken and hard to get along with because Im just so tired of the complications of daily life and all youve ever done is be there for me. How the fuck did I just let that go right over my head? Your patience is astounding and I never thank you for it. So, high as fuck in the middle of this art show, I told you everything I truly feel about you. Your loss for words and genuine surprise kind of broke my heart. Not because of anything you did wrong, but because I knew in that moment that I have not been treating you right. I dont tell you how much you mean to me. I dont soak in our time together like I should. I take it all for granted, and that ends today. Fuck my phone. Fuck the TV. Fuck staring at the ceiling, just feeling total emptiness. Fuck shutting you down when you try and be cute with me because Im not in the mood. Ive realized that if I were to die tomorrow, I would not be ok with the way Ive treated you. Next time, I will leave my phone at home. We will go somewhere fun, together. We will immerse ourselves in the moment, and I will tell you how much I love you. I will tell you that I cant imagine a future without you in it. I will tell you how waking up next to you gives me the motivation to begin my day, how coming home to you gives me motivation to excel at what I do, and how touching you calms me so much that I can sleep peacefully. I will tell you all the ways in which youve made me better. I will continue to do it, regularly, for as long as you will have me. And I will do it sober. I promise."

Thank you for your patience with me, your affection and attention that you've all given to me. Not to mention your time, efforts and food. I appreciate you so much. Sorry that it had to end this way. You deserve someone so much more than i can be. I'm sorry that I started this knowing that it would've ended, not matter how long or how short, i knew that we would not last. Hell, I wasn't expecting to be in a relationship in the first place with you! You jumped forward, gave it a leap, it surprised me and yet i jumped with you. I suppose we both took it half\-heartedly, but half\-seriously, because we did like each other and wanted more. You said you loved me, but i didn't say it back at the time. Thinking back, i did love you. But i couldn't say it, we were ending, and barely starting again. What were we doing!? Well. Now I realised that i did love you. But we had to stop. It wasn't healthy for the both of us, to be anything together. I'm sorry that I couldn't say it to you in real life, and only through text. I was scared. It was hard for me to express feelings, especially because of past trauma which made me suppress myself. I was terrified of being vulnerable. I'm sorry I couldn't accept you for you. There's no other way around it, we're two very different people, yet very similar at the same time. Our values, morals, goals and motivation for life are vastly different, yet our behaviours, thinking, humour, habits, are strangely similar. I felt comfortable around you. You were never judgemental like i was, never boastful, never dismissive. You were caring, considerate, and so loving and affectionate. You showed me so much love and blind affection, and it let me open up to you. If only we were in similar life positions, if only i wasn't given so many expectations, if only my life was different, and i could do whatever i wanted, I would've loved to be with you so much. I'm sorry for making you feel like you weren't good enough for me. I'm so fucking sad right now and I am so fucking sorry... You are fucking good enough and it's me who's not enough for you. You deserve someone who will love you for who you are and would not want to change you. Someone who inspires and motivates you, someone to make you want to live, someone to make you happy. You showed me kindness, generosity and most importantly; vulnerability. I appreciate you so much for that. I have learned so much from you. While we did have our differences, we did make it work for a few months. I tried too, i tried to please you, to spend time with you, to like you, and to love you, as you did with me. I hope your time with me brought you lessons and joys as it did with me. I do wish we had more time together, and enjoy each other for a bit more longer. When i'm with you, time stops and every moment is bliss. I thoroughly enjoyed every waking moment, even though i tried to make it seem like i didn't. You made me feel like i was wanted again, you showed me that i could be loved. You are so special to me. Time is precious and I'm glad that i have spent the time to get to know you and experience what you had. Thank you for being along my journey of life, and i will always look back to our chapter with love. I love you, from Leah. "

I learned things about you, not all of them good. In our fight, I was shell shocked by how mean you could be to me. I really never knew that was something you had in you. You really tried to hurt me! But then you stopped, and tried to end it. I wasnt ready to end that easily. You tried to give me the thing I do love, your vulnerability. I took it, but it wasnt enough. Things were bad and they got worse. You actually flipped me off and told me to shut up! But you said sorry... You tried to make me jealous by flirting with another woman when you knew I was mad at you. But you didnt make me jealous, you made me think you didnt care about me because I wouldnt have done that to you. I tried to end it. Like really and actually end it. Stop letting myself care about you. But you came back first. You didnt say sorry or tell me that you would change, you tried to pretend it didnt happen. But you kept coming back. Things are still different, Im honestly a little bit scared of that you now. But that little, odd, insignificant gift. Wow, I get it this time. I finally understand what youve been doing for me for years. You took that from me this year, we let each other go, but then we both came back. What you do to me...my best and worst mistake.

The man who seems to have my whole heart, has already been emotionally equipped to another female. The songs were so sweet, heartfelt, and endearing...it reminded me of the looks you used to give. Always knew that you had been the poetic type, and most men cannot seem to even grasp how beautiful that quality is. Your eyes used to capture mine, and all the while my heart would start pounding...and I start to pondering. Do you do the same, can you feel this intensity? It cannot be...those song's were written before I ever came close to contact. For I was a fool, how could someone from a loving family and be so thoughtful ever consider me? The endearing hazel eyes...they have me in a trance, all the while your salacious smirk appears and you start running your fingers through your hair, do you know? How you can just take my breath away? It's damaging and so enlightening...as someone so small all I ever wanted was a man who would be just as poetic and share vulnerability together, ""be vulnerable as flowers in hell,"" its just destiny for myself to move and go somewhere else. I'd love for you to show me...can you be there for me too? I would never let you go... Thank you for these feelings and emotions, wish you'd somehow know its me reaching for you..Mr.Prof.Nobody."

You actually told me the night we met in person that you preferred to ghost people. Something about hating confrontation. I thought I was different. I thought we had something real. I thought we had enough mutual respect to talk it out...at least enough for you tell me your feelings changed. You kept making plans with me then bailing or not following through for a solid two weeks. I called you out on it and then you just dissapeared. No one is that fucking busy dude. I really thought we connected. You even said that too. Multiple times those words left your mouth. All those late night conversations talking about our fears and deepest secrets seemed to mean something. Now, it all seems like you were just playing a game with me. I remember the last time I saw you. The way way you squeezed me when you held me. You told me you felt connected to me and we had something real you wanted to nurture. You told me not to worry about us. You promised you'd see me as much you could. I remember the time we did mushrooms and talked about our lives and us. All the questions about making a schedule to see each other and how often we should talk...getting our kids together, what a relationship with us should look like...I think if I agreed to be with you that night, we would have been. I told you I wanted you to eventually be my boyfriend, but I needed time. That wasnt true. I couldnt tell you what I wanted. I was too scared to give you the power to hurt me. I wanted you then and still do. I am a little worried about you to be honest. I think youre chasing something, C. I think your trying to feed a beast within yourself that will never be satisfied. I know because Ive tried to feed the same beast. The things you say sometimes, things you do, shit you post on social media just screams for attention. What youre looking for isnt something outside of yourself. I hope you figure it out before you push good people away, grow old and miss the things that matter. Im dissapointed I couldnt be that bad bitch by your side you talked about. I would have supported you 100%. I really hope you continue to be successful. I know you ghosted me, but Im sorry. I feel like its partially my fault. I think my lack of vulnerability pushed you away. I approached everything with you with a complete lack of confidence and total fear. Total trepidation. I never let my guard down fully with you. I couldnt even play my music around you or tell you what I watched on YouTube. Stupid things. I wanted to show you myself. I know I told you this, but I met you fresh off an abusive relationship. I was still so raw and emotionally barren I couldn't get close to you. My ex literally almost killed me. He beat me down emotionally and mentally to almost nothing. I was in the early stages of my recovery. I remember you were always one of my favorite connections. Always enjoyed our meme exchanges and goofy texts. Part of me knew youd mean something to me if we ever got to test it out. I wish I met you now when Im finally solid, balanced and healthy again. Not coming from a place of need. Even though you're kind of an asshole for ghosting me, Thank you. Thank you for helping me learn to love myself again. Thank you for being yourself and vulnerable with me. Thank you for making me laugh so hard so many times. I know one day it'll all make sense, but right now Im heart broken. Right now I jump at every phone call and text hoping its you. With every passing day, a little more hope dies inside that we'll talk again. I hope maybe one day we will. "

I can't really articulate it right now because I have so much emotion on my mind but the vulnerability is oddly attractive in a weird way? I love your smile, your quirkiness, your attitude about life, and the fact that you're one of the people with whom I can converse and learn a thing or two, and one of the few people I know with more random trivial knowledge than I have. Most of all, I love you and I love that you're always you.

705,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,An open apology to the guys I've broken up with,14,8deq7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/8deq7v/an_open_apology_to_the_guys_ive_broken_up_with/,2018-04-19 23:43:37,"So, it's taken me this long (over a decade) to understand why I broke up with you. And maybe you don't care anymore, because you've moved on. (In fact, I hope you've moved on) But in case you're curious, here it is: I was scared of your feelings. When I went on vacation with my parents and you missed me desperately, I got scared. At the time, I broke up with you in a heartbeat - over the phone nonetheless. I called you soft behind your back, and I was quick to find other love interests. Over the years, I watched you go through puberty, become athletic, become even more attractive. I always felt bad for the childlike way I treated you. And I surely didn't deserve your forgiveness when I apologized over 15 years later. So thank you. When you told me that you missed me for years and didn't think you could find anyone like me, I got scared. Your emotions were strong, and I found mine fading because of that. I saw myself in you, and that familiarity was frightening. I kissed other guys, wondering if you would find out about it, which you did, because I wanted to push you away. In a way I succeeded. But I still think about you, and I always hope that the mark I left on your heart has healed. When you cried in my arms after we had been together for only a week, I got scared. Who knows what you saw in me, but you called me every day, you planned elaborate dates with me, and you called me sweet names. But as the weeks went by, I found myself getting angry with you - angry at the affection, at the feelings, at the seeming disregard for my feelings. Your feelings sucked me in like a vacuum, and I wanted to escape. With each passing day, I liked you less and less, and you seemed to like me more and more. Now I recognize, there was some 'you-want-what-you-can't-have' at play for both of us. But instead of breaking up with you, I cheated on you. I found someone who had nearly no emotional expression, who I had been pining after for years, and slept with him. And you were devastated. But I was heartless, because in my mind we were already broken up. And I'm sorry. Perhaps I worry about you the most, because of how sensitive you were. I worry that I made you jaded, and that you lost your trust in women. So I want to say that it wasn't you - it was me. I should've been forthcoming and honest. I should've broken up with you sooner. I shouldn't have been so greedy. You deserve someone else, much different than me, and I hope you've found/find her. When you fell so deeply in love with me that you finally started to open up, I got scared. I had loved you too - for years at that - but now I realize I was drawn to you because you were cool, stoic, distant. We spent many years together in a friendship that blossomed into a relationship. I liked how comfortable I felt with you, and there was plenty of room for my emotions, once I was ready to share them. I felt close to you, closer than I've felt to anyone in the world (aside from my husband). We had ups and downs, fights and cuddles. You helped me to grow up, when I was most in need of someone to rely on. You helped me to understand myself. I would get angry, and you would break through my hard exterior, and make me cry. But it was a welcome cry. I always felt better afterwards, and I always felt like I could trust you with my feelings. That was until you started to have feelings too. You told me that you were lonely, that you were angry, that you wanted more from me than I was giving. And my first instinct was that I should just break up with you. At the time I reasoned we were fighting too much. But now I realize that the fights were okay, as long as you weren't vulnerable. Eventually, I broke up with you under many guises. It was our parents, our fighting, our compatibility. You must have asked me dozens of times after that ""why? no really, why???"" and I always gave you b.s. answer after b.s. answer. No, at the time I didn't think it was b.s. At the time, I thought I was being logical. But now I get it. Your emotions terrified me. I thought I was going to lose that precious space where I grew to be vulnerable and experience my own emotions. I was afraid that I was going to have to 'deal with' your feelings too, on top of my own feelings that I could barely control. I'm sorry it took me this long to figure it out. I hope that your current wife gives you that room for vulnerability that you need. It's what you deserve. I don't know if this part matters to you, maybe not. But if you've read this far then it doesn't hurt to share. My parents were emotionally repressed people. I never learned how to deal with my sadness, my anger, or my rage. They encouraged me to brush my feelings under the bed, and focus on other 'more important things'. In retrospect, it might've been okay if I wasn't such an emotional person. But I suffered from so much depression, mood-swings, self-harm, substance abuse because I didn't know how better to deal with my emotions. Maybe you didn't know any of this - I was very good at hiding it. I also found that being in a relationship helped me to balance my moods and hate myself less. I guess I was using you as a coping mechanism instead of loving you, like you deserved. I'm sorry. It's taken me years of therapy to finally learn how to cope with my feelings in a positive way. And in the journey I've also come to wonder why I'm attracted to men who are not emotionally expressive (such as my husband). My conclusion: I learned that feelings are not safe. And I also decided that in a relationship I needed room for my big feelings to surface, otherwise the relationship wouldn't progress. I was greedy, and I didn't think whether my partner needed their feelings to surface too. I suppose it wouldn't have matters if I did realize it - I was too scared to confront their feelings. I don't know if any of you will read this. I considered reaching out personally, but I don't think I'm ready. I hope that if you haven't understood already, one day you come to understand that ""it wasn't you, it was me"" and I did and still do care about you, even if it didn't seem like it at times. I'm sorry."

You went around ruining person after person. I Wonder what was the look on your face was when you found out. What did you feel? Anger, vulnerability, shame? I have to give her credit it was the only thing that could have been close to equivalent to what you put other people though. I wonder what it was like to tell the police and your parents that you had no idea were the pictures came from? You sent them to that many people.

I loved you but you were too unreliable to trust. You didn't deserve it. 4) I've never felt heartache before you. Its a unique mixture of never wanting to see a person again and missing someone so much it hurts. Ive been mourning our good memories. 5) Your temper .This rage inside you mixed with your insecurities will be the downfall of any future relationships. And the way it manifests into hypocrisy and rash decisions and hurtful comments. You act like a child with this deep rooted insecurity and fear of vulnerability. Crazy to think it's only been a day when it feels so final. Crazy to think that if our conversation just went a little differently we wouldn't be here. I could be telling you I loved you for the first time and you maybe would be telling me you loved me back. None of that matters now as you've revealed yourself to me and I just hope i'm strong enough and can let go of my forced attachment to you because i'm scared of the next stage in my life. My very first impression of you was that you were manipulative. If I learn anything from this I want to listen to my first impressions and save myself time and heartache. So I thank you for that I will grow from this experience. Me "

And yet, it still comes in waves. I dreamt of you last night. My dreams of you are so vivid. Your wife was in this one..... she typically is or plays some role. And now, here I am, struggling. Wishing you would talk to me, wishing things were different. The wave is here today and Im drowning, more and more as the day progresses. I cant tell a soul. My therapist has released me from her regular care, my friends think Im doing fine and I dont want to let them know otherwise and my husband, hes been hurt enough. It may have been three months to you, but to me, it was much more. It was a lifetime of pain and an openness of vulnerability. It was of following a path of pleasure that turned into destruction. It was an ending of the person Id always been to a person I am now learning. Im drowning tonight. Ive learned that you cannot save me, please release me."
710,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,J.,7,8fdxbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/8fdxbu/j/,2018-04-28 04:31:51,"When I met you I was finding myself. I was beginning to take chances, fight my extreme social anxiety, do things I swore I'd never do. I was coming out of a box I had placed myself in a long time ago and life felt terrible and wonderful all at once. And then I met you, and god what a whirlwind it was. We started talking a year ago this week, and I would meet you a month from then. You walked up to me with your goofy little grin and hugged me so tight. We were both sweaty and nervous. I loved you immediately. You grabbed my hand in the museum and I melted. Kissing you that night on a sidewalk in the capital was a moment I'll never forget. We were together from that moment on, at least in my eyes. But the anxiety from the idea of intimacy and vulnerability tore me apart. I know I struggled to communicate, but not for lack of desire. My brain just...wouldn't work. I couldn't articulate my pain, my insecurity, my fears. Your life was so different from mine, and we just smashed ourselves together and hoped it would work itself out, make sense for itself. You always told me I wasn't good at communicating--but it's become clear that you were just as bad at it. And to be fair, no one does communication perfectly well. But I sat in my therapist's office every week trying desperately to work through the obstacles in my brain, to combat my self-harming tendencies and inability to be completely vulnerable. I know a lot of the time you said we didn't face problems until things built up and exploded, and that's mostly true. But even if I didn't wait for things to build up, and I tried to voice my hurt, things tended to explode anyway. I'm willing to accept my faults over the past year. I don't stand up for myself or what I want. I set myself aside and make myself unhappy in order to do what I perceive will make others happy. I know you drank a lot, and instead of putting my foot down, I just drank more to make it bearable. I got used to saying ""I'm fine"" or ""It's nothing"" instead of saying ""I simply don't know how to articulate right now."" My insecurity and jealousy and baggage made me feel weird about your relationships with other women--and some of that was valid. I never felt like I was enough, and I was always afraid of being too much. My depression and inability to think long-term made it difficult for me to see the issues we should have addressed immediately. I was always afraid to bring up the problems I should have talked to you about. My sensitivity to conflict made fighting with you an overly painful experience. And I know my self-harm was just as hurtful to you as it was to me. But I was working so hard. I wanted to be there for you through every health issue and family problem. I wanted to build you up when you were discouraged and calm your anxiety. I wanted to hold you and give you the attention and reassurance you needed. I loved cooking with and for you and being a partner in your life and your goals. There was never a moment I didn't want to give you my best, even if I was incapable. And then there's you. Your laughter and passion about hardcore and theories about the universe. Your ability to spin and tell elaborate, entertaining stories. The way you captured me with your rough-around-the-edges sweetness. The way you cooked with and for me. Your over-readiness for any disaster. The games we played together. You made me laugh. You made me love you. But you and I both know there's a darkness in you that's yet to be fully addressed. There's deep-seated anger and bitterness and sadness that comes out at inappropriate times in inappropriate and deeply harmful ways. Your trauma eats away at you and encompasses your mind. You've felt so deeply hurt and all I've seen you manage to do is lick your wounds and then hope they'll just...go away. And if we're both being honest, honesty was never your strongest characteristic. You've gotten so used to hiding and covering truth and building a false reality to make everything easier. Nothing was easier. I know you want to start over. I know you want to try again. And a part of me does too. I loved you deeply and truly. You were my first great love and lover and that will always grip at my heart so tenderly. But I'm scared. I'm terrified. You know I don't trust you. I know you keep asking me to try, but I need you to help me--I've told you as much. We have to learn to be patient when we broke each other's trust. The rebuilding process is far more elaborate and painstaking than we allowed time for. I find myself questioning everything you've said even up to this day. I asked you to go to therapy with me and you pushed back and didn't tell me the real reasons why until it was too late. All I want from you is pure honesty, even if it hurts me, and I don't know if I can get that from you. We both have a lot of problems. Mental illness wracks us both and caused our relationship to suffer and buckle under the weight. I'm seeking a lot of help for mine. I'm hoping you will really do the same, as you promised--and not for me. Don't do it for me. Do it for yourself. You. Are. Worth it. Near the end of our relationship my anxiety reached a point where I was blacking out doing every day things. I know you experienced that with me and my distress over it--not being able to remember why my socks ended back up in my bag or taking off your IcyHot patch. I felt the weight of the unhealthiness between us. And you continued to hide your interactions with people you thought might bother me instead of approaching me with them and assuring me of the innocence. You've always needed and asked for a lot of assurance from me. I needed it too. I've started meditating to help with my anxiety and confusion. I've started chasing after my own goals and living my own life--something I found difficult to do while pouring all my energy into you. I'm working hard to get the help and support I need, so that if we ever do come back together, if our worlds ever can collide again and we can find our love again, I will be healthier and ready. I need you to start being honest with yourself and others in a way you never have. I need you to dig deep into your shame and guilt and dredge it all out into the open. I know it's so painful, so, so hard, but your health depends on it. And if I'm really the one you want to be with, the one you want to love for the rest of your life, then our relationship depends on it. I love you. I miss you. I know I won't always respond right now when you send me those sentiments, but it's not because I don't feel them. It's because I can't keep dragging out my affection not knowing if it's ever going to land in a healthy place. Spending the day with you yesterday, being held in your sweet, loving arms was euphoric and terrifying for me and may have been a terrible decision--but if that was the last time I got to experience it, I wouldn't trade it for anything. You tell me I'm your world, your soulmate, your everything. So do what you need to do for yourself so I can step into those roles and be happy and healthy with you. I want to dance with you again, cook with you again, play nerdy games with you again, lay in our warm bed again and wear earplugs while you snore. I love you J. I hope I'll always be your Little One.

Is it really so easy for you to pretend like the conversations we've had never happened? All I wanted was to be your best friend; but I turned into your Mom, your therapist. I became a doormat, the filter for all of your shortcomings, conversations, messages, even your thoughts. I never wanted that, and you knew it. I leaned on you in times of strife and vulnerability; you used to remind me to shower and clean something, because you knew I struggled with depression and motivation to take care of myself. You used to make sure I didn't forget about me. But you took advantage of it. Giving me unsolicited advice, when I told you I just wanted to vent. I set boundaries, and it seemed like you understood and respected that. But I guess I was wrong? Then you made me the mediator for all of your Tinder escapades. I get it, you are socially awkward and never been kissed; it was endearing at first, but after the 15th screenshot and ""what do I say?"" it started to wear on me. I could not condone the types of women you were matched with, and I said as such. Your fragile ego and emotional stability could not handle the types of unstable and manipulative women you were matching with. I said as much, and you stopped coming to me. Then, everything turned into an argument. It felt like spending time with you was a chore; I had to defend myself at every turn, no matter the subject. You would attempt to belittle me and poke holes in all of my opinions, and would imply I was ""less than"" intelligent for not acknowledging and immediately adopting your opinion. It was the straw that broke the camels back; I told you to leave me alone. You tried to rugsweep. You, of all people, know that that shit doesn't fly with me. You can't just act like nothing happened and nothing is wrong after all the aforementioned issues I was having. I wasn't ready to talk about it; and you weren't ready to see the truth. I was rude, and I told you off. I sent you a really long message, setting my boundaries, explaining my feelings; I did not owe you that at all. But, I know you, and I know that you would sit there and continue to wonder what you had done wrong. Or, I thought I did. You read the message 4 days ago and never responded. I thought maybe you didn't know what words to say, or how to reconcile with me. But no, you decide to project, and be passive aggressive through your Facebook posts, pointing the finger directly at me. You took no responsibility for your actions, offered no remorse for the affect your behavior had on me. It fucking hurt, dude. It still hurts. I needed you today. I went to my new doctor, she listened to everything I had to say, and offered solutions to all of my health issues. She prescribed me meds to help with my insomnia and depression. She put me in touch with a doctor that specializes in chronic pain management for my shoulder. Remember how I told you I was scared that this insurance would be better than my last and I wouldn't be able to afford it? It's all free, just a small copay for my prescriptions. The first thing I wanted to do was message you and tell you. But I couldn't; I established a boundary and went no contact because your behavior towards me was toxic and unhealthy. I couldn't break that, because it would teach you that you could continue to treat me that way and I'd end up forgiving you anyway, without any real work on your part. I'm bad at setting boundaries; you KNOW this. I'm bad at enforcing boundaries, and I let people walk all over me. YOU KNEW THIS, and vowed to me that you would never do that; you loved me, and valued me too much to ever do that to me. You said those things. Did you lie? I'm grieving for the loss of my best friend; something I haven't had since I was 10 years old. My heart is broken, and I blame myself. This is why I don't trust people; this is why none of my friends *really* know me. It hurts too much to feel like a piece of myself has been taken and stomped on repeatedly out of sheer malice, right in front of my face. I would say I hope you realize one day just how much damage you've done, but in reality I just hope you learn your lesson and keep doing better for yourself. Keep making progress in your life, and file this away as a lesson you had to learn the hard way about how you treat people. Maybe one day we can be friends again; but it will never be the same. And it hurts."

You can hate me, and I hope you do. It's truly unlike me to be filled with such bitterness for someone, but I guess with the way you pushed and shoved me emotionally it became the natural response for two people not meant to be in a situation that \(I felt\) you were trying to force us in. When you first told me those three words, I didn't know what to do. I tried my hardest to go along with it. I was agoraphobic in every sense of the word and this was my first time out in the world, being vulnerable with someone. I wish you hadn't. I'm sorry I kissed you first. Touched you first. I'm sorry I told you I loved you back. Keeping up with the charade that I didn't quite fathom or grasp yet became difficult, it turned me into someone awful and full of anger. Vulnerability with someone in the real realm was something completely beyond me. To protect myself, I started hating you. And even worse, I displayed it. Being afraid turns people into someone else. I wish I could've been brave enough to truly give it all back to you. Despite my ever growing anger and resistance towards our relationship, I tried to take my time to cool off. Send you little gifts to lighten up your day. Spend some time with you when you were free, just to make sure you were ok. Check up on you after one of our fights because I knew that even though I had my reasons to be angry, you're still a wonderful guy and I wanted to apologize for being a defensive ass. I'll miss you. I'll always care about you, but being in a relationship with you just made me feel like a phony. We haven't really talked in the past 3 days and I've been a bit busy trying to put my new plan and carefully curated lifestyle together, but every once in awhile I get those few minutes where an activity I did with you feels empty without you. You were my only friend, and trying to make you my lover destroyed that. 8 years of friendship gone because of it. Take care. "

but i never just viewed you as someone i have romantic/sexual interest in. as i'd explain it to anybody else, i love you as my friend, but if you and i were at the right time in our lives to be together, i wouldn't say no. i've told you as much. these past 5 years have told me as much. you are incredibly important to me. remember when we first became friends and you actually asked me upfront instead of gradually getting closer? or remember when you first liked that guy who turned out to be a creep? remember when i first kissed you and another girl, then when i first kissed a guy and pondered for some time if i might be a lesbian? remember when you comforted me as i cried about the first person to leave me, instead of me leaving? i've seen you grow from somebody so awkward and cringey (i was the same, but instead of awkward, maybe over-confident? haha) to somebody who is full of kindness and compassion and beauty and wisdom. but it's happened again - somebody i love leaving me instead of me leaving. truth be told, you already left a long time ago. we both just chose (maybe subconsciously) to ignore it. back in december, this february, and for sure, this april. and now that i've waited this long, i think i'm ready to leave too. when i told you i was, your boyfriend told me you were hurting and it was my fault, along with other people. but you told me you couldn't blame me, that i had the right to feel what i feel. yet somehow, as pathetic as it may seem, i expected you to fight a little harder for our friendship. you said you thought we were different, right? that i wouldn't leave like the others did. but i think you've always given me too much credit. because while i love you and my loyalty hardly wavers, the thing is, i have always loved myself more. i feel stupid waiting for you to come around, after i've watched you pick someone else over all your friends who have been here longer and through more than him. i feel stupid loving somebody who claims to love me and yet can't return my texts for days on end, can't talk to me until 2 weeks are past, can't even go to my birthday. i would've understood, you know, if i was the only one with these hurt feelings. but your ex boyfriend hurt your other friends, and has hurt you continuously, and it took THIS LONG for you to break up with him. after everything's been done, been said, and it's too late for me to say i'm over my sadness and disappointment with the choices you've made. seriously. i would've understood you taking him back if you and him were the only ones involved in this story, but it isn't. there were so many more people. you often tell these people it's not their business, but he involved them, so. they have every right to speak, honestly. i guess my words on the relationship has no value anymore, after all, you're broken up. but i can't look past the decisions you've both made while you were in it, effectively losing so many of us along the way. please just know that i love you and i will keep loving you until i run out of it. and if i still love you when i get over all my feelings of being betrayed, and if you also still love me by then, then maybe we can be friends again. but no dead flower can grow back again the same way it did before. and PS, i know you know my reddit account. so if you've come across this and you wanna talk, it's okay. please talk to your mom and your sister a lot, they love and care for you unconditionally. i know it's been hard believing that lately, but i've known them for as long as ive known you, and from what ive seen they mean the best for you. you've got a wonderful family, and you've got a wholesome heart. and i'm sorry."

You've altered my families history forever. You made my #1 nightmare a reality. &amp;nbsp; You are one of the biggest factors as to why I have so many issues as I do now. My PSTD, my anxiety, my paranoia, depression, all of that shit is majorly caused by you and what you did because you were fucking selfish. I have aspirations, but I'm so fucking scared to do anything now in fear of what of what might happen. How the world is today surely doesn't make this any easier on myself. I'm taking medications now and even now, I'm still trying to figure out the right mix of medications. I'll need a therapist for sure, but, you know, everything these days is expensive as Hell. &amp;nbsp; They didn't deserve that at all. They were innocent, they were caring, they did so much and you just had to fuck everything up. I have no faith in anything now. It's hard for me to open up to anyone, especially to those I've known for even a decade. I can't trust anyone. Everything is suspicious to me. No matter how genuine someone may seem, I will always have the paranoia screaming at me in my mind. The thought of opening up to people makes me want to vomit, that's how hard it is for me. When I do open up, I regret it, the paranoia rushes in and I hate it. I no longer believe in a God, but if there is one, then they're shitty as Hell. Speaking of Hell, when I end up there, I sure hope I don't see you there because I will torture you. I will do everything imaginable. &amp;nbsp; Life is brutally unpredictable and I hate it. I hate uncertainty. I hate when something isn't black and white. I hate can't control something for the better. I hate when I can't help someone. I can't stand the feeling of being useless. I want to make a positive impact, something that you failed at. &amp;nbsp; It has been 3 years since you decided to take the role of God and deem that you have the right to rip life away at your disposal. I have so many walls that you have no clue. I can't care for so many things. I go through periods of completely not giving a fuck about anything and going at people's throats because I refuse to be weak. I refuse to take any shit. I refuse to feel the feeling of excruciating vulnerability. I refuse to let people feel the pain I've felt. That's why I help people so much, especially at times when they don't deserve it. I can be your best friend or your worst enemy. I can switch on you in an instance. Do not take any aspect about me for granted. &amp;nbsp; Nothing feels that real anymore in all honesty. Almost like derealization, though, I'm not sure if that's what it is. It's only when something is ripped from my control and I'm blindsided by unpredictable events that throw me. I'm unable to get attached to people because I feel like there's no point. People come and people go. It's life, it's loss and there's no point on me to dwell on it. Life doesn't just stop, it continues and you have to deal with it. &amp;nbsp; What you did put things into perspective for me, though. I'm a cold individual, almost callous. There are way bigger things to get upset over in life than something stupid and minute, first world problems. Something I view excruciatingly realistic can come off as being a bitch or insensitive. I'm brutally honest and shove it down people's throats. I have nothing to lose. I'd rather be hated for what I am than loved for what I'm not. I have so much anger pent up. My nightmares occur so often that I can't even label them as nightmares anymore. They're just dreams. &amp;nbsp; My best friend and family are my biggest priorities. Don't fuck with them. I protect what deserves to be protected. I don't care how long I've known you or your relation to me, family, friend, whatever, I have no problem disowning you if necessary. &amp;nbsp; I'm going to push through all of this shit, just fucking watch me. I'm not a fucking pussy, anyone who has met me knows I'm capable of doing many things. I'm capable of doing things that I wasn't before, both positive and negative. I will use these things to my extent and achieve what I want to achieve. You will not completely alter my life. I will go after my dreams. It's all about adapting. I will achieve these dreams and I will make a difference. I always have a plan. I almost always know what to do, just watch me. I'm not a stupid individual. My mindset almost comes off as bipolar, doesn't it? My whole mind is a double-edged sword and I will use it to my absolute advantage. I will prove the side that doubts myself wrong, I will prove to myself that I'm capable of doing what I want to do. It's a psychological fight inside my head. One part terrified of life, but the other part not giving a fuck because I don't come from a line of people that are weak. I refuse to be a disappointment. I refuse to let this define me. I refuse to let you fuck up my whole life. I refuse to let fear engulf me. It's not my fault. It wasn't their fault. I hope you experience unimaginable things. I hope you are ripped to shreds. I hope every repulsive thing happens to you. I will prove to everyone around me that my family nor I are to be fucked with. We're strong people. I will be okay as long as I keep pushing, that's what they would want, what my parents would want, my family, friends, everyone. &amp;nbsp; I know what I deserve, I know what my friends deserve, my family, everyone. And that's nothing but the best, but you? The exact opposite. I hope you choke on your own shit. I hope your organs shut down slowly. I hope you experience unimaginable pain. I hope you experience every bad thing possible. &amp;nbsp; I am a vixen. I have a vendetta. I am Sybil and this is what you've created."

I can't wrestle with my memory of you and the knowledge of the pain you cause most people around you at different times anymore. You are a beautiful, smart, funny man, everything I dreamed about for over twenty years. I threw away relationships over my loyalty to just the memory of you.

I give 100% of me in every relationship I engage in. When I met you, I had prepared myself to be in a relationship for the 9 months leading up to that moment. I knew that I had been hurt a lot before meeting you so I took a lot of time to make sure I was prepared to love you in a healthy way. I went on the first date with you, I saw many red flags from the very beginning but I overlooked all of those things because I only wanted to see the good in you. I wanted to give you the chance to prove me wrong. I wanted to believe that there were good men out there with good intentions. You didnt prove me wrong; you proved me so right. I so didn't want you to. I'm disappointed in me for even allowing it to get to this point. I set a very low bar of expectations for you and somehow you didn't even meet those. And as I watched you not meet them, I continuously made excuses for you in the hope that it was a coincidence or a phase or anything other than your true character. I wanted to be there for you and be a good person to you. That is why I went out of my way for you whenever you needed help. That is why I put your own happiness before my own. You weren't ready to experience me and the love that I am capable of giving. I am slowly learning that I would love to be in a relationship with someone exactly like me. That is not to say that I think I am the epitome of a perfect partner, but I know that I do things with intentionality and I love fully and purely. I thought that these qualities within me could help to change you, but I was wrong. I didn't think I was in this relationship attempting to change you. I thought that I would be pulling out the soft-hearted man that I assumed was beneath the hard exterior. However, that hard exterior is not covering a soft and empathetic heart which means I did end up trying to change that quality about you. I thought that since I'm going to school to be a counselor that I would be able to somehow teach you skills to listen to me the way that I want to be listened to. I don't know why I thought that I could play God and somehow instill within you qualities with which people are born. I don't want to say that you didn't deserve my love. I think everyone deserves to be loved the way that I know how to love. However, I do think that you did not appreciate my love and that means that you are not ready to be an equal partner capable of being selfless. You did deserve my love and you did deserve to know what it is like to be involved with one of the few ""good women"". You deserved for me to change your perspective. You deserved for me to open your heart to the endless possibilities of love. You deserved it all just by being another human being. And just when you got what you deserved, you demanded more. You asked for the impossible and you pushed me to my limits. No amount of me loving you could have ever changed the way you felt. No amount of me loving you could have ever been enough for you to be happy and grateful. As much as I want to be spiteful and resentful and maybe even vengeful, I still know that you are someone who has been incredibly hurt. You were not made to be exactly this way but you became this out of necessity. For that, I do not blame you. What I do blame you for is that you consistently used that as an excuse as to why you didn't need to treat me the way that I deserve to be treated. I blame you for not taking control of your life and your actions and your feelings by owning the mistakes while simultaneously working to overcome the psychological barriers you have built so high. Only you can tear those down and rather than doing so, you stand next to them in your bloodied battle gear with your shield raised and your sword prepared. You stand next to these walls as though they are a trophy in which you have won for surviving hardship. You will never be able to feel differently until you are able to see that these walls are not working to your advantage and that the only way to advance would be to take it down, brick by brick. You have the power to help you. You are capable. You have the intellect to overcome this. As much as I know I would have stood next to you during your process and even would have bore the weight of the bricks, I cannot do that for you any longer. I cannot convince you that you need to do something differently and I certainly cannot convince you that I am a person worthy of love and affection. You had the opportunity for me to be your biggest cheerleader and supporter and you traded that in. I want you to succeed and I want you to do something with yourself. You have to take the steps to get there and some of those steps will be incredibly difficult to take. You have to put in the work and you have to learn the value of vulnerability. Until you do this, you will be setting yourself up to feel alone and unloved and a victim of the situation in which you find yourself. I am at peace. I wish you well. -A"

A new hairstyle that, every time Ive seen it, Ive thought damn I wish I could tell them their hair looks really fucking good. Okay? A classroom that smelled of wet dog. An unspeakable atrocity that followed me around this entire year until I succumbed to its reality and somehow found relief in doing so. A weakness. An incredible strength. A flight, a wedding, a graduation, a diploma by mail, London to Dubai to NYC to Brooklyn whether North or West (I dont know Ive not wanted to believe in Northwest), a melted dashboard AND a missing radio, the growth of rain, a swarm of fireflies. A school I hate but want to succeed at in order to prove to them, to me, that I was capable. A cry for perspective, an owls envy, the growth of rain, a swarm of fireflies. A person I tried to forget because my only memory of them was their absence. A sapphire muse that I NEVER could have imagined was indicative of kaleidoscopic romanticism the likes of which are so incredibly vast that I almost couldnt imagine they could be for me. A memory of their presence after noticing it, once again, in my peripherals one fateful night in the library. A feeling underneath my skin - even sans shirt - that they were there even though Is thought theyd left. A feeling that lead to me finding them *everywhere* just as they have been in *everything* even so long as Ive denied it. Im headed home. Im sitting in the back of the car right now. Were seven hours from Houston. Youve been on my mind this *whole time* and that is the vulnerability, THAT is the fear, THAT is the moon, THAT is the rain, THAT is truth I have been so scared to admit until after I sat on the cold tile of my hotel room and cried for hours so that I might come to terms with it. THAT is the truth. THAT is what has motivated every action, every kindness, every pain, every anger, every confession, every I like me, every cry for authenticity, every fear of vulnerability, every night terror that ended in me waking up and forgetting them because my only remaining memory was absence. Every post before I was buried alive, every ambiguity as I pondered digging myself out. Every denial, every drink, every misstep. Every positivity. Every negativity. I burnt the dashboard after a thief left in the night with what I once bought and last night I collapsed onto the bathroom floor and tried to remember the piney woods. All of my friends have always loved to remind me that I was destined for the city - stars!, Ive always thought - when the truth is I yearn to feel the sun burn the back of my neck. Hopscotch. When I first read those words, I didnt recognize them immediately as your favorite book but still I went back to the subreddit again because I knew that it was mine for a reason I hadnt quite reconciled. I noticed. Melancholy. I am the owl. That is the most genuine way I was able to express how I have felt this entire year. That still is the most genuine way I can describe it. It is as if I snapped my neck into the other direction but never moved my body with me. "

I am a storyteller and I spin out various scenarios where you find this sub and recognize yourself in my letters and I imagine how the different versions of you would react. I still dont know which one is the real you. I may never know. Anyhow, some versions of you react with anger and hatred. Some react with sadness and empathy. I dont think any of the versions would want to keep reading. My letters have been pretty raw and have revealed a darkness and vulnerability you likely wouldnt want to see, either because you wouldnt understand and it would cause you fear and anger, or because you *would* understand and it would make you concerned and sad. You would be punishing yourself if you kept reading. I know you have always been a lurker on social media, tending to read but never comment. So, if you are out there, I want you to know that I am still fighting. This depression is really bad, like *really* bad. I read some things recently that opened my eyes to just how bad it is. I filled out a questionnaire for the psychiatrist with questions about symptoms (do you cry? think about death? struggle to interact with people? that sort of thing). I checked a lot of the boxes. That didnt surprise me. But, it asked how many days in the last thirty days I felt those symptoms and how many days those symptoms significantly interfered with my life/routine. It kind of hit me when I had no trouble writing 30. I didnt even have to pause. Every day I fight back tears, wish I was asleep or dead, avoid people, struggle to find the motivation to do the things that have to be done or to do the things I used to like to do. Every...single...day. At this point, I would never hurt or kill myself but things are pretty bleak. Life is hard and I am *so* incredibly tired. It isnt an easy fight. But, I am an optimist even in the midst of depression and, somehow, I am still fighting. Every day, I manage to drag myself out of bed and do the things that absolutely must be done. You have no idea how much I just want to drop the ball and let everything fall apartto just curl up in a ball under a blanket and sleep. And I cant say I am doing a great job at the things I do. But, I am doing them. I am pushing onward, one foot in front of the other, one gray day after another. I havent dropped the ball yet. And I am still seeking professional help. I am trying the medications and talking to the therapist. I am trying to get better. Somehow, I still have a sliver of hope for a better tomorrow. So, I want you to know that I am apparently stronger than you or I would expect or believe. I desperately wish that you could help and support me through this, that you would let me make music with you again. It would mean more to me than you can possibly know. Choral music is one of the few things that still lifts my spirits, even if it also sometimes contributes to my sadness, and I truly loved making music with you. I loved you as a director. I valued your friendship. But, I also know that, for whatever reason, you cant or wont do that. I cant expect help or support from you. I cant even expect you to acknowledge my existence. And, I will be honest, that hurts a lot and certainly hasnt made things easier. Still, if you are out there lurking, I want to soothe your concerns. I want you to know that, as hard and painful and exhausting as this journey is, I am still fighting and I intend to keep fighting while I still have the strength to do so. Hopefully, I will defeat this thing and, if we ever meet again, I will be someone who you can respect and admire, not just an exhausted mess clinging to life. "

I hate everything that I've ever done for you. I hate that I won't stop trying. Even now, when you've made it plainly obvious that you only care for what I can give to you, and not that it's me giving it. Because that's just who I am - that's what I do. Once you reach that certain stage of companion in my heart I can't just abandon you, even if it brings me pain to keep going. But with how you are now, you don't care. You'll keep taking and taking and taking, until there's nothing left of me to give. I need to stop this side of me, kill it in its tracks before it kills me. I love you, you know. In a platonic sense. I love you and I hate you. Yeah, I caught feelings when I shouldn't have long ago. It was an obsession at the start. And maybe it's a little bit of one now, too. Less so, but still qualifying. I used to care about what you were doing, where you were going, who you were with. I don't care about any of that anymore. I only care that you won't drive drunk, that you'll make better choices, that you're happy. I'm so disappointed in you, you who always proclaims you're going to change but never does. Still, I want to be there when you need someone. I want to be there to see you transform into someone who gives a shit about those around him. Because I know that person is inside of you; you just prefer to keep him sedated with drugs and alcohol. Caring about people hurts. I should know. But the beautiful moments of vulnerability are what makes it worth it. I want to be one of the few you care about. I don't think I ever will be though, and that's okay. But for the love of god, do better. Just for your sake, do better. And leave me in peace while you're at it, because I don't have the strength to walk away."

Like I always do. Time after time and time again. Why do you all accept me so easily? I put up a good front, don't I? I say it's easy when it isn't. When all I want to do is tear myself apart, limb from limb. Peel my skin and muscle away from my bones until I'm nothing. Until I don't exist anymore. The sweetest oblivion. I hate myself. So. Much. I'm sorry. For everything, really. For existing, for meeting you, for breathing. But that facade... It's decent, isn't it? I don't know why I do it, either. Maybe I just want to be normal. Feel normal. Like I'm a part of society, just like everyone else. I can shoot the shit, just like a real girl. Look, Mom! I'm a real girl! No. I'm 26 and I won't call myself a woman because I'm not. I'm not mentally or emotionally mature enough to don that title. I'm getting married soon. Jesus christ, what in the fuck am I doing? I'm spiraling so fucking fast I can't even breathe. I don't even know what love feels like, and I'm going to commit to it. ""She seems to really have it all together,"" they said to my fiance, and he laughed and said, ""If only you knew."" He didn't have to tell me about that interaction. I wouldn't have known if he hadn't said anything to me. Blissfully unaware. Ignorance is bliss. He thinks it's funny. It is funny. So funny. Hilarious. I'm dying over here. Inside. I appreciate his honesty. His realness. I think. Aren't I supposed to? I can't live in a world of lies. Relationships don't work that way, we have to be honest with each other. Fuuuuuuuuck. I try to explain my ADD. It's like flipping a switch, I say. I can be hyper focused on something, and then the switch is flipped and that something isn't a focus anymore. It's just.... It's nothing now. The passion is gone. There isn't a reason. It's just not there. It works the same with my depression. One moment I'll be happy as can be, completely ignoring the signs. Everything is A-OK! *flip* Nope. Nope. Not okay. There is no color in the world. I'm rambling, Nate. I'm sorry. Just like you ramble, but your rambling is harmless. You're expanding your mind. Your musings are beautiful. I really did appreciate you opening up to me. It was sweet, and your vulnerability and wonder at the universe made me remember when I was a child. In my family we used to have long discussions about life outside of Earth, what death was like, if there was a heaven or a hell. There was color then, but in the back of my mind I could feel the darkness creeping. I knew it would come, and it did. I broke over a guy that I have never met in person. How fucking stupid is that? I was scared and I saw my salvation in him. I bore my soul to him, and he accepted me. Then someone else came along, and his eyes were immediately off of me. I remember feeling so worthless, so ugly and unclean. I was dating someone at the time, and he knew and he voiced his concerns but I ignored him because he made me feel validated. It was a short-lived and stupid fling, but the circumstances behind it pushed me over the edge and I broke. I hit those rocks at the bottom of that chasm at mach 6 and I haven't been the same since. I'm still there, shattered into a million pieces on those rocks. I found a shovel down here, and I've been digging. Deeper and deeper. I'll tell you more, but right now I'm tired."

I blocked your number months ago. ""Please unblock me,"" was all you wrote. I've come to expect an email from you along these lines every week or so. I caved, and I unblocked you. I sent you a text message: ""What do you want to talk about so badly?"" Your mother passed. And you know what? I wanted to fly there right away and hold you. I wanted to cry for you. I wanted to drown you in my love. But I didn't. All I replied: ""I'm really sorry."" What am I supposed to do? When we met, I was a woman so full of hope. I was about to start my career and move to the other side of the country. All of my hard work had paid off, and my life was about to take off. A few months later, you flew to see me. We spent that Labor Day weekend together, and I knew that I was never going to be the same. I fell in love with you, and I fell in love so hard. You left your t-shirt with me and when I found it in my bag, after youd left, I just cried. You asked me to be your girlfriend a few days later. I couldnt believe that it was finally happening for me. I had fallen in love; I had found my guy. Even now, two years later, I still cry thinking about it all. But then I harden. Why did you do what you did to me? All of those nights we FaceTimed for hours when we couldn't be together. All of those movie dates. All of the dinners we made. All of the places we went. All of the amazing moments of intimacy. All of the blissful laughter we'd get lost in. The plans we made for our lives together, just gone. It fucking rips me apart. The whole time, I was never the only girl. My intuition knew the whole time, but you made me feel crazy, instead. You gaslighted me into oblivion. You made me feel so small. It just slowly got worse and worse until, one day, I woke up, and I didnt have anything left in me. I was so confused as to how it had gotten that terrible. Every night, you would lie to me, scream at me, and then disappear for the night, sometimes not coming back for a whole day. I woke up that day and saw all of the soon-to-be scars on my legshow I passed the time when you would scream at me; when you would leave me; when you would tell me to shut up; when you would threaten me; when you would shove me; when you would ignore me pleading, stop; when you would come at me, fists first. Why? All I had was love in my heart for you. I did everything for us. I was so in love with you. I never did anything to hurt you. So why did you do what you did to me? It was all a plan to you, it seems. You were disloyal to me before we ever made things official. You knew I was getting to a good place in my life, finally. And all you did was rip me to shreds from the inside, out. I could send this to you, but then it would just let you know that Im thinking of you. With you, my love, my vulnerability: theyre all weapons for you to use against me. So, thats why I cant say anything more than Im really sorry. Because I remember those nights. I remember those nights without you, spent wondering if Id even make it to the sunrise. If I managed to sleep at all, Id wake up, eyes swollen shut, and find something to do until you came back. Im so sorry, I love you so much, the edible arrangements, the cardsthey all came with you when youd come back. None of it will ever make sense to me, but I do know that I still love you, and I always will. But I also know that in this life, all Ill ever be able to extend is: Im really sorry. "

I wish I could say it was clever planning of boredom in years and pattern. Im smitten, confused and slightly awestruck by this. It was not the intention of either of us; it is professional, at least at the start, it was. The professional aspect lead to mutual admiration, your situation meant I would care for you from my heart, with intent to show gratitude for what youve given me. I want to know you, and I know youre guarded. It is easy to see. You shared your vulnerability with me yesterday, and I chose to feel your deprecation. It hurt me to feel this, but I wanted to share in how you conveyed your feeling. Knowing you dont share such susceptibility with nearly anyone, allow me to be clear: I love your strength in sharing your vulnerability with me. It is safe with me. Thank you for confiding in me, bearing that truth of your ethos. Let me feel broken with you. We are human. Suffering is part of our condition, but, it doesnt define nor inflict upon me. I want to know about you, your life, your thoughts, entire gamut of your inner self. Take your time, it isnt natural for you to open up instinctively. Youre at home in my soul, deep within my hollow heart. Now, I dont see you as weak, neither feeble. I saw someone under duress. This is an intrinsic difference, a significant one, at that. After the undeniable connection yesterday, Im going to show you my demons. I want to show you how Ive learned to live with them. I want to show you my passion for living. I want to show you who I truly am, just as I want to know you, completely, patiently. Yet, Im over the surface pleasantries. Thats bullshit. I want to fuck you stupid, steal your soul, keep it, protect it, and honor it. I hate fucking fairy tales and romance is contrived. I want you, wholly. To be warned, it will be a raw pain, eviscerating. It will bleed you out, as I hold all that is dear to you, with mercy. I want entanglement that which cannot ever be undone, a mark that cannot ever be removed, a scar. The connection between us warrants such. This isnt superfluous, you and I. I dont do anything less than full-throttle. It is intense, searing and deafening, what brings us close. I dont give a flying fuck that youre shorter than I am. Youre fucking handsome, talented, broken, hilarious, intelligent, and gentile. I dont want to fix you; I want to show you youre worthy of a love beyond the bullshit fakes we see in the world. Please be forward and direct, it will serve to triage the erotic, inoculating against fading self-confidence with a dose of validation. I welcome the challenge for you to break me, as Im relentless. Youve never known another quite like me. I feel everything. At least if Im writhing, burning and living, come with me. Join me. Walk into the fire, eyes open, holding my hand. I want you to torment my heart, consume my soul and destroy my being. The taste of your mouth will make me salivate, whet my appetite to suffice the beast within, but finally enmeshing my admiration and gratitude for you. You wanted my collaboration, you knew my abilities were as extensive as my capacity to love, adore. Thats why you took me up on my passive offer. I unabashedly, undoubtedly...love you.

I let you get what you want. You sent me a picture of yourself topless to me. You told me you loved me. Is this what you wanted? Was this all some twisted fantasy? Did you want me to come fuck you in a hotel room and leave? Is this why you You engaged me sexually and immediately closed me off. I hate feeling used. I hate knowing that you malnipulated me into sexting you. You knew you could just tell me you loved me and I would give in. There was no conversation about the future. You did not want to leave me yet you wanted others. You wanted me to love you. You wanted the same love I had always foolishly given you without a second thought. I was unconditional. I didn't know any better. You abused me. You monster. Do you know how it feel completely emotionally numb? Do you know how it is to have flashbacks to events that only took place in my mind? That is honestly so disgusting and twisted. I gave you my vulnerability. I was left completely sexually disfunctional after these events. I still am. I hate feeling so broken. When I asked to communicate, you flat out told me you didn't want to. Did you just want to use me and forget about me forever? You knew deep down that we weren't obviously going to work out. I was blinded by my emotions. You knew you could do what you wanted me. You knew you could get away with it. My freshman year at Texas Tech was absolute hell. I thought I was heartbroken at the time. I thought these were just feelings you had when you lost someone you loved. Little did I know I was experiencing the symptoms of someone being abused. I lived that whole year at Texas Tech with crippling anxiety, severe depression, and daily panic attacks. I remember completely collapsing on the floor in sheer panic and pain, unable to move. I thought what we had was ""love"", but The idea that you were engaging me sexually and talking to your boyfriend at the same is something that makes my skin crawl. The feelings of shame and disgust due to being exploited is the most harrowing and frightening experience. I started to have panic attacks triggered by simply looking at a photo of you. I would relive how you texted to malnipulate me seduce me through the phone over and over again. You violated me. You abused me. You are a disgusting sexual predator. I am grateful my therapist was able to navigate these frightening feelings with me. She helped me understand how people like you used my feelings as leverage to exploit me. She told me how people can rape others without phyiscal interaction. She informed me about healthy boundaries, something we were not able to have. You raped me without even having to lay a hand on me. I just want to know why. Why did you decide that this was the best thing you could have done? When I think of the past, it scares me because I wonder what other lies and hidden truths you kept from me. This is what PTSD looks like. Its writing up my feelings at one in the morning on my laptop because I cannot deal with holding this inside me any longer. This was a completely one-sided abuse. When I finally met you, on an emotional level I handled it very well. There was such a disconnect from my idealized perception of you and reality that it didn't even seem real. My biggest regret is not being able to stand up to you and tell you how much you hurt me. In my denial, in my broken state of mind, I even told you how happy I was we could meet, and that I hoped we could have an amicable future. I was in denial about everything. It was so shocking to be abused by you I could not even realistically conceive what truly happened. I was just afraid of losing you, and I had relied on you for so long that I was not able to come to terms with the situation. The foundation of this abuse goes back all the way to the summer before senior year, when we ""broke up"". You told me you should ""be allowed to see other people too"". I relented and gave in to everything you asked me for. This was just a way for you to justify our emotional closeness while seeking romance with others without feeling like you're cheating. The unhealthy boundaries came into play again. I wish I had given myself space from you. Eventually, you told me you missed me. You missed the phone sex. When you weren't able to find what you were looking for in someone else, you came back to me. I gave in because I didn't know better. You just wanted to have your cake and eat it too. I didn't know how to say no. I'm just so angry. I have sexual dysfuction because of the psychological trauma of these events. You champion ""feminism"" yet you abuse someone who just wanted to love you. I know now that you just wanted me to want you. You wanted that same familiar emotional support I had always given you, but you wanted your boyfriend at the same time. And you know what? Nobody knows. Nobody knows in your life what you did. You can just pretend nothing happened. I never once confronted you about these things because I simply didn't understand that I was being abused. When you were out of my life and I had realized what was really going on, it was too late to have a conversation. Because you never wanted to have this conversation. "

You felt I answered with hate. You felt I hated you. You felt I was done with you, and all of that broke my heart. Im so glad that we got to talk. All I wanted was for you to understand that it was hurt not hate which drove me. I fully believe that youre smarter than you like to let on. Therefore its very likely that having stumbled upon my Reddit account once you now are out there in your queen sized bed, feeling alone and empty, and looking for some sort of a sign from me. I cant message you. I dont want to lead you on, I dont want to constantly remind you of what we had and lost, and I dont want to turn into an emotional whirlpool, slowly draining you of all your strength and energy yet again. You write far better than I ever will. I wish that I could express my feelings as eloquently as you do, but while I cant, the least I could do is write this letter on the off chance that as you lie at home youre searching for it. So here goes. Last night was amazing. It was a page stolen from the book of someone who was allowed to be happy. I got to see you, more beautiful than ever, and for the first night in a month or so, everything felt right, and yet, everything felt so wrong. The endearing nicknames we have for each other, the affection that we both so clearly host even as we feel it slip away, the vulnerability we feel comfortable expressing, all of it felt right. So so right. When you told me I dont even know why we broke up and then went on to repeat it, casually, some time later, just in case I had unintentionally ignored you, I couldnt bring myself to answer. We both know why we broke up, but the reason we arent together currently? My heart needs to heal. Emotions are new for me, as freely as I expressed them, and believe me, I feel so comfortable and happy with you in my arms. All feels right in the world. All feels good. But as I said earlier, all feels like a page from someone elses story. I wish that in my story I was the character who was allowed to be happy. I tried to right all that I had wronged. I wish I could. I didnt use my phone, I didnt smoke, I listened. I shut the fuck up and listened. I didnt patronize. I wanted you to feel how I cared, not just hear it from me. Those are words I cant bring myself to say, lest it destroy the walls Ive carefully been rebuilding to protect the remnants of my broken heart. I tried to show you how I felt with music. I played the song I played because I too am leaning out. I too feel as though I am a sailor waiting for the sea to free me. I tried to show you with touch. You speak touch, and your vocabulary is far more sophisticated than mine. I hoped that youd understand what I was saying. I tried to show you how I felt with tears. Strange as it may seem, when you sobbed along with me, I felt like we were in the midst of the deepest conversation of our lives. One where we both communicated that we loved each other. That our love was slipping away but it wasnt too late to rebuild it. That we both felt that soon it might be. I tried as best I could. When you told me how you felt about me casually mentioning other women, I knew exactly what you meant. I felt that and dealt with that with Mike. I too felt the dull loss that wasnt mine to lose when you received that message, as much as you tried to soften the blow. When I left we both cried. Remember that. Both of us wept, engaged in a wordless conversation which cut too deep to think about. Tonight, Ill smoke, if I can. Not from a joint, as much as I didnt want to, I left that at your house. Tonight I smoke from my bowl of loneliness. "

There were times I brought other parties into the picture - cluelessly - over things that should have remained private.

I want you to know that i forgive you for the times you were hurtful to me. i caused the suffering - from the very beginning - that contributed to your anger. Beneath every layer of resentment and grief and pain, ive always known this.. And if i never get the chance to say it again, its important to me for you to hear this... This is not about longing for a romantic relationship... it is about how i hurt somebody who had loved me, and who i loved, and who was once so good to me. it is about what i cannot take back, but wish so badly that i could.. it is about how i got so far away from myself and hurt a dear, dear friend and how deeply i regret. i said terrible things to you that i never believed, and never meant, and i'm sorry for that. i am sorry for all the pain, the embarrassment, the fear of what boundaries i wasnt capable of crossing, and every other hurt i caused you. i violated your trust in so many ways. if anything i said or did made it the slightest bit harder to love or trust another person the way you once loved me, i am sorry. if what you took from all this was that your vulnerability was something other than a strength, that couldnt be any further from the truth. im not sure what is real and what isnt - to what degree i (with all of my flaws) was drawn to you for who you aspired to be, or for the beautiful, imperfect person i came to know.. Im not sure it makes any difference honestly... The only thing that matters to me so many years later, is how i felt about you as a friend, and in how meaningful you became to me as a person in my life. The deep intimacy of our letters and our conversations - not as lovers, but as two people sharing the deepest of friendship.... all the ways you articulated and loved me for my little idiosyncrasies that prior to then, i either hadnt noticed, or had seen, only as liabilities (P, youre such a girl). The discovery of how alone id always been even when id unceasingly ever been in the company of others. The feeling of being known, of being understood and valued, for who i was, despite my own failures to live up to who i, myself, aspired to be. The great irony that i would have to meet somebody oceans away to discover any of this The hardest thing - from the very beginning - was knowing what the end meant: it meant never. seeing. you. again. it meant knowing that your presence in my life, going forward, would be your absence. it is a memory of loss, it is a memory of grief. And in the context of everything else that was happening in my life at the time, it was far, far beyond my ability to cope. i wish the expression of my grief would have been in a less destructive, less hurtful way. i wish i would have had it in me to have paused and taken the time to have seen the other choices for my own survival without the burning of bridges, and that i would have been mindful about what crossing even a single boundary of decency could lead to.. i wish id understood how leaving S in the way that i did - regardless of the merits - would have the consequences it would have on my sense of myself, the way it would shatter my sense of being worthy of trust, or of love (and on how i would project those feelings about myself onto you and onto others, and constantly need reassurance to cope with this). The way all the disorientation and self-hatred would affect my sense of the value of my own personal integrity, and cause such lasting harm to you and to other people - and to me. i wish i hadnt been filled with such hubris to think that the the kind of crisis I experienced was something that could only happen to other people (perhaps if I was the kind of person with the discipline to never stray from within the lines, Id feel differently about this, but Im not and never have been, and theres no getting away from that.. ). And i wish that when it really mattered, i would have acknowledged the source of my pain.. my suffering was caused by me. im mindful there are no meaningful excuses for any of this. And im mindful that if i believed there were circumstances that would have or could have made my behavior acceptable, i would have let this all go a long time ago. i visited P over the holidays even though my preference was to leave it to memory. i walked the xxxxl with my family. We made a lot of new memories - but there were flashes of the old ones too: places seen, paths crossed, the familiar voice of a barking dog, the difficulty in catching my breath. Being back there made me think about the accident, the randomness of the people we meet in our lives as though, somehow there was a plan. the people we pass every day who we may never so much as notice, the magic of the connections we do make. The magic when something resonates in those moments. We ate breakfast on the first morning at the very same place where you approached me on the dusty, winding highway that ran through the little town where wed stopped. As i recall, we were waiting for our guides to get organized prior to boarding a bus. i had my back to the group, watching the traffic go by, and you came and you stood by me and we had our first conversation i know the Y i met on that roadside no longer exists. She helped me to see the reflection of my soul in the world around me the discovery of my artistic nature. The expression of our feelings, our hopes, and our dreams - when often, all we had was our writing - was a lesson in poetry, and that has always stayed with me. it is so much of who i am, a world that could have otherwise gone undiscovered. it is a way of seeing, and a way of being, and it is a gift and i am grateful. i loved the Y i knew.... i was inspired by her, i was changed by her. And i deeply, deeply regret hurting her. You are one of the closest, most intimate friends ive ever had, and that will always be sacred to me. i value how we met. i value what you gave to me, i value who you were... i am grateful i was able to share a moment with you in this life. i grieve the loss of you as my friend and what i did to cause that. And i regret the message i sent that you were not loved, that our friendship had no meaning beyond what was telegraphed at the painful end, that how i behaved in those moments represented how i felt if i never get the chance to say this again, i am sorry. From the center of my being i am sorry. i came to ____ over ten years ago needing a change of scenery, hoping for a sense of redemption - only to learn that outside of storybooks and movies, there is no redemption, only coping. i have lived lives. i have gotten married and had children. i have gone slightly gray around the temples and in my beard, and my back hurts from time to time. i have lost people and learned the importance of not leaving things unsaid. i have come to take more pleasure in my childrens and my wifes accomplishments than in my own... and the expression of myself through my art has become more urgent for me in recent years - though the genres have changed. And as i have gotten older, i have learned that time and space are not a constant, that they expand and contract in relation to the meaning of our particular experiences and to the memories of the people weve loved. I have lived many lives since i knew you but whats never changed is wanting to finally get this right, to make amends as best i can, to honor what you gave to me to say how badly i feel about that past, to not let more of my life slip away without doing so i do not think worse of you for whatever negative feelings about me you may hold.. conclusions drawn, judgements passed. i do not feel entitled to forgiveness or any reconciliation, i dont... And i am not expecting a response.. i only want what ive always wanted but never had the clearness of head or heart to do with any sense of satisfaction: to try and make peace with the past, and to maybe in some way, do what little i could (or that any of us can) to shape the world in the way we would hope for it to be. I know im missing on some of the particulars, and I know the tools Ive got are blunt or not shaped correctly for the demonstration of good faith or the clearest expression of how I feel - but please know I regret hurting you for all this and more. I am sorry. "
726,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Dear P,9,886t7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/886t7p/dear_p/,2018-03-30 12:40:20," It has been years. And yet, here you are; haunting me. I miss your body crushing mine, your laugh, your sighsI miss thinking that a lifetime with this guy wont be enough. The day I drove off, I promised no contact. I kept that promise and more. I changed my latitude, my number, and my name. I cut-off mutual friends and destroyed every trace of you. I avoided social media, and when I finally joined FB, I blocked you and anyone associated with you. I vowed to disappear and treat you like you never existed. I had to do it to protect myself from the devastation of losing you. A few months ago, I googled your name for the 1st time. I found a picture of you. It was the kind of picture one might use with a professional bio. And you looked wella bit older, maybe sad or annoyed but still handsome. I sat alone in the dark with your picture illuminated on my phone and a sleeping child on my shoulder and cried. How Id love to see your smile again. I remember how wed lie on the couch together; you on your back with me on top of you. Id make like I was about to kiss you then whip my face away only to cover your mischievous grin with kisses moments later. I could call or email - but we both know I wont in spite of how my heart aches for you. You are a lifetime gone. But I still look for you; when Im caught in the haze between sleeping and waking, when Im hiking, or when I see surveyors in their bright safety vests, or anytime something reminds me There are things I should have said or would have said if I had the words. Things you deserved to know. Not because the knowing would change anything - but because I love you. And I suspect that like you are for me, I am a painful memory. So Ill write it here, and (not so) secretly hope my words find you. Then I will tease myself into thinking you will not only see this message, but recognize yourself/me and respond. Ha! When we met in college, you were all sunshine and laughter and lightness. Loving you was easy and sweet and I did. We saw the best parts of ourselves mirrored in each other. But I came with a problem. I was stuck in a relationship with an abusive drunk. I had an exit strategy and I bided my time until I could safely escape. He was a danger not only to me but to any man or woman who got close to me. So I had to untangle myself carefully, but I did it. And we were thrilled. Do you remember kissing in your driveway after you took me to my friends wedding while he was away? Little did we know, I did not get away, or rather I did not get away unscathed. It would take years and an unholy loss and heartbreak to understand the extent of the damage he did to my psyche. And a few more to fix it so that it didnt continue to destroy me and everything I loved. You knew he was terrible because of the few things I told you. But I did not want to cloud our new beautiful love with ugly baggage. I thought the more you knew about that situation the more apt you would be to think poorly of me or think I needed rescuing or protection or that I was weak. I didnt want to lay all that on you. But the truth is; because of that bad experience and another that came later (which I will get to), I struggled daily to see me for me. Instead of seeing beautiful girl with with a world of opportunity in front of her; I saw myself as some used-up, damaged piece of meat. I saw myself as unworthy of love, as ugly as vapid. And I felt guilty for not getting the hell over myself and guilty for being in the bad situation in the first place. And I felt guilty for not relaxing and enjoying my life and the heart of the most beautiful soul - you. My sweet precious you. I know you had your own insecurities and darkness. It made me love you more. You were real and complicated and sensitive and chivalrous. When you showed me a vulnerability -my heart raced with love and pride that you trusted me with a precious detail, a secret from your life. I just wanted to love you. I wanted to hear your secrets and kiss your wounds and have adventures and delight in the mundanities of daily living with you. I saw you babe. And I love(d) you. But the more I loved you, the more vulnerable and afraid I became. I was terrified youd see that I was ugly, and unworthy and damaged and on and on. And I worried that once you saw this ugly mess, you'd leave. My fears of course became a self-fulfilling prophecy. And you did leave. Then after a few years we came back together. This time our feelings were stronger. And I tried to explain my demons. But I did it poorly and then, embarrassed I brushed it off. I thought I could be ok. We were so happy. Live with me you said. We called each other soulmates and declared how wed be together for the long haul. We marveled at how good we were together, how connected, how at peace we felt. But my demons remained. And the years we were together are scared irrevocably by them. I never felt good enough for you. I wish I had been eloquent or insightful enough to explain this to you. I know you would have understood and would have had compassion for me. Hear me though: none of this is your fault. You were wonderful to me and never gave me cause to question. You never gave me reason to think you couldnt handle my past or that you weren't wholly committed to me. Tho I did question. Sometimes you were patient and I was grateful, sometimes you would get annoyed. Who wouldnt? And my questioning hurt you because you didnt understand my (seemingly irrational) thought process. And youd pull away which I would read as disgust which would fuel my demon. By now I was aware the demon was triggered by stress. And I worked hard to just chill and breathe and think and remember. BECAUSE I wanted to be better for YOU, for US, for me. And I WAS getting better. Stress. There was NO shortage of stress in our lives. Money stress in spite of both of us having professional careers. Job stress. You changed jobs and I was (at the end of our relationship) in the midst of being deposed by the SEC for things my company did prior to my tenure. The result of their inquiry could have been devastating. Professional exam stress. Pressure from well-meaning family members and our own psyches; after all, we were into our 30s with no children (tho we wanted them), and no wedding on the horizon  We had started looking at property to buy and I know you had been ring shopping. The thought of the money we didnt have ate at us more than it should have. We were over-educated with good jobs. But because we were in the beginnings of our careers we didnt have much saved (if any) and we were at the lower ends of our pay scales. All of this was fine - but we (well maybe more me) started to get angry that we were so far (financially) behind friends who started working with only a BS/BA. I know this wore on you in a different perhaps more insidious way than on me. I think it caused you to question your ability as a man to provide for a family. And this insecurity ate at you. I think you felt overwhelmed and unworthy. Although you would never say it directly. To be honest, I would have married you with a beer can pull tab at a gas station. And I would have been thrilled and thankful. But we never got there. As I was starting to get better from my demons and you found a better paying job with better management (albeit with a horrible commute), something happened that I never told you. I had been looking for a better position in my field for a while. I had various interviews with famous companies, and I spoke with two head hunters regularly. I was doing my due diligence. I was also preparing to take the bar in two states. An exam that I didnt necessarily need given how I was using my degree - but a feather that wouldnt hurt prospective employment. But it scared the crap out of me. Meanwhile, a friend from schools husband worked in my field offered to help me. I met him a few times. Out of the blue he contacted me via my friend with the offer to meet for dinner to discuss a position in a company he did business with. You were away, so I went - it was fine. He was professional and cordial. The job sounded promising. We arranged another meeting, but this time with a few people from that company. The job wasnt advertised yet but he seemed to think he could help. Why was he being so kind? Good question. I wondered that too. Apparently his wife (my friend) discussed with him her high regard for me for sharing notes and being kind to her. He traveled a lot and was grateful she had a friend. Fair enough. The second meeting did not go as planned. The people from the prospective company did not show. We had a quick bite, and I said I wanted to get home (to you). He offered to walk me to my car. I agreed because it was dark. I dont know why my guard wasnt up. It has been over 10 yrs and I still struggle to not blame myself. Long story short, he assaulted me in the parking garage stairwell. He didnt rape me but he may as well have. I got away and ran to my car and drove to the gym. I showered and threw my damaged and piss soaked clothes away and drove home in a t-shirt and leggings. It was snowy, but I was so freaked out that I didnt notice the cold. You were distracted with something when I came home, so there was no awkward conversation like, where is your coat? I was relieved because I didnt want to talk. And then after some time had passed I decided not to tell you. I decided it wasnt my fault that this man was a pig. I decided you didnt need to know because you would be worried and hurt. I decided I could not bare to see the hurt and rage on your face. This is how I talked myself out of telling you. I also did not want to add to your stress of acclimating to a new job and commute. I swallowed it. I should not have because the incident in the stairwell ate me alive and the demons I worked so hard to begin to overcome were back in full force. This time Id beat them back I thought. Im older more insightful I thought. I can do this alone I thought. But I couldnt. I finally went to a therapist. You knew that but I didnt tell you why exactly. It was helping. I actually felt like I could be normal again. But it was too late. You started pulling away from me. At first I thought it was stress, then I thought maybe depression or anxiety related to your new job or our house hunting. I wanted to help. I tried talking to you. I put our realtor on hold. I tried to show you how much I loved you. I started doing all of the domestic things. I cooked your favorite meals. I planned what I thought would be relaxing weekends. I didnt know what to do. I still had an intense job. I offered to quit and take a new position so we could move to the city of your job instead of a city between our jobs. We fought about strange things. I went to one of your friends for help. You were drinking too much and blaming me for things in your life I couldnt possibly have been responsible for. You said I controlled you. I was never that kind of girl. I was confused. You didnt want to sleep with me, but you still talked about our future children. I confronted you. You said you loved me. Then you said you didnt. I got sick from the stress. We tried talking but our conversations got lost and confused. You drank more. I was becoming afraid of you because the drinking. I felt panicked. I cried for days. Finally, I told you to just leave. But I was the one who drove away so you could pack up alone. I still dont really understand. We went from bliss to complete madness. I wish I could have just shaken you. Taken you away so youd come back to me for a moment just long enough for us to figure out how to not implode. But I was too stressed or weak or who knows what to figure it out. I think you needed me and I failed you. The image of you in my rear view mirror is the last I have. I wish I turned the car around. But to be fair, I already cried and begged - I didnt know what to do. I thought it would be temporary. The more days went by the angrier and more hurt I felt. So I left. I disappeared. And I made a life for myself as far from you as I could go. But I miss you. And you are still the love of my life. I am gutted. Im sorry. Im sorry. Im sorry. I am sorry if I ever caused you to feel less than, or unmanly, or disrespected or unappreciated. I am sorry I didnt tell you the truth about my demons or about the stairwell. I ruined us. It was me. And I am so sorry. I failed you and me and us. I am sorry I confided in our mutual friend R about things that were happening at the end of our relationship. I suspect she told you I cheated on you which I NEVER did. She stopped speaking to me around that time-I always suspected she meddled somehow. And NOW the big sorry which is the single reason you will probably never speak to me again. I am sorry I married your friend. There was no prior romantic relationship. Despite what R may have said to you, I never did anything behind your back. I went to him for help for you. This you knew. I did not go to your family because I thought you would be mad at me for involving them, and that they would worry more than be able to help. I knew you loved this friend as a brother. I thought he was smart. I thought he could help you. But either he couldnt or you would not let him. When you left our place, I was devastated. I was lost and broken and mad. Your friend offered me a way out. A different life. An arrangement. I took him up on it. Why? I thought I would literally die from a broken heart. I was already in my 30s. I didnt know what other future I would have. I didnt want to be alone. I wanted a baby. So I took him up on his offer. He didnt want to be alone either. We are sincere friends and we love each other. But it isn't the same. It isnt a romantic love. So I wouldnt say hes an ideal husband. And after a horrific struggle I managed to have babies. Babies that should have been yours. But they are his (genetically). Though again, more mine as hes not the ideal father. Im so sorry sweetheart. I know theres nothing else to say. Please find me someday. I cant live with the idea of slipping off this mortal coil without even a glance xx "

Has he always known about me? Has he always been whispering to you that Im slowly becoming that dead weight, that tired hag, that old news, that last years phase? I am powerless.

I want you to see just how badly you hurt me, and I want you to feel horrible about it. I want you to be ashamed of what you did. You left me on the day I got my test results back. You never asked what they showed. (They were positive, by the way. I spent the next 4 months having surgery and radiation therapy). You never gave me a reason. I begged you to at least tell me why, after 5 years, you were leaving seemingly completely out of the blue. Everything was going great. We had moved in together just 2 weeks before, and we were both so happy. You couldnt even tell me why. You would get angry and tell me that it was your decision and that I should respect your decision when I asked for an explanation. You never did give me that reason. I had to find out for myself. In fact, I think you probably still think I dont know. Your friends told me. They told me all about how you cheated on me the night before. How you felt bad about it and, apparently, instead of telling me and facing the consequences of your actions, you decided to end the relationship completely. I wish I could say that our story ended there. But you didnt stop coming home. You would come back and tell me you loved me and wanted to be with me, but then you would leave the next morning and I would hear absolutely nothing from you for 3 days until you showed up again and repeated the same routine. You did this for almost an entire month before I stopped it. You took advantage of my emotions and manipulated me for your own satisfaction. After I called you out, you decided to start staying with your friend (the one that hated me), but promised you would keep helping with your portion of the rent since you signed the lease with me. Then, you stopped paying your share of the rent. I was tired, run down, going through radiation treatment, and trying to stay in school despite all of that. I couldnt add being evicted to that list as well, so I took on a second job and paid your share of the rent. Eventually, once I finally was able to get a hold of you (after you dodged my texts and phone calls about the rent for weeks), you promised you would pay me back. Out of the four months I covered you for, I got my money back for two, and it took an entire year of harassing you to even get that. You know how you directly affected me. What you dont know is everything else I dealt with that you made worse. When we were together, you became like family to my sister. She looked up to you and trusted you like a big brother because thats how you treated her. About a month into all of your nonsense, my mothers alcoholism became too much to handle, and my sister had to come stay with me. I was so physically and emotionally drained from the daily morning treatments, my two jobs, and school, and now I was adding caretaker to that list. But how does this involve you? Before we broke up, she trusted you. She told you a secret. Something awful that had happened to her. She was sexually assaulted. She didnt feel comfortable telling anybody but you, so she told you. You promised her that you would be there to help her get through it. You said you would help her to find someone to help and that you would be there every step of the way. But then you werent. You disappeared from her life without so much as a goodbye. When you left me, you abandoned her. You didnt have to stay in her life, but couldnt you have at least given me a heads up that something was wrong? I was completely oblivious. She went for MONTHS thinking that when she told you, she scared you off. She thought that it was her fault you left. She thought that you didnt care about her anymore because you were disgusted by her. A few months later, I came home and found her passed out in the bathroom barely breathing with a suicide note taped to the mirror. She attempted suicide. And in her note, she apologized to me for all the trouble she caused by telling you. She talked about how you abandoned her. So now you know. Now you can see everything that you put me through. While you were off partying and drinking and getting all your new tattoos and fancy equipment, my entire life was crumbling. You manipulated me; you took advantage of everything and used it against me. You abandoned a 15 year old girl who trusted ONLY YOU with the knowledge that she was assaulted, and, indirectly of course, I almost lost her because of you. I will never be the same person that I was when I was with you. I was weak and unsure of myself, constantly living in your shadow. I was always your girlfriend instead of being known as my own person. I had no self confidence and was constantly letting people walk all over me. You took advantage of that. And now, three years later, not much has changed. While Im completely over you and the relationship, Im still reeling from the effects of what you did. I still find myself mistrusting people. I have a hard time letting people in. Im terrified of showing vulnerability. You broke me, and Im still having trouble trying to pick up the pieces. So there it is. Everything I wish you knew. Everything that I wish I could tell you. I wish you could understand the pain you caused me. You broke me, and Im not sure I can ever be fixed. "
732,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,A letter to an old friend,11,8au5tl,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/8au5tl/a_letter_to_an_old_friend/,2018-04-09 09:51:52,"Hi sweetie :) Do you remember me? I wonder if you do think of me sometimes. It's been almost a year since we last talked. God! How time flies. I still remember everything about you as if we've never parted. I thought I finally got over you but then I checked your profile and I can't stop crying ever since. My heart hurts because of how much I miss you..even the little things that used to get on my nerves. I miss it all: the way you talked, how you always wrote it's as its, how you were totally unable to write in paragraphs but most of all, I just miss your vulnerability. It was so refreshing to find someone like you. It made me fall in love with you right away. I denied it for so long but it was so apparent, wasn't it? Did you notice it? Maybe you sensed it in my frantic, probably excessive, worrying about you? I hope that you know that even though many people have betrayed you, there is someone out there in the world who still loves you with all their heart. Someone who thinks about you every day and prays to whatever governs this universe to take good care of you. I wish you all the happiness in the world, sweetheart. My heart still has so much love for you that sometimes it feels like it's going to burst. God, I wish things had been different. Goodbye, my love. A word that you sadly didn't say and probably never will. "
733,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,M - Will you find me here?,5,8bkssc,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/8bkssc/m_will_you_find_me_here/,2018-04-12 07:30:33,"M, As I wake up, I am immediately invaded with thoughts of you. Last night replays in my mind. Parts are highlighted, effortlessly, as if they put themselves there. I finally let you read that letter. Its been around for weeks. I struggled with the idea of letting you read it. It was so long and contains so much about me. About you. About my feelings. It takes a lot to trust someone enough to give them all the stones they could inevitably use to crush you. I know we may never be but I couldnt live without knowing I had tried. I couldnt keep wondering if it was mutual. So I laid it all at your feet. Trusting you enough to tread lightly, even if your response/reaction wasnt the answer I wanted. As I watched your face as you read it, I was so nervous. You described my mood to a T before I finally handed it to you. I did have butterflies. Thats not uncommon with you. I often get that giddy, happy, hyper, straight goofy rush of emotions around you. Its so refreshing and yet so unbelievably frightening. I remember you describing it as being almost as if were back in high school. You know those other raw feelings now too, dont you? The one that starts when you realize youve opened your heart up, right there on the table in front of the one person that could literally crush it. You said it after you told me your feelings. I responded with, I would never crush you! I mean that! M - you mean so much to me. I know your past has made you guarded. I know you question motives. I know you have a hard time fully trusting people. I dont blame you. We are warned several times to guard our heart. But please believe me when I say I will do everything I can to protect yours. I will do everything I can to continue to prove how amazing I think you are. Ive never met anyone like you. Ive never hit it off on so many levels with someone else. Selfishly I wish for the changes necessary to move forward with you. Unselfishly I pray for where you are now. Your happiness matters more to me now than my own. Thats when I knew I loved you, and I always will. Regardless what road life leads us down, you will always have a large piece of my heart. Remember that night we tried to get one of mine out of the area so we could set up a surprise birthday potluck? We got your boss involved and she was just as lost on a good plan. We tried to come up with an idea. We made jokes about it and laughed as if no one else even existed and in our environment that doesnt happen for several reasons but it did. Everyone and everything disappeared except you and that wonderful, whole-hearted laugh you do when you feel it deep inside. I think thats the night it fully hit me. I knew beforehand but thats the night. Later our eyes met and you smiled at me and my heart about popped out of my chest. The effect you have on me is so overwhelming. I adore you. I really do. I hope one day you let me love you fully. I hope one day we both get what we want. Until then, I will love you from a distance. I will continue to pray for you. I will continue to support you. I will continue to show you that what I feel is pure and true, and that I would never, ever use your vulnerability against you. Until then, youll be on my mind. Cant wait to see you Sunday. LJ"

I don't know how it got all so complicated: a messy tangle of dreams, love, aspirations, vulnerability and neediness. I'm not sure how to tell you -- truth be told, I'm not sure how to even tell it myself. Maybe it goes back to the start: How giddy, happy -- childish even --- we were in our love. Two souls, awash with the naivete and innocence of young love; maybe that's what went wrong, right from the start. We were so blind to the things around us, so focused on each other, that we failed to see all the little things about each other, the little stones and rocks that piled up over and over till it formed impassable mountains between us. The first sign was our respective issues. You, with the history of abuse and neglect that you've never managed to move past entirely (though you never acknowledge that fact); me, with my crushing anxiety, abysmal self confidence and burning -- perhaps compulsive -- need to be loved, to be valued, to be better than what my family made me out to be. They were the driving forces behind our actions: if my issues made me the compulsive white liar (which till now, you've never fully seen), your issues made you the self-centred one in our relationship. Right from the get-go, we were a time bomb waiting for explode. It was fine for a while, really. I truly mean it. That blissful time we had together? You were the only thing that kept me off the ledge I sleep next to every night. You showed me a possibility of escape, of happiness even, gave me my first glimpse that there is more to life than the grey path I saw ahead of me. You offered me escape. Escape from the oppressive expectations that come from being born into the asian rat race, escape from the christian fundamentalism my family subscribes to, escape from the old life -- or dare I say prison-- that was all I ever knew. It was everything you did: our little debates, our discussions, our intimacy, our arguments even. For the first time, physical contact with a person was something I yearned and missed. I don't remember the last time I hugged my parents with joy. Perhaps never. In turn, you told me I filled a void that had always ached in you. I hope that was true. While that time lasted, I did everything I could to make you happy. Remember those roses I folded for you? I've never done origami in my life before. Sat down on the floor of my room, experimenting over and over again just to make sure each and every rose in that bouquet was perfect. Took me a good two weeks of shopping every day to get the perfect prints for the paper. Another week to get the roses right. A full week to fold them all. A hundred folded roses in total, each with their own unique print of something you liked, each with a little note in the petals talking about how I love you. A hundred reasons altogether, and I had leftover roses too. Fuck, it hurts so much, but I remember the smile on your face when I finally gave it to you. You couldn't believe I did it. It was a joke you said, you didn't expect me to do it, let alone so many. And then you kissed me. Not before you laughed at the silly washi tape I tied around the stalks to hold the bouquet together though -- the websites said use floral paper to wrap it up, but it never worked, so in desperation I slapped some whale-print tape on the bottom and hoped you'd like it. I'll take that laugh, that kiss with me to the day I die. But it's all come crashing down. Eventually, those little dark sides in us won out. You cast me aside to pursue what you wanted: Be it this reason or that, I sat on the backburner, waiting for you to come back to me. In my heart, I resented it. No mincing my words here: I really did. I hated that I'd become the second priority, doomed forever to wait until you wrapped up this or that, only gratified with a day or two's worth of attention before you busied yourself with something else. But I never voiced it. I swore to myself to never, ever let me stand between you and your dreams. I knew what they meant to you: an escape from your own set of cricumstances, much like how you became my escape. So for the full year I waited. But one year became two, and two years became three. Three years, and I saw you for dates at most once every two months. The only times you came back was when you failed. I did my best to offer comfort then, but you lashed out at me, claiming my fumbling attempts to offer comfort were hollow, insensitive, and worst of all, exasperating. All I said was ""Don't give up!! You can try again next time hehe. There's always a second chance next year :))"" I copied that text -- a text message, because you refused to see me. Three years later though, finally, you decided to come back to me. But I was gone. As you left to pursue your dreams, so I left to pursue mine. You occupied my days-- being with you was a 24/7 commitment. Somewhere in the third year, I realized my life was basically in stasis, waiting for you. So I filled my days. I took up jobs, attended classes, studied for exams. The time I spent waiting turned into time spent improving myself, just like you did. When I had free time, I would come back to you. Oftentimes, you wouldn't even notice I was gone. When you came back though, I'd drop everything I had, and I'd do my best to help you through whatever short lived crisis you were going through again, and when you inevitably left, I would go back and busy myself. And therein lies our problem: You want me back, and I want me to go back, but I can't. Not without shirking all these new roles and responsibilities I have, not without casting off these new goals and dreams I've forged for myself. I claim its because of familial expectations and promises I've made, but truth be told, that's a lie in part. I want this for myself too. I begged you to wait, to give me just this month more to finish everything, to tie up all the loose ends, but you told me you can't. It doesn't help I'm making all these excuses to buy time or steal time from what we should be spending together. you know it-- or sense it maybe, on some level, that I'm falling back on my old defense mechanisms, telling white lies and refusing to confront you and our issues head on. Its all gotten so complicated, I really don't know what to do. But of course, you'll argue this account is flawed -- of course it is, life's a subjective thing, and people hold different viewpoints: the first lesson you taught me. I love you so much. I love you so, so much. But I just don't know what to do."

To reap the benefits of what your body and mind had to offer, while I forewent the ramifications for my vulnerability. I hoped that I could keep myself at just enough of a distance that you couldnt hurt me. Friends with Benefits. I dove in. Begged you to take advantage of me without breaking my heart. I misjudged my own strength. I gave in too quickly. I fell in love with you. Every bit of you. Your talents and passions. Your flaws and insecurities. I fell in love with the books you read, the movies you loved, the dinners you cooked, the television shows you fell asleep to, the levels you beat, the board games you mastered, and the puzzles that kept you up at night. I fell in love with your sense of reality and logic- how honest, matter-of-fact, and down-to-earth you were. I fell in love with the way you made me feel. I fell in love with way you interacted with your children, your friends, strangers, and the world around you. I fell in love with your commanding disposition, your intellect, and the swagger in your walk. I fell in love with the moments of silent vulnerability between us... the smell of your sheets, and the security of your arms wrapped around me. I fell in love with the friendship that we were building, and the support we were finding in one another. But I needed to remind myself that utopia is a concept not a place You were building me up. You made me feel sexy. You made me feel worthy. You made me feel loved. You inspired me to be the best version of myself possible- to strive for greatness. You wouldnt stand for my self-deprecating sense of humor, and insisted that I spoke more highly of myself- forcing me to face my impostor syndrome and accept the intelligent, beautiful, valuable human being that I am. You invited me to open and expose myself to you. To give myself to you wholly, spiritually and emotionally. To bare my deepest wounds; to be empowered by my most prominent scars. You noticed me for my subtleties. You appreciated me for the characteristics of my laugh, the complexity of my mind, the range of my emotion. I started to crave your company. The hours I needed with you turned into days, and the days soon turned into weeks. Suddenly my free time was consumed by you, and I could only relax in your presence. I began breaking plans with others, and feeling physical withdrawals when you werent around. Codependency. But I needed to remind myself that forever is a concept, not a date in time You became my best friend. You became my best friend, and suddenly the benefits werent enough. You wanted me to yourself, and I wanted to you to be mine. There was more at stake. But there was more in the way. What if there was someone else? What would happen if I lost your interest? What would happen if I lost you? Was I enough? .. Could I ever be enough? In a moment of vulnerability and fear, I let my cards show. I showed you that it would hurt to lose you, and as quickly as you wrapped your hands around them, you loosened your grip on my heart strings and fell silent. Days went by. Weeks. Grieving the loss of a relationship we agreed we never intended to have. I was broken. Suddenly I could see a line drawn in the sand. Defenses were up. I had been pushed out. You fell silent. I began to appropriate time that was once dedicated to you, to activities that built me up and brought me joy. I rebuilt lost and muted friendships, reaching out to people who could show me compassion. I committed time to activities that granted me the validation that I once sought from you. I told myself that I wasnt going to let myself be hurt by you anymore. If you were going to keep me at arms length, I was going to be alright with that. Slowly, you reemerged from the dark. Slowly, you reinitiated conversation. Slowly, you showed interest in me again. But I needed to remind myself that perfection is a concept, and not a standard Here we are. Rebuilding our friendship. Holding on to reluctant kisses goodbye, and the occasional sexual encounter- craving the way you touch me. Wishing you would express longing for me. My walls are back up, but I cant help but to hope you fall in love with me, still. I need to remind myself that infinity is a concept, not a number "

Im afraid to truly let my guard down. Im afraid of letting my jealousy, clinginess, possessiveness, obsessiveness show. Im afraid of how much I already love you. Im afraid youll break my heart. Im afraid of the vulnerability. Youre the sweetest guy I think Ive ever known. Youre so respectful to me. I dont think youd ever really hurt me. Im afraid to let you in completely. Im afraid to lay it all on the line. Im afraid that you might be it. Im afraid of leaving my life behind. Im afraid of the choices that Im making. Im afraid of not being good enough for you. Im afraid of disappointing you. Youre the most amazing person Ive ever known. Youre the only person Ive ever felt like I can really be myself with, even if I havent always done that. Youre so beautiful, I dont deserve you and I dont know how you could ever love someone like me. Im afraid of who Ive been. Im afraid of my past and how youd feel if you knew the things Ive done, the things Ive been through. Im afraid of everything right now. But most of all, Im afraid of a life without you next to me. The thought of losing you doesnt just make me afraid...it terrifies me. Without you here, part of me is missing. I need to be with you. Im just so afraid. Please dont think that Im shutting you out, thats not my intention. I still have you at arms length from me, not because I dont want you closer, but because Im afraid of holding you too tightly. Because once youre mine, I dont want you to be anyone elses ever again. Im trying to suppress these fears. Im trying to swallow it and just be myself again. Im playing it cool but I think its coming off as cold. I need to be warmer, but Im afraid Ill be too warm. I want to tell you everything. Instead, I tell you nothing. Im going to try to make it right the next time I see you. I have to. I think its time. The next two weeks will be torture. More silence. More suppressed feelings. More quiet insanity. More of settling for your sporadic texts instead of holding you and talking to you for hours. I love talking to you. I love the sound of your voice. I love your randomness. I love you. I cant be without you. I have to get over these stupid fears. "
737,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Enduring Remorse,9,80x7ht,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/80x7ht/enduring_remorse/,2018-03-01 03:15:54,"Hi there - I have wanted - not to ask for anything - but to tell you, meaningfully, that I am sorry. Ive written apologies to you before that werent credible. There were times I insulted you. There were times I was so consumed with grief I would have said literally anything to change your mind. There were times I brought other parties into the picture - over something that should have remained private. And I fired things off before allowing myself enough time or space - or the emotional work - to make sense of this chaos of conflicted feelings (maybe as if to say, here, you make sense of this, because I cannot). I have never ended a close friendship on the terms ours ended. It is tragic. it is heartbreaking. And it is so, so wrong. Hurting you was deeply destructive to my self, to my soul, to my spirit. There is nothing in my life Ive regretted more. There is nothing Im more ashamed of. Considered against what you gave to me, there is nothing I have known has been so enduringly sad. Ive wanted to tell you: For the times you were hurtful to me, there is nothing for you to be sorry for. I caused the suffering that contributed to your anger. The resentment I felt related to that was misplaced. Beneath every layer of grief and pain, Ive always known this.. And if I never get the chance to say it again, its important to me for you to hear it... This is not about missing you or longing for a romantic relationship that never should have happened (certainly, not under the circumstances in which it did). This is about how I hurt somebody who had loved me, and who I loved (as imperfectly as I did), and who was once so good to me. It is about what I cannot take back, but wish so badly that I could.. It is about how I got so far away from myself and hurt a dear, dear friend and how deeply I regret. I said terrible things to you that I never believed, and never meant, and I'm sorry for that. I am sorry for all the pain, the embarrassment, the fear of what boundaries I wasnt capable of crossing, and every other hurt I caused you, and the people you cared about. I violated your trust in so many ways. If anything I said or did made it the slightest bit harder to love or trust another person the way you once loved me, I am sorry. If what you took from all this was that your vulnerability was something other than a strength, that couldnt be any further from the truth. Im not sure what is real and what isnt - to what degree I (as deeply flawed as I was - and still am) loved you for who you aspired to be, or for the beautiful, exquisitely imperfect person I knew.. I'm not sure it makes much of a difference, really. The only thing I can be sure about, is the depth of how I felt about you as a friend, and in how meaningful you became to me as a person in my life. The deep intimacy of our letters and our conversations - not as lovers, but as one distant soul to another.... all the ways you articulated and loved me for my little idiosyncrasies that prior to then, I either hadnt noticed, or had seen, only as liabilities. The feeling of being known, of being understood and valued, for who I was, despite my own failures to live up to what I, myself, aspired to be. The hardest thing, always, was knowing what the end meant: It meant never. seeing. you. again. It meant knowing that your only presence in my life, going forward, would be your absence. It is a memory of loss, it is a memory of grief. And in the context of everything else that was happening in my life at the time, it was far, far beyond my ability to cope. I wish the expression of my grief would have been in a less destructive, less hurtful way. I wish i would have had it in me to have paused and taken the time to have seen the other choices for my own survival without the burning of bridges, and that I would have been mindful about what crossing even a single boundary of decency could lead to.. I wish Id understood how leaving S the way I did would have the consequences it would have on my sense of myself, the way it would shatter my sense of being worthy of trust, or of love (and on how I would project those feelings about myself onto you and onto others, the way I would constantly need reassurance to cope with this). The way it would wipe out so many of the easy meanings Id counted on in my life. The way all the self-hatred would affect my sense of the value of my own personal integrity, and cause such lasting harm to you and to other people.. And I wish that when it really mattered, I would have acknowledged the source of my pain.. my suffering was caused by me. Im mindful there are no meaningful excuses for any of this. And Im mindful that if I believed there were circumstances that would have or could have made my behavior acceptable, I would have let this all go a long time ago. I visited Bolivia over the holidays even though my preference was to leave it to memory. We made a lot of new memories - but there were flashes of old ones too: places seen, the familiar voice of a barking dog, the difficulty of catching my breath. Being back there made me think about the accident, the randomness of the people we meet in our lives as though, somehow there was a plan. the people we pass every day who we may never so much as notice, the magic of the connections we do make. The magic when something resonates in those moments. We ate breakfast on the first morning at the very same place where you approached me on the dusty, winding highway that ran through the little town where wed stopped. As I recall, we were waiting for our guides to get organized prior to boarding a bus. I had my back to the group, watching the traffic go by, and you came and you stood by me and we had our first conversation I know the Y I met on that roadside no longer exists. She helped me to see the reflection of my soul in the world around me the discovery of my artistic nature. The expression of my feelings, my hopes, and my dreams - when often, all we had was our writing - was a lesson in poetry, and that has always stayed with me. It is so much of who I am, a world that could have otherwise gone undiscovered. It is a way of seeing, and a way of being, and it is a gift and I am grateful. I loved the Y I knew.... I was inspired by her, I was changed by her. And I deeply, deeply regret hurting her. As strange as this may seem to you (~12 years later), you are one of the closest, most intimate friends Ive ever had and that is sacred to me. I value how we met. I value what you gave to me, I value who you are... I am glad I was able to share a moment with you in this life. And beneath everything, I will always grieve the loss of you as my friend. And I will grieve the message I sent that you were not loved, that our friendship had no meaning beyond what was telegraphed at the painful end. Youre too important a part of my life to think you didnt matter to me, that how i behaved in those moments represented how i felt and that, more than anything else, is what I want you to know. I cant prove it to you - I cant do anything to convince you of who or what may have been the real K or that theres anything more to this than a bunch of words on a page, but for what its worth, this is the greatest regret of my life. Youre an important part of who I am. its important to me to make amends to you, as best I can. Thats all. So please know, i dont hate you, I never hated you. I reacted mindlessly, on the whims of my pain. and if I never get the chance to say this again, i am sorry. From the center of my being and for as long as I live - I am sorry. I do not feel entitled to forgiveness or any reconciliation, I dont... And I am not expecting a response.. "

This letter is for me. I dont know that youre stalking my Reddit, but its been a hunch for a few days now. When you look at someone with rose-coloured glasses, all the red flags look just like... flags. I heard this quote recently, and despite not being a quote person, this really rang true for me. I had naught but rose colored glasses. They allowed me to love you as much as I loved myself. They allowed me to daydream about you, to fantasize about holding you when you were away, and to pine for you when I couldnt see you. They enabled me to want to be there for you. Yes, I know you never asked me to until that last time, but I was. That will never change, as much as you may distort that in your head. They allowed me to be vulnerable, foolish though I was in my vulnerability, I regret none of it. They allowed me to learn to love one person so much that I lost interest in all others, and indeed, even envisioned a future with her. They allowed me to be raw, to be real, to care without need for reciprocity, yet to still long for your validation. Time again you betrayed this trust, twisted it so that the fault was on me, and made me feel guilty for it. I imagine that if you are reading this, youre fairly incensed. So for your own sake, even if you are, stop. You betrayed my vulnerabilities, my most private and intimate lifestyle behaviors, and my insecurities. You shared these with others; both friends for whom I care and acquaintances for whom I dont, yet I was barely ready to have them shared with my one true love. Despite this, despite that you had full knowledge of this, despite the fact that I had specifically asked you not to, you did. You shared details of my sex life with the one if the men youd compare me to and my insecurities with a friend whom I had asked you not to. Accordingly, you would go on to lie to my face about this, and when confronted, turned it around on me. I imagine that the first thing you did when we ended things was to share those with him (albeit from your own twisted point of view). You lied to me. Repeatedly. By omission and otherwise, you lied to me. You told me that youd cut contact with your most toxic of friends after you had relapsed with him, I remember that night well, lying in the bottom bunk in the days before I built you a queen bed. You would later say that you never cut him off because I had never asked you too, that you needed him because he was the bedrock upon which your stability rested, because he had never wavered from your side whereas I had and would. You told me that this was about me having an issue with you having male friends. Ironically enough, you would come to manifest this nightmare of yours into a reality. I hope youre happy with him. Truly. I hope that when youre intimate and vulnerable with him, when you trust him enough to let him throw you around, when you relapse(d) and confide(d) within him, I hope that youre happy. I hope that the man who raped you remains the shining white knight in your head, lording over your denial. I hope that when he reaches out to you next, assuming you havent unblocked him already, you make sure that hes safe and that he doesnt drive while stoned. I pray that when you attempt to ostracize my friends from me you truly believe that youre successful, else-wise your own spite will drive you mad. Above all, I hope that when you think of me you truly truly believe that I lied to you and cheated on you intentionally and maliciously. How else will you cope with knowledge that what ended us wasnt my insecurities but my own self-worth. My determination that I no longer deserves to be treated like this. Thankfully, I have gained a lot from this relationship, and for that Ill always be grateful. The way I felt towards you is the way I hope someone once feels towards me. Ive been shown that I want someone who never compares me to anyone else as youd done with me. Ive been shown the value of vulnerability, and I hope to replicate that with someone whom I trust. Ive been taught lessons about honesty, love, devotion, and sincerity that I might never have learned. Thank you for that. The last time I stalked your social media profile I saw a picture posted in a costume I had seen you in once before. Curiously, that moment was liberation in itself. You may not understand this but thats ok. I hope you revel in your pettiness, deceit, revenge, and anger. And if that doesnt make you happy, I hope that someday you find something that does. Nevermore yours. -M. Edit/PS: If you are reading this, despite my asking you to have stopped, and are whitewashing all that youve done by remembering all the good that you had done. If youre making me out to be negating the truth and a liar, if youre making this out to be something other than what it is. There was good. There was tremendous good. Thats not what this is about."

I am so proud of you and who you've become since I met you when you were 17. It's unfair for me to be so possessive of you because I've only been consistently around in your life for the past two out of seven years, but you are my darling forever and I'll always be protective of you. I know you've been hurting. I wish I had it in me to not be so selfish and support you in the way you need to be supported, but there is just too much going on now. I am in a period of strange self-discovery, severe mental illness and easing childhood trauma. I simply don't have it in me to be the nurturing lover when I hurt, too. But truth be told, I hurt myself even more with all the nasty things I said when you saw the ugly defense mechanism I use in bouts of vulnerability come out. I left without a good word and this insane anxiety that I could not quell, not because you were flawed or dysfunctional. I'd never leave because of who you are. You're the most lovable person I've ever met and I hope you finally see that in yourself one day. If I could show you how terrifying the world is all around me and how it feels like the walls are slowly caving in on me, I'm sure you'd understand. My own mind is detrimental to me and I'm slowly becoming colder as the time goes on. It was never you. In fact, I think I'm doing the wise thing by trying to distance myself when all I seem to do is spew an unnecessary toxicity, even when it feels against my own will. I am a very, very bitter girl and I will need many months, if not years, of healing.. and that's even assuming that I'll be a case that gets better. You have added so much light into my life and because of my moments with you, I am a little bit less afraid of the world, but I still need to heal. You need to heal, too. You're a very brave, witty, wonderful man and I have no doubt that you'll find happiness. But like me, you really need to start looking for it in yourself. We both do. I don't know if you'd believe it if I said it at this point, but I love you forever and you mean the world to me. Thanks for helping me start to finally change my life when I needed it so badly, and I hope you continue to change yours too. We both deserve new, beautiful beginnings. If I could be by your side without the resentment and fear, I would. I just don't want to hurt you anymore."

Here's what you don't.,11,7sx73u,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/7sx73u/heres_what_i_know_heres_what_you_dont/,2018-01-26 03:23:29,"Here's what I know. I hope I'm wrong. I hope this is all a matter of perception. I hope that it's because I have become toxic. Full of pain and hatred and I can't see your value any longer. I hope that you meet someone and it just fucking works. I hope everything I'm about to send you in this e-mail is just my own sense of injustice, I hope the abuse I received was situational, circumstantial and entirely because of our environment. But I don't think that's the case. I think you have a darkness in you that creates these realities and you will continue to repeat them. It's all you've ever known. No one else can break this cycle for you. Instead. You will avoid that space of discomfort to resolve your own demands. Instead, you will push it on another to resolve on your behalf because you cannot break the cycle yourself. And instead. The cycle where you abuse your lovers will continue. When you need, want and would like to see me, I make myself available. I tell you when I hope to see you. When I want to see you. When I need to see you. But for you, you can live in the grey. You never must commit or plan to see me. I see you on a whim or when your plans otherwise suit you. It's 2018. To date, you have never seen me or planned to see me. I've seen or made plans to see you at a moments notice. Either you've had an availability or a window for me amongst others and could slot me in. But you constantly live in ambiguity and in the grey. I don't know if you realise it but you, by far, at the least dependable person I have in my life in this current moment. We made plans for Boxing Day. Thats been the first time I had plans with you in months that I confidently thought youd enjoy me. And we did, and being interrupted by others destroyed me. Thats why it ruined me that you left early that day. It was out of control, I couldnt handle it. The one time we had made plans and a genuine external influence meant you couldnt stay. I made it clear I wanted to spent Australia Day with you, Ive made it clear that I want to spend time with you but youre just so ambiguous. Youre grey. Youre not dependable. You always leave yourself an out for you and I to spend time together. But but you always seem to have plans with others before or after me. Where I just fit in at the last minute. I start to feel devalued and underappreciated and when Im starting to accept that reality. You will send me a screenshot of Bliss n Essos song Dopamine. The chemical on my wrist that represents you. Were outside of Press Club where weve been opening and crying next to each other. You tell me you love me twice, I hold you before you in your Uber and I see, feel and hear you melting into me. Again, Ill pulled back into your circle. Im love bombed yet again. And then I dont see you for weeks. Radio silence. Hot. Cold. But never temperate. There are days where we spend all day talking to you. There are days where your messages are sharp, distant and unemotive. Youre unapproachable. Its because X, its him again, its what hes doing, its what works doing. I just want consistency. I see it now. Im addicted to your love bombing again. I want to hear you say I love you again like outside of the Press Club. You got me hooked again. Im on the line, dangling, waiting for you to take a bite. You repeat phrases like, Why do I fall in love with those that dont prioritise me, he didnt before, why would he now? And push away those that love me genuinely?. I sit and dwell on this for days. I hope youre referring to me. I find hope again. I find hope. Christmas was not planned. Christmas day was an opportunity for you and I to share some quality time with one and other. I ripped myself open to make myself vulnerable and provide you a window of opportunity to find comfort in the place that I have always, since I met you, kept for you. We got drunk, had some fun, but for the most part you spent the day on your phone. Talking to others that were more comfortable for you to speak to than me. Perhaps thats fair, Ive been leaking a lot. I was growing tired of the emotional tears and weight of our conversations. I needed another dopamine hit. I needed to hear you say I love you again. And I'm bitter. So. Fucking. Bitter. That night. You show me your flesh. You share a bed with me. I hide in my own bedroom because I think this is what friendships do. They share a bed, I look at you wanting more. I sit there thinking of the frantic love making we had. But I don't act on it. I respect your boundaries and hope you make my dreams real. I hold you in your sleep. I want to feel you melt into me again, I want to feel you rock and sway your hips, I want to hear you say I love you again. I want to feel a connection. I want to feel cherished. I spent so long working on myself and making sure I can be a stronger person to help you with your trauma. In that space, I made sure I could commit to loving and caring for another person without making myself a martyr. I found a balance. I made my reserves bigger. More bountiful. But now I know. My net love can never exceed 49%. I will always keep 51% for myself. I thought, and still do, that this means I can be the best possible carer and lover for your specific, broken needs. Here's what I know. You won't find anyone that wants to help, love and cherish you like I do. It took you ruining me to make me realise I had a void and darkness that I had within me and must resolve. I worked on myself where my own dependency is not based on the love and affection of another. I chose to love another despite my own co-dependency. I made myself stronger. For myself, first. Secondly, for you. Thirdly, for another that would be lucky to have me. For another that I love and would move mountains and seas to care for. I did it so I could find a strength so in moments of despair, I could be depended upon by others. There's no other person in my world that I wanted to take advantage of that new-found strength, courage and fortitude than you. But I don't feel the same way any more you repeat. You don't need it now. You get your kicks elsewhere. You got it outside of the Press Club when you said I love you. I wanted to hear it again, I havent heard it since. But fuck I want to. I want to see you say it and believe the words and that this discomfort is equal parts you and I. You knew perfectly well what reaction that would bring out in me. It brought everything back. You pull me back in. The love bombing has started all over again. I don't think you'll find a lover that can be in a space with you and your trauma until he's learnt your ticks and tocks. Till they have made amends with themselves to ensure he has a concrete basis of vulnerability to let him find courage and strength. And there in that space, help you carry your own pain. But. What use are my own learnings when you cannot grow yourself? The narcissistic streak in you demands that you are the centre of attention. That you are the entire focus. That there is nothing else in the world more important. And I think you regularly receive this from those that are unfortunate enough to fall in love with you. But at a moments notice when you doubt this fucking desire and absolute, emphatic need to make you feel better about yourself. You discard the person you should keep close. You set about recreating the cycle that you hate the most. You go from abused, to the abuser. First. When you're overwhelmed with pain whether it be imaginary or real. You blame others. With no basis on their actions or intent. Your negative feelings are the responsibility of someone or a circumstantial, situational event. But as soon as that next person becomes the next, closest thing in your life. You turn the blame on him. You turn the blame on me. Your constant victim identity forces you to see your retaliations as being justified with whatever compensation you receive. You make the reality that you despise real. You persuade yourself that this new dependable love will fuck you over like you have been before. You recreate your trauma but with the tables and roles reversed. You are now the perpetrator. What do I do? I get dopamine tattooed on my wrist. I make it known that you are IT. That you are permanently etched on my skin because your love bombs make me feel fucking invincible. I see your expression. I see it hits home. I see that in that moment you believe nothing can come between us. And nothing does. Until you do. You then become resentful. A constant, overbearing, black cloud of unfairness that you perceive because you're not getting the help, consideration, praise, reward or affection that you believe you deserve. The truth is, the rest of us take the hits and blows and move on. But you inflict your misery and darkness on those that are closest to you as a maladaptive coping mechanism. You waste your emotions on dwelling on this perceived unfairness because I was 15 minutes late to an important dinner. You do it because you caught me in a trap of balancing honesty and fairness. You use that resentment as a definition of failure and inadequacy. You're so insensitive to the rights and perspective of others, I became the brunt of all your pain over time. We lived together for a period and I became diminished and hurt as I bore the brunt of your bleak emptiness. After this. You become entitled. You drive back from Bundaberg because you wanted to see me and because it didn't go exactly to your plans. You fucking ruin me. You 'believe' you deserve special treatment, you belittle, devalue and discard me when you get home. You think you can expect me to be available at your choosing. You say and behave in any way you choose as long as it hurts me because inflicting your perceived hurt, means finding fairness. Your myopic perspective demands compensation for your constant frustrations because 'It's so fucking hard being me'. You think I deserve to be hurt. Because your own pain is more important than my own. And you can't find balance unless I am hurting like you are. Again. And again. I agree. I became devalued. When I disagree. You abuse me. Your resentment, blame, and lack of introspection, your need to leave your unchallenged core behaviours and eventually lead you to think that the pain, discomfort and emptiness you feel makes you feel superior. You lie to yourself and you think your pain is equal to the efforts that you have made. You think your pain is because it reflects the energy you've put in and didnt see returned from me. You think the balance is unfair. You think there's no justice. That this is my fault and you put in all the effort till now and because of it, being an appalling human is entirely justified. Ignoring that it is so far from the fucking truth that you live in a delusion that you can only see. An injustice that you trust and believe. That you want to believe. Its easier to blame others. This absolute misery is a moment you never recover from. Not until it's all gone. It's all lost. You reach rock bottom. You've lost everything. Then you invite me back in, and the love bombing starts again. It starts again from a place where it's not possible to lose anything else. You have nothing else to love. So, you start to love me again. Your hierarchal self-esteem demands that someone else is meant to feel as devalued as you think the third party sees you. Completely ignoring that this reality is not reflected in any way shape or form by my efforts to appease you. Next comes the pettiness, hypocrisy and contradictions. I'm too busy reading your body language and catering for your inflamed ego. We go for wings at dinner. I don't ask 'how're you?'. You ask me how I feel knowing you made it clear I am not invited to our romantic holiday to the wine regions of Adelaide. I swallow the pain and darkness in me. I don't want you to know just how fucking hurt I am that you've told me not to join you on my own fucking holiday. You throw it in my face. You storm off and go to your car like a toddler that's lost your fucking favourite teddy. You then go to Adelaide without me and artificially create a fucking disaster between you and I. You create conflict. You create a fucking war zone where I didn't think I could feel worse. I have no visibility of what you are feeling and thinking but I'm meant to cop your anger and hatred for weeks and I honestly believe I deserve it because I wasn't careful, soft or kind enough with your needs. After it all, I justify your abuse, your negging, your devaluations, your hatred and lack of compassion and justify that it was your circumstances. That it was because I deserved it. believe I do not deserve our holiday. But you do. I believe you deserved to have that break to yourself without me there because I am such a fucking horrible man. Two weeks later you tell me the reason why you were acting like a fucking dragon and like a fool. I accept that your circumstances and anger in that moment were circumstantial. That it was entirely because of situations out of your control. I blame Chris. I believe you. I blame everyone else for your vitriol except for you. I don't hold you accountable. At the end of it. It's like everything I ever did for you did not matter. I was criticised and diminished for the smallest of infractions whether real or imagined. All the credits to show you I was worth your warmth and love. All that time and love I spent building mattered not at all. I was worthless in your eyes. I was a barnacle that could be relied to be there, but I offered no sustenance in your eyes. I offered no warmth. I offered no love. You thought I offered nothing but pain. Despite everything I ever and would continue giving. Next? Jealousy. You're jealous of my friendships. Your jealous of those that I can depend upon when I need it. Your jealous I have support groups from the pits that you put me in. Those friends of mine are always there. You do not have the same dependencies. You're jealous of my Matt, my adrenaline. You're jealous of Welsh Matt. You're jealous of Stephen and Sarah, my serotonin. You dont see it but, I wanted you to have them too. And they would have accepted you. If they honestly believed I had forgiven you and that you could care for me. You're jealous that I have so many escapes to recover to from the pain you push on me. Whereas you. You sit in your own misery and find distractions with other men that come and go out of your life. You find affections in strangers to make up for your own loathing. You're jealous that I can accept my pain and not blame others for it. There's still so many people that want to put themselves in a position that allows them to help me. You don't know what this looks like because you push everyone away. You make it their fault. You make it their fucking burden to bare. I accept my burdens. They are mine. No one elses. But my friends give me backbone when my own falters. I offered you the same. I continued offering you the same until you broke me. Next. After all of this. On the next crash and love bombing session you rush. You start talking families. You start telling me 'I'm the best person to be the father of your kids because you can make up for my own failures'. You make me feel like a King on a Hill because I can make up for your own cracks. We start talking engagement, marriage and ceremonies. We start shopping for rings. My need to find dopamine highs were so much more important than the need to find a steady, growing relationship. You become the tattoo on my wrist that's became a reminder that I can't fix others. Two weeks later you break up with me. And the next day after we break up, after a fortnight of shopping for rings, talking weddings and spending Christmas with your family. You break up with me on Boxing Day. The next day you're in bed with another man. What do I think? I think this is okay because 'technically' you broke up with me. You're single. You can do what you want. Ignoring that this home I'm meant to occupy with you is now being shared with another fucking man while I hide, cower, hide and heal in my friends huge, lonely house. By myself. On Boxing Day. Desperate to find a place to myself because you remind me of everything I have given, you remind me of everything you have taken, you remind of everything I've lost. This is what I know. I deserve love. I deserve compassion. I deserve warmth. And you don't deserve me. This e-mail is the start of my third attempt to go no contact. This email, this e-mail is the start of the end. I will fill the void that you left. And when I've recovered from the darkness that I've inherited. I will love again. And she will deserve it. "

Better to retreat into safety than take a leap, right? Vulnerability is too scary for you. Honesty just a bit too real. You're incapable of either. We joked about me wearing your ring, but thank fuck I don't. I can't imagine what a shitshow being married to you would be.

It was like day and night. I blinked and I missed it. All I know is that the moment I told you I was ready and in too, you left. It's like you were stringing me along to that very moment of vulnerability, to let go once we arrived. Why? Revenge? Or maybe if you stick the knife in deep enough I'll stay away for good? Or just the thrill of knowing you can control and manipulate. So I cry my silent tears in the dark and ask myself, was it a dream or was it a lie? What do I believe?

Probably not, because in the end I was just some weird fucking rebound you used to get out of your shitty hometown. You're a bad liar. You say I don't love you, but you never loved me. Don't try to now. The worst mistake I made was kissing you that night. It exposed a vulnerability within me and I'm paying for it now. You were the person I was trying to avoid in my life. I've had older men who are narcissists hurt me less than you did. You can say you tried as hard as you could, but I know you lied to me that one night. You know you did, too. That's all you had to do for it to end like this. I don't play games, and I certainly don't mess with boys who have their hearts in the wrong places. -S (since apparently that's what you like to go by now)"

(vulnerability is not my forte.) im mad because youre nice to me for no reason. im mad because i have trust and commitment issues, and you make me fear that im somehow going to fuck up the good that we have right now. im mad because i dont know if im just lonely and solitude is pushing me towards the first receptive person that comes around or if i actually, genuinely fuck. what if i like you? [thats why im mad.] [because i like you.] [if you couldnt tell.] because the sound of my phone notification makes my heart jump a bit at the possibility of it being you. because i feel safer with you holding me, complimenting me(even though i pretend to hate it), letting me lean on your shoulder. because you dont judge me. because i have dreams about you every night. and because youre fucking up my view of myself. im mad because i dont know what your motivation is. all i know is that i wanna hug you and be with you all the time. fuck. fuck you. im pissed that i like your music suggestions and dumb humor and nerdiness and patience and how you always know when to be gentle and when to be rough. i dont wanna admit that i like you. or how much i just wanna do stupid shit like sit on park benches and watch dogs or cook together or spend all day in bed doing nothing but exist at the same time and place for a little while. forgive me; this is new for me. my whole being is fighting against this, because it contradicts everything i thought i believed about people and relationships and the possibility of love not being complete bullshit. i dont want to hurt you. most urgently, i dont want to hurt myself: my default defense is to barricade myself and sever emotion until i convince myself that im invincible to petty human attachments. im confused because youre someone that makes me want to try and unravel the fortress of myself. im suspicious that you give me the space and time to do that. why me? im so scared that ill disappoint you down the line. im worried that im not worth your investment. im mad, uncomfortable, frightened but god, im happy. you make me so happy. and im gonna chase that as far as it will take me. take us. as sincere as ill let myself be, La Insane "
748,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,I took a moment from my day,28,7x4iyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/7x4iyg/i_took_a_moment_from_my_day/,2018-02-13 09:15:11," Hi there - I have wanted to tell you in a meaningful way that I am sorry... Ive written apologies to you before that werent credible. There were times I insulted you. There were times I was so consumed with grief I would have said literally anything to change your mind. There were times I brought other parties into the picture - cluelessly - and antagonized you. I fired things off before allowing myself enough time or space - or the necessary work - to make sense of this chaos of conflicted feelings (maybe as if to say,here, you make sense of this, because I cannot). And I boasted of the wonderful things Id done a way of protecting myself, and fantasizing the good things Id been associated with would somehow mitigate so much hurt - they dont, they never did. I have never ended a close friendship on the terms ours ended. Hurting you was deeply destructive to my self, to my soul, to my spirit. There is nothing in my life Ive regretted more. There is nothing Im more ashamed of. There is no greater sorrow. There is no greater sadness. Ive wanted to tell you: For the times you were hurtful to me, there is nothing for you to be sorry for. I caused the suffering that contributed to your anger. The resentment I felt related to that was misplaced. Beneath every layer of grief and pain, Ive always known this.. And if I never get the chance to say this again, its important to me for you to hear this... This is not about missing you or longing for a romantic relationship that wasnt going anywhere, that never should have happened (certainly, not under the circumstances in which it did). This is about how I hurt somebody who had loved me, and who I loved and who was once so good to me. It is about what I cannot take back, but wish so badly that I could.. It is about how I got so far away from myself and hurt a dear, dear friend, and how deeply I regret. I said terrible things to you that I never believed, and never meant, and I'm sorry for that. I am sorry for all the pain, the embarrassment, the fear of what boundaries I wasnt capable of crossing, and every other hurt I caused you, and the people you cared about. I violated your trust in so many ways. If anything I said or did made it the slightest bit harder to love or trust another person the way you once loved me, I am sorry. If what you took from all this was that your vulnerability was something other than a strength, that couldnt be any further from the truth. Im not sure what is real and what isnt - to what degree I loved you for who you were, or for the person I may have conjured in my mind - Im not sure it makes much of a difference really.. The only truth that holds is the depth of how I felt about you as a friend, and in how meaningful you were to me as a person in my life. The deep intimacy of our letters and our conversations - not as lovers, but as one distant soul to another.... all the ways you articulated and appreciated my little idiosyncrasies that prior to then, I either hadnt noticed, or had seen, only as liabilities (J, youre such a girl). The feeling of being known - of being understood and appreciated,for who I was. The hardest thing, always, was knowing what the end meant: It meant never seeing you again in this life. It was knowing that your only presence, going forward, would be your absence. It is a memory of loss, it is a memory of grief. And in the context of everything else that was happening in my life at the time, it was far, far beyond my ability to cope. I wish the expression of my grief would have been in a less destructive, less hurtful way. I wish i would have had it in me to have paused and taken the time to have seen the other choices for my own survival without the burning of bridges and that I would have been mindful about what crossing even a single boundary of decency could lead to.. I wish Id understood how leaving X the way I did would have the consequences it would have on my sense of myself, the way it would shatter my sense of being worthy of trust, or of love (and on how I would project those feelings about myself onto others). The way all the self-hatred would affect my sense of the value of my own personal integrity, And I wish, when it really mattered, I would have acknowledged the source of my pain.. my suffering was caused by me. Im mindful there are no meaningful excuses. And Im mindful that if I believed there were circumstances that would have or could have made my behavior acceptable, I would have let this all go a long time ago. I visited the place where we met so many years ago in December even though my preference was to leave it to memory. I was there with my family. We ate breakfast on the first morning at the very same place where you approached me on the dusty, winding highway that ran through the little town where wed stopped. As I recall, we were waiting for our guides to get organized prior to boarding a bus. I had my back to the group, watching the traffic go by, and you came and stood by me and we had our first conversation I know the Y I met on that roadside no longer exists. She helped me to see the reflection of my soul in the world around me the discovery of my artistic nature. The expression of my feelings, my hopes, and my dreams - when often, all we had was our writing - was a lesson in poetry, and that has always stayed with me. It is so much of who I am, a world that could have otherwise gone undiscovered. It is a way of seeing, and a way of being, and it is a gift and I am grateful. I loved the Y I knew I was inspired by her, I was changed by her. And I deeply, deeply regret hurting her. Years ago N told me you had children and you had a good life (we havent communicated in years. she gave me no details, and Im sure she would attest that I never asked.). I am happy for you. Theres an old lady I see a few times a week in little nhood store where I often get my paper. Every time I leave the shop she says to me, Have a blessed and a beautiful day, my baby. Its grown on me - Im not sure why it has, but it has. Occasionally, shell mix it up and say something different. Sometimes, shell call me my darling instead of my baby. Sometimes, but only rarely, shell just wish me a wonderful day and it makes me feel a little empty Anyway, my wish for you is the wish this beautiful old soul gives me most of the time: Have a blessed and a beautiful life.. My life is richer for having known you. Please know i dont hate you, I never hated you. I reacted mindlessly, on the whims of my pain, and if I never get the chance to say this again, i am sorry. From the center of my being and for as long as I live - I am sorry. I dont feel entitled to forgiveness or any reconciliation... And I am not looking for a response. "

Health is something that so many people take for granted, until they lose it. I wish for you to be healthy, both in mind and body. I wish that you will open your mind a little, maybe try something that you've never considered before, like acupuncture, drinking fresh squeezed juices instead of the cocktails you sip at night, scented soy candles with frankincense, yoga instead of basketball. I wish you will one day understand that it is the complexity of your mind, with all its intricate patterns, connections and accumulated experiences, that makes you so captivating. I wish that you won't compare yourself to other men, those square jawed blond Marlboro types you saw in magazines when you were a kid, whom you wanted to be like, because they don't compare to you. I wish that you will see that you are not old, but the perfect age, a man who has finally come into his own, with a bit of grey, and perhaps more cautious than his younger self, but a man who has seen the best and worst of humanity, and still retains his ability to love without boundaries. I wish that you will know that it is not your public voice, the flawless persona you put onto the world, but your private voice, the one full of vulnerability, paradoxes and self-doubt that has the power to stir people's souls. The kind of voice that people imagine listening to at night, telling bedtime stories, or reading from a passage in a favorite book, or a story about what you used to be like as a young man, just before drifting off to sleep. I wish that you will see that the shifting loyalties of the people around you is not the way all people are. I wish that you will find peace, love and friendship. "
750,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Letter to a lizard,9,7m5epb,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/7m5epb/letter_to_a_lizard/,2017-12-26 14:24:17,"I read somewhere that I should write you a letter, without sending it, detailing how I feel. I figured this could be therapeutic as it allows me to be honest without the added pressure honesty typically awards. Im not really sure where to start. I feel like Ive pieced this story together so many times that I have nothing novel to report, but then I am reminded that this is intended for you and most of this would be novel for you. Perhaps I should start with why some of this may be news to you. Its not as if I deliberately tried to keep things from you, I guess I just become discouraged over time about being honest with you as a result of your reactions. Firstly, youre incredibly defensive. You like to preach about love without judgement and learning from each other but if I say something remotely critical, you treat it like a personal attack rather than guidance driven by love. Secondly, and possibly related to the first, you dont seem to really hear what I am saying when I do speak. You are always distracted and noticeably impatient, lending to the idea that I am irritating you and (worse) wasting your time. I think its safe to say that my confidence in speaking truthfully has degenerated as a result. Its not all your fault though. A big part of why I stopped openly communicating with you is due to the fact that I was in love with you. It seems odd to spell it out like that (since loving someone should be cause for more communication, more trust) but thats essentially what it boils down to. As I came to realize that my love was unrequited and that I was chasing a dead dream, I became more detached from you, convincing myself it was easier to get over my woes in silence and not have to burden you with the things you had no interest in. Then came the paranoia, characterised largely by an obsession for validation. I foretold the saga with that woman not because I willed the idea into being, but because I deliberately focused my (existing) observational prowess on you. The fact that you insist it happened because it was meant to be' releases you from taking any responsibility for your actions and also of having to weather the repercussions. That is, quite frankly, one of the most insulting things you could have done to me, as a friend, as a roommate, as someone that slept in my bed for almost a year. You acted like it didnt matter, like it was just some fun you were having which you probably figured you deserved and it didnt last long anyway so how could it matter in the long run? We were, according to you, bigger than that. But if we truly were bigger than that, wouldnt you have taken the time to make sure I was okay with you cuddling her on the leather couch that my mother gave me (which, incidentally, you didnt help to retrieve), or fucking her on the bed we had shared for months? When Ive asked you this question you defend your actions by declaring that we werent talking at the time and I was being bitchy. This is all true. But when you ask me the same question every day only to get the same unsatisfactory response, shouldnt that be an indication that a new question is in order? Id think so. I was deliberately using that response (fine) to see if it would elicit actual effort from you, not the cookie cutter greeting you apply to your customers because you are one hell of a salesman. I know now that you felt like you were applying all the effort where I was applying none and while that is also true (to an extent) I was in a very dark place and I needed you to show me that you cared and all I can seem to remember from that time period is how you garnered time out of your busy schedule to spend with her while I got the short end of your attention stick. Jealousy has consumed me ever since. Its weird and the timing is so completely fucking off because Im in a place now where Im trying to hone my identity and focus on myself and garner the kind of love that isnt controlling or needy or obtuse. But Im in this state of limbo because my feelings for you are still incredibly strong and they were formed in a different part of my life, of my personal journey. So Im tethering on the edge here, trying to figure out where to place you in my new identity whilst dealing with the emotions that were borne out of my old one. I wish I could say that enlightenment was a catalyst for me but I seem to be walking this tightrope rather effectively. I did a lot of things I am not proud of, a lot of things that have required re-evaluating my moral compass. I have checked your texts/IMs on several different occasions. I have perused both your laptop and your phone for pictures. I also read your journal. The enormity of what Ive done is only just beginning to hit home as I read it aloud and I can only imagine how much spiritual penance I will need to do for this, but heres what Ive gathered: from your journals I get that you never seemed to respect the women you were romantically involved with (even those you claim to love still). Granted, much of what you wrote was based in high school and I can only empathise with such a hormonal onslaught, but it gave me an insight into how superficial you treated your relationships even back then. From your texts I discovered that you lied to me about keeping in contact with her and that you seemed friendly with her even though you told me she turned into a bitch and you are no longer friends. These cracks in your story could be explained by you wanting to keep the peace, but it still undermines what I was supposed to mean to you by entirely disregarding the truth clause of our unorthodox friendship. The pictures were the most daunting, they opened my eyes to what I should have known all along, to what youve been saying all along - you are a single male in your mid twenties with a keen appreciation for women with lithe bodies and you have nothing limiting you from sharing your appreciation, especially me. It was after I stumbled upon some semi-nude selfies that I came across one picture Ive since convinced myself you were the photographer for and her lace-clad ass was the subject. I could be wrong, but creating the backstory for that photo is helping me to ween myself off of you. I get sad when I read this all back to myself, its a testament to how I have forgone my personal autonomy for a love that only ever flourishes in measured bursts and almost always from one direction. It wasnt enough that you lied to me and then humiliated me in my own home by parading her around. It apparently also wasnt enough that you likened me to your best friend from Washington whom I later found out you didnt want to pursue because you didnt want to ruin the friendship (a thought that initially flattered me but has since taunted me about how I was pursued, and then betrayed). It wasnt enough that I discovered, by your own hand, that you treat sex casually and women as having a singular purpose. It still wasnt enough when you explicitly laughed at me for revealing my feelings and then proceeded to excuse everything you had done to cause my tears as being part of some greater cosmic plan. It wasnt enough that you took advantage of my vulnerability after I had chosen to let my anger go and started conversing with you again; coaxing me into your bed and then back into your web of deceit. It wasnt enough that you whispered to me about how I am your favourite and how you love sleeping with me, probably within 10 minutes of taking inappropriate snapshots of a young mothers FB feed. It wasnt enough that you proffered open communication to ensure the strength of our bond and then omitted that which was (always by your own intuit) a circumstantial interference. It wasnt enough that you continued to tell me you didnt love me in that way, that its not a head-over-heels thing, more of a sister thing so it kind of feels wrong, that you like what we have and you dont want to change it. It wasnt enough that sex with me was only ever an option when you deemed it thus and dare I attempt to initiate it, youd groan about being dirty or hot, another red flag illuminating the basic premise: Im not the kind of girl youre looking for, but right now Im the only one thats available. I hadnt had enough yet. Id convinced myself so many times that this was okay, that I could somehow sift through the bullshit and stomach the pain because, after all, getting some of you was better than nothing at all. But its not okay. Im not okay. Im happy because I choose to be, because I dont want to think about the alternative. But loving you has turned me into the most vile version of myself and I cannot do it anymore, I cannot allow you to syphon any more of my integrity, of my soul. The letter that I will never send and the irony is that, even if I did, youd get distracted and lose interest within the first few sentences. So I guess, in a way, this letter is symbolic of our friendship. All that which I could never say meets all that which got overlooked and undervalued, lost to the wind: a mere murmur in the trees. "

You felt rejected by your own parents, forced to act like a man far too soon, choked up with toxic masculinity and hating your own vulnerability. I think falling in love just made everything far worse. You fell quick and I didn't, I felt bad for not being able to reciprocate that first 'I love you' but everything went wrong as soon as I did. I panicked, I got scared and I think deep down I knew what we had wasn't going to help either of us but the intensity with which I loved you was utterly, utterly terrifying. Everything I'd worked for went flying out the window when I fell in love with you. I couldn't eat, couldn't breathe, couldn't think unless you were with me. I cried constantly, screamed at you at times, suffocated the both of us, I expected so much of you - too much. I was very ill and it's taken me years of professional and self help to get better - I'm so proud of myself for that but I appreciate that bring with me was exhausting and unhealthy. I'm sorry for that, truly. But that doesn't excuse anything you did to me. I knew something wasn't right but I couldn't figure it out. You gaslighted the shit out of me and it was terrifying. You belittled me, humiliated me, scared me, made me feel worthless and somehow the best thing all at once. All I wanted was to be with you, I think you did too, but deep down we both knew it wasn't going to work. You did apologise, I'll give you that. You admitted you hurt me so you could feel powerful. When I finally had the strength to walk away for the last time I cannot tell you how relieved I felt. I changed my life for the better and now I get to spend every day with the love of my life. I wish you the absolute best :) "
752,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,11 years of regret. Please forgive me.,10,7p1q4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/7p1q4w/11_years_of_regret_please_forgive_me/,2018-01-09 08:08:01,"Hi there - Please dont get angry at this or scared Im going to say something awful. Just go to a quiet place and read this when you get a chance and know its from me to you and to nobody else, and that its about how sorry I am. And if you have the urge to forward to K as you did the last time, please skip to the PS at the bottom (note, K and I are fine we love each other and our children and all of us are happy as a family and for the benefit of everyone involved, Id like to keep it that way). I was just in Cusco with my family for the holidays. We took the kids to Peru - and hiked the Inca trail.. I was reluctant to come back here, but its what K wanted to do and there wasnt any good reason for saying no... People in the office of our tour operator had told me young children would be fine on the trail (I couldnt remember many details of any rigors of the actual hike to say so one way or the other, so I guess it never occured to me to question their judgement). On the morning of the trip however, our guides said theyd only had one 5yro before (and according to them, he was carried by a porter) - and we both looked at Madeleine (5), who was carrying her own backpack, and wondered if this was going to be the childhood event our little girl would think of first when compiling the list of how her parents had failed her in life ;-). In the end, everything turned out ok (other than a few tears and times when I had to carry her, football style, over the cruxes of some of the steeper climbs). it was gratifying to see how 7yro L supported his sister.. also a reminder as a parent of how much my instinct to protect them can get in the way of who theyll become, how they need to be the ones to determine their own limitations and possibilities. We made a lot of new memories - I like to imagine places through the eyes of L and P. Before this trip if you asked L what his favorite place was he surely would have told you it was southern Utah - because of times weve spent backpacking and exploring the canyons there.. but Cusco and the sacred valley left a big impression on both of them, so maybe thats changed.... There were flashes for me of old memories too.. being back here made me think, as I often do, about the accident, the randomness of the people we meet in our lives as though, somehow there was a plan. I saw a classic movie a few weeks ago (Kielslowskis Red - such a beautiful film) that kind of touches on this - the people we pass every day who we may never so much as notice, the magic of the connections we do make. The magic when something resonates in those moments. We ate breakfast the first day of our trek at the very same place where you approached me on the dusty, winding highway that ran through the little town where wed stopped. As I recall, we were waiting for the tour guides to get organized prior to boarding the bus (or something). I had my back to the group, watching the traffic go by, and you came and stood by me and we had our first conversation. Your genuineness - your light - that particular brand of light was apparent to me even then. We climbed Huayna Picchu and I took a picture of K and P and L smiling down at me in a spot where i later realized Id taken a photo of you and some other folks.. I was happy to see the hostel where B and I had stayed (our last trip together) was still there, under the same name.. These ruins are a place for ghosts. More than anything else, it underscored how much I want, I hope to someday reconcile and have peace with you in this life. Ive written apologies to you that werent credible. There were times I insulted you. There were times I was so consumed with loneliness and grief I would have said literally anything to change your mind (there is no doubt it showed). I fired things off before allowing myself enough time or space to properly reflect on the trail Id left behind. And I boasted of the wonderful things Id done in Puerto Rico a way of protecting myself, and fantasizing the few good things Id been associated with would somehow mitigate the past that we shared. My behavior haunts me. Its not about missing you or longing for a relationship that was doomed.. its about how I hurt somebody, anybody, but especially somebody who I loved and who was once *so good to me*. How in a moment of a deep emotional crisis, I hurt a dear friend. This may seem strange to you, or especially to someone outsider who knew nothing about how our lives intersected, but (for me) given what I did and given what your friendship meant to me, in many ways, it seems *natural* to have agonized over this for so long. I turned the love of this person who was once my closest, most important friend into hatred. I made you question whether youd ever really known me at all. What could be more wrong than that? There is nothing in my life Ive regretted more. There is nothing Im more ashamed of. I said terrible things to you that I never believed, and never meant, and I'm sorry for that. I turned what should have been good memories into something toxic, and Im sorry for that. I am sorry for all the pain, the embarrassment, the fear (of what boundaries I wasnt capable of crossing next) and everything else I caused you, and the people you cared about. I violated your trust in so many ways. Once I started doing these things, I couldnt undo them - so I just kept doing them - and I deeply regret that. If anything I said or did made it the slightest bit harder to love or trust another person the way you loved me, I am sorry. If what you took from all this was that your vulnerability was something other than a strength, that couldnt be any further from the truth. When Im reminded of the things I did to hurt you, I feel it physically, in my chest, in my stomach. How hard - still - it can be to breathe. How hard it can be not to turn inward, to not collapse upon myself. I don't treat friends *or anyone* that way - I *never* have - and I am ashamed of what I did to hurt you. It never. should. have. happened. Im not sure what is real and what isnt - to what degree I loved you for who you were, or for the person I may have conjured in my mind. I'm not sure it makes much of a difference, really. The only thing I can be sure about, is the depth of how I felt, and in how real and profound it was to me. The image of you crying the first time I left Vancouver, the way you touched me, the way you looked at me, the deep intimacy of our conversations, all the ways you articulated and appreciated my little idiosyncrasies that prior to then, I either hadnt noticed, or had only seen as liabilities (F, youre such a girl). The fierceness of who you were. The way being with you helped me to discover my creativity, the way art became a language (one I've embraced again after many years of neglect). The way romance (or whatever it was) was always secondary to the friendship which came first. The intimacy of our conversations and the feeling of being understood and appreciated - for who I really was (the most intimate me) - for the first time. The hardest thing when it ended was knowing that losing you meant never. seeing. you. again. It was devastating. It was so much easier for you to get past that and move on - I wish it had been so for me. It never would have been an easy loss if we both lived in the same place or if I hadnt kept my distance from the people who cared about me and been left utterly alone, but I was overwhelmed by the grief of knowing you would be *entirely* absent from my life, going forward. By knowing the nature of our relationship meant there would not be room for me or for you in each others lives. In a lot of ways, it seemed more like a death than the end of a typical relationship - for me anyway. Why should integrity have meant shit in the face of such an overwhelming sense of grief? It means nothing for its own sake. It is meaningful only to the degree it keeps us from harming other people and makes it harder for us to live with ourselves. This is what I know. I know, if it was to have happened again, a part of me would go crazy with grief, over, and over, and over again. I just wish its expression could have been in a less destructive, less shameful, a less hurtful way. I wish, at the time, I could have seen a future for myself (if I have gained any insight through this, it's that impulse control is a lot more relevant for people who believe in a future - not stuck in some moment of devastating loss). I was so angry at the abandonment I felt - the suddenness of the revelation you were with someone else (I guess I shouldnt have had to wait for you to announce we were over). I should have been prepared for that. I wish I could have simply let go - and been only grateful, for all the things I had been given your patience and your tolerance of my emotional self absorption which went so far beyond what anybody should have reasonably put up with. I wish I could have accepted reality without burning bridges to somehow derail or destroy my sense of hope.. to have known what crossing even a single boundary of decency could lead to.. And I wish Id understood that the half-life of my behavior would have been so much longer, so much worse than the experience of the loss itself. And maybe most of all, I wish Id known how leaving B the way I did would have the consequences it had on my sense of myself, the way it tore at my sense of being someone worthy of any trust or love. The way it destroyed my sense of self worth. I wish I could have had the self awareness at the time to have admitted I needed time on my own for healing and not prolonged your unhappiness.. and hard feelings towards me. And I wish Id known how punishing myself for what I did to B would have such effects on you and the other people around me (isolating myself the way I did was so destructive, and it made me so much more vulnerable, so much more dependent on you when you needed support from me.. support that I wasnt in a position to give). I took and I took and I never stopped to see all I was given. I regret that you suffered because of me. There were the times you made comments that were cutting and hurtful. Anybody would have been frustrated with what I put you through. It's not that they didn't hurt or that they didn't have an effect... but mostly, I understood where it was coming from and that's all that matters. You have nothing to be sorry for. I say all this and Im mindful there are no meaningful excuses. I say all this and Im mindful that if I believed there were circumstances that would have or could have made my behavior acceptable, I would have forgiven myself and let this all go a long time ago. I cant, I wont. Years ago, V told me, vaguely that you were married and had children. She told me you had a good life, and Im glad for that. (beyond that, she told me nothing - and I never asked). BTW, no, we do not communicate - It has been a very long time since Ive communicated with anyone in your life. I have a good life. K is kind and patient with me and seems to tolerate the near constant state of my head wandering in the clouds (which seems to have infected L). L and P are our world. I dont expect a response You are entitled to your anger with me.. and your skepticism of anything I say. I just want you to know i dont hate you, I never hated you. And I am desperately sorry for how I hurt you. I am appalled at the person I became after our friendship ended. Hurting you was deeply destructive to my self, to my soul, to my spirit and in a lot of ways, I have never completely healed from that. You know, after things ended between us, I went to visit B. We hardly fought during our marriage or the process of our divorce but there were a lot of hard feelings on both sides. I went to visit her under the pretense of seeing the dog (thats what I told myself). It was emotional for both of us. I told her everything. I held the dog and she held me; we held each other. We spent some time together over the next few months before I left and we put the past behind us. We went backpacking, we went climbing - we put our lives in each others hands again. On the eve before I moved away, I spent the night with her, with the dog between us.. we talked pretty frequently after I moved.. maybe once a week for a while. Shes remarried to a great guy now.. shes happy and Im happy for her and we talk less and less every year. In the end, Im glad to know shes always there.. that were always there for each other. Im glad we feel goodwill towards each other. Im glad were at peace with each other, that were reconciled with each other Im glad we came to a peace that honored the roles we played in each others lives. Thats what I hope for with you. I hope for peace and reconciliation. More than anything, with respect to you and the past, I want peace in me, and with respect to me, I hope for peace in you. Not a peace where we routinely talk on the phone or become friends in social media, or whatever else (I will never overwhelm you with communication, and I promise you I will never again intentionally act to hurt you regardless of whether you were to open yourself to me or not). Peace doesnt necessarily mean we forget the things that happened that caused so much suffering, but that we recognize each others humanity, and validate the pain we experienced when our lives intersected so long ago, forgive and (however modestly) reconcile with each other in a way that heals us both. I hope for peace and reconciliation because life is short and I dont want to waste a single moment of a single day being burdened by feeling negative about you or about our past anymore. I hope for peace because it allows me to hope that the world can be better for our children - because if we - me and you - cant be willing to solve our problems and rediscover our humanity, then how can we hope for strangers to do so? I hope for peace because I dont want to wait until Im about to take my dying breath and regret that I gave up on something so important to me, worried too much about what other people may have thought (how ridiculous it is that he reaches out to her 10+ years later), or that I simply wasnt willing to try. I understand how the pain I caused can be so difficult to forgive - and how risky it can be to reconcile given the considerations of your partner and for your children and not wanting to expose them to somebody who has proven capable of causing so much pain in your life and to the people around you. But if we can reconcile with each other, it can heal us both and transform how we approach others in our lives, how we interact with the world. And it can go beyond me and you. People have told me not to reach out to you - that appealing to forgiveness or reconciliation is a lost cause. Ive come to think of that as a symptom of a prevailing notion that we have to build walls which is why our world is so fucked up. It is ok if you dont have it in you to open yourself to me again - today, tomorrow, or next year or in 18 years time. I havent judged you, and will never judge you for an inability to trust me, or unwillingness to forgive.. or for the degree of any forgiveness. I dont feel entitled to anything. But I wont stop hoping. And I will always be open. For all of my weaknesses, for all of my flaws, thats what I want. Im not going to harass you - I think Ive said about all there is to say about the past... But peace and reconciliation are what I hope for. And I hope someday - in your heart - this is something youll want too. I deeply, deeply care. I regret. And I am more sorry than these words can ever convey. "

Do you know thats a rarity? Thats what you and me felt like. But you hold yourself back, out of fear, stubbornness, or the inability to be anything but coy. Who knows really. I hate myself a little for pining for you so hard. Hate myself for wondering how I am falling short of reaching deeper within you to find out what your real intentions are. And so Im left to my paranoia that scratches and burns inside my mind and tells me about everything that Im not, and I am forgetting about how truly great I am. Thats how it happens I suppose; when someone rejects us, we take it as a sign that our shortcomings are just too massive for us to be loved and wanted. While deep down, I should really be faulting you. Well some part of me does. The angry part of me does. Because you asked, Ive opened up all these boxes of pain and vulnerability that were kept tucked away in hiding for so long that having to now relive them again makes the pain surface and as fresh as the day they happened. It was so easy with you. You should feel lucky to have heard my story but I dont think you have a clue that so rarely do I divulge any detail. You take that for granted. And now I fear that I will need a new box for you. "

Ive never really felt this exact way about anyone. I know that Im falling for you, but not in the lovesick-teenager way that I always have in the past. I feel this connection to you that seems so much more meaningful, so much more real. I dont know what love is. I dont really know if Ive truly felt it in the past, or if Im feeling it now. Maybe this is love. Who am I to know. What I do know is that I love the feeling of you pressed up against me in bed at night. The feeling of your arms wrapped around me as you drift asleep. I love when you kiss me on the forehead or take my hand. I love when you poke fun at me and bring me weird little gifts. I love debating with you, laughing with you, and dreaming about the future with you. But Im also scared. This feeling is foreign, but also so incredible, and Im afraid of losing it. Im afraid of you hurting me, because you dont realize how strongly I feel about you or maybe because you dont particularly care. Im scared because of the things you said on that long car ride back from SF. I dont really think you have any way to even begin to understand how badly Ive been hurt in the past by cheating. And you seem to take it so lightly. To you, cheating is just a natural normal thing that anyone is capable of. To you, its something that should be simply forgiven. I understand why you say these things. I understand that you love your father and you cant bring yourself to condemn him for his unfaithful past. But I need you to understand, yes, people make mistakes, and these mistakes dont mean that you have to love them or care about them any less, but please. I need you to see these mistakes as an opportunity to learn, not as justification that they cant be that bad if someone you care about commits them. I want to be with you. But Im scared. If theres any inkling of possibility in your mind that you could cheat again, cheat on me, then I want nothing to do with you. Im sure that sounds harsh, but the pain that Ive had to bare in the past was too much to bare again. And Im afraid that this time around, the pain would be immeasurably worse. I feel such a special connection to you, but with that connection come heightened vulnerability. I want to give my all to you, relinquish my fears and secrets and dreams to you, but I know Ill never be able to fully do that when I know youre capable of shattering it all with one thoughtless act of infidelity. I wish I could make you understand how it feels. Maybe then you would see why Im so afraid. And you would understand the tumult and chaos in my head. I want to love you. I know that I could. And I will if we continue down this path weve chosen. But I also need to trust you. I cant pull that trust out of thin air, and I know that you dont expect me to. I feel like Im at a crossroads, and both options have potential for immense pain. I feel stuck. I want to tell you all of these things. But Im afraid of you telling me youre not looking for a relationship or commitment or something that may tie you down. Especially after you told me you see a relationship as just a small step from marriage. And I know you may not stay in SoCal. You want to go back to SF and be with your family. And I cant nor do I want to stop you from doing so. So what are we? Just two people who happened to cross paths and will eventually drift apartjust to become occasional passing thoughts in each others minds? Is that what you want? I dont know what you want. I dont know what I want. Except that I want you. "

And darling, there is no solace in what could've been. It feels stupid that I'm hung up on something that happened 2 years ago. It probably means nothing to you but it means more than everything to me. I guess you made it official with her today, and I was the first one to congratulate you. She's my friend. But she doesn't know about what was our sorta, kinda something. It shouldn't even be a surprise, because for more than a year I saw you two going from strangers to too-close friends. I accepted it but deep down I hoped you were really *just friends*. Yeah, right. But, you're not just friends. We are. Me and you. Things between us get tense and awkward so easily and I wonder if it's because of the things that go unsaid or if it's because we just don't really know each other? What hurts the most that I feel like I'm killing you off; as if I'm tearing away a part of me, yet, I know I'll see your face tomorrow and every day after it and be reminded of it all. In spite of everything I do want you to take care of her, okay? She's a good person and I know your ""bad boy"" reputation is one you gave yourself to protect yourself from vulnerability, that's what you told me. She loves you. I, from now, no longer bitter, regretful or heartbroken. I now for once have the heart to give that one guy that really loves me a chance after pushing him away. This is my closure, even though there isn't an actual one. I hope I can still be a good friend to you. "
756,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,End of chapter...?,3,7gsbli,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/7gsbli/end_of_chapter/,2017-12-01 14:46:12,"Today, while at work, I spent quite some time thinking about you. I won't lie and say I think about you every single day. but it'd be mendacious to say I don't think about you most days. It's a.. It's a bit strange, you know? I assume when someone opts to end a relationship, they have an easier time going on about their merry way and leaving the past behind. But you were never just a past to me. And quite honestly, I don't think it's possible to forget. Is it? For anyone to forget someone they loved ever so fervently, to forget the wonderful time spent with them... It's a laughable notion. Especially after all these years. The rollercoaster of elation and despair we endured over the course of 7 years. Goodness. Who would've thought that this girl I met online would become one of my greatest desires. The purest ecstacy. I wonder... Do you still think about me? If even half as much as I think about you? What would you think if you read this? Would you scoff and leave without a split second of hesitation? I wouldn't be too surprised if you did. I know I'm not the easiest man to deal with. Though that never stopped you, did it? Contumacious as ever in your resolve to prove to me you were my ride or die woman. And prove it you did. You always looked on the bright side. You believed love could overcome any encumbrance that could rise up. You gave your all for me. Yet here we are. Communication is no more. Again. But this time is different, right? I know it, and I'm sure you do too. Is it.. Silly? I still expected a happy birthday message from you this year. The 22nd came and I was thinking about you. I wondered if you'd still give me that. When the day ended, I realized how adamant you were about moving on. I'm sure it can be called selfish though, to expect your message when I didn't send you one. I suppose that's one thing I loved about you though. You were usually the one to mend the wounds we inflicted on each other. Magnanimous to a fault really. I often questioned why you remained as long as you did. Though I was always thankful that you did. You truly were a fantastic woman. Wife material. Many times I've envisaged what it would be like to be married to you. I'd play out scenario after scenario. Whole days from waking up to a kiss from you to ending the day with you in my arms. So where did it all go wrong? Must be me, no? I tend to defend my actions with logic. I blame a realistic mentality, whereas you argued it was more pessimistic than realistic. In retrospect, perhaps you were right. Maybe I'm more fucked up than I realize. I was usually the one to abrogate the relationship, yet so effortlessly returned to you at a moments notice muagre the ambivalence. I don't know... Do I still love you? That's a common question I've yet to find an answer for. This.. This that you'll never see... Is this a way of telling myself I still love you? I'm honestly not sure. I think it's hard to discern emotions like these on our own. We're all so biased when it comes to questions about ourselves be it due to denial or apprehension or the desire to be rid of these feelings. I miss you, I'll say. I miss how we were with each other. I miss how you made me feel. I miss what we could have been. It's funny, you know... Everything I feel and felt about you seems to have had no influence in my decision to leave the many times I did, yet I claim to have had a passion for you. I bet anyone would argue that my actions belie the message my words convey. Maybe I am more pessimistic than I'd like to believe. Maybe it's a defense. Maybe I'm just an asshole. Or a lovely concoction of all three. I'm sure you'd agree with that. I still hear your voice. I still see your gorgeous smile. I still feel your warmth. I... I don't know why I'm writing this. What good will this do? You won't read it. It'll collect virtual dust. Sigh... I don't believe I can stop thinking about you. Maybe, in time, the frequency will abate. Maybe. I feel a bit silly writing this, probably because I can't discern why I did. But you've been on my mind quite a bit recently, so I felt like getting it off my chest. Love... A vulnerability, yet an aegis to withstand adversities. A strength unlike any experienced before, and a weakness never thought possible. Ecstacy in it's purest form, and sorrow in it's ugliest. A chapter of my life rife with these emotions thanks to my time with you. I wouldn't dare say I regret any of it. Wherever you are, whatever you're doing, I hope you're well. I hope you find the happiness you deserve. And with that, this chapter comes to a close. Farewell, my dear. Valentine"
757,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,I slept with your best friend and never told you,1,7hqgmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/7hqgmi/i_slept_with_your_best_friend_and_never_told_you/,2017-12-06 02:42:10,"Dear J, I don't know how to say this... I slept with B, your best friend. I slept with him willingly. I might have been an emotional wreck at the time, but I was sober. This was in June of 2016... While you had that injury from your football game. I guess I just felt alone and we had been distant even before that happened. And when I came there, B was with you and you largely ignored me. But I felt very traumatized by the whole ordeal and when B drove me back I asked him to come inside and just comfort me a little. I guess one thing just lead to another and we started a relationship... I mean, I never told you but you probably realized I always liked B. Not as much as you, but I must say I found his vulnerability and complex character to be so attractive. And the feelings WERE mutual, but we had never acted on it before then. I hope you don't think too badly of B... He wanted to stop after each time we had sex... But the next night when I would come over we would have sex again. We had always liked each other, it was a dark time, and we both lacked self control. We stopped after a month, when you recovered. I had wanted to stop even before then but lacked self control I guess. I also wanted to tell you then, but I was too cowardly, and I just wanted to put it behind me. I shouldn't have, I should have told you then... But I made another huge mistake after the biggest mistake of my life. Anyway, then B got cancer. And I think when it became clear he wouldn't survive, he suggested to me that it was time to tell you. And I confess, I stopped him. And I don't think I was wrong in doing so. You were about to lose your best friend, I was about to lose my friend, and he was going to die. We were already dealing with enough and it was not the right time, so I stopped him. And he didn't tell you... and passed away. But before he passed he did make me promise to tell you, and so that's why I'm writing this letter I guess. It's been several months since that but I haven't been able to tell you. I've thought about it frequently, but it never seemed like the right time. We struggled to move on after his death, and then we started having such good times I didn't want to tell you such a horrible thing. I guess that's why I've never been able to tell you this. Other than being a coward, I also just love you too much to live life without you. I want to be yours, and want you to be mine, for the rest of our lives. I couldn't stand to see you leave me. It feels so irrelevant to tell you now because I know I love you and will always be faithful. Still, I tried to tell you once, but I got cold feet, and backed off. But it seemed like you thought from what I said that B tried to force himself on me, and I don't want you to be confused about what actually happened. So here's my confession. I made a stupid mistake, but I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I regret what we did every day, but I will never do it again. I'm sorry. "

You were the strongest woman I ever met. But that night you showed your vulnerability. A past lover hurt you and you cried in front of me, a stranger, holding my hand. I kissed your cheek goodnight and we parted ways. We developed from that movement. Every time I saw you I couldnt wait to give you a high five. Until mid February I gave you my heart. We were inseparable from that movement. We would spend the next 2 years together 24/7 almost and never grow tired. Every single day when we parted and met again we would laugh. It was like two hours apart was two years apart. However, your strength I could not handle. You were too great for me. I thought I could handle it but my insecurity took the best of me. I told you, you couldnt do what you loved to be with me. I told you we werent best friends. I hurt you in ways I could never imagine. And then you struck me back. You moved on while we were still together. Sought attention from others and broke my heart. I tried to piece everything together in a last ditch effort but to no luck you were gone. Its been years and I have no idea where you are or who you are anymore. Never know why I did the things I did to you. You were exactly what Ive always wanted and still do.

I had a crush on you for a while before we started dating. I thought you were so funny, and interesting, and intriguing... and fucking adorable. We would run into each other occasionally on campus and you were so cute. You had this essence of vulnerability about you, and it was so pure- like a puppy. As time passed, and we started dating, I grew more and more attached to you. You would tell me you missed me, and compliment me, and it meant so much to me. The break up happened so quickly. One day we were cuddling in my bed, and a few days later it was over. I wanted to know you better. I wanted you to know me better. I wanted to see you more often. I wanted to be more comfortable around you. I wanted to talk about deeper things-- darker things and you didn't want that. and I was crushed. It hurt a lot to be rejected like that. I cared so much about you. I was so attached to you and when I lost you it almost felt like a part of me died. I want to be over you, but I'm not. It's almost like this obsession, like the great gatsby or something. I idealize you in my head. But it's over. and I'm trying to move on. I think I'm going to be seeing you in a couple of weeks- at a party. I feel anxious about it and I think I'm going to be sort of uncomfortable around you. And it's hard because a part of me just wants to see you and hug you and flirt with you... but I can't do that anymore. I just have to keep reminding myself that it's going to be okay. It's been an extremely difficult year for me, but I'm going to get through it. Anyway, I do hope you're well. I miss you. Maybe we'll be friends some day."

Why would you want to maintain any kind of relationship? I did too much wrong and cant correct those mistakes. It was the deceit and attempts to correct the wrong, without being honest which finally drove me mad. Not that I can excuse my attacks on you. I wasnt just projecting my own wrongdoings, I was projecting my fundamental fear of rejection. Im too stunted a person to be vulnerable. Without being self-pitying Im sorry you met me, or at least Im sorry we met when we did. Perhaps in another lifetime I have already taken my mental health seriously by the time we met. Im not sure I could control it, well not as simply as you suggest. There were plenty of occasions I blew up in the presence of others. How wonderful that is all I can boast. It should never have happened. I hope it was never a conscious decision to be domineering and question your reasoning and rationale. There is too much I am ashamed of, but stymying your expression is one of two things which really bother me. The other I will leave unmentioned. These two failings represent the size of my person. I want to say I am not my worst moment, but for now I am. I hope one day Ill grow to be someone more. More like you. Someone brave, curious and whole. I didnt show it when we were together but I am grateful for everything you shared with me and all I learned from you. Im sorry I didnt act with integrity or honesty from that moment on. Once it had been done, I could never be good enough but I had to fix it. Im not brave though and I made it worse. What good is being right when you can be neither good nor nice? I spend my days replaying all the wrongs I did to you. My lack of compassion for you was insincere. It was the guilt and the knowledge that I wasnt being fair to you by clinging on that spurred the outbursts. Do you remember that fit I had when we first broke up? I wanted to tell you everything then but I am a coward. Even as we were cooped up in our dingy flat in Rio and everything had fallen apart I wanted to tell you. I tried to bring the words out from my belly, from the belly of the whale, but they wouldnt come. I lied again. I have no right to apologise for any of it but I want to live my life as a living expression of my remorse and will to be better. To never be what I was to you to another. Scant solace perhaps. I have been in denial since we first got serious. Something was wrong and I couldnt place it. I have never been a controlling person before. It shows just how small a man I am. I simply couldnt deal with the feeling of vulnerability that came with love. Yes there were other circumstances but there is no excuse. I felt like I had duped you. In the moment I opened myself up to you all my deficiencies were exposed. I stopped being the guy youd met in a summer haze. I wont bore you with explanations. You dont need to hear it. Just know that there were specific triggers which I should have been aware of. Im sorry that I wasnt self aware. That complacency caused us both too much pain. You were never stupid. I always knew that. Its what attracted me to you in the first place. You are exceptional. My problems were always bubbling under the surface and I had lost my way when we met. Im still sad when I think about it because you were the One. I know its cheesy and not who I was when we met. I guess I dont really believe in the concept of the One outside of you. How fucked is that? That the only time I have loved someone I hurt and bullied them. That I did everything I possibly could to ruin it for them and myself. I know you say I can control it, but I couldnt in those moments. I'm ashamed because all I can do, is never subject someone else to it. I can't let go yet because I can't correct all my mistakes. I have no right to even ask for the opportunity. Therapy is great. I finally have someone to reorganise my thoughts. I dont know how long I have been completely mental but I think I was on my way this time last year. I dont want to invalidate what happened in October last year at all. It was real. I just flipped. The slightest rejection, change or increase in distance and BOOM. There I go. Thank you for acknowledging the mistakes you made. I know you did at the time. I wish that when I went off the deep end, back in January that I had asked to go on a break while I cleared up my mental health. Im sorry that I subjected you to that torture. I never think less of you. Its thinking more of myself which is the problem. I hope one day you email me and we have something positive to say to one another. That you tell me of all your lovers named Socrates and Attila. All your successes. All your concerns for society. Anything. I know I dont have the right, but I do hope. I hope that I have something to tell you. Something to show how I grew. How I didnt repeat the same mistakes. How I pulled myself out of my own mire. How I finally applied myself and took a risk on me. I understand though that there is no reason you would want any kind of relationship with me. "

If and when I do, maybe one day I'll let you know. Then again after all this time I don't know if I can. We used to talk everyday about almost anything; life philosophy, struggles, even mundane shit. Some days were tough. I struggled not to tell you how I grew to feel. Sometimes glimpses of it slipped through the cracks. I get the sense that you somewhat knew it and maybe even felt something yourself. But just like the last person I loved, I got afraid. Of what I can only guess. Vulnerability? Success? To let someone walk the halls of my castle? Whatever ends up happening, I at least want to thank you for showing me that I can love and feel loved. That there's a way out of this hell I've constructed for myself. I just have to work to break free from it. So far, the stages for executing that escape are going well.

Why is it so difficult for you to just show some empathy? Being sad is okay. I can handle just being sad at times. Something saddens you and you get over it. Being depressed is different. Sometimes there is nothing happening to make you feel depressed. Sometimes the current situation can trigger or intensify depression. One cannot just simply snap it of being depressed. When people tell me to snap out of it, it just causes me to shut down more. Like why didnt I think of just being happy? When I try to open up about feeling depressed and you are dismissive of it, I dont want to bring it up again. Im anxious to show my vulnerability with my depression because you dont react in the most positive way. Its almost as if you blame me for feeling depressed. I cant just pretend to be happy when I am feeling intense pain. I just need to feel like you can be there for me and you havent. Just because I feel depressed doesnt mean that I abandoned you. Im sorry that you ever felt abandoned, but I did the best I could under the circumstances. Being depressed is like trying to climb out of a well while being stuck in quicksand. Its not a pleasant feeling. I dont want to feel intense emotional pain on a regular basis and wish that it would end. I dont want to die or hurt myself, Sometimes I just want to cease to exist. Sometimes I wish that I just never wake up or that I get some life threatening illness. I would never harm myself in any way because its unfair to those I love. When I tell you that Im depressed please try to understand its not just simple sadness. You cant just snap out of it. Please be empathetic. Let me know that i matter and that I am loved, that youre there for me in anyway that I need, listen to me and dont take it personally, and that I am important and you dont want me to go away. Please just understand that depression is not a reflection on you so that you can be there for the me when I need you. And I do need you, possibly more than you know or understand. Do not take it personally or get defensive when I tell you that Im feeling depressed. I just need empathy. "

The self doubt, world of pain and confusion is something unimaginable to you. I pretend everything's okay and put up a front around you so you dont see it. I don't want you to see my weaknesses. I dont want you to see my vulnerability. I dont want you to see how devastated I am for the sole fact of, I want you happy. Even if that means sacrificing my happiness. I come home everyday hoping and praying that you're smiling face is waiting on the other side of that door. Yet, the feeling of disappointment gets harder and harder on a daily basis. Coming home to your things divided from mine and waiting on you to come get them. Sleeping in our bed every night. Cooking a meal for two then realizing it's supposed to be a meal for one. I just can't do it anymore. I don't want to come home anymore because your presence will never leave our home. I just don't love you anymore. These are the six words that keep replaying in my mind over and over again. Each time I can hear them coming out of your mouth like broken glass on a hardwood floor. I'm doing everything in my power to pick up the pieces and align them perfectly back together in hopes that maybe just maybe, if they're perfect, this would have never happened. That this was all just a dream. You tell me to move on and you want the best for me, yet you make statement like the thought of you with someone else bothers me. You tell me you were so unhappy in our relationship, but now I see nothing but unhappiness in your eyes. I don't understand. I cannot wrap my brain around any of this. I keep trying to figure out where exactly I went wrong. What did I do to make you so unhappy? I did everything in my power to ensure you were happy. Where did I go wrong? I want to keep holding on to you. I want to fight for you. Most importantly, I want you to come home. But at the same time, I dont want to be with anyone that has to question whether they love me or not. I hope that you are able to find that person that makes you happy. Love, Me. "

Doesn't that sound like a Dashboard song? Maybe I'll write one in that vein. Though it potentially makes zero sense (or the most sense), I trust you more than anyone. It's both comforting and difficult. That seems to be the case with most of my feelings, especially those in the case of you. The lack of control I have over my physical and emotional reactions to you is the best and the worst. It feels so natural, so easy. It feels so challenging, so alien. You feel the same. We don't discuss this, except with loaded statements or silent eye contact. You trust me. You're so open and honest with me. This is not in your character. So I have this secret. I've never told anyone. You are the first and only person I have felt had the right to know. I feel this growing need to bare this last wound to you. It would explain so, so many things. I haven't though. It never feels like the right time. It never will. Because saying things out loud makes them real, right? Conflict and contradiction. Granting you with the vulnerability you deserve will be the gift that demolishes me. The last shield I have, this dark shame and fear, will give you every warped part, showing how truly ruined I am. It will also show how truly special you are. How can I do that to us? How can I not? I'm so sorry. "
766,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,A letter to the man who raped me:,142,6pgyyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/6pgyyd/a_letter_to_the_man_who_raped_me/,2017-07-26 01:44:25,"Youve been living rent-free in my head for over a year. I want you *gone*, every trace of you scrubbed away. But thats not going to happen any time soon, is it? So while youre here, youre going to listen to what I fucking have to say. You took advantage of my kindness and that of my husband, and you took advantage of my fear and vulnerability. You are a wicked, sick man. I have wished violence upon you many times over the course of the past year. But mostly, I just want your own karma to come crashing down on your head. In a way, from what I know of your life before we met, I think it already has. But you continue to accrue terrible karma, and I cant help hoping that when that debt comes due, it hurts you as much as youve hurt me. You pretended to be kind. I thought you were someone who could be a friend. When you needed somewhere to stay for the night, I didnt want you to be left on the streets, so I persuaded my husband, who was greatly reluctant and for, it turns out, good reason, to allow you to stay with us for one night until you could get into the homeless shelter. I doubt you really needed the safety of sleeping under my roof. Its clear to me you planned this to work out in your favor, and you figured out which of my buttons you could press to get close enough to take advantage of me. It worked, of course. Earlier in the evening, you went out and got some drinks to share. Whats the harm in having a bit of alcohol with a friend? So I had a drink. And while I was in the kitchen cooking, you came up behind me and touched me a little inappropriately. I ~~should have~~ wish I had sounded the alarm right then and kicked you out, but instead I laughed you off. I didnt want to overreact. I didnt want to punish you for what I thought was flirtation. It wasnt flirtatious, though. It was predatory. You were seeing how much Id let you get away with. Too much, it turns out. I did not invite you into my home because I wanted to sleep with you. I invited you in because I wanted you to be safe for the night. What I have learned from this, and had reinforced from therapy, is that it is not selfish or hard-hearted to protect myself, and I wish I had protected myself better that night. I took a risk helping you, and was hurt because of it. But one thing you will not take from me is my generosity and ability to trust. Ill just be more careful of where I bestow it. When you knew what you could get away with, you pressed for more advantage. And my fear started to build. When I get scared, though, my reaction is often to try to make light of it. So I minimized the hell out of what you were doing. Processing my fear only happened much, much later. When I break it down, now, I see how many things I was afraid of. Some of it was justifiable fear: fear that you would hurt me if I said no too firmly. Fear that you would hurt my husband, or that he would hurt you and embroil us in some ugly legal battle. There was fear that you would make a scene, waking my husband up from sleeping in the other room, and blame me  making him think that I had decided to cheat on him, and then  what, changed my mind? The thing about fear is that it demands a response in the moment. It doesnt leave you time or resources to analyze why you are afraid, or whether it is even reasonable to be afraid. So when my options were fight, say no vehemently, emphasize how uncomfortable this made me or run away from what was happening in the only way I could, mentally? I ran away. In time Ive come to understand that this in itself is a marker of my strength. I chose what seemed like the safer option. I **protected** myself by not fighting back  I am not physically strong, I do not have any experience fighting someone off, and even if I did he may have easily overpowered me and done me more violence than violation. He showed he was willing to hurt me when he slapped me for hesitating too long. How much further was he willing to take that, if I fought back? There is a phrase from a book I dearly love that says That which yields is not always weak. These words took on new meaning for me when I read them again almost a year after being raped. They lifted a measure of the burden of guilt I felt  and still do feel, if Im being honest  for not having fought harder. For not having said no more often, more forcefully. For inviting him in in the first place. But a friend of mine also pointed out to me that the absence of a no *does not mean yes*. Consent is not something you can take by fear. I was pressured and manipulated and intimidated  I was raped. It took me nearly a year to even acknowledge that I was raped. When I went to the doctor to have myself tested for anything you might have infected me with  which, thank all that is holy, you didnt  I fearfully told them that I had made a mistake. I couldnt say the words I was raped. And in my mind at the time, it WAS my fault. And I did make a mistake. I trusted you. But what you did wasnt a mistake. It was a deliberate, calculated act. I am not, and was never, in the moral wrong here. It took six months of experiencing flashbacks to the event before I could verbalize to my doctors what was happening. I take medication for it now. It helps, but the flashbacks arent gone, and I have more nightmares than I did before. Just today, I had a dream in which I was violated. When I woke up, that feeling stayed with me, and the reminders of the event, from so many little things I could never have imagined would affect me, until I experienced the trauma of being raped, have been particularly strong today. Your name is common. When I see it, or hear it, I feel sick. I dont think Ill make another lemon cheesecake for a few years at least, because that was what I was making in the kitchen that night. Men with beards frighten me now. You ruined what was my favorite tea at the time, all because I had a cup of it the night you raped me. Theres a fucking NPC in Skyrim whose voice sounds like yours. I hate that NPC. I hate the scent of pomegranate dishsoap. I want nothing to do with strawberry flavored vodka, or Redds black cherry. There are knives in my kitchen drawer I cant look at without calling up awful memories. June hasnt been a good month for me for a long time, but now I dread the 22nd. I cried on the phone to my mother on the first anniversary of the day you raped me. I remember the date because I took photos of the cheesecake I made that night. Someday, Ill do something really positive on June 22nd, and it will be so good it will overwrite the ugly feelings, the shame, the fear, the guilt, the hate. The 21st and the 22nd were both hard days for me this year, because it happened at night, on the cusp of the date. And whats more, that falls on a holy day for me. In time I will reclaim it. For now, though, youve tarnished it with your filth. Some people urge forgiveness for those who have done you evil. But anger can be useful. I dont know whether I will hate you and be angry at you forever. But I have earned the right to my feelings. I have earned this anger, this righteous fury. At this point in my recovery, my anger protects me. I still have need of it. And I will not be ashamed of using my anger as a shield, because every time I think of you with anger is a time I am not thinking of you with fear. I honestly cant remember climbing into bed that night. I dont remember exchanging pleasantries with you after you were done with me. I think I remember that I got you an extra blanket, but maybe that happened earlier in the evening. I remember what happened in fragments, and the chronological order of events is fuzzy for me. I guess thats a way the brain has of trying to protect itself from traumatic events. But I know I must have slept, eventually. You slept in the other room. I dont know how I did it. I honestly dont know. I couldnt touch those blankets after you left. I let them sit there for days. How do you exchange pleasantries with your rapist? How do you pretend everything is normal? I had to pretend everything was fine. It seems Im very good at doing that. I avoided having sex with my husband until I knew I was clean. I was so afraid, afterward. What if you had given me an infection or disease? How would I explain it, live with it if it were permanent? Remember that I couldnt process what happened as rape for *many* months afterward. The fear I felt having those tests done and waiting for the results is another debt I lay at your door. Everywhere I look, though, I see markers of my strength. Despite having my daily life affected in new and unpleasant ways, I am still making the best I can of life. I still have close friendships and a close relationship with my husband  though, as of this writing time, I havent processed what happened enough to feel comfortable telling him yet. This letter is part of my efforts to move through this trauma. Despite the devastating way in which my trust was violated, I can still form new trust, new friendships. Most things that remind me of the event, I still avoid, but I have made efforts to reclaim others. I have days where I avoid every reminder, not wanting to think at all about what happened and how it makes me feel. But I also have days like today, where I feel horribly uncomfortable but am still able to face the memories of what you did to me and make progress toward living with them. I will never be able to erase what you did, but neither have you stained or tarnished who I am. I am still the same loving, generous person I was before you hurt me. What you did to me was not my fault. I am not to blame. I did not ask for it to happen. I repeat these things to myself on a regular basis. In the end, the details of the event dont matter. The jagged edges of those memories will dull over time, and the less said of them the better. Suffice to say that I survived everything you did to me, and that this will not be the trauma that takes me down. Ive endured worse abuse. You violated me physically and you violated my trust, but there are things you cant break. You cant break my heart because I never had any feelings for you. You cant break my spirit, because I am stronger and more resilient than youll ever be. Imagine how weak someone has to be in order to take pleasure in hurting another person. Imagine needing someone elses pain or discomfort to feel powerful. So yes. It could be so much worse. I could be like you. Another affirmation I say to myself is this: My capacity for love is not diminished by the pain I have endured. If anything, it has grown. And that is what separates us so completely: where you have withered and decayed under your misfortunes and bad choices, where you have warped and bent and twisted into a monster, I have become more compassionate and more empathetic. I have used this trauma as a bridge to connect with other people who have also been hurt. What you sought to weaken or destroy, you only made stronger. And thats why I am not just a victim. I am a survivor. And I have more love in my life than you ever will. I have such supportive friends and family. I am so thankful to the people who I have confided in, because they have helped me see things clearly and have helped me so much in my recovery. I am strong, but with them I am stronger. There is a quote from the Desiderata that is also part of my list of affirmations. It says, ""You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars. You have a right to be here."" This quote brings me peace. And I know that no matter how much Ive been hurt, I am stronger than what hurt me. I am stronger than you."

768,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,To Angel,3,6rfd51,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/6rfd51/to_angel/,2017-08-04 06:47:37,"I've always been kinda of alone. Always on my own. Sometimes by choice, other times either because I just scared to form a genuine connection with someone, or that I just didn't feel good about myself. Depression drove me into isolation even further. Depression took a decade of my life. One day I was just a kid, and the next a young man. I never got to be a teenager. There was childhood and then there's this, adulthood. No teenage years. I missed out on a huge part of life, and it honestly feels like I'm mourning that lost time with how much I've been crying these days. I'd like to think that my road in life just diverged from where everyone ordinarily walks in their teenage years. I remember once when I was 15, somewhere around there. My parents had a pretty nasty verbal fight while drunk. I had to separate them. It was in the middle of the night. I was pissed off, and the fight went outside. I was following my mom down the street while I kept shoving my dad to get him to back off to give the two some space. I didn't fucking care why they were fighting, I just needed them to stop. They were unhappy in their marriage, I was unhappy with my own life. They needed to communicate, I needed some quiet. Anyway, I was following my mom down the street as she was crying and saying all sorts of horrific shit back at my dad, who also was shouting some shit back. Eventually, I convinced my dad to turn and go back at the house. My mom and I walked down the street. She was crying and I just held her as we walked. I don't know what she was talking about, but she said some shit and I was just too pissed off to listen, much less care. I just needed her to cool off so that we could go home and I could have some fucking peace and quiet. It wasn't a long walk, it wasn't short either. Our way home, as I walked with my mom, crying her fucking eyes out, this woman saying all sort of shit to get it all off her chest, the same person that abandoned me, who told me when I first started to show signs of depression to stop my fucking crying, which led me to isolate myself, which led me unable to cry for fucking years until recently, this bitch who would later attempt suicide while drunk, just kept crying and crying. I was pretty embarrassed. Pretty pissed off too. Because there were these group of girls making their way over, they were going to pass us. They were laughing, generally happy with themselves and their teenage life. They looked about my age. They stopped laughing when they saw us. They just looked. And I remember looking down, pretty fucking ashamed at my crying mother, and me taking care of her. I was pretty jealous too. These group of girls got to live their own lives, while mine was pretty fucking horrible and stagnant. I'm sure they had some of their own bad shit in their lives happening, but they had each other. I had no one. Just me, trying to take care of my parents whenever a drunken fight erupted and trying to take care of myself with my depression. Before that, whenever we were out at our camp, I'd walk into the woods and find a quiet spot to sit and cry. I didn't know what was wrong with me. I had no name for what I was feeling, what I was going through. If my parents had been communicative and opened up about their own depression much, MUCH earlier, everything could've been prevented and I would've gotten the treatment I needed. Anyway, I''d cry in the woods, generally unhappy with life. I'd feel a bit better after those cries, but there was always this black cloud over me in my head. I told my dad about this recently, about why I can't ever go back at the camp. One of the reasons, at least. This year, I walked around those woods and I honestly could almost hear little me in my head crying in the woods. And I remember walking around there and some part of me, the me now, the 21 year old me, hoping I find little me, so I could give a hug and comfort little me. Because I sure as hell needed someone. ANYONE. I broke down when I reached that spot. I just lost it, I kinda just sat there in the snow, crying my eyes out. I don't know, maybe I really was hoping to find little me, as stupid as that may sound. And the point of all this, me telling you this stuff, isn't to tell you how hard my life was, how much of a shitty hand I was dealt with. The people that were in my life, at some point or another, had it worse. YOU had it worse. The point of why I'm telling you all this is that I've always been on my own with everything. I literally never had anyone there for me during tough times. Until you came along, until I reached out to you. Even with friends, I always felt alone. But not with talking to you, even if it was just through text. With you, that might have been the first time I had some sort of connection with anyone, at all. Truth be told, I'm so starved of having any meaningful relationship of any kind that it's scary. That's what I think I did to you, I said deep and personal things way too fast and way too early because I was starved, still am, and the more I did that, the more I felt like I could trust you, the more I opened up and let my guard down the more scary it got. The more my mind told me to run, the more the thoughts of what I say being used against me popped up. I was deeply hurt as a kid, and by my own mother, no less. I opened up and I was so young to fully express what I felt that I just ended up saying a bunch of nonsense. She'd let me cry and just hug me, as any mother would do. But one day, there was an argument. And I talked back at her. And she used what I said against me. ""Shut up, all you do is fucking cry like a baby!"" I had a hard time opening up after that, hard time crying too. She was a horrible fucking woman back then, now she's pretty okay. People change. I changed. So much so that I let go and sent away Elysia, probably the closet anyone got to me before you. That sucked, that's the third time I did that. I told her I'd be gone for good from her life, and I meant it. People change, and she reminded me of old me. What I did was selfish, but it needed to be done. Then there's you. No one has helped me the way you have. Just by giving me time, giving me attention, just by being you helped me so much that I really don't know how to express it. I could just be vulnerable with you. To be honest, it feels Like I've always been on edge, like I stood around ready to fight or run when it came to dealing with people. But with you, I could just be human. I'm not good with people. I've been on my own for so long that I get fucking anxious around others, even with family. I'm so caught up in my always-will-be-alone thinking sometimes that my mood takes a nosedive and I have to work on bringing it back up. Honestly, if I could go back to the past, I wouldn't change a single fucking thing. I'd probably go up to little me and say, ""shit will get tough, you'll spend a fuckton of time alone, but you'll be all right. You'll fall ass deep in anxiety and depression, but you'll make it through, you'll be okay,"" and that would be that. I'm glad I spent all that time alone, dealing with shit on my own. It taught me the value of a healthy, normal relationship of all kinds. And whether it was worth keeping or to let it go. Looking back, I didn't exactly have any of those. I'm on my own, again. Elysia, I let go. You? I let you go because what I need the most in any kind of relationship, openness, honesty, vulnerability was something you weren't comfortable giving. I don't blame you, after telling me what you've been through. But I can't give unless there's reciprocation. And the other reason being I was afraid. Afraid our connection becoming more. I don't think you'll ever see me the way I see you, and that's okay. Not your fault, we all value everyone differently. I wouldn't be surprised if I was pretty low on your list. Well, you're pretty high on mine, and I think it'll be awhile before you start to go down. You, Elysia, both of you were at the top. Right above family. There's a reason for that, but this is getting too long. Plus, I don't wanna bad mouth family. It was bad enough to say shit about my mom. This may sound stupid, but its true. I often wondered about what could've been. What if I had the courage to walk up to you back then and just talk? Maybe we could've been friends, best fucking friends, in a relationship or something? Maybe we could've helped each other? Maybe I could've helped you? Maybe you could've helped me then instead of years down the road? Maybe if I had just made that simple choice to talk to you, just like the simple choice I made in reaching out to you, life would've been completely different? Maybe and what if. Those two things run through my mind daily, more so in a way about how small little choices can lead to huge, unimaginable changes. I don't know why I wrote all of this. I'm not even sure if I'll send it. Maybe I'll just shred it, or put it away with all my other writings, I don't know. But it was something i needed to do. I guess I had to put down in words about why the time you invested in me, even if it wasn't much and just through text, why it wasn't all for nothing. I know you value your time. That's my problem nowadays, time. Somedays I waste it and forget how valuable it is, given how much of it I lost to depression. And other days it feels like I won't have enough time to do everything I want in life, now that I'm ""better'. I don't think I've written this much in a single sitting. And here I am trying to work on writing stories more, I guess I had to tell my own life story a bit before moving to fictional ones? Just a thought. I don't know what you'll do with this. Maybe you'll just glance at it, not read it, and then throw it away. Maybe you'll use it against me, as cynical as the thought may be, I don't know. I don't know who I'll be in your life, I don't know how you'll remember me, if at all, but I know who you'll always be to me. Little Angel, smiling and teasing me because you had a crush. I remember you wrapping your fingers with a piece of paper and did this little dance with them, saying, ""LJ-Chests' girlfriend, and this is her dress,"" referring to the paper around your fingers. Girlfriend in a dress, that was a good one. You know I fell in love with you, I told you that. Maybe in some alternate timeline, universe or whatever, we're dancing around with you in a dress. I won't lie to you. I've been all over the place emotionally. One day, I'm happy enough that I just want to cry at how far and how long I was able to make it on my own with depression. Next day, I just feel so down and I inevitably end up crying and mourning the lost time and what could've been. I knew I lost a big chunk of my life to depression, but it really didn't hit me until recently, until I saw just worse I had gotten after getting better. I had a pretty dark day when I sent that last text, telling you to take care and everything. I meant it. I just thought since you had been pretty quiet on your end that maybe you didn't want to talk anymore. It was a bitch to send, I was a complete wreck. I'm starting to hate texting. You can never really see and feel the gravity of what's behind the words. Kinda why I've been quiet too on my end before that text. I think this is it. Where we part ways. I guess I just wanted to tell you, or at least make an effort to put it all down in words about what you did for me. You were a friend. Probably the only friend that was there for me during a tough time, probably the very first true friend I've ever really had in my 21 years of living. Thank you. "

You were tall and certainly handsome, but sat on the other edge of the circle and that was the end of it. A few pleasantries exchanged, and we went our separate ways. But who knew it would happen again in the middle of a chilly Canadian night almost exactly two months later? This time in a car, I was high, you didnt remember me. You were just another friend of a friend up for the weekend. A few hours spent together after that, in my living room talking about who knows what with the others until five in the morning. That first night I thought nothing of you, this tall handsome stranger was just that, and you were sleeping fifteen feet away on my futon. I knew when I woke up though; I knew something was pulling me to you. The dark chocolate eyes, rough stubbly cheeks, and red shoelaces. I tried my hand at catching your attention over the next few days. The only time I thought I may have been successful was under the blanket, our hands clutched and touching but not together. Did I imagine the longing looks through my open bedroom door? Our next encounter was on your turf. Wed been messaging quite constantly since we had parted not five days earlier, and I was fairly certain on your keenness in the cocky way my mind works. I knew nothing of your past or character, but youre a boy all the same and Im fairly in tune with these signals. The unnecessary touching, the fleeting glances and goofy smiles. When your arm slipped around me on that wonderful balcony to save me from the terror of drunken friends, I knew this was my opportunity to give you my best signal: a light brush of your skin just above your waistband. I wonder if you remember. Our first kiss was less than magical, to say the least. We were the only two people in the room even if it wasnt really true. You practically crushed me you sat so close, and I could see the leap of faith in your eyes as you stole that first kiss, and the confidence as you pushed back for a second. And immediately we had to get out of there. I knew I just had to be somewhere else with you. But thats not what happened, was it? We both remember well the hail Mary attempts to squeeze between us. But we broke free finally. The next thing I remember is teasingly offering to sleep on the couch, and you sheepishly offering your bed. And so I came in and shut the door, not to reopen it until several hours into the next morning. I think our first mistake was that second night. We transcended into something more in less than twenty-four hours. After spending that whole Sunday lounging on your bed and getting to know each other, I felt like you were an old friend. And then that second night, we climbed into bed, chatted and smooched, and slept sharing a pillow. We woke up in the morning an old couple: me watching you change into a suit for an interview and dozing until you returned to sneak back under the covers with me. Not your average one-night stand. And then it was so hard to leave the next morning. Harder than either of us realized, which we acknowledged. I felt so open with you, so ready to let you know that I didnt want to leave one bit. But I had to, without knowing if it was just one weekend in paradise. But it wasnt. Because sure enough, one month later, you crossed a border for me. A girl you dont know. And we drank and danced and played footsie at dinner, went to the museum and sipped Starbucks and kissed on street corners. And then a quick goodbye, prolonged glances of am I ever going to see you again? But of course we did, almost one month later, right on schedule. And this was the best of them all. We walked and talked, cuddled and chilled. We saw all of Boston because it was your city to show me and boy did we see all of it. I still dont know my way around though because I was too busy watching you be my tour guide. And then I got to be a real part of your life and go to parties with you. I met your friends and they all told me how lovely you are. And the best part? They all knew who I was. You made me feel so special. And then our conversations lying in your bed, wrapped in your arms, our legs twisted around each other. We were even fully clothed. They werent sexual, and in the least corny way possible, they were soulful. I opened myself to you in a way that I really dont know if I ever have to anyone. And it was close to four A.M., lying diagonal upside down on top of your covers with your head on my chest and tears in my eyes that I realized how much Id given you. In the shared space of vulnerability, I never wanted the sun to rise. I wanted to stay in that night forever, listen to you whisper the same words over again as you divulged your side to our story. The repeated playlist, the brightened disposition, the and then I met you. I didnt want to fall asleep because if I could accomplish that, I wouldnt have to wake up and leave you. But as reality would have it, the sun peeked over the Prudential Center and into your window soon after we had surrendered to our drooping eyelids. We woke up late, and for our final act sat in silence. I was tired, hungover, and panicking about what came next. And as cheesy as it is, that is how I love to remember you. In that final half hour, you staring through your long eyelashes trying to read me. And then hasty dressing, hasty packing, hasty Uber ordering. A final kiss upstairs, and one more under surveillance of the driver. I watched you as you watched back from your doorway until I turned the corner and your red shorts flicked out of my existence. And now Im [here]. And youre nine hours away, [there]. Weve missed our monthly meet ups for three months now, and I miss you. I miss you so very much. I dont know yet if I miss what we were, what we could be, what we are not. I might miss what I think we were, what we could be in the future. I just know that those dozen days Ive spent with you were some of the most impactful Ive had in a long time, and I know so little about you. Were a fluke, a happy coincidence, a pair of perpendicular lines. I dont know if I will ever see you again. Maybe this is all this is going to be, our story ends here. And I know if it does, it will be because we are both okay with it. I cant be imagining what I felt that night in your bedroom. Im so happy to know you, Im so happy to be special to you, Im so happy that youre you. Thank you for everything S, youve reached a part of me I didnt know existed yet. "

You took advantage of my vulnerability. I am weak. You preyed on my weakness. At first you made me giddy and happy. Then out of nowhere you ripped it all apart. The worst part is I have to see you nearly every day. Why couldnt you have not told me what you did? You know why you shouldnt have said anything. You made me doubt myself. All because of a vendetta you have against certain people. You are a sick person. You have 2 faces. 1 that is kind and caring. The other that just doesnt care. Your addicition consumes you. You have no idea what affect it has on others around you. You try to emotionally blackmail me and pull me in. Then pretend the next day that nothing happened. How dare you use me because you have a checkered past. How dare you use me for your ego boost. How dare you say you love me. How dare you try and kiss me. Most of all. How dare you continue this when I told you I just want to be friends. I care about you. And I want you to be happy. I cant make you happy. I can listen to you. But you have to want to talk to me. As a friend. Dont tell me you are lonely and need a man. I am not that man to fill your need. I am here as a friend. You took that friendship away from me the moment you wanted something more. I know it breaks you that I wont play your games. I know you cry yourself to sleep. Being with me wont solve your issues. Not in the long term. I opened up to you. As a friend. Hoping, wishing, thinking I finally found a person I can open up to. I wish I didnt. You used me. You are a mess. Dont pull me into your chaos. Why cant we just be friends?"

I won't hope that your thumb hovers over my name for a second too long, a fleeting moment where all you're thinking of is me. No more will I wish to own any of your time, irrespective of how brief and inconsequential. Falling asleep will only be to the soundtrack of other people's heartache or sorrow. I won't recount the amount of times you made me smile in the guise of counting sheep. I will not even think to dream of us in another paradigm. All because I know that in every other possible permutation of us, what we almost had here was the best version of us we could ever be. I shall no longer measure my casual responses against an indeterminate scale of too keen and noncommittal. I'll speak my mind freely and keep my thoughts to myself. Before you I would only speak when spoken to. After you, I'm not so sure I'll speak at all. My writing will naturally suffer because for the past two years you have taken over every single synapse. You've prompted moments of utter clarity whilst simultaneously narrowing my capacity to produce anything of any real creative value. No part of my integrity will remain intact after you, a side effect of having being consumed by all that you are. I'll miss the adrenaline rush after you. I will wonder if I'll ever feel that spike in my blood again. The one that creeps up from the crook of my elbow, almost visible beneath my translucent skin you were once so fixated upon. Where my fingertips once fizzed and tingled just below the surface and I tried to busy my hands, all because you caught my eye and I forgot to breathe. If I do ever experience that sensation again at the hands of someone else I will only compare them to you, I'm sorry. After you, I will avoid men with seemingly easy smiles that serve to mask their desolate eyes. I will resist harder with those who are gently persistent in their pursuit to get to know me. I promise I won't be bought quite so easily by a potent mix of vulnerability and attentiveness, thoughtfulness or concern. After you, I will be harder. I wont be the same. I will no longer be me."

I hardly even know you to be completely honest. Your eyes have always been my favorite feature. Somebody once said that a person's eyes are a window to their soul. I've always felt like I was a good judge of character, the few people that I hold close to me all have one trait in common. Tired eyes. Your eyes however, were the most interesting pair that I had ever seen. They couldn't be described with just a single word. Your eyes told me that you were lost, they showed me sadness, hopelessness, guilt, regret, fear, self loathing, I could go on for ages. The one that stood out the most to me though, was loneliness. This baffled me at the time, how could you possibly be lonely? You're so popular, kind, clever, adventurous, fun, interesting, and absolutely stunning. How could someone so desired by everyone possibly feel lonely? This is the thought that set everything into motion. This is when I realized that you and I weren't so different. This is where I discovered the cause of my own loneliness. People adore me as well. Not to toot my own horn, but there are very few people that dislike me. Everyone wants to be around me, yet I am still lonely. Why am I lonely? It's simple really. I am lonely because these people like my front. Not to say that I am pretending to be someone that I'm not, I'm more so controlling how much of ME they're able to actually see. I am lonely because I know that if they saw the rest of me, they wouldn't even acknowledge my existance. I am lonely because it isn't real. Could it be possible that it was the same way for you? Like I said, I don't really know you. I just know what I felt. Maybe, JUST MAYBE, you were like me. Afraid to show your vulnerability, being strong for others, never faltering, never showing weakness. The person that everyone looks up to. It always kills me when you try to mask your problems with a smile. Your expression tells one story, and your eyes another. This is why I love you. It takes a lot to keep smiling through the pain. I love you because you're strong. I love you because you're caring. I love you because you know how to take the hits as they come. I love you because I admire you. Most of all, I love you because you love me, the real me."

I really wanted to punch you in the face, or just scream at you, or for the love of god just talk. You broke me, and yes, I do blame much of it on you. You had the evil intent, you had the recklessness, you had the cruel and callous view of the world. I had naivet and vulnerability, and I did not use the venom that I so wish I had. I want you to know that you do, in fact, hurt people by simply existing. I also want you to know that that's not normal. Most of the people that I know bring joy by existing. Again, you don't. You cause misery to anyone that truly cares for you (the few on this earth). You told me that I care about my friends too much, but you never said that I cared about you too much. You wanted to own and possess me, and then you got bored. You're literally a sociopathic cancer to goodness in people. I hope you're still addicted to cigarettes, and that that cancerous dependency stays with you for as long as the sick, twisted fragments of you remain in my persona. I'm really proud that I gave you your first cigarette. I hope that you're still crazy and self-loathing and developing shallow, unfulfilling relationships in your life. I hope that the closest thing you ever feel to love is your ex that you punched in the face, and that your life is a waste of the capability of human emotion. I hope that you never develop a strong relationship with an animal. They can sense fucking psychopaths, you know. Unlike me, an animal isn't going to swim through an ocean of red fucking flags out of curiosity and devotion. It will just leave, like I hope all of the people in your life do. I have been trying for years to fix myself because of the manipulative trash that you put me through, and you can't even give me the shred of dignity to speak to me. I cried yesterday because I'm scared of being happy and safe with someone. I ended a relationship a month ago because their actual consideration of my feelings scared me. I'm always wondering what the catch is to happiness, and your cruel manipulation planted that in my heart. You get to live the rest of your life doubtlessly, and I get to look around and find myself in the same god damned place every time. I was sad, I was callous, I was afraid, I was remorseful, but now I'm just angry. Fuck you. I would laugh if you died in a fire of your own fucking creation, Devon. I would go to your funeral to spit on your grave and burn pages of all of the words that I'm now fearless enough to say. Love, Jackie"
775,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,"This time last year, I was in love with you and letting you abuse me.",10,67usur,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/67usur/this_time_last_year_i_was_in_love_with_you_and/,2017-04-27 20:42:31,"Names have been changed. Here is how I understand our relationship. I am a considerably older man, but I have known only one woman in my life in a way that I would call close, and then only for a few years. You know her: Allie. She and I remain close even though she now has a husband. Here is something else you know about me: I am good at friendship, but close relationships fuck me up. You are a young woman. By your own testimony, you have supreme confdence in your seductive ability. You have known many men intimately, several of them much older men, often fucked up to the same degree I am. I played a role in your drama, and you played a role in mine. You gave me exactly what I craved: closeness. I wanted closeness so badly that I was willing to let affection grow between us despite your boyfriend. We were both responsible for letting that happen. You admitted your feelings for me, much too late. In fact, you apologized for ""discouraging"" me. Do you know how ludicrous that is? You didn't discourage me. I would never have made a move under the circumstances. Yet you blamed the course of our relationship on me and my failure to disclose my feelings. You hadn't seen your boyfriend in weeks because you were spending all your free time outside of school and work with me. That was a choice you made. How is it rational or fair to blame me? The whole relationship was fucked up from the start, and we were both a party to it. It is true that there were many good times between us. I genuinely loved the conversation and the intimacy. I have all our correspondence bound, hundreds of pages worth. I've titled it as we always discussed. It is a testament to an extraordinary relationship, which was by the far the most stimulating and creative of any relationship in my life. I do not chalk that up to feelings alone. I chalk it up to the fact that I got along with you like I have never gotten along with anyone else. When we were spending all those many hours together, everything seemed like sunshine and roses. Of course, you know what happened on that sunny day when the roses were in bloom. We didn't talk about it, but the roses concealed something dark. We are both deeply wounded. That is what brought us together. Romantic coupling would have been a bad idea. I wish we could have just been friends, without so much intensity and drama, but I don't think we are capable of that. We *feed* off each other. Memories of us come back to me several times every day, yet it has been four months since we last had words. Some memories bring me joy. Most are sad. Others are surreal. I got one of my biggest omens with you, though I could not have discussed it with you at the time. I regret that. I am sure you would laughed out loud to hear it, were the circmstances not so grave. Do you remember me telling you about the frightening omen I had when I was 19? It was like that, quite a bit different but just as blatant. I am grateful that I abstained from sex. That would have made everything worse. Do you remember coming on to me while you were drunk after the party? Do you have any idea what a difficult position that put me in? I couldn't even discuss it with you. I forgave you instead. That was a mistake, but by that time I had fallen in love with you. I would have forgiven you anything. You know what I think was the most destructive part of the relationship? Healing. We talked often of healing. My wish to heal you and be healed by you came to dominate other important needs that I had. I have come to believe that the healing was a fantasy. What I felt as healing was you preparing me for the abuse that you knew you would not be able to contain for ever. Do you remember asking me what I would do if you became bestial and tore out someone's throat? I said, with a light heart, that I would call police and ambulance and sit with you till they arrived. That reassured you, and I felt good to give you comfort like that. Looking back on things, you gave me ample reason to believe that you are actually capable of something like that. I should have been frightened, but I was in love. You will never read this, and even if you did read it I am not sure you could admit that there is any shred of truth in what I say. Your self-abuse and self-hatred exceeds what anyone else might say about you. No one can reason meaningfully with you when conflict arises. A letter like this would instead open me to one of your blistering verbal assaults. You abuse people who get close to you. You warned me and tested me on this point many times, didn't you? That is why, by your own testament, you would never have a relationship longer than two years. People who presume to care about you become your scapegoats whenever you begin to struggle with intimacy. They tend to be kind-hearted and stalwart, able to endure your intensity and your abuse. I feel for you. I do. I struggle with intimacy in my own way. The difference is that I keep my hurt to myself. I don't want to entangle women in it. When I met you, I thought maybe because you were so hurt you would understand me where others have not. How wrong I was. You frighten me. The last few times we interacted, I was dissociating and getting panic attacks. How is that in any way reasonable? I was almost twice your size. My fear of you is not something I could tell you. I had lost all trust in you. I didn't have the words at the time, but you were my abuser. I am grateful that what scared you off was my insistence on having a serious talk about our relationship. That is my basic expectation in closeness, yet you accused me of trying to ""control"" you through it. It is no wonder that you are so often accused of being immature. You are afraid to admit weakness or vulnerability. You don't understand that forgiveness is real, that I stand in need of your forgiveness as much as you stand in need of mine. When things fell apart between us, I was still in love with you. I'm grateful they fell apart, because I would have been under your spell indefinitely. Do you remember suggesting that my long-time friends were ""no good for me""? You suggested I come hang out with your newly acquired friends instead. What's worse is that agreed with you. I didn't even defend my friends. I thought you were looking out for me, with the pseudo-feeling of safety I felt around you. I'm grateful things fell apart. Looking back on your hundreds of hours of deep personal disclosures, I understand that I was a fool. You once told me that the lyrics of Fiona Apple describe your experience; you said that the familiarity of her reports troubled you. As an example, you said ""it's good to know that the best thing you can do for someone is to never see them and to hope they just go away because you know that you can't control yourself."" You cited Fast As You Can: &gt; I let the beast in too soon, I don't know how to live &gt; Without my hand on his throat; I fight him always and still &gt; Oh darling, it's so sweet, you think you know how crazy &gt; How crazy I am &gt; You say you don't spook easy, you won't go, but I know &gt; And I pray that you will &gt; Fast as you can, baby run, free yourself of me &gt; Fast as you can &gt; I may be soft in your palm but I'll soon grow &gt; Hungry for a fight, and I will not let you win I think there's another song, Criminal, that you would probably also recognize yourself in: &gt; I've been a bad bad girl &gt; I've been careless &gt; With a delicate man &gt; And it's a sad sad world &gt; When a girl will break a boy &gt; Just because she can &gt; Don't you tell me to deny it &gt; I've done wrong and &gt; I want to &gt; Suffer for my sins You've been here before, haven't you? How many times have you played out this same drama? How many lives have you destroyed? I still love you. I miss you. I have blocked you on every account. I hope you don't try to circumvent my defenses. They are feeble, and I don't trust myself to say no. I want what hurts me, and I don't know why."

778,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,She was fucking married and I was the 26 year old she kept talking about and she cheated with someone else because i was oblivious and its the saddest thing ever for both me and her,1,5id14e,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/5id14e/she_was_fucking_married_and_i_was_the_26_year_old/,2016-12-15 07:39:15,"First of all, I apologize for any distress I may have caused a, because that was never my intention. I was never trying to harass a, and I never threatened her. Texting her was my way of trying to escape the intense emotional pain I felt at her loss. I considered Ms. a a good friend and I told her things that I had never told anyone. She was the first person I had told about all the pain I had been keeping inside my whole life. I will write the whole story below but I want to summarize the points Im going to try to make here first. First, it was not an online friendship, we met on the dating section of craigslist and she made it obvious that she was looking to date. We spoke very frequently through text, exchanging a few hundred texts at the very least, and speaking every 3-4 days, usually for an extended period of time. I was always kind and courteous to Ms. a and I listened to her problems and tried to be as comforting and helpful as I could when she told me. Im confused as to why Ms. A chose to say that I became increasingly hostile towards her during our texts. There were two occasions when I called Ms. a out on leading me on, but you will see from my statement below that those were not hostile and were actually justified. The last time we spoke, I had begun to slip into psychosis due to extreme life stressors (being cheated on and emotionally abused by my first girlfriend, my family falling apart, my mothers alcoholism becoming rampant, my father becoming more and more distant, and me having to take on a lot of the duties of caregiver to my sister because of it). Ms. a did not cut me off because I accused her of having my medical records or posting for me online, she said it was not a big deal. She cut me off when I called her a pathological liar after she denied posting for me online (which I still think she may have, but I wont pursue the matter further). Im bringing this up because I believe Ms. a did lie to me a lot, and that may be why that comment made me cut her off. I think its possible that Ms. a was married or in a committed relationship the whole time, and I find it interesting that she never mentioned the person mentioned on the police report, who is around the same age as her, and is listed as living in the same house as her on the police report. However, I cant be certain of this and dont plan to pursue the matter further. Finding Ms. as address was not very hard to do. Im bringing this up so the courts can see that I didnt do anything illegal to get her address and that I never pursued, and do not possess, any information about her that was not publicly available. She gave me her Brothers name, so I simply put her brothers name into facebook and searched by the town that she told me. This gave me her last name, which I then googled, which returned search results with her address and home phone number. I had this information for over a year and a half before I decided to call Ms. as house and eventually visit her, which shows that I had no intention of stalking her or harming her, as I clearly wouldve done it sooner if that were my intention. Going to her house was a last ditch effort to get closure on the emotional pain and confusion that I had been suffereing at her loss for the past two years. The psychologist R.D. Laing says that psychosis is caused by the sufferer experiencing a situation he cant explain, which triggers patterns of thought that the sufferer is unable to escape until he eventually experiences psychosis. I never threatened or tried to harm anyone in my psychosis. Im not at all a violent or malicious person. I was just very confused. I would also like to note that I had started Adderall for ADHD shortly before my psychosis and that my therapist and I believe that its what caused my psychosis. Adderall is also known to increase feelings of infatuation and love, which I believe exacerbated my feelings for Ms. a, as I never felt like I loved her before starting the Adderall, I did however have feelings for Ms. a before this. Before I read my statement. I would like to state that I am deeply appreciative of Ms. a for listening to, and trying to help me with my problems, that I dont have anything against her, and that I understand that sometimes life circumstances collude in a way that causes a well-meaning person to emotionally harm someone else unintentionally. I do not know what was going on in her situation, but I forgive her, and she will never hear from me again. And once again, I apologize for any distress I caused her as my life became incredibly tough after my breakdown and I did not take the best course of action in the situation. Im responsible for my behavior and Ive learned my lesson through this. I gathered from the affidavit that Ms. a thought I was contacting her just to have sex with her, that statement was made immediately after my grandfather died and my whole family went to England to see him and was more in relation to how much of my need to talk to her was based on the shame and humiliation I felt over her seemingly not wanting to be intimate with me, while telling me towards the end of her correspondence that she was being intimate with someone that she didnt like and hadnt kissed in 9 months. I have always been extremely reasonable about sex, and Ive never lied to or pressured a woman into sleeping with me. That statement does not at all reflect who I am as a person. Im not a womanizer, and I havent even been intimate with that many women in my life honestly. Im actually scared of speaking sexually to women due to a complex I picked up in my childhood. I also did not think Ms. a was even getting my texts or voicemails by this point, which caused me to be blas about what I was saying. I would also like to apologize to the courts for being late at the last hearing, as I had not slept the night before, and was experiencing a breakdown of sorts due to the stress of this court case. I would also like to apologize for not coming to the courtroom sooner on my first court date, I didnt know the procedure and thought I would be called in. I was here 45 minutes before that days hearings started, but was 10 minutes late in getting into the court room. Im trying to get my life back together again, Ive signed up to drive for lyft and Im planning on attending school again in the spring. I plan on moving to New York if Im not assigned a probationary period or if the charges are dropped today. I believe that psychosis is misunderstood and I can understand why Ms. a, the police, and the courts have reacted the way they did, since it can be a very unstable disorder, but I have never been violent or intentionally tried to harm anyone, even at my worst. I do not blame anyone for anything. I would just like to move on with my life and have a chance to do the things I want to do. I havent touched any substances in over a week, and I have not used anything but marijuana and alcohol in almost a year now, and I dont plan to use any substances ever again, as they exacerbate my mental health conditions. I do not have a persistent delusional disorder, as it seems to be isolated incidents triggered by extreme stress. Im not sure what my working diagnoses are yet, since Ive only been back in therapy for 2 months, but Complex PTSD and Aspergers seem to fit me, and my therapist agreed that I present in a way that could be that, but that its too early to make a diagnosis. Im not currently experiencing any delusions or suicidal ideation, and I feel as though I am starting to regain control of my situation, and my issues, again. I plan on telling the whole entire story in as objective of a way as possible. I dont want to make Ms. a look worse than she was and I dont want to make myself look better than I am. The statement Im giving is 100% the truth and I would even be willing to take a lie detector test to prove that Im not lying. I met Liz in June of 2013. I posted an ad on the craigslist personals dating section, and Liz responded. We began talking and we eventually set up a date. I would like to note that Ms. a came on very strong during these emails, saying that people talking about their passions makes her love them, that she was afraid I would think she was going to stalk me, and sending me a song called listener by wooden heart, which sort of worried me that she was going to stalk me as the lyrics talk in depthly about two people joining themselves together in a way that was a bit intense. She repeatedly told me that she was enjoying our emails. I do not think this was intentional, as I think that both me and Ms. a have a tendency to develop feelings for people very fast, but it did make the situation tougher to deal with. Me and Ms. a set up a date and we met at Arnold Arboretum the following Sunday. We walked around and talked for at least 3 hours before parting ways, with Ms. a telling me to tell her if she was texting me too much. Ms. a texted me later that night to tell me that she had a good time and we agreed to meet again. I texted Ms. A a week later and she said she couldnt meet up that weekend. I decided to give her space and didnt hear from her for two more weeks, at which point she texted me saying that she still wanted to meet, and that shes been busy, and that she didnt want me to think her silence was caused by something I said. We then texted some more and Ms. a once again agreed to hang out and then didnt follow through. At this point, I called Ms.a out on leading me on. I told her that she could just tell me if she didnt want to hang out again that Id been rejected before and that it wasnt a huge deal. Ms. a treated the claims as unfounded and accused me of hurting her with my anger, even though I was not speaking maliciously or with particular anger at the time. She told me that she wanted to meet still but that it was not something she could do every weekend, to which I questioned why she would respond to a dating ad, and come on so strong, if she didnt want a serious relationship. Ms. a responded that of course she was looking to date, but that shes been busy lately, we resolved the situation, she said she was still interested, and she told me she would text me next time she had a free day so that we could hang out. It was around this time that I really started to open up about my problems, and I would like to again state that Im extremely appreciative of Ms. as willingness to listen, and of her compassion and empathy. Me and ms. a continued texting after this. We spoke about a lot of things. I asked to hang out a few more times, which Ms. a agreed to, but never followed through. This push-pull behavior was extremely distressing mentally, more so for me because I have attachment and abandonment issues which caused her behavior to hurt more. I began to give up on the situation after asking if she wanted to go hiking and having her tell me that she had to get a haircut on that day. I stopped texting her and two weeks later I received a text from Ms. a saying that she was just thinking about me and wondering how I was doing that she thought about me often and was hoping I was still slogging through it all. This pattern was repeated multiple times during our interaction. Every time I showed interest, she pulled away, and every time I pulled away, she showed interest. I believe that this was a misunderstanding due to Ms. a recognizing possible relationship issues with me that I was not aware of, and her not wanting to get involved until I had become aware of them, and started to work on them. It was not the best course of action, as I wouldve liked her to be direct with me, but I do understand. We exchanged a few more texts before we stopped talking. We didnt speak again until I believe April of 2014, when I texted Ms. a and we resumed communication. We spoke briefly about our lives, and Ms. a seemed to hint strongly at wanting a non-committed relationship with me, which I balked at due to a crippling fear of intimacy, and also because its very hard for me to read social signals and hints, which is why Im discussing autism spectrum disorders with my therapist. Im bringing this up because I believe it may have been a subtle way for Ms. a to communicate that she didnt want a committed relationship with me, and that this may have been the source of the whole misunderstanding. As I began to assume she was just messing with me, but she may have kept her distance due to her sensing that I might not be in a good enough place for a committed relationship. I texted her again a few days later and asked if she wanted to hang out, to which she replied that she couldnt right now, because she was experiencing a rough patch, but definitely keep in touch. I got into a relationship with a woman with BPD after this, one in which I was abused emotionally, teased sexually, stolen from, and then cheated on. My phone also went missing from my pocket (I never forget my phone anywhere) one night and I believe she may have keylogged it, as she told me she was good with technology and that her and her ex had considered keylogging eachother, so I know shes capable of it. Im bring this up because I believe this wouldve given my ex access to all of my personal information, as well as my texts with ms. ah, and also access to my emails with her, and I believe that it may have actually been my ex who messed with me online using this information. This relationship completely destroyed and emasculated me. A few days after we broke up, I texted Ms. a again, and I told her about my relationship, and she told me about her relationship with a 26 year old, that cheated on her, spent all her money, all the while telling (her) what a shit person she was. I asked if she wanted to hang out, and she agreed. I told her to text me whenever she wanted to hang out, but she didnt text me for the next month. Eventually I texted her, simply saying hey, and she did not respond. I texted again a few days later and said I dont get you to which I received a long winded, and accusatory rant from Ms. a, saying you dont get me because I didnt respond to one text during the week from hell with family parties and whatnot, she then became accusatory and said that she had felt my anger before which I believe was a case of psychological projection due to the angry tone of her response, which Im not judging for because I generally do believe Ms. a was incredibly stressed at the time and this may have been a cry for help. Howeber, she once again acted like my statements were unfounded, and refused to accept any sort of responsibility for her behavior. I responded that I found it disrespectful and that I didnt have time for someone who didnt have the decency to send a quick text response. The next day, I began to fear losing Ms. a from my life (abandonment issues) and I texted her and said I was sorry, and that I wanted to talk again. She sent me a long-winded rant about how hard her life was and how all she did was give and give and give, while all everyone in her life did was take and take and take. I may have issues with how Ms. a treated me, but I do believe that she is a very emotionally giving person, and the type that would listen to anyones problems and try to help them out whenever she can, so I dont doubt the validity of this statement. I responded kindly and told her that I was also really struggling also and that I was attending my first therapy session the next day, of which she was very encouraging. She offered advice on seeking therapy and even texted me after the therapy session to ask how it went. Once again, Im deeply grateful that Ms. a was so emotionally supportive of me, because not many people will go out of their way like that. I dont believe I wouldve ever gone to therapy if Ms. a hadnt suggested the idea, and Im incredibly appreciative of that. Me and Ms. a started speaking more than ever after this, and we both opened up a lot about things going on in our lives. I told her about my family situation, and how it was all falling apart and how I was trying to keep it together and get them all to go to therapy. I told her about how my father and mother were, and how I was having to fill in as a parent for my little sister due to my parents issues. She told me about some very personal things. Our correspondence was pleasant, and we were both supportive and encouraging towards eachother. I dont believe I asked Ms. a to hang out again this time, because I was too scared of rejection. We continued to speak until late July, in which I asked Ms. a if she wanted to hang out again in September after her daughter had gone back to school, to which she replied yea, maybe, its tough to tell what Ill be up to in September though. At this point, my relationship with Ms. a had become too emotionally distressing (as I had strong feelings for her) and I decided that I needed to stop texting her so much. It was also around this time that I visited the ER for the first time because of suicidal ideation (of which I had been suffering from seriously for over 6 years at this point). I didnt speak to Ms. a again for a month. When I texted Ms. a again about a month later, she seemed different, but Im not sure why. It was during this time that Ms. a decided to tell me about her still being intimate with the abusive ex and for some reason decided to add that they had still been sleeping together despite not even kissing eachother. She also told me about a dream she had in which she kissed a guy she really liked and that it got her excited for the future, which was both confusing and upsetting as I wasnt sure if she was talking about me in some weird indirect way, or if she was talking about wanting to date someone else. I can understand that maybe Ms. a just needed to talk to someone about these things and she didnt fully realize the emotional harm it would cause me. And If I hadnt been so lonely, and still holding out for her at the time, that is if I had been able to just be a friend, then it wouldnt have been a big deal. These statement rang my head for the next two years, as it was humiliating to me that she wouldnt even hang out with me but would sleep with someone whom she didnt even like enough to kiss. The humiliation lessoned once I realized that Ms. a had hinted at wanting to be intimate with me multiple times during our communications and I was completely oblivious to it. I had also been left by my previous girlfriend for an abusive man, and what she said made all of those feelings resurface, as I had been trying to block them out up until this point. It was extremely upsetting, and a few day later, I called Ms. a out on leading me on again. She said that wasnt what she was doing but I didnt relent. I no longer believe that it was her intention to lead me on, and that she simply did not want a committed relationship with me. The first few months of texting may have been a different story, but the second time was simply a misunderstanding. (To erich, Im trying to be as thorough as possible so that the court can see why I reacted the way I did, but Im wondering if I should leave this out) This triggered my abandonment as I had become quite attached to Ms. a by this point. Over the next week or so, I sent her several long-winded texts, explaining why I got upset and telling her that I really wanted her in my life, that I was fine with friendship and that she had helped me a lot. She didnt respond. I eventually texted her and said that it was clear that she didnt want to talk to me and that I would leave her alone. The next day, I received a text from Ms. a saying that she had enjoyed reading my texts but wasnt in a place where she could talk right now but that we could see where thing were at in a few months. I started Adderall 3 days later. I began severely undereating and had more trouble sleeping than usual, the Adderall also increased my cigarette intake a substantial amount, as well as my feelings for ms a, both of which I hear are common. In short, I was very overstimulated, fragile and hurt at the time, which is why I ended up starting to search for posts from Ms. a on the missed connections section of craigslist, of which I had rarely visited, and never posted on, before. Before I go any further, I would like to say that all of what Im going to describe next could have been paranoia, but that Im personally convinced that at least some of it was real. I dont plan on pursuing any action against anyone, and Ive accepted that I will never know what happened and come to peace with the uncertainty of the situation. Im being thorough because I assumed Ms. A would be here today and that she might have confusing feelings about what happened here, feelings which hearing the whole story might be able to resolve. I was a victim in this situation, not a perpetrator. I began searching craigslist missed connections to see if Ms. a posted for me. I did not take any of the posts seriously until I saw one that had Ms. as age and seemed to be talking about our situation. I remember thinking that it couldnt be from her, but the information in it, as well as the writing style, were too much to be ignored (my ex was very clever and couldve easily imitated Ms. as writing style. I think its also possible that Ms. a posted these first few ads with a genuine intent, to avoid the vulnerability of rejection face to face, and that she did not realize how fragile I was at the time). This post was deleted the next day and after that 3 more posts showed up in the same writing style one consecutive, all of which were deleted the day after they were posted. This is what caused me to become convinced that Ms. a was posting for me. I went overboard and began searching for posts from her on those boards as well as other boards. Posts started showing up on a subreddit that my ex had told me about that seemed to have extremely specific information about me, information that I hadnt told anyone. Once again, this could be paranoia, but it seemed real to me. Ive come to peace with the situation and I no longer think people are posting for me online. I texted Ms. a to ask if she had been posting for me, and did not believe her when she said she hadnt been, which probably was quite distressing. Ms. a said it wasnt her but that it wasnt a big deal. She did not cut me off until I called her a pathological liar, that was the last message she ever responded to. I would like to note that Ms. a said dont text me anymore, and Im bringing that up because the evidence presented against me comes from voice communication, which she had not directly told me she did not want me to do. I believe that there are very malicious people who hang out online to try and mess with others, and that I caught the attention of these people when I made a post for Ms. a, after reading what I thought was a post from her. I believe that these people couldve gained enough information from my posts, and used it to mess with me. I also spoke to a schizophrenic girl that hung out online and read way too much into what she said due to my vulnerability and psychosis making me extremely suggestible. I believe I shared a folie a deux with her, which is when one person adopts another persons delusions due to constant interaction with them, and that was a big cause of my psychosis, as I exchanged hundreds of emails with this woman. I believe that my attachment to Ms. a was increased tenfold by this experience. I also managed to get in trouble by talking to someone online whom I thought was Ms. a and then going to visit her. I left when I saw it wasnt her. I called her a few days later and told her about the messages online. She texted me later and said she had a boyfriend that had found out about us talking and that he wanted to kill me. I had told them about the boards I had been going to, and shortly after death threats started showing up on the craigslist missed connections section. This terrified me and severely traumatized me, as I was positive someone wanted to hurt me and my family, and I ended up in the hospital a few weeks later. I became convinced there was some sort of conspiracy against me and that Ms. a might be in on it, which was delusional of course. This is all very hard to explain and Im trying to keep it short for brevities sake but I can go more in-depth if needed. I believe that this is part of the reason I felt such a need to contact Ms. a over the next two years. The amount of false information that I read online made me extremely confused and I lost sight of the fact that what Ms. a told me was probably very close to the truth, even if she was hiding something. I tried calling Ms. a twice of the next few months and sent her a few texts, all of which were pleasant. The next six months were nothing short of torture and I began to feel as though Ms. a was just messing with me, which made me feel extremely betrayed, as she was the first person I ever trusted enough to open up to. I did not start to seriously attempt to contact Ms. a again until things got to the point that I had started to plan my suicide, which was a year after my breakdown. I took a trip with my family to Salisbury beach shortly before I texted her, which triggered me because its extremely close to West Newbury and Newburyport and every sign with either of those town names on it reminded me of her. I assumed that Ms. a was not getting anything I sent her, and I began to text her as a way of working out my feelings towards the situation. I met someone during this time who saved my life by listening to all of my delusions without judging me or trying to tell me that they werent real. I managed to straighten out my head, and left a few voicemails for Ms. a apologizing for my actions, wishing her well, saying that I dont blame her for anything, and that I would always be in her corner, regardless of how she felt about me or if she ever talked to me again. Im giving the short version of the story here. But the year and 3 months between my breakdown (which occurred on September 29th) and my going to California were nothing short of Hell. It would take me a long time to explain the situation, so I wont go into it. But I basically spent most of the time in my room, dissociating, crying, laying in bed, and scouring the internet looking for some sort of resolution to my situation. I believe I was drawn to the internet because what happened to me there was very traumatic and they say that re-experiencing trauma can give the traumatized person a sense of mastery over the situation. I left for California in February of this year and did not plan on contacting Ms.a again. I quit drinking and smoking and exercised and ate a very healthy vegan diet. I was very productive and began to work towards doing things I had always wanted to do. About a month after I moved, I met a girl name Lizz, who gave me her number and then ignored my texts, and it brought back all of the feelings. I began to call and text Ms. a again. This continued on and off during my time in California. I was never outright insulting, and I was definitely never malicious. I did say that I thought it was very mean of Ms. a to ignore me and cut me off and I told her exactly what I thought of her behavior. I attempted to stop contacting her several times but could not come to terms with what happened and kept getting brought back to the situation. This continued until June of 2016, in which I planned on briefly returning home in between semesters at college (I was studying psychology and Music and got straight As). I would also like to note that I lived with a very cliquey group of popepl in LA and that they had ganged up on me, stolen from me, and threatened me physically, which caused me even more emotional distress. Shortly after I got home, my grandfather died and my whole family went to England for his funeral. I was left alone with thoughts I couldnt cope with and sort of fell apart again. I began attempting to contact Ms. a and eventually decided to call her house phone, I did not call three times beforehand, I called once, got nervous and hung up, and then called back again a few minutes later and left a message. I did not get the message that officer Johnson left for me on my parents phone, as I never check their messages since theyre not for me. I wasnt even aware of it until I read about it on the affidavit, after which I immediately contacted Officer Johnson in an attempt to resolve the situation. I respect law enforcement, despite what the Westminster police may think due to our altercations, and I wouldnt have gone there had I heard the messages. Going to her house was a last ditch effort to gain closure on the situation. I heard someone working in the backyard and was worried about a confrontation if I went into the backyard so I decided to wait by the front door, and knock, until someone came out. Ms. a eventually saw me at the door (I wasnt sure if it was her because I didnt have my glasses) and I smiled and waved at her. She called for her brother and I spoke with him pleasantly. I was still very nervous when I spoke to him but did not push the matter or attempt to speak to Ms. a when he made it clear that she didnt want to speak. I respected her right to not want to talk to me, and I hope that the fact I was calm and did not cause a scene or even get upset will reinforce the fact that I was not acting maliciously by going there. I shook her brothers hand, and left, he seemed like a very nice and cool person. Two days later, I texted Ms. a and said that going to her house was all I could do, that I accepted she didnt want to talk to me and that I would leave her alone from now on. The next day, I was served the harassment prevention order. I told the serving officer that it wasnt necessary and that I would never speak to Ms. a again, but apparently it was too late at that point. I would not have continued contacting Ms. a if she, or anyone she knew, had contacted me directly and told me to stop during the two years. I didnt think she was getting my messages and I was extremely worried that something had happened to her at times. I would like to bring up to the courts that my therapist and I have been talking about me suffering from some sort of autism spectrum disorder, as well as CPTSD, and that both of these things influenced my behavior. Im worried that Ms. a thought I was acting maliciously, or that Im an inherently malicious person, and if needed, I can provide a lot of character witness who will say that I am not at all a malicious or conniving person. Im actually a very understanding and kind person, and Ive gone out of my way to attempt to help a lot of people in my lifetime. I never wanted revenge on Ms. a, and I always wanted the best for her, other than times when I was extremely upset and thought that she was just messing with me. I have also never persistently texted someone like that before I met Ms. a. It seems to be an isolated incident due to the complexity of the situation. I no longer suffer from delusions and I am drug and alcohol free and plan on staying that way. Im in therapy and taking steps towards reclaiming my life. I have a lot of hopes and dreams for the future, and I wanted to be a counselor or music therapist, which I would probably not be able to do if this went on my record. Im more than willing to go through a probationary period if it will keep the criminal harassment charges off my record, and Ill cooperate with the courts in any way possible to get a resolution to this scenario which does not negatively affect my life. I would like to state once again that it was not at all my intention to harass Ms. a and that I deeply cared for Ms. A. I found her to be kind, tough, fascinating, modest, charming, extremely intelligent and very beautiful. My current feelings for her are platonic in nature, I appreciate her as a human and I really, really want her to be happy. The psychologist R.D. Laing says that psychosis is caused by someone experiencing a situation that they cant explain or process. The person gets stuck in repetitive patterns of thought in an attempt to explain the situation, or what Laing calls incompatible knots of thinking, until the person eventually disconnects from reality and begins to use delusions to cope with the stress. I believe the whole situation was just a huge misunderstanding and I have finally gotten closure and fully understand the situation. I do not have any more delusional thoughts about what happened between me and Ms. a. I will never contact Ms. a again, but I feel as though part of me will always care as she cared about me and my issues when I really needed someone to. I really, really hope that she finds happiness in the future, because I think she is a special person, and I think she deserves be happy. I wish her the best and I will never contact her again. I was unsure of whether Ms. a would be here today, but Im hoping that what Ive read her can help her move on if she has any unresolved feelings about this situation. IGNORING ME WAS WHAT MADE IT TERRIBLE. WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST FUCKING TELL ME IN PRIVATE"
779,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,the whole story,0,5id3al,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/5id3al/the_whole_story/,2016-12-15 07:49:19,"First of all, I apologize for any distress I may have caused a, because that was never my intention. I was never trying to harass a, and I never threatened her. Texting her was my way of trying to escape the intense emotional pain I felt at her loss. I considered Ms. a a good friend and I told her things that I had never told anyone. She was the first person I had told about all the pain I had been keeping inside my whole life. I will write the whole story below but I want to summarize the points Im going to try to make here first. First, it was not an online friendship, we met on the dating section of craigslist and she made it obvious that she was looking to date. We spoke very frequently through text, exchanging a few hundred texts at the very least, and speaking every 3-4 days, usually for an extended period of time. I was always kind and courteous to Ms. a and I listened to her problems and tried to be as comforting and helpful as I could when she told me. Im confused as to why Ms. A chose to say that I became increasingly hostile towards her during our texts. There were two occasions when I called Ms. a out on leading me on, but you will see from my statement below that those were not hostile and were actually justified. The last time we spoke, I had begun to slip into psychosis due to extreme life stressors (being cheated on and emotionally abused by my first girlfriend, my family falling apart, my mothers alcoholism becoming rampant, my father becoming more and more distant, and me having to take on a lot of the duties of caregiver to my sister because of it). Ms. a did not cut me off because I accused her of having my medical records or posting for me online, she said it was not a big deal. She cut me off when I called her a pathological liar after she denied posting for me online (which I still think she may have, but I wont pursue the matter further). Im bringing this up because I believe Ms. a did lie to me a lot, and that may be why that comment made me cut her off. I think its possible that Ms. a was married or in a committed relationship the whole time, and I find it interesting that she never mentioned the person mentioned on the police report, who is around the same age as her, and is listed as living in the same house as her on the police report. However, I cant be certain of this and dont plan to pursue the matter further. Finding Ms. as address was not very hard to do. Im bringing this up so the courts can see that I didnt do anything illegal to get her address and that I never pursued, and do not possess, any information about her that was not publicly available. She gave me her Brothers name, so I simply put her brothers name into facebook and searched by the town that she told me. This gave me her last name, which I then googled, which returned search results with her address and home phone number. I had this information for over a year and a half before I decided to call Ms. as house and eventually visit her, which shows that I had no intention of stalking her or harming her, as I clearly wouldve done it sooner if that were my intention. Going to her house was a last ditch effort to get closure on the emotional pain and confusion that I had been suffereing at her loss for the past two years. The psychologist R.D. Laing says that psychosis is caused by the sufferer experiencing a situation he cant explain, which triggers patterns of thought that the sufferer is unable to escape until he eventually experiences psychosis. I never threatened or tried to harm anyone in my psychosis. Im not at all a violent or malicious person. I was just very confused. I would also like to note that I had started Adderall for ADHD shortly before my psychosis and that my therapist and I believe that its what caused my psychosis. Adderall is also known to increase feelings of infatuation and love, which I believe exacerbated my feelings for Ms. a, as I never felt like I loved her before starting the Adderall, I did however have feelings for Ms. a before this. Before I read my statement. I would like to state that I am deeply appreciative of Ms. a for listening to, and trying to help me with my problems, that I dont have anything against her, and that I understand that sometimes life circumstances collude in a way that causes a well-meaning person to emotionally harm someone else unintentionally. I do not know what was going on in her situation, but I forgive her, and she will never hear from me again. And once again, I apologize for any distress I caused her as my life became incredibly tough after my breakdown and I did not take the best course of action in the situation. Im responsible for my behavior and Ive learned my lesson through this. I gathered from the affidavit that Ms. a thought I was contacting her just to have sex with her, that statement was made immediately after my grandfather died and my whole family went to England to see him and was more in relation to how much of my need to talk to her was based on the shame and humiliation I felt over her seemingly not wanting to be intimate with me, while telling me towards the end of her correspondence that she was being intimate with someone that she didnt like and hadnt kissed in 9 months. I have always been extremely reasonable about sex, and Ive never lied to or pressured a woman into sleeping with me. That statement does not at all reflect who I am as a person. Im not a womanizer, and I havent even been intimate with that many women in my life honestly. Im actually scared of speaking sexually to women due to a complex I picked up in my childhood. I also did not think Ms. a was even getting my texts or voicemails by this point, which caused me to be blas about what I was saying. I would also like to apologize to the courts for being late at the last hearing, as I had not slept the night before, and was experiencing a breakdown of sorts due to the stress of this court case. I would also like to apologize for not coming to the courtroom sooner on my first court date, I didnt know the procedure and thought I would be called in. I was here 45 minutes before that days hearings started, but was 10 minutes late in getting into the court room. Im trying to get my life back together again, Ive signed up to drive for lyft and Im planning on attending school again in the spring. I plan on moving to New York if Im not assigned a probationary period or if the charges are dropped today. I believe that psychosis is misunderstood and I can understand why Ms. a, the police, and the courts have reacted the way they did, since it can be a very unstable disorder, but I have never been violent or intentionally tried to harm anyone, even at my worst. I do not blame anyone for anything. I would just like to move on with my life and have a chance to do the things I want to do. I havent touched any substances in over a week, and I have not used anything but marijuana and alcohol in almost a year now, and I dont plan to use any substances ever again, as they exacerbate my mental health conditions. I do not have a persistent delusional disorder, as it seems to be isolated incidents triggered by extreme stress. Im not sure what my working diagnoses are yet, since Ive only been back in therapy for 2 months, but Complex PTSD and Aspergers seem to fit me, and my therapist agreed that I present in a way that could be that, but that its too early to make a diagnosis. Im not currently experiencing any delusions or suicidal ideation, and I feel as though I am starting to regain control of my situation, and my issues, again. I plan on telling the whole entire story in as objective of a way as possible. I dont want to make Ms. a look worse than she was and I dont want to make myself look better than I am. The statement Im giving is 100% the truth and I would even be willing to take a lie detector test to prove that Im not lying. I met Liz in June of 2013. I posted an ad on the craigslist personals dating section, and Liz responded. We began talking and we eventually set up a date. I would like to note that Ms. a came on very strong during these emails, saying that people talking about their passions makes her love them, that she was afraid I would think she was going to stalk me, and sending me a song called listener by wooden heart, which sort of worried me that she was going to stalk me as the lyrics talk in depthly about two people joining themselves together in a way that was a bit intense. She repeatedly told me that she was enjoying our emails. I do not think this was intentional, as I think that both me and Ms. a have a tendency to develop feelings for people very fast, but it did make the situation tougher to deal with. Me and Ms. a set up a date and we met at Arnold Arboretum the following Sunday. We walked around and talked for at least 3 hours before parting ways, with Ms. a telling me to tell her if she was texting me too much. Ms. a texted me later that night to tell me that she had a good time and we agreed to meet again. I texted Ms. A a week later and she said she couldnt meet up that weekend. I decided to give her space and didnt hear from her for two more weeks, at which point she texted me saying that she still wanted to meet, and that shes been busy, and that she didnt want me to think her silence was caused by something I said. We then texted some more and Ms. a once again agreed to hang out and then didnt follow through. At this point, I called Ms.a out on leading me on. I told her that she could just tell me if she didnt want to hang out again that Id been rejected before and that it wasnt a huge deal. Ms. a treated the claims as unfounded and accused me of hurting her with my anger, even though I was not speaking maliciously or with particular anger at the time. She told me that she wanted to meet still but that it was not something she could do every weekend, to which I questioned why she would respond to a dating ad, and come on so strong, if she didnt want a serious relationship. Ms. a responded that of course she was looking to date, but that shes been busy lately, we resolved the situation, she said she was still interested, and she told me she would text me next time she had a free day so that we could hang out. It was around this time that I really started to open up about my problems, and I would like to again state that Im extremely appreciative of Ms. as willingness to listen, and of her compassion and empathy. Me and ms. a continued texting after this. We spoke about a lot of things. I asked to hang out a few more times, which Ms. a agreed to, but never followed through. This push-pull behavior was extremely distressing mentally, more so for me because I have attachment and abandonment issues which caused her behavior to hurt more. I began to give up on the situation after asking if she wanted to go hiking and having her tell me that she had to get a haircut on that day. I stopped texting her and two weeks later I received a text from Ms. a saying that she was just thinking about me and wondering how I was doing that she thought about me often and was hoping I was still slogging through it all. This pattern was repeated multiple times during our interaction. Every time I showed interest, she pulled away, and every time I pulled away, she showed interest. I believe that this was a misunderstanding due to Ms. a recognizing possible relationship issues with me that I was not aware of, and her not wanting to get involved until I had become aware of them, and started to work on them. It was not the best course of action, as I wouldve liked her to be direct with me, but I do understand. We exchanged a few more texts before we stopped talking. We didnt speak again until I believe April of 2014, when I texted Ms. a and we resumed communication. We spoke briefly about our lives, and Ms. a seemed to hint strongly at wanting a non-committed relationship with me, which I balked at due to a crippling fear of intimacy, and also because its very hard for me to read social signals and hints, which is why Im discussing autism spectrum disorders with my therapist. Im bringing this up because I believe it may have been a subtle way for Ms. a to communicate that she didnt want a committed relationship with me, and that this may have been the source of the whole misunderstanding. As I began to assume she was just messing with me, but she may have kept her distance due to her sensing that I might not be in a good enough place for a committed relationship. I texted her again a few days later and asked if she wanted to hang out, to which she replied that she couldnt right now, because she was experiencing a rough patch, but definitely keep in touch. I got into a relationship with a woman with BPD after this, one in which I was abused emotionally, teased sexually, stolen from, and then cheated on. My phone also went missing from my pocket (I never forget my phone anywhere) one night and I believe she may have keylogged it, as she told me she was good with technology and that her and her ex had considered keylogging eachother, so I know shes capable of it. Im bring this up because I believe this wouldve given my ex access to all of my personal information, as well as my texts with ms. ah, and also access to my emails with her, and I believe that it may have actually been my ex who messed with me online using this information. This relationship completely destroyed and emasculated me. A few days after we broke up, I texted Ms. a again, and I told her about my relationship, and she told me about her relationship with a 26 year old, that cheated on her, spent all her money, all the while telling (her) what a shit person she was. I asked if she wanted to hang out, and she agreed. I told her to text me whenever she wanted to hang out, but she didnt text me for the next month. Eventually I texted her, simply saying hey, and she did not respond. I texted again a few days later and said I dont get you to which I received a long winded, and accusatory rant from Ms. a, saying you dont get me because I didnt respond to one text during the week from hell with family parties and whatnot, she then became accusatory and said that she had felt my anger before which I believe was a case of psychological projection due to the angry tone of her response, which Im not judging for because I generally do believe Ms. a was incredibly stressed at the time and this may have been a cry for help. Howeber, she once again acted like my statements were unfounded, and refused to accept any sort of responsibility for her behavior. I responded that I found it disrespectful and that I didnt have time for someone who didnt have the decency to send a quick text response. The next day, I began to fear losing Ms. a from my life (abandonment issues) and I texted her and said I was sorry, and that I wanted to talk again. She sent me a long-winded rant about how hard her life was and how all she did was give and give and give, while all everyone in her life did was take and take and take. I may have issues with how Ms. a treated me, but I do believe that she is a very emotionally giving person, and the type that would listen to anyones problems and try to help them out whenever she can, so I dont doubt the validity of this statement. I responded kindly and told her that I was also really struggling also and that I was attending my first therapy session the next day, of which she was very encouraging. She offered advice on seeking therapy and even texted me after the therapy session to ask how it went. Once again, Im deeply grateful that Ms. a was so emotionally supportive of me, because not many people will go out of their way like that. I dont believe I wouldve ever gone to therapy if Ms. a hadnt suggested the idea, and Im incredibly appreciative of that. Me and Ms. a started speaking more than ever after this, and we both opened up a lot about things going on in our lives. I told her about my family situation, and how it was all falling apart and how I was trying to keep it together and get them all to go to therapy. I told her about how my father and mother were, and how I was having to fill in as a parent for my little sister due to my parents issues. She told me about some very personal things. Our correspondence was pleasant, and we were both supportive and encouraging towards eachother. I dont believe I asked Ms. a to hang out again this time, because I was too scared of rejection. We continued to speak until late July, in which I asked Ms. a if she wanted to hang out again in September after her daughter had gone back to school, to which she replied yea, maybe, its tough to tell what Ill be up to in September though. At this point, my relationship with Ms. a had become too emotionally distressing (as I had strong feelings for her) and I decided that I needed to stop texting her so much. It was also around this time that I visited the ER for the first time because of suicidal ideation (of which I had been suffering from seriously for over 6 years at this point). I didnt speak to Ms. a again for a month. When I texted Ms. a again about a month later, she seemed different, but Im not sure why. It was during this time that Ms. a decided to tell me about her still being intimate with the abusive ex and for some reason decided to add that they had still been sleeping together despite not even kissing eachother. She also told me about a dream she had in which she kissed a guy she really liked and that it got her excited for the future, which was both confusing and upsetting as I wasnt sure if she was talking about me in some weird indirect way, or if she was talking about wanting to date someone else. I can understand that maybe Ms. a just needed to talk to someone about these things and she didnt fully realize the emotional harm it would cause me. And If I hadnt been so lonely, and still holding out for her at the time, that is if I had been able to just be a friend, then it wouldnt have been a big deal. These statement rang my head for the next two years, as it was humiliating to me that she wouldnt even hang out with me but would sleep with someone whom she didnt even like enough to kiss. The humiliation lessoned once I realized that Ms. a had hinted at wanting to be intimate with me multiple times during our communications and I was completely oblivious to it. I had also been left by my previous girlfriend for an abusive man, and what she said made all of those feelings resurface, as I had been trying to block them out up until this point. It was extremely upsetting, and a few day later, I called Ms. a out on leading me on again. She said that wasnt what she was doing but I didnt relent. I no longer believe that it was her intention to lead me on, and that she simply did not want a committed relationship with me. The first few months of texting may have been a different story, but the second time was simply a misunderstanding. (To erich, Im trying to be as thorough as possible so that the court can see why I reacted the way I did, but Im wondering if I should leave this out) This triggered my abandonment as I had become quite attached to Ms. a by this point. Over the next week or so, I sent her several long-winded texts, explaining why I got upset and telling her that I really wanted her in my life, that I was fine with friendship and that she had helped me a lot. She didnt respond. I eventually texted her and said that it was clear that she didnt want to talk to me and that I would leave her alone. The next day, I received a text from Ms. a saying that she had enjoyed reading my texts but wasnt in a place where she could talk right now but that we could see where thing were at in a few months. I started Adderall 3 days later. I began severely undereating and had more trouble sleeping than usual, the Adderall also increased my cigarette intake a substantial amount, as well as my feelings for ms a, both of which I hear are common. In short, I was very overstimulated, fragile and hurt at the time, which is why I ended up starting to search for posts from Ms. a on the missed connections section of craigslist, of which I had rarely visited, and never posted on, before. Before I go any further, I would like to say that all of what Im going to describe next could have been paranoia, but that Im personally convinced that at least some of it was real. I dont plan on pursuing any action against anyone, and Ive accepted that I will never know what happened and come to peace with the uncertainty of the situation. Im being thorough because I assumed Ms. A would be here today and that she might have confusing feelings about what happened here, feelings which hearing the whole story might be able to resolve. I was a victim in this situation, not a perpetrator. I began searching craigslist missed connections to see if Ms. a posted for me. I did not take any of the posts seriously until I saw one that had Ms. as age and seemed to be talking about our situation. I remember thinking that it couldnt be from her, but the information in it, as well as the writing style, were too much to be ignored (my ex was very clever and couldve easily imitated Ms. as writing style. I think its also possible that Ms. a posted these first few ads with a genuine intent, to avoid the vulnerability of rejection face to face, and that she did not realize how fragile I was at the time). This post was deleted the next day and after that 3 more posts showed up in the same writing style one consecutive, all of which were deleted the day after they were posted. This is what caused me to become convinced that Ms. a was posting for me. I went overboard and began searching for posts from her on those boards as well as other boards. Posts started showing up on a subreddit that my ex had told me about that seemed to have extremely specific information about me, information that I hadnt told anyone. Once again, this could be paranoia, but it seemed real to me. Ive come to peace with the situation and I no longer think people are posting for me online. I texted Ms. a to ask if she had been posting for me, and did not believe her when she said she hadnt been, which probably was quite distressing. Ms. a said it wasnt her but that it wasnt a big deal. She did not cut me off until I called her a pathological liar, that was the last message she ever responded to. I would like to note that Ms. a said dont text me anymore, and Im bringing that up because the evidence presented against me comes from voice communication, which she had not directly told me she did not want me to do. I believe that there are very malicious people who hang out online to try and mess with others, and that I caught the attention of these people when I made a post for Ms. a, after reading what I thought was a post from her. I believe that these people couldve gained enough information from my posts, and used it to mess with me. I also spoke to a schizophrenic girl that hung out online and read way too much into what she said due to my vulnerability and psychosis making me extremely suggestible. I believe I shared a folie a deux with her, which is when one person adopts another persons delusions due to constant interaction with them, and that was a big cause of my psychosis, as I exchanged hundreds of emails with this woman. I believe that my attachment to Ms. a was increased tenfold by this experience. I also managed to get in trouble by talking to someone online whom I thought was Ms. a and then going to visit her. I left when I saw it wasnt her. I called her a few days later and told her about the messages online. She texted me later and said she had a boyfriend that had found out about us talking and that he wanted to kill me. I had told them about the boards I had been going to, and shortly after death threats started showing up on the craigslist missed connections section. This terrified me and severely traumatized me, as I was positive someone wanted to hurt me and my family, and I ended up in the hospital a few weeks later. I became convinced there was some sort of conspiracy against me and that Ms. a might be in on it, which was delusional of course. This is all very hard to explain and Im trying to keep it short for brevities sake but I can go more in-depth if needed. I believe that this is part of the reason I felt such a need to contact Ms. a over the next two years. The amount of false information that I read online made me extremely confused and I lost sight of the fact that what Ms. a told me was probably very close to the truth, even if she was hiding something. I tried calling Ms. a twice of the next few months and sent her a few texts, all of which were pleasant. The next six months were nothing short of torture and I began to feel as though Ms. a was just messing with me, which made me feel extremely betrayed, as she was the first person I ever trusted enough to open up to. I did not start to seriously attempt to contact Ms. a again until things got to the point that I had started to plan my suicide, which was a year after my breakdown. I took a trip with my family to Salisbury beach shortly before I texted her, which triggered me because its extremely close to West Newbury and Newburyport and every sign with either of those town names on it reminded me of her. I assumed that Ms. a was not getting anything I sent her, and I began to text her as a way of working out my feelings towards the situation. I met someone during this time who saved my life by listening to all of my delusions without judging me or trying to tell me that they werent real. I managed to straighten out my head, and left a few voicemails for Ms. a apologizing for my actions, wishing her well, saying that I dont blame her for anything, and that I would always be in her corner, regardless of how she felt about me or if she ever talked to me again. Im giving the short version of the story here. But the year and 3 months between my breakdown (which occurred on September 29th) and my going to California were nothing short of Hell. It would take me a long time to explain the situation, so I wont go into it. But I basically spent most of the time in my room, dissociating, crying, laying in bed, and scouring the internet looking for some sort of resolution to my situation. I believe I was drawn to the internet because what happened to me there was very traumatic and they say that re-experiencing trauma can give the traumatized person a sense of mastery over the situation. I left for California in February of this year and did not plan on contacting Ms.a again. I quit drinking and smoking and exercised and ate a very healthy vegan diet. I was very productive and began to work towards doing things I had always wanted to do. About a month after I moved, I met a girl name Lizz, who gave me her number and then ignored my texts, and it brought back all of the feelings. I began to call and text Ms. a again. This continued on and off during my time in California. I was never outright insulting, and I was definitely never malicious. I did say that I thought it was very mean of Ms. a to ignore me and cut me off and I told her exactly what I thought of her behavior. I attempted to stop contacting her several times but could not come to terms with what happened and kept getting brought back to the situation. This continued until June of 2016, in which I planned on briefly returning home in between semesters at college (I was studying psychology and Music and got straight As). I would also like to note that I lived with a very cliquey group of popepl in LA and that they had ganged up on me, stolen from me, and threatened me physically, which caused me even more emotional distress. Shortly after I got home, my grandfather died and my whole family went to England for his funeral. I was left alone with thoughts I couldnt cope with and sort of fell apart again. I began attempting to contact Ms. a and eventually decided to call her house phone, I did not call three times beforehand, I called once, got nervous and hung up, and then called back again a few minutes later and left a message. I did not get the message that officer Johnson left for me on my parents phone, as I never check their messages since theyre not for me. I wasnt even aware of it until I read about it on the affidavit, after which I immediately contacted Officer Johnson in an attempt to resolve the situation. I respect law enforcement, despite what the Westminster police may think due to our altercations, and I wouldnt have gone there had I heard the messages. Going to her house was a last ditch effort to gain closure on the situation. I heard someone working in the backyard and was worried about a confrontation if I went into the backyard so I decided to wait by the front door, and knock, until someone came out. Ms. a eventually saw me at the door (I wasnt sure if it was her because I didnt have my glasses) and I smiled and waved at her. She called for her brother and I spoke with him pleasantly. I was still very nervous when I spoke to him but did not push the matter or attempt to speak to Ms. a when he made it clear that she didnt want to speak. I respected her right to not want to talk to me, and I hope that the fact I was calm and did not cause a scene or even get upset will reinforce the fact that I was not acting maliciously by going there. I shook her brothers hand, and left, he seemed like a very nice and cool person. Two days later, I texted Ms. a and said that going to her house was all I could do, that I accepted she didnt want to talk to me and that I would leave her alone from now on. The next day, I was served the harassment prevention order. I told the serving officer that it wasnt necessary and that I would never speak to Ms. a again, but apparently it was too late at that point. I would not have continued contacting Ms. a if she, or anyone she knew, had contacted me directly and told me to stop during the two years. I didnt think she was getting my messages and I was extremely worried that something had happened to her at times. I would like to bring up to the courts that my therapist and I have been talking about me suffering from some sort of autism spectrum disorder, as well as CPTSD, and that both of these things influenced my behavior. Im worried that Ms. a thought I was acting maliciously, or that Im an inherently malicious person, and if needed, I can provide a lot of character witness who will say that I am not at all a malicious or conniving person. Im actually a very understanding and kind person, and Ive gone out of my way to attempt to help a lot of people in my lifetime. I never wanted revenge on Ms. a, and I always wanted the best for her, other than times when I was extremely upset and thought that she was just messing with me. I have also never persistently texted someone like that before I met Ms. a. It seems to be an isolated incident due to the complexity of the situation. I no longer suffer from delusions and I am drug and alcohol free and plan on staying that way. Im in therapy and taking steps towards reclaiming my life. I have a lot of hopes and dreams for the future, and I wanted to be a counselor or music therapist, which I would probably not be able to do if this went on my record. Im more than willing to go through a probationary period if it will keep the criminal harassment charges off my record, and Ill cooperate with the courts in any way possible to get a resolution to this scenario which does not negatively affect my life. I would like to state once again that it was not at all my intention to harass Ms. a and that I deeply cared for Ms. A. I found her to be kind, tough, fascinating, modest, charming, extremely intelligent and very beautiful. My current feelings for her are platonic in nature, I appreciate her as a human and I really, really want her to be happy. The psychologist R.D. Laing says that psychosis is caused by someone experiencing a situation that they cant explain or process. The person gets stuck in repetitive patterns of thought in an attempt to explain the situation, or what Laing calls incompatible knots of thinking, until the person eventually disconnects from reality and begins to use delusions to cope with the stress. I believe the whole situation was just a huge misunderstanding and I have finally gotten closure and fully understand the situation. I do not have any more delusional thoughts about what happened between me and Ms. a. I will never contact Ms. a again, but I feel as though part of me will always care as she cared about me and my issues when I really needed someone to. I really, really hope that she finds happiness in the future, because I think she is a special person, and I think she deserves be happy. I wish her the best and I will never contact her again. I was unsure of whether Ms. a would be here today, but Im hoping that what Ive read her can help her move on if she has any unresolved feelings about this situation. LEt me guess, she can't admit to her feelings because she found out about shit I did and thinks i'm pathetic while loving me at the same time? Fucking ridiculous. Women, let me go or take me as I am. My behavior makes sense once you learn what i've been through. "
780,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,Last night you asked me why I was always so miserable before bed...,1,5idj8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/5idj8u/last_night_you_asked_me_why_i_was_always_so/,2016-12-15 09:04:10,"And the truth is, I'm just lonely. I can shake it off during the day, when I have kids and cooking and cleaning to distract me from it, but when the world winds down and I'm left there with my own thoughts there's no escaping it. I desperately crave intimacy with another human being , and I'm terrified that it's something I'll never know again. By intimacy I don't mean physical- even though I crave that constantly as well, my constant hunger for physical affection is more likely just a symptom- a means to overcompensate for the emptiness I feel inside. I have to admit, lately even physical means of affection are doing nothing to stave off the hunger I feel for a connection. Even with your arms around me I still feel like we're worlds apart, and I don't know how to bridge the gap anymore. I used to be known for my brutal honesty, but the constant silent treatments and scare tactics that have always followed sharing my thoughts with you make it impossible for me to safely tell you how I feel. Every time you shut me out or get defensive, I put up a wall, and now I feel like I'm trapped in them with no means of escape. I used to think I was just setting unfair standards for our relationship, because I was so spoiled by my first serious one. I thought I was just being needy, or overly critical, and that people don't really act like that in real life and C and I were unicorns so I just needed to let it go. I also worried that I made the wrong choice, which was why I sought him out so often in the beginning. Now, though, I understand that it isn't him I miss. In fact, I realize now he and I were horrible for each other. We had no common interests or goals, and I spent a lot of time trying to save something that was doomed from the start. I don't miss him. Sure, I still don't want to see him hurt and I hope he's happy, but I don't miss HIM. I just miss what he and I had. I think that's why the dream I had the other day shook me so badly. It just reminded me what it felt like to be intimate with somebody again(again, not just physically). I miss having that closeness, and that vulnerability. We definitely had our fair share of problems, but the one thing we always were with each other was honest and open. There were no walls, no secrets... I never had to wonder if he was really happy because he had no problems letting me know, and vice versa. If I told him he did something that made me mad, I never had to apologize for it or feel guilty for the way I felt. We never had arguments where we insulted each other's character, and the mutual RESPECT that we shared made it easy to be open about how I was feeling. I made that word all caps on purpose- because I think this and trust issues are at the root of our intimacy issues. Now, I just let it fester inside. Your mother always says that communication is key and if I don't tell you exactly what is bothering me it will just get worse. What she doesn't realize is that even more important than being able to say how you feel, is being receptive to what the other person is saying and willing to act accordingly. I can't talk to you honestly about anything without you feeling attacked or getting defensive. And I know you know exactly how I feel, because it's something I'm working on myself after you told me the same thing last year. Even when it's something simple, like you being mean to me about dropping a jar of spaghetti sauce on the floor, it escalates into who makes more messes around the house, and then into bashing each other about who's more lazy and rehashing an argument that happened weeks ago, or longer sometimes.Nothing ever gets resolved. It seems like every time we argue we don't get any closer to any resolution, we just collect more ammo to be used against each other the next time, constantly one upping each other to see who can inflict the most emotional damage. Why would I want to tell you anything when I can be sure it will just end in retaliation? And even then, I can tell you something bothers me until I'm blue in the face but if nothing ever changes what good does it do? I feel like we've reached a stale mate our relationship, and if nothing changes it's going to run it's course soon. I know it sounded harsh last night when I told you that it didn't make a difference to me if I slept next to you or not, but it's the truth. I feel like we could get the same effect with a strategically placed pillow as we do in sharing the same bed. I honestly prefer being alone, a lot of the time. At least when I'm alone I feel comfortable enough to be myself, and I don't have to censor my feelings. I don't have to feel guilty for having a higher libido than anyone, or like I'm begging for crumbs every time you lackadaisically throw your arm over me before you fall asleep. Even now writing this, I feel like I need to clarify everything that I'm saying so it can't be twisted around to work against me at some point. I'm just tired of being unhappy, and feeling guilty for how I feel. I miss having that closeness with somebody, where we share hugs and kisses and laughs and feelings. I miss not having to beg for affection, and reassurance coming freely and easily. And most of all, I'm tired of feeling like I need to apologize for having needs."
781,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,To the man I thought I would marry,27,539vla,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/539vla/to_the_man_i_thought_i_would_marry/,2016-09-18 10:08:28,"Dear you, It's been almost three months. It seems like an eternity, even though I know the days must be going by more slowly for me than for you. I know for you, they've been a blur of excitement and new changes -- welcome changes -- and you aren't the least bit concerned with the fact that one of those changes involves leaving me behind. You have a new life at your new school, and you stride closer to success every day, confident and capable as ever; and you've got the girl you love -- the girl I always, always knew you would pick over me -- by your side all the while. You don't know how much I wish that could still be me, but you've made your decision, and what can I do but stand aside and clear a way for your happiness instead? I'll cheer you on from the sidelines. I always promised you that if we didn't work out as lovers, I'd always stay your friend. In your weakest moments, rare glimpses of vulnerability that you only permitted me to see when I least expected it, you confessed to me that you needed me. Need is a powerful word, an emotional word, one that I never thought you'd use to describe what you felt for me, even when we were in love. You're a clinical person, all statistics and rationality -- for you to need me, fragile, insecure me, on any level, is something I still consider an honor. So as long as that still holds true, I'll still be here. I'll hope for your happiness, even if it's not with me, and no matter how I hate that we didn't last as long as I always thought, I will always be here to support you. You deserve to be wholly and completely loved, and maybe this girl, by some strange design of the universe, was who you really needed all along. But for you to have needed me for even this short time was a tremendous and unexpected gift in itself. It's easier to look back on the memories now than it used to be. For a while, I pushed them away, to the farthest reaches of the back of my mind, where I let them gather dust. I was afraid to touch them, sure of the pain that would await me if I did. But one day I woke up and found that when I thought of all the times you kissed me, all the gentle touches, all the ways you showed you loved me, what filled my heart was joy. Not pain at all. I was sad, yes, and perhaps regretful that it ended so soon, but I've come to the decision that I will not view you as a scar. You, with your flaws and your many mistakes, never bore me ill will. I know you never meant to hurt me, even if it did devastate me at first. But how can I look at someone who mended my heart as someone who broke it? Instead, I consider myself fortunate to have those memories, to know that we ever did love at all. And I hope she loves you, too. She'd better always make you feel loved and appreciated. Because no matter how far away I may go, I will always protect you -- you, the man I used to love, the man who wanted to spend the rest of his life with me once -- and God help anyone who hurts you. Thank you for saying it wasn't my fault. Thank you for teaching me to believe that I am beautiful, that I am worth something. Even if you forget me, I'll never forget you.

I've worked my ass off to not be beaten by it. I have come out on top every time. I don't know how to tell you thank you without it being weird. It is our conversations, the shared interests and banter and little bits of openness, that have kept me on track. I don't feel quite so alone while floating in limbo. However, it's also a bit threatening knowing that someone sees very nearly to the core of who you are and can make the choice to either protect the person they see there or find reason to turn on them. You? You've been a friend. The friend I didn't know I would need right now. Loss does weird things to people. It makes you just not want to care for others at all, because you remember how it feels when the person you care about gets ripped away when you aren't ready. You know what it's like to not have access to someone you trusted. And so you learn not to trust, not to invest too much, not to take the risk. To detest vulnerability and the pain that so often accompanies it. Maybe this friendship is a risk on a lot of levels, but I really like having you around. Please keep taking a chance on me. "

I wish I had a mother who doesn't judge how respectfully she should speak to other people on whether or not she has power over them. I wish I had a mother who could control her emotions better--who didn't seem like she catches on fire and starts firing at everyone when something upsets her. I wish I had a mother who didn't end up rationalizing blame for everything on everyone except for her. I wish I had a mother who could hold herself accountable for her own emotions. That she could talk with other people about how they're doing and what they're thinking with the same enthusiasm about the things that she wants to buy, the trips she wants to buy and all the money. The money is a means to significance in life, right? And it's an excuse. Wait, there's no depth to anything--everything is rushed, you're always getting to the next point to get to the next point to get to the next point.... So it's just an excuse, and that's the point. It's an excuse to lash out and harm. It's an excuse to call your six year old daughter a nigger for not cleaning up her room, it's an excuse for never seeming to be able to resist cajoling your children when they're sitting next to you and you're all talking to other people, ""joking"" about how they're ""lazy"", they ""don't clean up"", they're this, that, and for every one thing they do correct there's always an ability to find something else. The occasional positive here and there, but it's much more preferable to denigrate your shitty, sloppy kids, right? Because the worse they are, the better you look for having to put up with them, right? And cue your mother sagging her shoulders before your father gets home from work. I learn to play along, I learn the whole consensus that, ""Well that's just the way she is and we all love her"". But then occasionally I wonder why she doesn't have any friends. And I wonder why everyone she knows and I know has been in either a fight with her or her ""shit list"", so to speak. And it's because she'd rather have control over other people than connect with them. To do that shows vulnerability, you have to relinquish a little bit of control. And then you wonder why I just ended up crying for a half hour instead of raising my voice even though yours just got louder and louder and louder until it finally ending with the standard cutting insult towards me. And I am left with each bolt of years upon years of the same scar tissue, caged in my own mind with the ruminating echoes of contempt-dripped words, the motion to slit my own wrists with the blade on my bedroom floor, the pouring of the acidic tincture into my wrist, the huffing as I screamed from the burning, the nonchalant shrug of the shoulders when my father asks why it sounds like I'm hurt upstairs. All of them layer in the swath of plaque that suffocates my malnourished heart, mutating each memory of closeness with another human being into blistering torrents of fear. Maybe I wanted to keep talking because I was hoping eventually you could calm down and end the conversation without feeling like you have to charge me down like I'm some sort of target. But then I forget that's not how you treat people. And I forget you couldn't care less that you do. "

Shy messages back and forth once I was sage, small doodles and jokes, led to me almost tackling him when I returned from a stressful trip. This time I had given up, mostly. I didn't think it was impossible, but I wasn't looking very hard. I'd decided to focus on health, progress, and set my jaw to the slow but steady advancements I was making. That first meeting I was so stressed, then disheartened. Was it a poor match...?But the second went so much more smoothly; he was, and is, so patient and frank with all my fears. So considerate and sweet but sassy and fum; I want to hear all about him and share so much. I was trying to be slow, and was so unsure if I was really showing what he wasseeing. He seemed so mellow aand steady, something I didn't know was an intentional confidence. Hearing him share the fears I'd starting shatingcwith friends and anonymous people out of panic for the future, almostlike I was being quoted, and be comforted in a shared experience snapped everything in perspective.

I am not your completion. Neither am I your ""dream."" Complicated by our ages and marriages, lonelier with, than without; maybe that you've made choices that have left you feeling duped and abandoned. Most of you I've known for 2/3 of my life, we suffered on the same fields together, year after year. We bonded. We bled. We loved. We, the collective. We've hugged, held hands, cried, and become much older and wiser. We have become jaded in the repetition of patterns, only to be running into the wall, our heads bloodied. Connections exist that I, we, will always be bound together, despite the years marching on. Nearing the 40's, some more, some less, you've come to me with the implausible. The meaningless uninspired platitudes with my unreasonable expectations of a Hallmark card romantic grandeur-pathetically empty attempts to engulf me. I'm also at fault, here! I operated with this IDEA, this very hollow concept that someone would pursue me like a centuries-long persistent battle for territory, claiming me in the name of their identity. Too many years of the same thing. Too many of you who knew this exploit of my navet, despite my sharp tongue, filthy mouth and eyes that pierce you. It was always my eyes that hooked you, right? That darkness each of you have witnessed-you just had to have it, right? What you wanted to imbibe, be drunk of, was my vulnerability. And it was my illogical perception of ultimate love, for it became a macabre dance of souls. You were lost. I was lost. Difference between us? I hated myself for walking into the same scene repeatedly. I had to figure out why, how, and end the loop. I used the balance of my fledgling creative soul, mired in doubt, in search of self-acceptance. What once was driven by motive of seeking the unattainable, attention and this fictional qualitative ""love,"" became a quest to understand the multiverse theorem, literally. In that time, one aspect came clear: you're as lost as I, but you are not self-aware. You sought completion, externally, from exogenous means. I was tired of that. I knew I hated myself despite all I've accomplished, self-taught and proud. Self-loathing is my cancer, and I'm winning this sickness, now! I saw what the attempts were, from you. What you seek is not of this earth. It is a faulty construct of experience, shaping, conditioning, self-exploration. And in this case, it wasn't positive. Every time another one came to me, I doubled-down on prospect. I bet the farm on the last one. When the house crumbled from a lack of foundation, I wasn't hurt. I was outside when it happened, watched it happen, disassociated with the house. I didn't want to love you. I wanted to love myself through your eyes. This was improbable. I saw it through the viewfinder of my 5D; I'm the photographer, you are the distant subject, and the image is you, through my eyes. The universe continues to expand, light provides nuance, energy. It was then that I came to empathize with each of you. Something is lost, damaged, and you're searching. I was, too. But, how long do we go pretending that we can escape our marriages, from behind a computer or phone, in the dark, liaisons of deceptive origin, ignoring this with the saccharine sweet coating of this human and flawed construct of perception in ""love?"" You do not complete me. You do not get to engulf me. I am not your completion. I am no longer fearful. I no longer run away, in hopes of this existential and non-existent expectation of ""love."" The love I sought, despite the trysts and unspeakable, was the love of myself. All those things you wanted of me-my mind, my body, my wounds, my face, my talents and my inherently nave trust? They're mine, now. I'm not your ""muse."" The endless soundtracks to the vapid platitudes play in my head and invoke the deepest of anger-why did I ever think that was an acceptable pedestal? I'm not a statue for your proxied justification of self! And yet, here I am, searching to see if any of you have learned, that maybe, just *maybe*, my realism can be balanced with the irrational, that I'm not too cynical. At the end of it all, I love each of you for the lessons I've learned. I wish that for you, because it has grounded me in strength and self-love. You're in the aether, and I know you're looking for justification in your existence. It's within you. And you're resourceful-the journey to self-love is important. And yet, we are bound by our camaraderie, all those years ago. I'd still take the bullet for each of you. That's just me. Loyal to the person, character. Your flaws aren't my problem, but I surely know that I've learned how to not absorb them. Be careful whose heart you chase, and don't be errant in the pursuit. I love myself now, finally, like a phoenix rising from the ashes. I just wish there was a way that instead of unconscious behaviors repeating, justifying the self through provocative and lithe texts and messages-promises of infinite love and grandeur, you can find the path I have, without projecting it to another soul. At the end of the day, the rational has overcome the irrational. The inner child is still dysphoric. She is no longer angry, though. She is hopeful, but realistic. She is sad at the illusion of this unreasonable expectation of true love, from another, but she is numb to the antics of another. She is wiser and always astute. She is free, realistic and yet hopeful-but it doesn't rule her world, anymore. I just wish I could be touched, and to touch someone, and feel them beneath my thick skin. "

I don't date much. I'm an odd sort, I realize. In my early 20's, I knew there was a game to play and I had no interest in it. I turned down blatant offers for sex, back then. I knew there were strings that would have ensnared me. I would be dancing like a puppet on a line, soon, if I grew to care. Vulnerable to the worst kind of woman; one who had no clue of the power she held over others because she was charming, intelligent, and attractive. It's a rare combination of traits, now. The attention must be effortless to receive; gifts shower without effort. That doesn't happen very much, anymore. Perhaps it was uncharacteristic optimism that urged me to pursue you when I had never chased a woman before. Perhaps it was regret over the women I'd turned down, who were beautiful but I knew weren't good for me. But I think, more likely, it was a moment of intense vulnerability and weakness that led to me becoming entangled with you. I was debilitated, emotionally. I had struggled and been unhappy for so long that I was willing to give most anything a chance. And then you appeared. Despite you being younger, and a stranger, I felt I had little to lose. You had sought me, after all! Perhaps this was a connection that would mean something. You had all of the signs of being someone who would MATTER. All of the traits that would set you apart from most other people. But you've chosen the game. The silly, typical, average game of a woman who has recently become more attractive. The power over men must be positively intoxicating. But it's so, so fleeting. You lost weight. You left your fiance', the one who moved from the exciting coast to the featureless midwest. He moved his life and his family to be with you, and you left. You rationalized that it was a good move for his job. But a job is simply that: a job. You know better. I did, too. I was a fool for disregarding it. Your attention was never steady. Your presence was more of a flicker than a ray. Your affection was warming for a moment and then gone the next. Your attention was no more fixed than a match-flame in a breeze. But I know that I am not the center of anyone's life, nor should I be. That one must look after oneself first, and other second, and so I endured with the promise of us steadily growing closer. Instead, we grew further apart. I told you how I felt. I shared with you my desire, despite the urge to conceal it. I put faith in you, where I had not ventured to put faith in anyone. I disregarded my hard-earned life experience of knowing that actions speak much, much louder than words. Words are cheap. Free, in fact. But actions take effort, and time, and when it came to action you always came up short. And despite my knowing that this meant you were simply toying with me -- and I told you as much -- I accepted your cheap apologies and your empty compliments. I'm not mad at you, anymore, for ignoring me until I was forced to say goodbye to YOU. For the days I spent in uncertainty. For the agonizingly endless stretches of time that I spent pining for your company. The words would have taken less than 30 seconds to write. You obviously have no idea what it is you are doing. You are still a child. A selfish, naive child. And you don't know it because you ARE intelligent. People are easy to fool, especially if they want to be. And despite my knowing better, I fell into an obvious trap. Just once, I wanted to believe that following the heart could be a good thing. If nothing else, I'm glad that you confirmed everything that my jaded heart had suspected. For that peace, I thank you. But the existential sadness that you burdened me with is much greater than you can imagine. The knowledge of how rare it is for me to meet someone I can connect with, and how rare it is for that person to be worthwhile... Well, it may not happen again. I accept that, now. But I will never forget the disappointment of realizing that you are just a stereotype. A pretty girl who is exploiting and exploring a world of new toys. I had expected better, hoped for better, begged for better. And my words fell as empty as London fog; a cloud that could float but chooses to fall and obscure, instead. And in that haze I crashed, and I hurt, and I raged. And then I picked up the pieces and moved on. And still, you hover, linger, like a shadow. But I've chosen to walk out of the fog and into the sun, and your shadow is now behind me. I may forgive, but will never forget, how you exploited my weakness for a moment's pleasure. The sad truth is, however, that it's YOU who misses out. You may never be shown what you are missing. You know you are missing something because you are seeking. But you do not know what you are looking for. I could have shown you. I would have shown you regardless of your romantic promises. You will never know what you missed because meeting a person like me is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. You will think this hubris on my part, but wait. You will understand, in time. And you will regret. I would pity you if I had any energy left to waste on you. But I don't waste time on statistics. On the average. On the mundane, and predictable, and the disappointing. On you. Not anymore. You are lost. You don't know how lost you are. ""May you be lost in the fog forever,"" my pride says. ""Curse you, forever, for exploiting me."" My pity says nothing. It has left, and I move on."

Ive admittedly become almost obsessed with you. I dream about you - your messy black hair, your kind eyes, and your sincere, infectious smile. I'll never be able to tell you any of this in person because there is literally no reason for me to talk to you or you to me. Even if we did have a conversation, it wouldn't be a natural, effortless one. You would immediately be suspicious of me and even think of me as ""creepy"" or ""weird."" Frankly put, we belong in different categories and despite what anyone says, I dont have a chance in hell with you. You're the type of guy who cant help but snicker with his friends when someone like me performs. You're the type of guy who I doubt would even look my direction if I talked to you. I have no business liking someone like you. You're a man whos handsome, popular, and authentic. Life's going to be really great for you. I can see you pursuing and marrying a beautiful woman one day, someone more like you, someone of your choosing.

Speaking of... you're the only person who has ever seen me orgasm. I've tried in the past, but this is the first time I've ever achieved that level of comfort and vulnerability with anyone.

Gifts and favors weren't a part of my life before you dropped in. Being asked *""what's wrong?""* wasn't, either.

I had one leg over your lap. We spent forever in silence until I finally decided to ask if everything was okay. As I was opening my mouth to speak, you cut me off. You said, ""Just being next to you makes me happy."" You're snoring next to me now. Of course I want to let you sleep, but I also wish you'd wake up and grab me the way you do. Flip me over and back, look at me with those hungry eyes. Kiss me down my spine. Make me moan and respond with a grin. ""Oh, you liked that?"" Bastard. It isn't all lust. You're sexy beyond reason, but there's something more. The secret ingredient to sex is love. I've fucked people I loved before, but it wasn't quite the same. It's a pleasurable physical connection, sure. But with you, there is an extra layer. I want to be so close to you that we overlap. The way we put our legs at night, but spiritually. It sounds so dumb when I say it but that's what it is. I thought I knew what love was before. And perhaps I did know something about love... I don't know.

I feel like throwing up 2. Its night time 3. I cant stop thinking about her 4. I wish she was right next to me right now - ................ I wonder if you ever think about how much you know me, or about how Ive told you so many things about myself and yet, you may not even know me at all. - ................ She was so pretty in that lighting today. I held her hand often, and poked away at her veins. What translucent skin she has. Her hands are warm most of the time because of her peculiar body temperature. I think I like her like a child likes toys. - ................ I was alone with her all afternoon in her dorm room. - ................ I feel an ache in me because I am physically tired, stressed, and its midnight. And because she cant give me what I need. And because it is times like these when I condemn myself for even trying to play these games I know I will lose. And maybe the worst part of it is that Im losing to myself. - ................ Each time my phone flashes, Im hoping its a message from you. - ................ She wore my cardigan for a while today. When she gave it back to me and left, it was warm and filled with her scent. That was nice. - ................ I cant stop thinking about her. With my exams in a few days, I dont know if its a good or bad thing. Its the ovulation phase for me as well. I feel much clingier than I should, and before I sleep every night, I think about being somewhere alone with her, where I can be as close to her as I want. A friend asked,  do you really like her or are you just using her as an escape? Im not sure yet. - ................ Seated behind her in the car, I occasionally glimpsed at her through the wing mirror. In the darkness, with passing street lights as the only source of illumination, she lets down her hair and gently ruffles it. I was captivated by that moment, and I cant stop replaying it in my head. It has become clear to me that I really do like her. - ................ I got to meet her yesterday for dinner with a couple of other uni friends. When I first saw her, I hugged her pretty tightly and the words I missed you so much slipped out naturally. Its only been two weeks since I last saw her. I changed the subject quickly after that. - ................ She wont like me back. It started out as an experiment, to see if I could actually like her. Then I thought about how selfish it was. Now I cant kill off my feelings, and my heart aches. - ................ The forbidden fruit is ripe. Im just waiting for the right time to take a bite of it to be poisoned. - ................ If I meet the girl I like tomorrow, I think Ill tell her I like her. Im not ready, but I dont think anyone can be ready for such things. - ................ I woke up today close to noon, later than I expected, feeling more exhausted than I expected and wanting her more than ever. Although, a note to myself: people are not trophies. - ................ Things I need to tell her: 1. I was serious about what I said two days ago (even if I kept pretending it was a joke). 2. I need a response from her about what I said two days ago. 3. There are things that I wanted to say but didnt get to say because I was more frightened on the spot than I appeared or realised. - ................ ishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthatishouldn'thavesentthat - ................ 24 hours later, a reply. I have been emotionally drained, suicidal, insecure and all sorts of fucked up-ness just waiting. Prowling for indie music on Youtube distracted me. Im so afraid to read the reply. - ................ Having your vulnerability exposed crushes you. Exposing it of your own accord makes you hate yourself. I crave self-destruction so much right now. I look at my veins, hidden under my thick skin, and I think of hers, bulging slightly through her translucent skin and suddenly I feel like making incisions on my hands, right down to my veins, and bleeding out my feelings for her. - ................ My feelings for her have died. Just like that. I dont know why these things happen with me, but they do. I think its what she would want, and if it isnt, Ill know how to bring them back. But they are gone now for good, perhaps. - ................ When I decide not to feel, I stop feeling. I just have to repress the urge to be mean towards the one Ive invested so much effort in because it is never that persons fault. I get angry due to the lack of reciprocation, and used to be too prideful to admit it. Goodbye to feeling for a while. - ................ Me: I really, really want your veins. Her: Take them. - ................ You can only be hung up on someone for so long. - ................ Four months of my holidays have gone by. As of tomorrow, Ill be a second year university student. Sadly, the only thing I am looking forward to is seeing the girl I(m not even sure I still) like. Im feeling really stoic and emotionless right now but tomorrow Ill probably be as soft as some fucking cupcake out of an oven when I meet her and mushy words will spill out of my mouth before I can contain myself. - ................ So I took a namecard of a cake shop we were in and wrote I miss you..r veins before handing it to her. This needs to stop. Its not her I want, but closure to this whole fiasco. - ................ I spotted the moon. Grabbed her hand and pulled her away from everyone towards the darkness where the branches didnt obstruct our view of the sky. For a while, we stood staring at the reddish moon. I loved the darkness. The sea was nearby and I might have heard the faint lapping of waves. I like her more than ever now that I do not like like her anymore. - ................ I got closure today. I told the truth  that it was all an experiment, one that I created and backfired. And I said, Sorry for liking you. - ................ Today I realised I still need you. "

I am full with them. I need to put them down somewhere, and I dont know if Ill send this to you, but I cant keep all of this hidden in my mind anymore. There are a few things for which I want to thank you. But I think I need to explain some things first. You have somehow managed, effortlessly (merely by existing), to ignite something within me that I thought was dead. When I was younger, I was unabashedly open to being vulnerable and putting myself out there and revealing whatever it is that looms behind the human mask I wear. That part of me, the part of me that I loved so much, faded slowly and then all at once. A strange maelstrom of anxiety and tumultuous relationships and failures quieted the childlike wonder with which I used to view the world. And then I laid next to you in the grass and kissed you and your soul reached into mine. And I remembered what it was like to feel like a child on Christmas morning: a feeling Id long forgotten. A feeling you still give me. I keep listening to My Favourite Book by Stars. In our little place. I have been at war with my own body for awhile now. Realistically, I guess its been a problem throughout my whole adult life. I have not felt comfortable existing in a long time. But together: in our little place: I felt (not only the appeal but) the necessity of vulnerability for the first time in so long. I am still wholly astounded at not only the lack of self-hate and anxiety I felt, but also the comfort I experienced in laying lazily naked next to you, desperately trying to give you as much of myself as I was able. Our little place. With nothing but a glance, you have made me feel more beautiful than ever during a time in which Ive never felt less worthy of love and affection. I understand the situation and Im not so naive as to have any expectations. But it doesnt stop me from daydreaming about a life in which things were different. It has felt like such a chore to form close bonds and connections with other people, but with you it just happened. And I didnt ask for any of it - and I didnt see it coming, but it feels too beautiful and amazing that everything else pales in comparison. So quickly, we fell into step with each other. Every moment I have shared with you has felt so effortlessly perfect and the thought of giving that up is physically affecting to me. With each town and each exit sign we passed on the way back, my heart sank a little deeper into my chest. You have been incredibly open with me and I havent done as great of a job with that. All of these thoughts are racing through my mind constantly, but I havent been able to express them as eloquently as Ive wanted to. I hope that in those moments of eyes-locked bliss, you could see how desperately my soul was reaching out to yours. I hope that my eyes, my energy, somehow displayed the longing I felt in those moments - and now still. When we were sitting on the fourth floor of the book barn together today, I had a moment in which I had to keep repeating dontcrydontcrydontcry in my mind. My body sitting tightly next to yours, exploring books, trading thoughts, and sharing kisses couldnt have been more perfect. In that moment, all I could think about was how the connection I am sharing with you is so much more than I ever could have wanted. And I cant have it. That is torture. And I tell myself that maybe things would not have been so beautiful and all-encompassing with you had there not been some pseudo expiration date. Maybe I wouldnt have been able to exuberate the same raw vulnerability had the situation been different. But none of that really feels like it matters in the scheme of things. I am sitting here on this front porch, a few beers and too many cigarettes deep, and all I can see is your eyes and all I can feel is your hand on my thigh. And I just want it back. I want more. It is heart-wrenching to say goodbye to you without knowing when or if Im going to see you again. My head - my heart - my entire body is flooded with your image - with you. I feel like I am comfortably drowning in quicksand. I have no qualms with being overtaken by you. All I want is to continue sinking into this - whatever it is. I have been through a lot in my short life and I have felt so much. I am always feeling so much. Naively, I thought Id felt it all. I thought Id already found myself existing - bouncing around - across the whole spectrum of human emotion. Above all else, you have showed me that there is always more. No matter the stagnancy life can bring, there are still extraordinary surprises and undiscovered emotional roller coasters. To me - you have brought an incandescent happiness that will stir within my bones for some time - if not all time. I know that - feasibly - I cannot have you. But you should know that I want nothing more."

Because of boredom. You lost interest. I just want to know why? Why do this to me? Were you scared of saying goodbye? Just taking advantage, i sense. I was a wave that kept coming back to the shore. Loyalty is my Vulnerability. I wished you well when i said goodbye but now the pain is mixed with the ashes of anger. If i ever cross your path I would punch you in the face. You had no intention of coming here. No. This was all some sort pf sick joke. Guess what? You've made me suicidal. Thanks. But i will survive. (I will. This would be foolish to do. I will never be your Juliet). Each painful footstep. I will go forward. You're a dishonest manipulator. I didnt deserve this. I will be the phoenix that will burn my own skin for ever having thought you would have touched it with pure intent. No. You used me. I will rise. And i hope you fall, fall hard enough to scrape your knees. Can't hold the weight of what you did to me. You're a bonfire. You ripped through the forests of my soul, my feathery wings, you danced like a vision, a moth to a flame. Why? Why didnt you just tell me? If you were honest, I would speak to you. But you deserve desolation. Lack of burnable material. You will suffocate by your own doing, eating up all the oxygen until there's nothing left to burn but yourself. Arsonist, i wish you well.

You took advantage of my vulnerability. You took advantage of my innate belief that people are good. You made me feel special. You made me feel different. You inspired me to be the best I could be, and when I was by your side I felt invincible. You looked at me with those beautiful brown eyes that showed so much emotion, and when you held me, I felt like I had found my home in your embrace. That night that I fell apart in front of you, that I bared my soul to you, you told me you loved me. The night before you left, you told me to wait and that there was potential. Then you were gone for eight weeks and you wrote me and I wrote you and I thought everything would be okay. You gave me the hope to stay strong and I dreamt of the possibilities that lay ahead. I counted down the days until your graduation, and then when you graduated? Nothing. No calls, no response to my texts, nothing. It was as if I didn't exist. Now I know the truth about you, but I'm still in love with the person I thought you were and I hate you for it. I'm in love with someone who doesn't even exist. You fooled me and I fell for it, hook line and sinker. You're a pathological liar. I've heard the stories, and now I've experienced it first hand. I know who you are now. I trusted you. I told you things I'd never told anyone. We spent nights together that I wished would never end, and I felt closer to you than I'd ever felt to anyone. I trusted you with some of my deepest, darkest secrets and you made me feel safe. And then you turned your back on me. You know my story. You know what I've been through. You chose to emotionally abandon me after I let you in. I could never forgive you for that, but the fact that you can't be bothered to even return a text message means I'll probably never even have the opportunity to. How dare you play the victim when I gave you my heart and you ripped it to shreds, so soon after I'd been beaten down by another. You have no sense of human decency, and I regret the day I met you. The worst part? I don't know if I'd have the strength to deny you if you came back to me."

I remember the first time I saw you, dancing in that pseudo-trance way that you do, atop the roof at that seedy bar in Cambodia. I noted the way you meticulously put yourself together, in an almost effortless way. The way you tied your hair back and accented it with a strategically placed braid, the way that your black cat-eyed glasses matched the rest of your black wardrobe akin to Robert Smith circa 1982. The way you seemed to effortlessly float over the world like a cloud of smoke above a burning building. You were perfect within your flaws, that night and forever after. In a drunken impulse, asked you to dance. You agreed, but you wouldnt let me touch you. You told me that dancing had little to do with touching, and about moving my hips. I guess, if Im drudging through my retrospect, youve always safeguarded yourself from vulnerability. I think, at least sometimes, that everyone does that. Most people have been hurt, and most people dont want to be again. That makes you, us, them, everyone, human. I bought you a beer, and almost seemingly out of obligation you gave me your phone number. It would be weeks before I saw you again, and, I laugh thinking about it now, you didnt even remember who I was when I did. You, like many I have met before, could have just been a notch on my belt. Another ill-fated attempt to court a pretty-girl, or another casualty of my incessant exploits. However, and tragically bitter-sweet for me, you werent. I kissed you on your birthday, as if I had nothing else to give you but a Gin laced gnaw, and it began, as my indifference ended. I will admit, that even after that, I had no inclinations that it, this, us, or whatever the fuck you want to call it, would happen. Then, I fell ill and you came to visit me. I didnt really understand why, and I sort of still dont. But you did, watching me whither in that fucking hospital bed, you did. We then spent a week at a beach, one I had never been to, but you knew well. We kissed on that beach, as you looked at the sky entranced with the stars. That image of you, gazing upon the endless sky will probably stick in my memory forever. You looked on with a degree of innocence, but one that was tinged with fear, fear of the vastness and complexity of it all. Here we are now. I sit in this room, my stomach burning and my blood boiling thinking about what weve done. I am very lucky to have had this at all, and eternally unlucky to see it crumble. Im probably being over-dramatic, oh, I know that I am, but I can only curb it for so long. You held me through all the earth-quakes, you gave and never took, and for that I owe you the world. I am so sorry for the bruises you have from a life before me. But know, that although I cannot see you again, although I cannot bear, at this moment, to be friends I will never abandon your heart. Thinking of you always, Yours. "

I was emotionally dependent. You were emotionally manipulative. I had an unstable sense of self. You had an aggrandized sense of self. I was callously honest. You were deceptive (to yourself as well as to others). I was avoidant. You were narcissistic. I had a romanticized and childish sense of loyalty. You had no sense of loyalty. We both used one another. We were both selfish. We both had martyr complexes. I'm finally growing up and becoming a whole person. It has been long overdue. I had to learn the tough lesson, that personal growth only comes about through pain, hard work, honesty, vulnerability, and a willingness to spend some time alone with yourself instead of jumping from bed to bed. I'm hoping that you'll figure this out, too. I'm hoping that you'll be willing to do the hard work you weren't willing to do back in November. I'm hoping that you'll stop hiding behind your age and actually take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror.

So why are you fighting for this? I don't feel what I once did for you. We had one last chance and you ruined it. It's over. The energy is gone, and I can feel it, and so can you.

So ignorance I called it, and ignorance it shall be. Love blinds. Im sure youve heard me say this phrase at least once or twice to you. Whether it be conveyed through poetry or spoken words between us, I have definitely uttered these words to you at some point. Love blinds you to the possibility of lies and malicious intent. I was blinded, therefore, I loved you. Love is vulnerability. I felt that my vulnerability was safe with you, and so I loved you. Love is giving someone the gun to shoot you with and trusting them not to pull the trigger. I gave you the gun, so I loved you. And you pulled the trigger like youve been practicing it all your life.

805,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,To: The super cool [ex-]closeted lesbian -- From: The asexual guy who had the crazy idea of dating you,2,2vj0ta,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/2vj0ta/to_the_super_cool_excloseted_lesbian_from_the/,2015-02-11 23:00:33,"Hey, I've been tip-toeing recently. You're so friendly and inviting, but I don't know what's okay now that I've already had my shot. I don't want to come off as desperate or give you the wrong message or something, but I want to talk to you again. I miss the walks. I miss learning about you. You're fucking cool. You know how I got this weird asexual crush on you in the first place? Every time I talked to you, you would talk about something you were passionate about that you were planning on doing -- with a time frame to do it. You had things, plans, and ideas that you were serious about. There wasn't a superficial thing about you and it was so refreshing and respectable. I admired you almost immediately, and it was the level of admiration that could have just as easily been rivalry if there was even a single ounce of ""asshole"" in you (but hey, there wasn't, so here we are). Also you do falconry. Holy shit -- how cool is that? Falcons are awesome! Everyone wants to be a falconer, but you're exactly the kind of person who would *actually* go out and do falconry. That's more or less why when I decided to experiment with my relationship pattern by being the one doing the asking out for once, I ended up asking you. I knew you were cool. Every relationship I previously had followed the same pattern of finding out someone is interested in me, going along with it out of curiosity, and then breaking it off out of sexual disinterest and a need for space. The dilemma is that I still crave romance, in theory. I want a partner/ally/teammate to share passions with, so I wanted to see if things could be different if I just dated someone who was *ridiculously cool*. I don't mean to sound clinical or something, but you were by far the best candidate. Go figure how flattered I was when you were just as excited to learn about me. In hindsight, dating you was so enjoyable because neither of us pushed to escalate things. We just hung out, and it was fun. You thought I was heterosexual, I thought you were heterosexual, and everything was chill. Make whatever joke you want about ""playing pretend,"" but you gotta admit that it was fun. The only hiccup in our situation was that very sudden and confusing escalation on Sunday night. I'm sure that it must have been even more confusing from an outside perspective -- a guy comes out to a girl as asexual at the same time that she comes out to the guy as a lesbian, followed by cuddling and then prolonged kissing. It only really makes sense when you take into account that sharing a moment of mutual vulnerability has a tendency to catapult any sort of pre-existing emotions. It was way too much way too quickly, though. We should have talked more. I should have been more careful and smart instead of relieved and excited. After all, you were only coming to terms with being a lesbian a few days before I asked you out. I picked the optimal time to confuse the hell out of you, and I should have seen that and taken a more cautious approach rather than getting so eagerly excited about how unorthodox and interesting the situation was. You said we should keep dating, but I should have stopped and breathed and asked you the smart question of what it is exactly that you, a gay girl, would want in a relationship with an ace boy. Maybe I'm beating myself up unnecessarily for something that I couldn't fix even if I wanted to, but that's how I reconciled my lack of surprise when you told me the very next night that you couldn't do a relationship. I get it, though -- you need to kiss girls for science. On top of that, I'm sure things would have been awkward for you coming out to your family while also attempting to explain why you *just* started a relationship with a guy. Doesn't change that I miss learning about you. You are such an interesting person. I want to go back to when we both thought the other person was heterosexual just so that I can talk to you some more. I think you got used to me being the initiator, but now things are awkward and I don't know where to step. On the Monday night when you changed your mind, you told me that you still wanted to go on walks. You said that we should go take that detour on our usual route that we previously never had time to take... but we haven't. Can we? I'd like to. I promise I'm not avoiding you, I'm just unsure about where the boundaries are. You have to let me know. I know it's not my call anymore, but I'd like to give this another shot. We don't have to label what it is. I just want to continue the story. Yeah, I know, it was just an experiment for both of us... but it went unexpectedly wrong and now I want it to be more than an experiment. As rushed as our emotions were on that Sunday night, I have to say that the last time I felt that comfortable with myself was probably when I realized that I was asexual. It just felt right emotionally. I want to explore that. Hell, I'll let you have sex with other people while I go twiddle my thumbs; I don't care (it'd be unfair if I did). I just don't want to set down an interesting book. Go figure, the one time I don't want to break things off, I get the tables turned on me. To hell with it, I won't have that, I want to break the rules. I want to appear completely normal with you but be completely not. I want to confuse everyone but ourselves. Wanna hang out?"

This distance has given me the opportunity to see how you used me, how you preyed on my vulnerability and encouraged my dependence on you in order to stoke your own ego. I should have known as soon as I saw the way you treated your family, especially your poor little sister. You do love your family, yes, but in the most self-serving of ways. Your social persona as an empathetic and caring person is very well practiced, but the cracks have always been visible. The first time I saw your smile, I felt as though I were descending into the uncanny valley. That smile which never touched your eyes. That's why you left when you felt that I was getting under your skin, seeing through your facade. You didn't want me to see you for what you truly are: a predator. The guy before me saw it in the end, and he shouted it to the rooftops. I should have listened. I shouldn't have ignored all of the telltale signs. Now I know better. I hope the new guy you cheated on me with (I know you did, though you still deny it) and left me for wises up faster than I did. I hope your emotional body count doesn't keep rising. I don't hate you. You don't hate a spider or a snake for biting you. It's the nature of the beast. You don't want to take it to bed and fall in love with it, though. I'm free of you now. I never actually loved you. I loved the character you played, but that girl never really existed. The hollow, faceless girl underneath is the only real part of you. Now, when I start to feel that pang of regret for having lost our relationship, I make myself remember that cold, uncaring smile, or the dramatized, disingenuous tears you so often displayed. I remember the bizarrely unhinged scowl that fell over your face any time I challenged you. I remember the glimpses I got of the animal inside of you when I caught you off guard. I remember the sinking feeling I got in the pit of my stomach the first time I laid eyes on you in person, the feeling I tried to rationalize and stuff down. One day you will fuck up and expose yourself. One day K, M, and C will all see you for what you are. I hope, for their sakes, that they escape you with their hearts intact. I didn't, but I will rebuild. - J"

I used to think that you hadn't done anything wrong because you did a TON of things right. You really taught me a lot then. I'm not sure I would be who I am now inpart if it wasn't for you. But you now is so different from you then; night and day. I don't really like either one better than the other; thought I like more things about you now than the then you. I like the vulnerability that sneaks through in the now you. And I think this now you gets me a lot better than the then you. I think the now me gets me a lot better and I'm pretty amazing! !!
808,vulnerability,UnsentLetters,The things you did,1,2qym1i,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/2qym1i/the_things_you_did/,2015-01-01 09:55:54,"I dont even know why Im bothering to write this. I know, by all likelihoods, that itll never be read. I guess Im writing it for my own sake. Theres so much I have to say, theres so much I still feel, theres so many things I cant get over -- and I want to get over -- but its like a wall that I keep hitting and I just cant force my way through it. Where do I start? I guess Ill start with how I feel right now. Awful. Destroyed. Heartbroken. Thats really the shortest way to put it. Its been, I dont know, how many days since we finished this? And every day I feel lost. I really, really, really did love you. I dont know why you doubted it. Maybe I didnt show you enough, but its because I couldnt. I loved you more than I ever wanted or loved anything in my life. When we watched sunsets together I thought the sun smiled at me. I thought the hot, summery days in that humid city were for us to share, and the simple bedsheets were laid out for us, everyday, to consummate and roll around in joy. When I left, I still thought of you, all the time. Id take pictures every day for you. Id write little notes and poems around. I wanted you with me, though by then you were already living in my mind and nowhere else. I remember, a long time ago, we went to Disneyland together. We walked around, holding hands, like every kind of couple, so scared to lose each other, knowing full well that the magic that we had was going to end when I left. And we didnt want the day to end. Every day that passed meant another cross off the calendar to that inevitable, looming certainty that we would have to go our separate ways. I remember, there, I told you about how if you ever left me for someone else, that Id just disappear from your life. Because I gave my heart to someone before and thats what they did, and it hurt me so, so much. And that if you did the same thing, Id realize that you didnt really love me. If you did, you wouldnt hurt me in the way that you knew would hurt me the most. You could have done anything, but that, and I would have forgiven you. I remember you dismissing the thought as silly, that theres no way you would ever hurt me like that. You promised you wouldnt. I really believed you. I trusted you with my life, and I opened up to you more than I ever opened up to anyone. I let you inside, showing you everything that I dreamed of and everything that I was scared of, the things that were beautiful to me and I held on to tightly, the things that were ugly and I wanted to cover up, all the little marks of a childhood cut short and angst and mistakes that I wanted to erase and scrub away -- I gave it to you. I gave myself to you. I thought you would never break me. But in the end, you did. You were the one who shot first. I dont even understand how, or why. Why were you so unhappy with me in the end? I was never unhappy with us. Was I not enough for you? Thats my best guess, and the only guess I can come up with. And it is not that, that hurts me the most. It was that you left me for someone else, so quickly, so silently, as if I mattered nothing to you anymore, and the entire world that I gave to you was shoved aside for some new attraction in the amusement park of your life. I couldnt imagine. I couldnt imagine that this was happening to me, not only because it was happening again, but because it was between us. I couldnt believe that you did this to me. I was shaking, because I was crumbling apart. All those things that I believed about us, about you, about myself, it was chopped down in an instant and suddenly I was back at rock bottom after trying so hard, brick after brick, at rebuilding my life for what I thought was the final time. Ive been sitting here this Christmas -- what a disgusting holiday -- just watching everyone having the time of their lives. With friends, family, dinners, countdowns and celebrations -- and Im just here, trapped in this jail cell of an estranged family falling apart and wondering what the hell Ive been doing with my life and why everyone seems to find so much more happiness than me. I guess Ive been dealt a bad hand, and theres nothing I can do about it. But even if there was, whats the point? I dont think I can ever be happy again. I cried thinking about it. Crying is important. We cry when were overwhelmed with joy, when were frustrated, heartbroken -- whenever its too much. Its a reminder of our vulnerability and that were alive. I want to say its a beautiful thing, because thats what I used to think. But I dont think so anymore. Whats the point of knowing that Im alive when I have no one to share this aliveness with? I have this ball or energy, this entire world, and I cant share it with anyone. I have no one now. I hope you understand that. I hope that you know that youre a heartbreaker. That youre no different from all the vile, ugly people who lie, and lie, and cheat and steal. You lied to me. You cheated on me. You stole everything that mattered to me. You stole me. I want it back, but I know that thats impossible. I guess Ill let you keep it. I know you feel no guilt, or shame for what youve done. It hurts me to know that. I always believed you were a good person, and I loved that about you. But clearly youre not, and I was wrong. I hope you feel proud of yourself, for being able to ruin a life and crush someone. Do you feel empowered again? You disgust me."

I had no idea where I wanted to be, but I couldn't be at home all day. I was receiving an unemployment benefit from the government for which I was required to apply for 5 jobs a week. I was applying for 10+ jobs a week. I barely got an acknowledgment of application e-mail, let alone a call-back. I have a vulnerability to depression, and this process was ripping my heart apart. I became severely depressed and I felt like I was diminishing into nothing. To keep being paid by the government, I was required to go to an ""employment agency"" on a regular basis. I stupidly went along with some optimism. You were there. You were young, tall and with hair slippery with gel. You made me wait for 20+ minutes and then you ushered me into your office. You had certificates all over your wall. Seemed impressive until I looked closer and realised they were given to you for menial things like ""completing fire safety training."" You also had one for ""mental health sensitivity training"". You didn't look me in the eyes once, not one time. You typed on your keyboard, you asked me standard questions and gave me dismissive grunts for answers. I avoided appointments with you, and I was penalised for this. I had to see you one last time before starting my next degree, and my new career in social work. Before coming into the office, I could see you coming back from lunch and I wished death upon you. You with your arrogant stride, your coffee shop coffee. We went through the routine one last time, you typing meaningless crap as though I was not even in the room. I considered making a complaint about you, but I figured you were the standard welfare officer. The non-profit organisation you worked for merely filled its pocket with cash from a government contract in return for pretending to give a fuck. I thought maybe you were a prick because you were burnt out from a tough job with limited political will and resources. And then I worked a similar role, if not, a tougher one. And I realised you were just a prick. I may be tired, I may feel demoralised at times, I may feel powerless and I still look my clients in the eyes. Fuck you, you piece of shit. You don't deserve your pay cheque, and you sure as hell don't deserve your authority. You're everything I aim not to be. "

811,cybersecurity,UnsentLetters,The Reimagined Obituary of Scarlette McKenna,1,fbw5mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/fbw5mc/the_reimagined_obituary_of_scarlette_mckenna/,2020-03-02 03:11:40,"Yesterday, I wrote an [Obit for myself.](URL Today, I reimagined it based on the life I want to have. &amp;#x200B; Dr. McKenna died on Thursday, March 1, 2074 at the ripe old age of 98. Throughout the course of her life she made tremendous effort to return anger with kindness, hate with love, and prejudice with inclusion and acceptance. She never met a stranger. Scarlet was a naturally curious individual who was known for her sense wonder which lead her to constantly redefine who she was; she considered herself a lifelong learner. She jokes that she only pursued a bachelors degree in English literature to stick it to all the teachers, psychologists, and individuals that told her she would never be a writer due to her Dyslexia. In her college years Dr. McKenna helped secure funding for the scientific research that lead to the development of targeted gene therapy. She founded and ran a local Theater Company with a small group of friends. She worked on groundbreaking research that lead to the development of online video streaming technology, municipal WIFI, and multi-touch attribution. Later, she went on to earn Master's degrees in Decision &amp; Information Analytics and Data Science, a PhD in Organizational Behavior, and professional certificate in Cyber &amp; Network Security. Over her extensive career she worked in Finance, Engineering, Media, Publishing, Advertising, Public Relations, CPG, Technology, Journalism, Education, and Cybersecurity. Dr. McKenna liked to think that she inherited her cunning from her bank robbing relatives that notoriously escaped from Alcatraz Prison in 1962. Scarlette loved her family, dogs, friends, and acquaintances. She enjoyed math, art, music, laugher, reading, and writing. She was not a fan of surprises and often said, I dont like surprises. Dont put nuts in brownies or fruit in my cookies. She played guitar, piano, violin, and the steering-wheel drum set. Quilting was passion; she was known to make quilts for friends, veterans, the homeless, the disabled, and the sick. The thought of making something that brought warmth and comfort to others made her happy. The first half or her life was difficult; she saw the world and the people in it much differently most. As a result, she always felt that she never truly fit in. She clung to the belief that the one thing that binds us together as humans is the human condition - we all love, hope, dream, succeed, fail, hurt, cry, and suffer - this is what makes us ALIVE and ALIKE. This fueled her lifelong advocacy for equal rights; passionately fighting to secure protections for women, minorities, individuals with disabilities, those that are neurodivergent, and the LBGT+ community. Dr. McKenna publicly attributed her much of her success to her husband, whom she met during her midlife. When speaking of him, she often referred to him as the catalyst that set her world ablaze and encouraged her to make her life spectacular. He has the patience of a saint, but he has always pushed me to empower myself. He loves to tease and torment me with his endless stories. That man has a heart of gold, the mind of a genius, the laugh of the devil, and my undying love. There is no one else I would choose to travel beside me on this the wicked, wonderful, and winding road of life."
812,cybersecurity,UnsentLetters,The Puzzling Madness,7,bg9o3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/bg9o3j/the_puzzling_madness/,2019-04-23 10:30:19,"I don't know what this is all about at the end of the day, I really don't. I have vague premonitions of meaning, but they are just that - incredibly vague, unable to take shape in any definable way. A series of events, or perhaps not events. Perhaps it's just all my choices, or maybe this whole thing - addiction, mental health, the consequences - is a determinist trap for people who are made up like me. The content here at times amuses me, and other times it seriously concerns me. Most of the time I browse this out of reflex, the result of not having the guts to say the things I want to say, or not even knowing what those words might be. It's a little silly romantic time waster. And waste time I have! Dammit, in the absence of getting laid, all I wanted today was to rub one out without the sensation of being watched. But here's where I have to stop myself. I am no expert, no psychologist or neurologist. I've done a lot of drugs, not as many as a lot of people have, and certainly I was never able to make doing drugs look cool. So I know when I can't be trusted; for the most part, at least, I understand that this is paranoia. But when I'm in the actual state, and when the mind moves with scant regard for your effort to keep up with it, I can't help but notice the connections that are practically lit up for me. Some of them - you know, of course you know - are just elaborate red herrings, others perhaps strange coincidences. Or maybe my whole family, and all those friends I abandoned, in addition to ex-girlfriends (that I hope, understand that I was young, immature, unprepared and insecure, but who I'm sure really don't want anything to do with me), *maybe* all those people have gotten together at the behest of some bizarre Slovenian psychiatrist and his theories of elaborate confrontations to tear down the walls of the psyche, and are trying to save me from myself. *Come on.* What am I supposed to believe? More importantly what the fuck am i supposed to do? Christ, I'm so poorly equipped for anything like this. What I mean is, I'm too goddamn lazy to figure out cybersecurity of whatever fucking jargon they're using for that stuff today. And I'm too fucking high on meth to really think; all I have to guide me are fragmented compulsive behaviors that make my little rabbit brain go around and around. So you know what? I don't want to know, because at this point I'm scared. I'm scared that there is something going on here that I don't want to be involved in. Or I'm afraid that I'm loosing my mind. The good thing is, that's easy to solve. I only start going crazy once I'm on the drugs, right? No? It turns out that I am insanely selfish, arrogant, falsely humble. That's apart from the other ones that have stuck to me, with accuracy, of course - liar and thief and degenerate and more. They're right, of course, they're all right, but I know that I am also more. Unfortunately in my present iteration I am some combination of incapable or unwilling to be better. I don't know. Goddammit. You know what I was going to do, before I got all freaked the fuck out by my own shadow? Of course you do, if there is a you. Or you might be my probation officer, through some unforeseen consequence of my checking into this hotel (technically this isn't a change of address, is it? Although let's not get into the particulars of what could be alleged against me or not.), and that has me worried about having a working girl come by. ""But look!"" I implore myself. ""Look at what you are writing! This is all so absurd, more than that, it is all so pathetic and you - me, I! - are, fuck, am probably losing years off my life by just sitting here paralyzed. My heart beats to a rhythm that no normal heart should sustain, and meanwhile dopamine has so hijacked my personal neurology that I'm lost. That's the end, that's the big takeaway. I'm lost. Not permanently; I still have a foot on the path, if I make the right choice. I don't know what that will look like. Is it begging for help, manipulating the people I love and who love me again? *Again?!* No. It's simple, or it should be. Honesty. That's it. Honesty. I don't know. I don't know who you are, what you want, what you believe, what your interest in me is, or if there even is a you. Maybe there's just one you, or maybe there's some sinister (or well-meaning, how should I know?) organization of you. Shit, maybe all this time, I've been the subject of some insane experiment, or new and ethically questionable form of entertainment. More likely once again, I will come back down (""But can he live with the shame?"" you ask. To which I say, ""Of fucking course! Now I have to make a point to do it, at least then I'd have something in common with that stupid fucking cult of cool I more or less traded my potential in for, and it was an awful deal for me, of course. What's that? Oh yeah, fuck you!) I should get a lady of the night. That's what men have done, right, throughout history when they are intoxicated by substances of a dubious repute, and lonely and afraid and uncertain? The oldest profession, right? Of course, my delusions, present as they still are, will keep me cautious. Can't arrest a guy for for the other thing though, eh? Though you probably should be able to in my case, Jesus Christ eh. So maybe this changes the status quo. Or more likely I will just look at this i an hour and delete it because it shows how poor of a decision maker I am, how much of a creature dependent on foul chemicals I am, how little of a man I have let myself become. Can't say I've given up though. Not in the sense that I'm going to give up life, or trying to stop for my own good and the good of those who love me - even if it's not quite as much as they used to. Yippie Kay Yay."
